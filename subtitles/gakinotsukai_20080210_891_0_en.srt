1
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,407
I used to eat sweets last time

2
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:17,417
It was pretty harsh.

3
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:28,357
This time it's starting with aro and let's eat it as a side dish

4
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:32,999
Matsumoto, look at the end

5
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:39,376
Yes, the image of this project is an image of children playing

6
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,655
Only he is pushing his character

7
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:44,054
There is no good day like this

8
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:53,398
Fujiwara, the gluttonous comedian

9
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:58,118
Endo is 8kg under the stress of divorce.

10
00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,557
This time, the subtitles like beggars start :)

11
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:09,459
Gogo!

12
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:19,789
Rule- 7 people eat a single meal with a side dish that starts with a child picked from the drawing

13
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,654
7 men's fight against Han-Bob begins

14
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:29,385
First, what side dish will start with Tanaka A?

15
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:33,180
Didn't you eat lunch today?

16
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,215
-Didn't you even get the Matsumoto Prize? -I only have a side dish

17
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:36,986
What is the first one?

18
00:01:36,986 --> 00:01:38,066
Tempura crumbs

19
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:40,385
It's nice to fry

20
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:44,652
It's fried!

21
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:46,795
By the way, you can add tea.

22
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:47,912
Rule- How to eat is free even if you eat it with Ochazuke.

23
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:49,920
Oh really?

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,216
-Eat as it is.-Yes, if you eat it with Ochazuke...

25
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:59,912
Eat fast

26
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:06,412
It's quite long when Tanaka does it

27
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:10,561
Supplementary Rules-No side dishes left

28
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:14,318
It has no taste

29
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:16,510
I can eat one bowl

30
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,745
It has no taste

31
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:21,269
Just eat

32
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:26,409
Eat it fast

33
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:31,012
Ochazukero to eat some tempura fritters without taste

34
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:35,498
It's easy to eat

35
00:02:35,498 --> 00:02:38,593
You eat pretty lightly

36
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:45,310
But I put it in a normal way

37
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,807
1 bowl

38
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:57,245
What is the side dish that starts with Hamada?

39
00:02:57,246 --> 00:03:01,286
what?

40
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:07,741
Too much

41
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:15,846
Andean melon! (One of the house-grown melons developed in Japan)

42
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:23,263
What should I do

43
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:24,986
in a bad mood!

44
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:36,175
It might be like cucumber

45
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:43,015
Bad mood

46
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:47,769
The third is what is the license Inomoto side dish

47
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,097
Now, what

48
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,417
what is this

49
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,336
Anchovy (Anchovy fish on the coast of Europe)

50
00:03:55,336 --> 00:04:02,559
This is a perfect match

51
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:04,007
I can eat this

52
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:08,591
You shouldn't eat 3 or 4

53
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:11,957
We're 36 now

54
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:19,526
It's Hamada 51.

55
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:24,117
Taking advantage of youthfulness, Inomoto aims to complete the rice

56
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:28,694
Isn't it possible to continue eating 1 bowl?

57
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:34,698
Can't you just go ahead and eat 1 bowl?

58
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:40,497
I'm still a burden today

59
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:46,498
Endo continues to lose weight due to the stress of divorce.

60
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:48,707
Whoa this

61
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:49,735
Almonds

62
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:56,783
-How many did you hear? -Five overviews

63
00:04:56,783 --> 00:05:02,572
All right!

64
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:05,432
Wow, this is another stress

65
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:09,295
-Is it different from divorce? -It's different.

66
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:15,202
I can't see each other

67
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:16,883
Is not it? Not as hard as everyone thinks

68
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:22,995
Did you eat with yesterday?

69
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:26,399
Indeed

70
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,250
What are you talking about?

71
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,526
You don't have to say

72
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:34,237
It's not as hard as Sagan thinks.

73
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:38,807
You don't have to say that! Hama-chan!

74
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:43,637
The appetite has started to rise right now.

75
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:49,237
What about the Yamazaki side dish?

76
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:50,966
reel!

77
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:56,663
-clam! -It's pants.

78
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:58,102
Is there something like this because it's a clam?

79
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:07,502
After all it's a burden

80
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:16,413
Let's leave

81
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:19,622
delicious

82
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:20,431
I can eat this

83
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,343
How many bowls did you eat with this?

84
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:27,641
Are you saying this (shell) 1 bowl?

85
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:33,401
Eat more

86
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:35,634
I've seen this

87
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:38,722
1 bowl

88
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:46,726
Will there continue to be delicious side dishes starting with Matsumoto A?

89
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:47,654
what is this

90
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:53,770
Later, Matsumoto's surprise side dish appeared!!

91
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:54,937
what is this?

92
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:58,165
It's red miso! (Made with barley yeast)

93
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:12,068
It suits you

94
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,979
This guy is real

95
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,828
I'm only focusing on bullying.

96
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:21,186
That's why everyone gathered.

97
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:26,400
Still, this one goes well

98
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,245
Isn't it nice to mix all this?

99
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:33,887
Wow this is hell with this

100
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,697
You must not eat too much

101
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:40,350
Matsumoto doesn't end with a bowl of miso

102
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:51,378
The second is rice with capsules and miso chazuke

103
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:58,728
I tried hard because I didn't want to use this cap

104
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,056
And Fujiwara with the expected glutton

105
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,096
What's the side dish

106
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:07,351
Oh what is this meat

107
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:10,407
-fat? -Bad mood

108
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:17,329
This is a winner

109
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,875
It smells really good

110
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:23,514
Ah, I can eat it with the smell first

111
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:27,146
Today's Versus Awards is something different.

112
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:34,254
indeed!

113
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:41,166
Whoa-chan is really?

114
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,602
Surely Fujiwara 4 bowls

115
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,949
He showed that the top of the bowl was different with 4 bowls.

116
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,695
I'm coming in

117
00:08:51,695 --> 00:09:00,372
Second, Tanaka picked the thick salt

118
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:06,028
This is the same as miso

119
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:10,635
I'm not putting it at all

120
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:13,068
It's the same as Yamachan

121
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:18,860
The next side dish of the second Hamada?

122
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,245
It's the worst!

123
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:25,181
Since then, Hamada has a face change!!

124
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:28,199
It's the worst!

125
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:35,312
Almond caramel

126
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:43,375
It's hard even with 3 caramels

127
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:48,788
what is this

128
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:56,891
-Meron and caramel. -Andes Melon!

129
00:09:56,892 --> 00:10:04,239
I feel bad just by putting it in here

130
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:06,615
It's only sweet

131
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,086
right

132
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:16,806
-It's just that. Melon and caramel.-Andes melon!

133
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:17,996
come

134
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:26,732
It's dangerous to enter this mode

135
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:39,853
This will be hard

136
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:41,980
Where are you looking?

137
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:51,827
The red bean bread that seems to go wrong with rice

138
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:56,521
Because the red beans are juicy

139
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:04,260
No bread

140
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,890
Rendezvous Rendezvous

141
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:16,802
What is the side dish that begins with the endo pick?

142
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:24,202
Grandma came out five times.

143
00:11:24,202 --> 00:11:26,755
Came out!

144
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:29,187
Wait a minute!

145
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:35,546
Number 5 is Gamju!

146
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:38,962
You can eat this in the sense of Ochazuke

147
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:41,596
Crisp

148
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:45,836
I'll do it

149
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:49,934
Whoa

150
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:52,911
This will be hard

151
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,730
Think different

152
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,195
What do you think

153
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:57,394
I think it's honeymoon.

154
00:11:57,394 --> 00:12:12,043
When you think about the honeymoon... but the results are bad.

155
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:18,281
1 bowl

156
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,480
What is Yamazaki's side dish? Yamazaki, work hard.

157
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,034
I'm working hard

158
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:24,793
You don't work hard at all

159
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:26,032
How did it go?

160
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:28,296
Listen to this for a second

161
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:32,568
what is this!

162
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:35,033
-Wait a minute! -It's very heavy

163
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:38,050
In the shell

164
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:43,980
Are you eating this?

165
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,557
what is this

166
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:55,403
Plus tight

167
00:12:55,403 --> 00:13:00,282
What's in the spark

168
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:02,329
What meeting did you have

169
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:10,319
Wow

170
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,633
Are you into a sweets right now?

171
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:19,625
Really

172
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,272
I have a lot of sins...

173
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:24,872
What did you say

174
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:25,976
Who made this?

175
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:28,840
Fall into hell

176
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:39,665
If you do something like this

177
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:43,153
Feverish

178
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:47,048
Hell

179
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:50,091
10 minutes later

180
00:13:50,091 --> 00:14:03,138
Eat fast

181
00:14:03,138 --> 00:14:05,451
Please forgive

182
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:13,868
Dad and Mom forgave!

183
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:19,872
Oh I ate it

184
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:31,405
Yama-chan, eat all the stuff on the rice

185
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:41,698
What side dish did you choose next?

186
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,385
Sorry please look at this

187
00:14:43,385 --> 00:14:45,881
-what? -Evil this

188
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:48,258
This is completely oil

189
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:51,466
Wow this

190
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:57,370
This is no good!

191
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,562
Are you stupid!

192
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:06,436
Do you eat with these things!!

193
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:12,475
TV humans have their heads turned!

194
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:16,667
Woo Wak has become quite small

195
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:21,219
There is a problem there too

196
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:24,484
Because this is not direct

197
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:28,718
Ugh this is hard

198
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:30,692
How about scaffolding

199
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:32,850
Does it have a taste?

200
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,678
Does the taste change?

201
00:15:34,678 --> 00:15:36,567
The taste of oil

202
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,911
Tasteless and odorless

203
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,622
Here is also a sin

204
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:43,182
This is malicious

205
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:53,167
Do you mean this? I put it in here and covered it with something

206
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:57,455
I can't even think about this

207
00:15:57,455 --> 00:16:01,759
What education did you have

208
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,485
Pour the tea to make the oil a little smaller

209
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:12,373
It doesn't melt at all

210
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:16,920
Can I eat oil?

211
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:23,665
-Sure-Really?

212
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:30,241
Oh! I ate it!

213
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,256
okay! Awesome

214
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:39,304
Apple Pie is the second thing Fujian Fujiwara picked

215
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:40,299
indeed

216
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:50,528
The movement of the chopsticks is slower than the first one that finished 4 bowls of rice as a side dish.

217
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:52,730
Belly full

218
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:58,180
-Eh? -said

219
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:02,532
You're angry

220
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:08,114
In the third, Tanaka finished a bowl of rice with dried squid anyway.

221
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:14,315
What's the next side dish of Hamada who continued to eat only sweet food?

222
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:18,125
what is this

223
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:23,067
Acerola

224
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,159
Really, pretty

225
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:30,760
I wish you

226
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,567
No matter what you eat

227
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,648
Whatever

228
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:38,893
What is this without being sweet

229
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:40,871
No acidity?

230
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:42,455
But it will never be bad for you.

231
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:44,293
Yes

232
00:17:44,294 --> 00:18:09,647
I ate something bad for my body

233
00:18:09,646 --> 00:18:23,866
No

234
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:28,450
It's a scream I've never heard of

235
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,651
Never before

236
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:45,292
It's a southern bird.

237
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:51,587
Idiot

238
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:55,957
1 bowl

239
00:18:55,958 --> 00:19:02,525
Inomoto completes one bowl with anzubo (apricot)

240
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:07,184
Endo's side dish: Annin Tofu

241
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:19,966
While watching TV on the top in a formal house

242
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:23,936
Indeed, I want to do that too

243
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:27,447
Wow looks delicious

244
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:30,742
Should I buy Annin Tofu and go home?

245
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:39,663
lie

246
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:43,166
1 bowl

247
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:51,128
Yamazaki, who is addicted to Japanese sweets these days, is made of anamato (sweets boiled with soybeans, soaked in sugar)

248
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:54,022
Oh it's so good

249
00:19:54,022 --> 00:19:55,446
really

250
00:19:55,446 --> 00:20:00,845
This has no comment

251
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:05,134
Afterwards, can I have one meal of rice?!

252
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:09,871
What Matsumoto chose was an ankake that goes with rice

253
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:12,564
(It looks good) But this guy was using Ochazuke

254
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:19,337
Should I eat this Ochazuke again?

255
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:22,582
Look, the upper part of the Ochazuke.

256
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:27,870
It's like the last bath in a large family.

257
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:34,453
About the fifth

258
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:44,819
Former Ochazuke judges it to be unreasonable and pours water

259
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,226
This is delicious

260
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:52,582
It looks delicious

261
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:59,549
There is some oil in the ankake

262
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:06,513
You have to drink 4 of these

263
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:16,108
Do it in an endo way

264
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:21,419
Don't let chopsticks go

265
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:27,060
I'm going to eat some

266
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:31,915
Exciting rice 1 eating plan

267
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:36,076
The last Fujiwara that will shine the last

268
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:43,621
Which side dish starts with ah?

269
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:49,750
No. 22 is green juice.

270
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:56,722
If this is unsuccessful, it's a penalty with Matsumoto.

271
00:21:56,722 --> 00:21:58,779
We ate

272
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:05,788
If you don't do it quickly, the mission will fail.

273
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:11,156
Really hard everyone

274
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:15,543
Matsumoto complete

275
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:19,242
Isn't it the same if I eat green juice?

276
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,513
No, this is the end

277
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:23,803
Why? It says 4.5.6 (th).

278
00:22:23,804 --> 00:22:27,983
No, no, you're alone.

279
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:29,868
There is no side dish

280
00:22:29,868 --> 00:22:34,174
Then I can tell you.

281
00:22:34,174 --> 00:22:39,294
KY (You can't understand the atmosphere)

282
00:22:39,295 --> 00:22:40,902
Roger Fujiwara

283
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:44,097
Another side dish

284
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:56,588
First of all

285
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:57,828
What are you doing

286
00:22:57,828 --> 00:22:59,557
number 3

287
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:09,178
Grandmother~3

288
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:15,386
It's Akama Mushi.

289
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:19,874
It's impossible

290
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:21,746
Why?

291
00:23:21,746 --> 00:23:32,140
My stomach is full

292
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,546
Penalty decision!!

293
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:41,286
What are you going to eat?

294
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:46,115
Came out for a long time

295
00:23:46,115 --> 00:23:48,586
Even if you are an adult,
