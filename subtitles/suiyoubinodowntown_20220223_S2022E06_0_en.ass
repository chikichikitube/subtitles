Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.77,0:01:35.18,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,The theory I've brought is this:

Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.89,0:01:42.05,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,I see
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.05,0:01:44.35,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,After listening to what you just heard
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.35,0:01:46.45,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,"Heh?" wasn't all that common a reaction
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.45,0:01:48.88,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Some said stuff like "Seriously?" \N-Indeed
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.88,0:01:49.91,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,So it's like this

Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.50,0:01:58.53,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Heh?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.53,0:02:01.87,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,So, is it true what you said about the ghost?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.87,0:02:03.75,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Regarding that...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.75,0:02:04.36,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,It's a lie

Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.45,0:02:17.08,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,As far as i'm concerned,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.08,0:02:20.29,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,I like to share this type of rumor
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.29,0:02:21.72,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,When people hear stuff like this
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.72,0:02:23.35,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,I always get this "heh?" reaction
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.35,0:02:27.88,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,But, as it turns out, actual rumors can't be broadcast on TV
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.88,0:02:30.49,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,So all the information we used this time is just patently false
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.49,0:02:31.70,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,I see  \N-Fictitious
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.70,0:02:34.64,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,So, how many "heh"s can we get from them?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.64,0:02:36.38,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Let's find out
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.99,0:02:58.46,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,It is actually difficult to get a person to say "heh?"
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.11,0:03:02.40,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,And so, the instigator is...

Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.15,0:03:23.45,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,Let's say it is
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.70,0:03:25.68,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,This time, to complete the verification Hyouroku and Morita are gathered
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.68,0:03:27.76,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,In the lounge of a fake show in which the former and the latter are starring together
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.76,0:03:30.50,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,How many "heh?"s can be elicited?

Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.57,0:03:42.03,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,The time limit is 30 minutes
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.16,0:03:42.39,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,He'll probably say "heh?"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.30,0:03:44.95,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,Seems likely
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.94,0:03:46.60,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,Hyouroku wore a very bright jacket
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.60,0:03:49.55,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,But TBS is really...
