1
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,884
THIS PROGRAM IS THE RECORD
OF A "BATTLE" AMONGST COMEDIANS.

2
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,854
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE QUALITY,
IT IS MOSTLY UNEDITED.

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,556
AS SUCH, VIEWERS MAY ENCOUNTER
EXPLICIT CONTENT.

4
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:30,931
They might have a strong desire
to win 10 million yen.

5
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:36,303
Or maybe they just don't want
to lose their one million yen.

6
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:40,474
I'm sure each participant
has his own motivation.

7
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:44,512
For someone like Toro Salmon's Kubota,

8
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,182
one million yen must have been
a lot of money to prepare.

9
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,752
For well-known comedians like Fujimoto,

10
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:56,290
he's probably not as concerned about money
as he once was.

11
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,093
I think that will be a big factor.

12
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:14,468
-You don't need 10 million yen, Fujimoto.
-Yes, I do!

13
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,737
-Don't lie.
-That has nothing to do with this.

14
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,038
You already have enough.

15
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,307
You can never have enough money.

16
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,277
And this is no small change.
It's 10 million yen.

17
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,479
-It's a lot.
-It's too much.

18
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,882
Are you getting philosophical?
I'm off to the bathroom.

19
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,183
It's 10 million.

20
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,118
Ten million is a lot.

21
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,620
This may be the difference.

22
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,822
And I have a family.

23
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,925
-You do.
-But your wife earns a lot of money too.

24
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,460
-You say so yourself.
-But--

25
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:40,861
"My wife earns big."

26
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,229
A man has his pride.

27
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,432
You're always talking about
how shockingly large her salary is.

28
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,468
When you compare it to Yoshimoto's rate.

29
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,174
Right? Only compared to Yoshimoto.

30
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,552
You can never have enough money.

31
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,021
Who knows what will happen in the future?

32
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,157
Name a comedian
who's still popular in his fifties.

33
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:11,825
Are there any?

34
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,727
In their fifties, or sixties...

35
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,095
There aren't many.

36
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,631
How about the guy who always says,
"How tasty"?

37
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,970
-Is Ishizuka that old?
-Around 50, I think.

38
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,141
But I heard that when he does
those gourmet reports,

39
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,512
he leaves a lot of food.

40
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,914
-Why say that?
-He only takes two bites.

41
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,249
He laughed!

42
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,450
Right?

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,356
That was... All I did was cough.

44
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,392
Should we review the video?

45
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,828
All I did was cough.

46
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,030
You have to give me a break on that one.

47
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:55,269
-The chef said he hardly touched the meal.
-Don't be so disrespectful to Ishizuka.

48
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,370
But he said--

49
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,172
Fujimoto. Orange.

50
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,707
You have no more chances.

51
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,642
We all heard the "Hmph!"

52
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,110
You laughed from your belly.

53
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,147
Anthony has a yellow card.

54
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:09,783
-And these two still have no cards.
-None.

55
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,519
-I let my guard down.
-You did.

56
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,754
Let's focus!

57
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,089
That gets a card?

58
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,495
Kawahara, do you ever laugh?

59
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,632
I've never seen you smile.

60
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,400
-Neither have I.
-Never.

61
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,103
-Don't you ever laugh?
-Of course I do.

62
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,572
What made you laugh the hardest?

63
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,808
The thing made me laugh the hardest was

64
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,211
the TV show Gaki no Tsukai.

65
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:42,650
That's a funny show.

66
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,818
-Yes.
-Of course it's funny.

67
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,120
That's about it.

68
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:50,824
To make others laugh,
without laughing yourself...

69
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,460
I've never used my brain like that before.

70
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:57,231
Of course, I want to make them laugh,

71
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,868
so I'll seize every opportunity.

72
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,336
How do you laugh?

73
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:03,937
Show me your smile.

74
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,339
But then I'd lose.

75
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,412
You'd still be in the game
even if you got a yellow card.

76
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,085
Just once, then.

77
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,787
-You will?
-Are you sure?

78
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,555
I won't get a red card, right?

79
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,957
-No.
-Yellow first, right?

80
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,092
Really?

81
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,827
If you say so.

82
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,997
-Well, that's quite manly of you.
-Wow.

83
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,032
-He's a real man.
-Sure is.

84
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,735
Use this to hide your face,
then flash it at us.

85
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:38,305
-Ready?
-Wait! He'll just make a funny face.

86
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,307
He'll make us laugh.

87
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,476
Well, it's a game of funny faces.

88
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,445
Wait. You guys watch, too.

89
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,180
-Of course.
-We're watching.

90
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:47,748
Ready?

91
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,098
Which of them was it?

92
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:07,668
-Who was it?
-Not me! It has to be him!

93
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,105
Don't laugh out loud!

94
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,708
He laughed right before the siren.

95
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,444
No, I didn't. I laughed after the siren.

96
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,650
Yellow card.

97
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,922
-Fujimoto laughed after the siren.
-See?

98
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,291
-That was close.
-You were on the edge.

99
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,393
Everyone could've laughed just now.

100
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,229
There was the possibility.

101
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,064
That's what I was aiming for.

102
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,133
That was so close.

103
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,835
I thought he wouldn't make a face at all.

104
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,403
I thought so, too.

105
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,773
But he gave us a full on laugh.

106
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,508
It was so unlike him.

107
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,214
You're scary.

108
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,788
That was scary.

109
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,190
I'm hungry.

110
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,626
-They have ramen.
-I want some, too.

111
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,828
-You want ramen?
-Yeah!

112
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,530
That's just what I wanted.

113
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,966
Just what you wanted?

114
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,635
"Just what I wanted."

115
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,236
You laughed.

116
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,307
Didn't he laugh?

117
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,478
-He laughed as he did an impression.
-Right?

118
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,447
All I said is that it was
"Just what I wanted."

119
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,982
Who's that supposed to be?

120
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,318
Can I boil some sausages?

121
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,720
-Will you cook something?
-I'll just boil them.

122
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,056
-Cook us something.
-Something proper.

123
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,225
-You're not eating, Kawahara?
-No.

124
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,027
-Why not?
-I'm not hungry.

125
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,796
-He's full because he had wine.
-That's right.

126
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,398
I had a bit of wine.

127
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,233
There's still some left.

128
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:50,804
This is good!

129
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,040
-That must be good.
-It's good.

130
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,308
I bet it is.

131
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,313
Delicious.

132
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,815
You don't need to stare at me.

133
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,417
But it's really good.

134
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,753
You say everything is good.

135
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,222
No, I don't.

136
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:11,425
When we did that sausage gig together,
you said they were so good,

137
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,893
you ate about 20 of them.

138
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,797
We did a sausage gig.

139
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,966
-Twenty sausages?
-Yes, 20 sausages.

140
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,601
That many?

141
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,703
Can you stop saying "sausage gig"?

142
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,404
But it was a sausage gig.

143
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:28,775
-I've never heard of a "sausage gig."
-It was a gig for a sausage company.

144
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:30,544
That was good.

145
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,880
-Well...
-Delicious.

146
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,218
Kubota, doesn't this remind you
of when we were neighbors?

147
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,853
In Kita-ikebukuro.

148
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,589
It's a town most people don't know.

149
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:43,724
People know it!

150
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,363
Why are my noodles still uncooked?

151
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,099
Just leave it for a while longer.

152
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,168
-It's been over three minutes.
-You don't say?

153
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,170
What kind of response is that?

154
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,874
-You're going to fry them?
-It's tastier.

155
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,776
-Better than boiling, right?
-I want one.

156
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,311
Right... What?

157
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,513
-You said you weren't hungry.
-You did.

158
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,548
If it's sausages, I want one, too.

159
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:11,818
Damn.

160
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:13,954
He's trying to pick a fight.

161
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,622
No, I'm not.

162
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,659
You said you wouldn't eat.

163
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:22,829
That looks so good.

164
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,535
My noodles are still uncooked.

165
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,237
What is this?

166
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,673
This is so annoying.

167
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,975
They're so stiff.

168
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,011
They're stiff.

169
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,379
Why?

170
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,914
It's been five minutes!

171
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,417
Are the noodles too thick?

172
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,585
Wasn't the water boiled?

173
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,522
But it tastes great!

174
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,391
They're stiff but great!

175
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,730
-The aftertaste is awful!
-Shut up!

176
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,865
I don't know how to cut these.

177
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,168
These look good. Look.

178
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,870
-These must be delicious.
-Whoa!

179
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,439
Must be good.

180
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,474
You found the chopsticks.

181
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,479
That looks good.

182
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,252
I didn't know instant noodles
could be this good.

183
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,354
Yum.

184
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,392
Wow.

185
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,495
-That one doesn't work.
-Yeah, it won't turn on.

186
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,531
It doesn't turn on. Use this one.

187
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,266
Whoa.

188
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,903
-You're gonna make pasta?
-Yes.

189
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,705
Why?

190
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:40,974
Yummy.

191
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,242
Want some?

192
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,812
Well, if it tastes good.

193
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,248
-Did you work in a restaurant?
-No.

194
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:49,983
What's your best pasta dish?

195
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,686
It's an original recipe.

196
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,993
-How old were you?
-I was in kindergarten.

197
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,328
I grew up fast.

198
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:09,703
Hm?

199
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,414
Who laughed?

200
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:23,517
Who was it?

201
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,121
No idea.

202
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:46,940
Anthony.

203
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,011
You smiled, right?

204
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,347
I thought I held it back.

205
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,918
He was eating and smiling
like a normal dinner.

206
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:02,823
How old were you?

207
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,524
I was in kindergarten.

208
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:05,826
I grew up fast.

209
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,068
You seemed to be having fun.

210
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,305
THE JUDGING IS STRICTER
NOW THAT HALF ARE GONE

211
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,773
Orange, right?

212
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:20,841
Okay.

213
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,143
-I'll be stricter from here on out.
-Okay.

214
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,213
Fujimoto and Anthony have orange cards.

215
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,848
He's on yellow.

216
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:28,982
Yes.

217
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,250
He's still clear.

218
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,119
-No cards yet?
-I'm done for.

219
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,754
-Does he really not have a card?
-It's true.

220
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,024
-You won't win if you're not aggressive.
-Okay!

221
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,165
Kubota hasn't smiled yet.

222
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,901
I think it would be nice
if everyone knew me better.

223
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,837
So, would you mind
looking at some of my old photos?

224
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,806
My plan?

225
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:57,277
I guess, above all,
my looks are my strength.

226
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,179
As you can see,

227
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:03,283
I'll probably be the only one
of a difference race.

228
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:07,387
So, I want to use that to my advantage.

229
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:12,392
-When were the photos taken?
-Back in my early schooldays.

230
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,494
My first day of grade school.

231
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,764
-Old photos of you?
-Yes, please take a look.

232
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,001
My graduation from grade school.

233
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,202
Oh, my.

234
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,073
This is my dad.

235
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,742
The American one.

236
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,014
-Fujimoto, please take a look.
-Who's this?

237
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,850
That is my American dad.

238
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,185
Victor.

239
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,486
Professor Victor?

240
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,088
He's Victor.

241
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,657
Look at Victor.

242
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,393
-Show him this one, too.
-Who's this?

243
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,628
-It's Victor--
-Wait.

244
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,097
Kawahara should take a look first.

245
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,303
How is it?

246
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:01,908
Here.

247
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,353
Who was it?

248
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,355
-Who was it?
-I didn't laugh.

249
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,457
I did not laugh.

250
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,064
Hold on.

251
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,337
Kawahara.

252
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,571
Kawahara?

253
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,373
You smiled, right?

254
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:38,078
You smiled just like you normally would
when looking at a graduation photo.

255
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,147
Kawahara should take a look first.

256
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,553
How is it?

257
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,758
You smiled.

258
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,493
I was close, too.

259
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,162
If I'd seen one more,
I would have been gone.

260
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,767
He asked you to look at his photos,
but Fujimoto went to smoke in the kitchen.

261
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,570
-I don't think that was right.
-I agree.

262
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,305
-You tried to escape.
-Sorry.

263
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,140
-You have to look properly.
-Right.

264
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,809
But these photos are too much.

265
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,611
-They're too much.
-Hold on.

266
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,747
Well, they were quite a trap.

267
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,615
Trap? Take a look at this!

268
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,420
I don't think it's nice to call someone's
childhood photo a trap, by the way.

269
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,760
-Show him the other photo.
-It's there.

270
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,296
-Show it again.
-I'm scared.

271
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,502
Please take a look.

272
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,237
I will, but...

273
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,772
Don't bring it to me.

274
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,273
Why are you like that?

275
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,442
Look at his father for him.

276
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,444
Don't make it sound like he's dead.

277
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,512
He is dead.

278
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:46,746
Sorry.

279
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,481
He died when I was two.

280
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,617
What is Victor's...

281
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,187
What's his full name?

282
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,589
I don't know. All I know is "Victor."

283
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,160
Sorry, I don't know.

284
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,595
Please, take a look.

285
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:05,165
You've had your eyes closed
the whole time.

286
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,900
What was his job?

287
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,134
Professional boxer.

288
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:15,141
-How many matches did he win?
-He was ranked fourth in the world.

289
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,512
He's damn strong.

290
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,752
How did he pass away?

291
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,387
Cut it out.

292
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,789
-But...
-Stop asking questions.

293
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,826
-I'm curious.
-You're just feeding my imagination.

294
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,996
Please. I won't ask anything else.

295
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,865
It was gout.

296
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,843
-Boxers shouldn't get gout.
-He got it after he quit boxing.

297
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,511
He ate a lot on the rebound.

298
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,413
You two, take a look.

299
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:54,914
Why do I have to go first?

300
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,051
-Didn't Kawahara see it?
-I did. That's why--

301
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,953
-No, you didn't.
-That's why I got a card.

302
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,721
-Don't lie.
-He got a card for it.

303
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,523
-I got a card for it.
-That's right.

304
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,093
-Let's decide who'll see it first.
-By playing rock-paper-scissors.

305
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,194
Okay.

306
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,163
Rock, paper, scissors.

307
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:12,399
No way.

308
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,905
He's so dark, you can't even see him.

309
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,673
He's dissolved into the background.

310
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:26,646
He laughed.

311
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,948
That was you, right?

312
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,083
It wasn't me.

313
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,151
It wasn't me!

314
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:32,952
That wasn't me!

315
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,387
I held it back.

316
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,156
-It was in your voice.
-It's not me!

317
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,658
-That was Fujimoto.
-No, it was Kubota.

318
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,427
No, I laughed after the red light.

319
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,368
-Kubota.
-Me?

320
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,003
-You laughed.
-You did.

321
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,638
-Your voice was...
-Exactly!

322
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,606
-It was trembling.
-You were trembling!

323
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,342
-You laughed.
-You trembled.

324
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,144
Your voice was trembling.

325
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,280
-It was me?
-That voice was funny.

326
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,182
I told you I'd be more strict.

327
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,217
But that battle was fierce.

328
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,920
I think you're all amazing
for not laughing at gout.

329
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,355
I definitely would've laughed.

330
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,224
I was biting my tongue.

331
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,929
There's only about one hour left,
so I'm going to be even more strict.

332
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,330
Let's go.

333
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,866
-Did Fujimoto see the photos?
-Not yet.

334
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,135
-Enough already.
-He hasn't seen two of them.

335
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,138
-I saw them.
-Two photos is a serious offense.

336
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,840
Kawahara has one to go, too.

337
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,775
I'll laugh even if it's not funny.

338
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,278
-Kawahara hasn't seen it.
-That's right. Don't lie now.

339
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,948
-I saw it.
-I want everyone to see.

340
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,449
-Did you really see it?
-Yes.

341
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,354
You're not looking at it.

342
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,559
You can't separate him
from the background.

343
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,063
You're laughing, Fujimoto.

344
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,868
He must have been healthy back then.

345
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,437
He's so sly. He's setting them up.

346
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,672
He was still a boxer in that photo, right?

347
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:03,376
No, he'd already retired by the time
I was born.

348
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,279
So he was still boxing, right?

349
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,848
No, he was retired by the time I was born.

350
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,717
Sorry for that.

351
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,820
You're so sneaky,
bringing those photos out at the end.

352
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,489
This is my family now.

353
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,259
Me, my younger brother...

354
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,160
Terumi and Masumi.

355
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,198
Did he have to wear a white shirt?

356
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,568
Enough with the photos!

357
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:32,205
I told you I'm not going to laugh
at your childhood photos.

358
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,507
This is me during a physical.

359
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,276
My nickname was "Rapist."

360
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,946
-Why such a nickname?
-I don't know. It was given to me.

361
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,215
It's because you look like a rapist.
You're scary.

362
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:45,485
Why are you first in line
when you're the biggest?

363
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:49,188
The biggest should be in the back.
How tall was the kid behind you?

364
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,892
Probably about 1.2 meters.
I was already 1.76 meters tall at age 10.

365
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,994
That's scary.
You should've played sports.

366
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,462
-I did.
-What sport?

367
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,530
Dodgebee.

368
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:59,599
What the hell is that? Not dodgeball?

369
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,901
It's dodgeball using a Frisbee.

370
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,103
Play a more popular sport!
You have the face for it.

371
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:07,640
What the hell is dodgebee?

372
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,610
-Dodgebee is a safe sport.
-How do you lose in dodgebee?

373
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,979
-When you get hit.
-When what hits you?

374
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,481
You use a Frisbee instead of a ball
in dodgebee.

375
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,285
Dodgebee is... A moth landed on my arm!

376
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,589
What the hell?
Is it a sign to stop talking?

377
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,958
Is it a sign to stop talking?

378
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:27,860
It stinks!

379
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,762
It came because you stink.

380
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,298
It looks like I have a tattoo.

381
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,368
-It's because you stink.
-Then it should be in my armpit.

382
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,203
It came because your armpit stinks.

383
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,372
If so, it wouldn't stop here.

384
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,307
Your whole life is like a moth.

385
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,042
Who are you calling a moth?

386
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,578
Are you talking to me, or the moth?

387
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,948
Which one?

388
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,351
Your armpit.

389
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:52,819
My armpit?

390
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,520
You're an armpit moth.

391
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,422
What is an armpit moth?

392
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:57,690
So I'm an insect?

393
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,258
You are like an insect.

394
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,828
Then spray me with pesticide.
I won't die. Probably.

395
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,329
Try spraying me.

396
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,434
What is this?

397
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:10,737
Wow.

398
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,572
Why is it still on me?

399
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,777
-Still there?
-It won't--

400
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:20,046
Damn it!

401
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:23,349
Now the moth's sitting on my pants.

402
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,119
You're overcooking the pasta.

403
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,186
Look!

404
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,389
It looks like a logo.

405
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:31,958
Looks fine to me.

406
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,227
There's less than an hour left.

407
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,396
-What should we do?
-Any ideas?

408
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,931
-We have to fight.
-Yeah, let's fight.

409
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,333
Don't you agree?

410
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,001
Yeah...

411
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,404
Yeah

412
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,139
Tears flow endlessly

413
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:47,807
Yeah, oh, yeah

414
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,842
Yeah, yeah. Tears flow endlessly

415
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,477
You're good at rapping, right?

416
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,946
He is. He's really good at rapping.

417
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:57,083
-Why don't you two do it together?
-But I can't rap.

418
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,351
You do it.

419
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:01,487
-You look like you can.
-I can't! That's just my looks.

420
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,557
Don't judge a book by its cover.
I can't rap!

421
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,659
-I can't rap.
-You try, Fujimoto.

422
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,861
-I can't rap.
-You haven't done anything!

423
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,331
-What's going on?
-You give orders, but do nothing yourself.

424
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,334
-So far, he hasn't done anything.
-Neither have you.

425
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,072
-Do something.
-I did that knife joke.

426
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,506
That's the only thing.

427
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,011
You haven't done the knife.

428
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,480
Does everyone have to do it?

429
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:30,483
You don't have to,
but you haven't done anything.

430
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:34,053
I can do it, but it won't be funny.

431
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,027
It's not funny at all.

432
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,498
Not funny at all.

433
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,303
-Because you're not wearing the uniform.
-That's not the problem.

434
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,804
This prop isn't funny.

435
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,506
This just doesn't work.

436
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,675
-You forgot about the pasta.
-It's yours!

437
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:56,976
Oh, yeah.

438
00:22:58,411 --> 00:22:59,979
I'm confused, too.

439
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,548
If you're going to eat, cook it properly.

440
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:04,717
Why did you boil it? Don't waste it.

441
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:05,885
This is such a waste.

442
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,521
How firm do you want the pasta?

443
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:10,556
But you've had it going for so long...

444
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:12,992
I'll check the firmness.

445
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,395
It's definitely too soft. Isn't that hot?

446
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,436
What are you doing?

447
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:35,214
Aren't there any ingredients?
You should add something to it.

448
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,649
You don't have to...

449
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,585
You don't have to eat it.

450
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,154
I'm checking the firmness!

451
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:45,825
You only need to try one.

452
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,161
Just one.

453
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:50,797
Hey.

454
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,498
He's gone crazy.

455
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,000
You're going crazy.

456
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,270
-Stop him, Anthony.
-Why me? I don't want to. He's crazy.

457
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,705
Don't say that. He's your senior.

458
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:03,075
Why do you make me do everything?

459
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,644
Because you're the youngest.

460
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,145
That doesn't matter.

461
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:09,348
Kawahara, stop it. What are you doing?
I can't watch this anymore.

462
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:10,983
Kawahara.

463
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:13,586
He's having a real feast.

464
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,087
Stop him.

465
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:16,455
Kawahara.

466
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:18,057
Kawahara.

467
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:19,992
Thirty minutes to go.

468
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:22,261
Not much time left.

469
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,034
What's up?

470
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:29,368
What's he doing?

471
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,284
That's promising.

472
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,086
Go for it.

473
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,391
Keep going.

474
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,414
Where's he going with this?

475
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:52,785
You hit me.

476
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:54,954
You actually hit me.

477
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:39,865
Wait a minute.

478
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:42,568
That was not fair.

479
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:43,769
What happened?

480
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,137
No way.

481
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,574
No way!

482
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,609
Fujimoto, red card.

483
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:53,946
You laughed.

484
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,988
-He got me.
-You stole his idea, then laughed at it.

485
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:03,990
You're out.

486
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,624
We don't have much time.

487
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:08,027
When you get punched that much,

488
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,996
you can't help but laugh.

489
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,365
I thought, "What the hell am I doing?"

490
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:15,568
So, Kawahara's plan succeeded.

491
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:21,407
I realized nobody had
any more cards to play.

492
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,443
We were all feeling each other out,

493
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,545
wondering who would do what.

494
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,647
How frustrating.

495
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,083
Will we get a winner?

496
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,690
It would be nice if we do.

497
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:39,925
Yeah...

498
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,961
It is an experiment.

499
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,301
-We're on.
-We are.

500
00:27:58,711 --> 00:27:59,712
Good work.

501
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:01,647
Nice, Kawahara.

502
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,452
It might be best to keep pushing that.

503
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,555
That may be the best strategy.

504
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,290
And where's Anthony?

505
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:34,513
The drum-drum man

506
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,917
The drum-drum man...

507
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:42,822
Go for it.

508
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,290
Go, go!

509
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,925
It's a fighting game.

510
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:49,862
A fighting game.

511
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,708
Anybody laugh?

512
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:03,976
Ouch!

513
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:06,946
Nobody's laughing? No laughs?

514
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,348
That one hurt.

515
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:13,886
Kubota's on the move. Okay!

516
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,488
Kubota's making a move.

517
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,190
There are still 16 minutes left.
That's enough time.

518
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:23,896
Okay.

519
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:25,598
He's filling it up with pasta.

520
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:28,734
He's putting the noodles in like a pro.

521
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:32,071
So, what's Kubota going to do?

522
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:34,773
What will he do now?

523
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:54,793
I admit defeat!

524
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,074
Keep at it.

525
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,862
Poop.

526
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:30,963
Poo...

527
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,232
Poo...

528
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,366
Poo...

529
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,534
Poo...

530
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,802
Poo...

531
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,138
Poo...

532
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,439
Poo...

533
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:46,345
I just broke all the toes
on my right foot.

534
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:51,550
I'm sleepy!

535
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,052
Why do your usual routine?

536
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,155
Who would do a normal set here?

537
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,626
What are you doing?

538
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,328
Could you tie this for me?

539
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,330
-Kawahara, tie it for him.
-Please.

540
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:11,670
That's too tight!

541
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,406
If I twist it, my dick will show.

542
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,278
Now I have two.

543
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,781
Oh, my. Which is the real one?

544
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,050
Which is the real one?

545
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,423
You? Oh, this is the real one.

546
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,327
I'm the real one.

547
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:09,495
-You are?
-Yes.

548
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,630
-I'm the real one.
-Which is it?

549
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,898
It's me.

550
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,533
-Which one?
-I'm the real one.

551
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,035
I'm the...

552
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,140
-I'm sleepy.
-I'm sleepy!

553
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,541
I'm sleepy.

554
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,879
Okay.

555
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,515
This is my last resort.

556
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:33,185
What is it?

557
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:36,021
-Sorry.
-What is it?

558
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:38,390
Forgive me.

559
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:42,194
This is going to be my final act.

560
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:44,997
Sorry.

561
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,498
Please forgive me.

562
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:48,767
Forgive me.

563
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,537
Mom and Dad, please forgive me.

564
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:52,538
Don't do it!

565
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,540
For 10 million yen,

566
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,141
I'm going to...

567
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,609
die.

568
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,353
If you have any questions, ask me now.

569
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,089
What? How... Will you die?

570
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,290
No!

571
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,858
I'm going to poop standing up!

572
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,561
Seriously?

573
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,031
-This is not good.
-Don't do it.

574
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:21,033
-No way!
-Poop is not the answer.

575
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,134
Poop is wrong.

576
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:23,268
It's not funny.

577
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,004
-Seriously?
-Poop is not funny.

578
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,074
I always laughed at poop.
That's why I became a comedian!

579
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,176
Don't poop. Do a gag.

580
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,012
A joke will do.

581
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,714
Okay, I'll write it with poop!

582
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,616
I'll write "Amazon" here with poop!

583
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,584
Not funny.

584
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,056
Damn, I'm only getting farts.

585
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:46,625
-Only farts.
-I won't laugh at poop!

586
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,394
But think about it.

587
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,363
You became a comedian to have fun
and get rich, right?

588
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,132
One poop can earn you 10 million yen!

589
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:54,600
But I won't laugh.

590
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,536
Poop is not going to make me laugh!

591
00:33:58,704 --> 00:33:59,838
No pooping!

592
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:01,907
Wear a mask!

593
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,675
I've had enough of masks!

594
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,911
They're better than poop!

595
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:09,982
Seven minutes left.

596
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:18,957
We just have to fight.

597
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,894
Let's do something. Shall we use props?

598
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,563
Prop jokes?

599
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:27,399
Should we do that?

600
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,106
Good morning, sir!

601
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:35,441
Who are you?

602
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:36,608
I'm Kakefu.

603
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,343
You grew.

604
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:39,912
You're bigger now.

605
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,413
Kakefu wears pants.

606
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:44,616
I'm Mr. Tigers, Masayuki Kakefu!

607
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,418
But your crotch is a Panther.

608
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:50,389
Huh?

609
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:54,593
Your top says you're a Tiger.
What do your pants say?

610
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:56,829
I'm a Panther.

611
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,631
No way.

612
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:03,936
This is not good.

613
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:05,270
Not good at all.

614
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,405
Go for it!

615
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,042
We have to find a winner.

616
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:11,777
We're out of props.

617
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:14,379
Should we all do something together?

618
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,482
-Let's give it a try.
-Yeah.

619
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:17,683
Otherwise...

620
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,585
No point thinking.

621
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:21,653
What should we do?

622
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,192
What if we all go home with nothing?

623
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,027
We have to do something.

624
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,535
Should we try an impression?

625
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:40,873
Let's all imitate the same person
and see who's best, okay?

626
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,142
Who should it be?

627
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,179
-Takuya Kimura?
-How about Croket?

628
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,948
-The king of impressions?
-I don't know about Croket.

629
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,484
Croket is the one who does
the impressions.

630
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,053
-I think Kimura's okay.
-Okay.

631
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,855
-Who goes first?
-Kawahara.

632
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,024
-Me first?
-Yes.

633
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,327
So, is this is a serious impression?

634
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:03,862
Of course.

635
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,331
"Wait up!"

636
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,167
"Hey."

637
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:11,537
"Wait up, Croket."

638
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:18,644
What kind of scene is that?
Is Kimura chasing Croket?

639
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,514
Anthony.

640
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,684
"Wait up!"

641
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,721
"Wait up!"

642
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,290
Why does he have an accent?

643
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,026
Why the accent?

644
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,427
Your turn, Kubota.

645
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,800
"Wait up!"

646
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,007
You act like you're the best,
but you're hopeless.

647
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,747
Six hours and still no winner.

648
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,251
Ten seconds...

649
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,554
Eight, seven, six...

650
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:05,390
five, four, three...

651
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,928
TIME UP
(SIX HOURS HAVE PASSED)

652
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,597
It's over...

653
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,932
This sure is difficult.

654
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,233
It's really hard.

655
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:27,446
Good job.

656
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:28,947
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

657
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,352
I think we've all had enough.

658
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,325
Should we talk in the other room?

659
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,461
-Okay.
-Okay.

660
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:49,468
The other room?
Oh, because we can't laugh in here.

661
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,703
Are we allowed to laugh now?

662
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,872
I guess it's fine now.

663
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,043
Whoa!

664
00:37:58,143 --> 00:37:59,745
-This is amazing!
-Incredible!

665
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:03,382
-What is this place?
-I've seen this at a casino.

666
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:05,217
What is this place?

667
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,185
Six hours, but no winner.

668
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:10,288
IF A SOLO WINNER IS NOT DETERMINED,
NO ONE GETS 10 MILLION YEN

669
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:12,491
I guess there's always next time.

670
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:16,128
-How frustrating.
-That was...

671
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:20,265
-There should be a way to win.
-What were we lacking?

672
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,869
It just shows how hard it is
to narrow it down to one.

673
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:28,874
The fact we couldn't narrow it down
is part of the documentary, too.

674
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,143
If it was me, at that stage,

675
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:32,310
I would've pooped.

676
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:35,080
I punched my guts so many times,
but nothing came out.

677
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:39,718
I tried, but all I could do was fart.
And even then, they were silent.

678
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,587
But if you had pooped,
you would've got a red card.

679
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:56,101
If only they'd given us one more minute,
I would've won.

680
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:04,342
Thank you.

681
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:07,379
Thank you.

682
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:08,780
Is this the way?

683
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,185
I really should have pooped.

684
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:15,854
But it didn't come out.

685
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:20,392
Sorry for contaminating
your eyes and ears.

686
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:21,593
Hope to see you again.
