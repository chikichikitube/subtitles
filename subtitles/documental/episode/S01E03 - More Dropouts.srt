1
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,800
THIS PROGRAM IS THE RECORD
OF A "BATTLE" AMONGST COMEDIANS.

2
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:19,734
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE QUALITY,
IT IS MOSTLY UNEDITED.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,433
AS SUCH, VIEWERS MAY ENCOUNTER
EXPLICIT CONTENT.

4
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:30,033
What would it be like if you participated
as a player?

5
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,767
Well...

6
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:34,667
What do you think?

7
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:38,200
There's a certain element to consider,
that I can't really deny.

8
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:43,400
Them being polite to me
would interfere with the comedy.

9
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:45,533
That's pretty much unavoidable.

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,033
Now that I'm over 50 years old,

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,133
it's tough to work with young comedians
in their twenties and thirties.

12
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,200
I want to work with them,

13
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:58,266
but you can't tell if they really think
I'm funny, or if they're being polite.

14
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,667
That's the age I've reached.

15
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,133
That's hot.

16
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,700
That's hot.

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,567
Things like, "The mechanism of laughter."

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,333
And, "What is laughter?"

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
"What is it that we find truly funny?"

20
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,600
I think this program will make us consider
concepts like that.

21
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:27,800
I still haven't found answers
to questions like that myself.

22
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,533
-Jimmy Onishi!
-Damn!

23
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,033
You're out!

24
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,667
THE PREVIOUSLY ELIMINATED PLAYERS ARE:
JIMMY ONISHI & DIENOJI'S OHCHI

25
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,667
He let you go so many times.

26
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,133
That's still only two gone.

27
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:58,066
Two people out in one hour and a half.

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,300
-How's the pace?
-Pretty fast.

29
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:03,333
-Several of us have no more chances.
-You're right.

30
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:04,834
I have one chance left.

31
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,333
Losing Jimmy is huge.

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,633
Start.

33
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,700
It's a huge difference.

34
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,700
-He was dangerous.
-I'm going to smoke.

35
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:13,767
We have only eight left.

36
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,066
Kawahara keeps opening
new bottles of water.

37
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,767
Someone keeps taking mine.

38
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,367
I had one there, but...

39
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:23,700
you drank it, right?

40
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:27,767
Did you?

41
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:31,600
-Kawahara keeps opening new bottles.
-Fujimoto drinks from others' new bottles.

42
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,367
He's always been like that.

43
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,867
-Not always.
-I never realized that.

44
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:37,500
He never drinks from his own.

45
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,900
I wouldn't say that.

46
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,500
He looks strong.

47
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:49,633
-He looks like a demon.
-This is a strong one.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,333
-This one's definitely strong.
-Please don't hurt me again.

49
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,333
He can't breathe through his nose.

50
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,667
-Please don't hurt me.
-Look at his eyes.

51
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,333
They're squashed.

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,333
-I still hurt from that fall.
-Can he breathe through his nose?

53
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,667
His mouth's open.
He can't breathe otherwise.

54
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,066
-It's wide open.
-It's stuck open.

55
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:10,367
That is funny.

56
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,200
He is scary.

57
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:19,700
-The mask makes him do it.
-Give up?

58
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,600
Shut up. Shut up.

59
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,467
"Shut up"?

60
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:25,100
Give up?

61
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:26,400
Shut up!

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,066
Why is he saying, "Shut up"?

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,700
What a bad actor.

64
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,767
He's so bad at faking it.

65
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,300
My bone's broken.

66
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:36,967
It's broken.

67
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,400
My bone's broken.

68
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,767
Shall I make something to eat?

69
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,734
-You don't mind?
-Not at all.

70
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,266
-No, thanks.
-I watch the show Cooking Papa.

71
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,400
I said, "No."

72
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:50,233
-You can only make hamburgers, right?
-My dad's a sushi chef. I'll make sushi.

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,567
-No sushi, please.
-I don't know what sushi is.

74
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:53,834
Why not?

75
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,033
Bake me some beans.

76
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,800
You always cook beans, right?

77
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:00,500
-What?
-With ketchup and...

78
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,867
Oh, here's a new one.

79
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,767
I use salt and pepper...

80
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:07,967
Soy sauce,
and the flavor of the ingredients.

81
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,867
That's pretty funny.

82
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:15,934
-Give up?
-Shut up!

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,200
"Shut up"?

84
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,400
How cute.

85
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,767
Heart-shaped eyes.

86
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,367
-Sorry I didn't bring my American cape.
-Why don't you use mine?

87
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,233
The mouth part is so small.

88
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,533
You sure have a lot of masks.

89
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,400
-That's so cute.
-Yeah.

90
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:37,567
He's doing it again. The third time!

91
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:38,633
Give up?

92
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,834
Shut up.

93
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,000
-He broke my throat bone.
-How many throat bones do you have left?

94
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:48,867
-He's got so many masks. More coming?
-You're all out, right?

95
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,734
-We don't need any more.
-You're all out, right?

96
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,233
You keep eating that.

97
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,600
-He does.
-You like dumplings?

98
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,567
He likes bald, round things.

99
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,367
You like dipping them in sauce?

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,667
Kukky, he's back.

101
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,900
The masked man's here.

102
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,467
This wrestler is a funny one.

103
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,767
He's a funny one.

104
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,266
Not your typical wrestler.

105
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,600
-Does he really exist?
-Probably made it himself.

106
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,433
Is that really a lucha libre mask?

107
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,133
Does he really fight in Mexico?

108
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,467
What are the horns for?

109
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
That's intense.

110
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:39,033
-He's scary.
-Isn't he supposed to be zany?

111
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,934
Maybe he's just plain insane.

112
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:45,200
-They look alike.
-He's trying to say something.

113
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,266
What?

114
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,467
-What's this?
-"They're mother and child."

115
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,066
"They're mother and child"!

116
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:56,967
-That's Jimmy's line.
-It must be him.

117
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,633
-He's back.
-Jimmy came back.

118
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,033
-The next one is the last.
-Last one?

119
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,200
Last one.

120
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:06,467
That would have made me laugh.

121
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:10,567
What's up, Saito?

122
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,567
I can't stand the bugs.

123
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,734
They are gone.

124
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,467
Those bugs.

125
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,433
So that's what your scalp looks like wet.

126
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:37,667
There's more?

127
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,600
-We've had enough.
-That's a new mask.

128
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,467
Is it a different color?

129
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,734
It's a different color version of
the first one.

130
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,967
-It's a leopard pattern!
-Yeah, it is.

131
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,233
-It says, "M."
-What does that mean?

132
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:52,567
What does the "M" stand for?

133
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:56,166
"Masato." From the comedy group
The Bonchi.

134
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,633
The Bonchi.

135
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,333
Masato.

136
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,734
Masato doesn't wear masks.

137
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:16,533
When he eats lunch,
he does it really, really slowly.

138
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,734
Then he says, "Now I don't need to eat
three meals today."

139
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,734
He showed me the inside of his mouth once.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,633
His tongue was tiny.

141
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:27,600
Really.

142
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,200
He has a really big mouth,
but his tongue is tiny.

143
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,400
That must be why he eats so slowly.

144
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,367
-Is his tongue short?
-It's not short.

145
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,567
It's a normal shape, it's just tiny.

146
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:42,166
I have a long tongue.

147
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,000
-Really?
-Yes.

148
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:46,233
I can stick it in my nostril.

149
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,433
Show us.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,800
-That's super short.
-It doesn't reach at all.

151
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,500
Maybe you should aim for one nostril.
Not the middle.

152
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,400
Make your tongue longer,
or your top lip shorter.

153
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,867
Why did you lie? It doesn't reach at all.

154
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,533
-You must be too far away to see.
-I can see from here.

155
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,533
It's in my nostril.

156
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:13,533
Is it?

157
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:16,633
See, I wasn't lying.

158
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:19,467
-On closer inspection, it does reach.
-No, it doesn't.

159
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:20,667
It didn't reach.

160
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,867
-Anthony's been gone for a while.
-You're right.

161
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:25,600
Anthony, your seniors are waiting for you.

162
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,200
-Sorry.
-What are you doing?

163
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:33,533
-I had to wear something more comfortable.
-Going somewhere?

164
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:36,667
-You're looking fine.
-I didn't go out much this summer.

165
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:38,266
-He's mighty fine.
-Yeah.

166
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,367
-Let's brighten things up and play a game.
-Nice idea.

167
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,467
-Do you have one?
-I do.

168
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,500
We used to play it in the dressing rooms.
Can I take the mic off?

169
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,400
Sure.

170
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,300
-Should we do that too?
-No need.

171
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,000
-It's called "Analympics."
-"Analympics?"

172
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,233
It's a contest to see
who can show their anus the quickest.

173
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,533
I was the champion.

174
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,333
-Really.
-Wow.

175
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,667
I don't have any trademark gag to rely on.

176
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:13,133
I can't really think of
any great strategy.

177
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,567
So, I'm going to do what I used to do.

178
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,166
My seniors used to really laugh at
the silly things I did

179
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:22,367
when we were in the dressing rooms
at the comedy theater.

180
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,967
That's what
I'm planning to spring on them.

181
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,834
That's my only plan.

182
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:30,567
-First, you strip down to your underwear.
-Okay.

183
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
And then, the Analympics start.

184
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,166
-What cute underwear.
-They are.

185
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,433
Nice curves.

186
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,633
Can someone say, "Ready, go"?
You'll figure out the rules.

187
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,400
Here we go.

188
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,400
Ready, go!

189
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,166
Wait. I saw toilet paper...

190
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,333
Seriously. Stop being an idiot.

191
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,333
-Toilet paper?
-You have toilet paper stuck on your hole.

192
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,000
-No way!
-You do!

193
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,233
You didn't just show your anus.
You showed toilet paper crumbs, too.

194
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,400
-You had tons.
-It looked like termites.

195
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,867
-No way!
-I thought you had termites.

196
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:13,667
That is so embarrassing!

197
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,333
Kukky.

198
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:21,400
Hachimitsu.

199
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,700
-Saito.
-No way!

200
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,533
Let's take another look.

201
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,934
Because there are so many of you,

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,800
I didn't catch everyone,
so let me watch it again.

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,266
Then I'll decide the color of your cards.

204
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,433
Ready, go!

205
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:40,867
Something's there!

206
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,233
Saito's laughing, right?

207
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,800
It's kind of hard to tell, right?

208
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,433
And then who's the other person?

209
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,400
-Hachimitsu.
-He laughed.

210
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,834
-He laughed.
-With his mouth open.

211
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,133
Ready, go!

212
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:58,500
See?

213
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,800
-Didn't I hold it in?
-Well, okay.

214
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,567
Decision made.

215
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,066
So, Hachimitsu gets an orange card.

216
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,467
Kukky is on yellow now, right?

217
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:10,934
-I have one yellow card.
-Then you get orange!

218
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,800
Okay, Saito is safe this time!

219
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:14,867
Yes!

220
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,700
-That was close.
-You're lucky.

221
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:17,867
I didn't laugh.

222
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:21,233
I'm wondering whether that toilet paper
was part of Daisuke's plan or not.

223
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,233
Will you show me?

224
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:26,266
-You want to see?
-Why do you have toilet paper there?

225
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,100
That's the big question.

226
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,166
Here we go.

227
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,166
Ready, go!

228
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,000
-He has toilet paper stuck on it.
-Why the hell is it there?

229
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:39,734
That would make anybody laugh.

230
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,767
That has to be the worst.

231
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,000
It's gross.

232
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,400
-The toilet paper part was embarrassing.
-That means you pooped today?

233
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,834
I did. Earlier.

234
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:53,367
Then you used a bidet, right?

235
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:54,300
I did.

236
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:55,834
The toilet paper absorbs the water.

237
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:56,934
From the bidet.

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,734
Then it sticks to your ass.

239
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,433
You end up with leftovers.

240
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,700
-That was gross.
-That was embarrassing.

241
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,834
-So, you were the quickest?
-Yeah. Want to try?

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,900
-I want to check for toilet paper first.
-It gets in the wrinkles.

243
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,133
Want me to check?

244
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,166
That's the only scary part.

245
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:14,700
How is it?

246
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
How was it?

247
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,333
-Any toilet paper?
-You have to tell him.

248
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:20,300
-Look at it.
-Take a proper look.

249
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,200
I have some? Seriously?

250
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,266
Saito, take a look for me.

251
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:28,567
-Saito.
-Is Saito out?

252
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:30,500
-Kubota!
-Do I have any?

253
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,233
-Kubota still has some lives.
-Check for him, Kubota.

254
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,266
-Those without penalty cards should look.
-Kubota, look!

255
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,367
Those without cards, take a look.

256
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,166
Look at him!

257
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:46,467
-I see some.
-Please show us properly. A bit more.

258
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,800
-Show us more.
-A bit more.

259
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,967
How's this?

260
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:56,266
You can't blame him.

261
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:58,367
Showing your ass is gross.

262
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:00,533
What was that?

263
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,033
Please wash your hands.

264
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:03,266
That hurt.

265
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,200
Did you stick a bunch of needles up there?

266
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,667
We wouldn't stick a bunch of needles
in your anus.

267
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:11,000
Only a bunch of needles can hurt
like that!

268
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:12,700
That's what I'm talking about!

269
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:14,667
That's what I'm talking about!

270
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,000
We can hear you.

271
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,433
My butthole really hurts.

272
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,200
Seriously.
That rubber is really strong.

273
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,100
He's washing his ass.

274
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,333
Don't do that in the kitchen!

275
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:33,133
-Don't do that in the kitchen.
-That's disgusting.

276
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,367
Don't touch my anus.

277
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,000
Fujimoto, that's not cool.

278
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,800
-That's not right.
-But he still has lots of toilet paper.

279
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,300
That was the most painful thing ever.

280
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,867
Hurts more than when
that 750 cc bike hit me.

281
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,033
What a liar.

282
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,233
Is it all gone?

283
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,900
-Wipe it off.
-Yeah, wipe it off for him.

284
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:56,600
Is it gone?
Do I still have some?

285
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,767
Remove it.

286
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,166
Blow on my ass.

287
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,200
Blow on it.

288
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
Huff on it. Puff on it.

289
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,166
Please huff on his ass.

290
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:07,300
You've come this far.
Go all the way.

291
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:09,333
Blow it. Huff and puff.

292
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:12,100
-Check it out, ya'll.
-Yo, yo.

293
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,033
Huff onto his anus, endlessly

294
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,834
Yeah, yeah
Huff on his anus

295
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Huffin' on an anus

296
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,333
Yeah

297
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,100
Anus, flowing endlessly

298
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,633
-Something wrong?
-It's "Anus Flowing Endlessly."

299
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,667
What's wrong?

300
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:27,433
If you're going to blow, go for it.

301
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,367
Turning the pages of old photographs...

302
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,333
Anus flowing endlessly

303
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:32,767
Yeah, yeah

304
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,166
Anus, flowing endlessly

305
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,834
-Should we all try the Analympics?
-I think so.

306
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,500
Do you have any advice?

307
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,867
You have to be quick.

308
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,467
So... Let me take off the mic.

309
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:47,633
Take off your pants first,
or you'll be too slow.

310
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:50,033
-But you can leave your underwear on.
-Okay.

311
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,467
And it's easier to see with your top off.

312
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,100
And then...

313
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:58,266
Wait for the "Ready, go!"

314
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,834
-Don't touch until you hear "Ready, go!"
-Okay.

315
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,100
-Say it for me.
-Ready, go!

316
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,266
He's quick!

317
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's fast.

318
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,734
You do it that quickly?

319
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,367
-That was ultra fast.
-Want to try?

320
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:12,967
You were like a gunslinger.

321
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,934
-You move the cheek out of the way?
-That's right.

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,166
Give me a cue.

323
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:21,166
Ready, go!

324
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,133
Ta-da!

325
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,133
Ta-da!

326
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,867
Ta-da!

327
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,400
-You're next, Anthony.
-I want to see a worldly butt.

328
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:36,433
-Like a "World Expo"?
-A "World Anal."

329
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:39,367
He looks fast.

330
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,166
He does.

331
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,834
-I think he has potential.
-He's in another league.

332
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,867
Wow!

333
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,700
-Wow!
-He's hot.

334
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,533
-I can see it already.
-Are you ready?

335
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:52,767
-If he sits, we'll see it.
-Don't sit.

336
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:55,066
-Representing America!
-Ready, go!

337
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,533
What was that "ka-pht" sound?

338
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,233
You're laughing.

339
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:02,633
Did he take himself out?

340
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,400
You self-destructed?

341
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,033
Did he laugh?

342
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,367
Did Anthony laugh?

343
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:09,567
It was my "Anus Time" cheer.

344
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:10,834
Put it back.

345
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,200
We'll do it again.

346
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,000
-Do it with one hand.
-Okay.

347
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,233
Okay? Ready...

348
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,000
Go!

349
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,934
Too slow!

350
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,533
Do it like you're fighting for
the American flag.

351
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,567
And do it exactly when the clock hits
30 seconds.

352
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,934
Start the moment it counts down
to thirty.

353
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,033
Four seconds left.

354
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,033
Three...

355
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,400
Two...

356
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,867
I said, "With one hand."

357
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:36,166
Look how slow you were!
It's already 28 seconds!

358
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:41,934
-Maybe you should cheer yourself on.
-Say what you did before.

359
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,400
I think "USA" is better.

360
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:44,734
Go "USA"!

361
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:47,100
Drop your pants on "U."
Bend over on "S."

362
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,400
Show it on "A."

363
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,066
Ready, go!

364
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:56,000
-That was faster, but I want more.
-He's still a little out of sync.

365
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,500
-Good idea.
-USA.

366
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,066
USA...

367
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,834
Let's take a break.

368
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,233
Can I stop now?

369
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:25,367
Sorry.

370
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,133
Maybe I should tie it.

371
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
Will you help me tie this?

372
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,467
-That's scary.
-You're cutting off the blood.

373
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:42,500
Scary!

374
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,166
I can do "USA" with this!

375
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,834
I think it will work.

376
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,967
-Give me a cue, please.
-Ready, go!

377
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,266
Still not right?

378
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:56,834
Nice try.

379
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,433
More than two hours have passed.

380
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,433
That was quick.

381
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,967
-I'm getting hungry.
-Me, too.

382
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:07,667
Shall I cook something?

383
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,533
I want to eat sashimi.

384
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,633
-You want to eat sashimi?
-Yes, I do.

385
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:15,967
-You're gonna eat sashimi?
-There's some here.

386
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:17,934
-Sashimi?
-Nope. I can't eat sashimi.

387
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,300
Chopsticks, please.

388
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:37,200
-Anthony, what do your parents do?
-They own a sushi restaurant.

389
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:39,700
Sushi, right?
Why don't we get him to make us some?

390
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,166
But he was just touching near his anus.
Not with those fingers.

391
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,867
-You're right.
-Bad idea.

392
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,400
-He was touching around his anus.
-During the "USA" performance.

393
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,400
Wasn't "USA" my thing?

394
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,133
No, it wasn't.

395
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,800
All you've done is drink wine.

396
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,333
-In two hours and 15 minutes.
-And he wore that cheap school uniform.

397
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,266
With that knife stuck in his head.

398
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,000
We should share that properly.

399
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,967
What's wrong with you?

400
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,967
-What was that?
-I thought you didn't want any.

401
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:16,433
-Behave properly.
-Always looking out for yourself, eh?

402
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,967
Junior members shouldn't act like that.

403
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,266
You're right. That was out of line.

404
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,433
-Come here, Saito!
-Yes?

405
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
What's your problem?

406
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,467
That was wrong.

407
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,266
-That wasn't cool.
-I'm sorry.

408
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,433
-Behave properly. Open your mouth.
-What's this?

409
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:41,500
You know the hierarchy at Yoshimoto.
Seniors eat first, right?

410
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,567
Yes, sir.

411
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,500
-I'm sorry.
-Grit your teeth.

412
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:46,233
-Okay?
-Yes.

413
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,066
-You're working for Yoshimoto.
-I am.

414
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:51,233
Don't only serve yourself.

415
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,233
-Okay?
-Yes.

416
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:58,100
This is the career
you always dreamed of, right?

417
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,433
-Who did you aspire to become?
-That's enough.

418
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,000
Who was your hero?

419
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,467
Shingo Yanagisawa.

420
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,800
He's not with Yoshimoto.

421
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:13,834
-Sorry.
-Okay, that's enough.

422
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:24,734
-Is it less funny?
-Things are messy enough already.

423
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:28,100
-We have lots going on here.
-It's a real mess.

424
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:31,867
Fujimoto, that's not Scotch tape.
That's called glue.

425
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,967
-Does the uniform make it less funny?
-Are you listening?

426
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,066
The material on that is too thin.

427
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,467
It's too messy.

428
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,100
Can he eat like that?

429
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,900
-Wow!
-He did well.

430
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,967
He must be used to eating like that.

431
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,166
But he chews so loudly.

432
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:49,600
How vulgar.

433
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,467
-Hey!
-That's dangerous!

434
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,533
Spit it out!

435
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,500
-Spit it out.
-I want to spit, too...

436
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,767
Ptooey!

437
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,934
He said, "ptooey."

438
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,266
-Did you use Scotch tape to hold that up?
-What did you use?

439
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,433
-Glue.
-Oh, you used glue?

440
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,867
Remember his little pouch?
Glue must have been the only thing in it.

441
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,300
-Now it makes sense.
-All he brought was glue.

442
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,300
-Just glue.
-Amazing.

443
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,767
Things have calmed down, haven't they?

444
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,767
Yeah, sort of.

445
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:28,967
All right.

446
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,266
Where are you going, Kukky?

447
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:37,934
To the bathroom.

448
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:39,300
Excuse me.

449
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,834
I don't want to just sit and persevere,

450
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:46,633
waiting for the others to fail and leave.
I definitely don't want to win like that.

451
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,500
Ideally, I'd like to win the prize
by going on the offensive.

452
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:54,066
What should we do?
Should we have him make sushi?

453
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:55,767
-Yes.
-It's easier to eat, right?

454
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,500
-But everyone's been touching their anus.
-You're right.

455
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,500
We don't have any chopsticks.

456
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:06,667
Daisuke.

457
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,433
Kubota, don't look away.

458
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:20,200
No way. That was too much.

459
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,800
That one was too much.

460
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,734
-What is that?
-An Egg Tenga.

461
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,200
The masturbator?

462
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:33,000
That one was Daisuke.

463
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,934
Let's take a look.

464
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,767
He was actually out at this point already.

465
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,834
-Right, Daisuke?
-I knew I'd lost it already.

466
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,533
So, Daisuke gets an orange card!

467
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:54,233
-Last chance.
-Yep.

468
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,867
-Things could go down pretty fast now.
-I see.

469
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:01,667
And Jiro's mask is so long,
I can't tell whether he's laughing or not.

470
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:04,200
-That's not fair!
-You're right!

471
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:06,900
-What a cheat!
-That's not a nice strategy.

472
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,333
Kukky, stop using that.

473
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,133
The moment I realized what it was...

474
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,367
Just stop it.

475
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:18,700
-Sure, I'll leave it here.
-Egg Tenga...

476
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:23,266
-But that is amazing.
-It stretches so much.

477
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:27,000
That was scary.
You stayed behind me the whole time.

478
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,867
It's so noisy when you breathe.

479
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,300
Saito's on the move.

480
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,567
That's right.

481
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:33,467
Ow!

482
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:35,433
-Watch out for your hair.
-It's so sticky.

483
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:36,800
Your hair will get stuck.

484
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:40,066
Wow, this is so stretchy.

485
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,834
But be careful with your nails.
It rips easily.

486
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,567
This is amazing.

487
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:47,433
Breathe in first.

488
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,567
Take a deep breath.

489
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,266
Blow it up.

490
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:54,433
That's it.

491
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,967
-Awesome!
-Right?

492
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:57,667
-That's awesome.
-It is.

493
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,433
Lift your head up.

494
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,100
Yes, that's it.

495
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:05,433
You're really good at it.

496
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:07,734
He's good.

497
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:16,900
Watch out, Fujimoto.

498
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,066
You're close.

499
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:32,233
-Are they brothers?
-He can blow it so big.

500
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:34,066
That's scary!

501
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:38,467
-That's awesome.
-They're collaborating.

502
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:40,834
They're resonating.

503
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:14,266
Well done.

504
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,834
-You're good.
-Thank you.

505
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,100
Anybody want to try it?

506
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:22,633
-No, thanks.
-But...

507
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,734
It feels like you're in the ocean.

508
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,533
Or your mother's womb.

509
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,533
You hardly hear anything. Wanna try?

510
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,667
But your face might be too big.

511
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,767
-Don't do it.
-Enough already.

512
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:35,066
-We've had enough.
-Jiro, don't do it.

513
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,133
-Anthony, stop it.
-You guys look like a comic duo.

514
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:39,567
Oh, no.

515
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:42,367
You need to breathe first.

516
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:46,333
Breathe.

517
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:49,400
-It looks beautiful on Anthony.
-But I don't fit at all.

518
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:53,133
This is fun.

519
00:26:53,734 --> 00:26:54,900
He's laughing.

520
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,667
Who laughed?

521
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:01,734
Who is this for?

522
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,033
I wonder.

523
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:05,800
Who is it?

524
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:07,800
-Jiro was laughing.
-He was.

525
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:15,133
Anthony, when you said, "This is fun,"
you smiled.

526
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:18,200
It was fun, but I didn't smile.

527
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,400
-He did.
-He was smiling.

528
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:22,100
He was trying to trick us.

529
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,567
-For real?
-Anthony...

530
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,233
Yellow.

531
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:26,900
You deserve it.

532
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:31,500
This is fun.

533
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,567
He's smiling.

534
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:33,900
You smiled, right?

535
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:37,166
That's exactly what everyone's trying
not to do.

536
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,300
-I know.
-How many hours have you been doing this?

537
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,934
Kubota keeps turning away.

538
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,967
He's sly.
He always swivels around.

539
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:58,233
I'm still embarrassed about my ass.
I'm going to have a shower.

540
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:00,800
My ass...

541
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:02,333
Want me to wash it?

542
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,433
Want me to remove it?

543
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,433
-No...
-I'll clean it for you.

544
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,233
We've known each other for ages.
We're cool with things like this.

545
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,633
Yeah, but you're still my senior.

546
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:14,133
How will you remove it?

547
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:17,667
Will you rip it out?

548
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:21,133
It's okay.
We've known each other for ages.

549
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,333
You don't have to.

550
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,934
-Want me to lube you up a bit first?
-That's a good idea.

551
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:27,867
-You don't have to.
-Hand soap will do.

552
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:29,533
I'll just take a shower.

553
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:33,300
-You don't have to go that far.
-I'll wash my ass quickly--

554
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,767
-We'll clean around your anus.
-Just like this--

555
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:37,533
-That won't work.
-Yes it will.

556
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,233
No, it's stuck inside.

557
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,700
Get the soap.

558
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,934
Of course, it'll come off.

559
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,700
-I'll be fine.
-We'll help.

560
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:47,166
We can't have you
feeling embarrassed anymore.

561
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,834
-You definitely need it done.
-I said I'll be fine.

562
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,300
Hey, don't tickle me.

563
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:59,300
-Tickling is off-limits.
-You're smiling.

564
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,567
I'm not. You shouldn't tickle.

565
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:04,567
You took so long, the soap's gone dry.

566
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,400
-You don't have to.
-I'll take care of it.

567
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,567
-Come on.
-But...

568
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:12,867
You've been depressed ever since
you realized you have toilet paper there.

569
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:16,066
I was embarrassed. But this is worse.
I'll take a shower.

570
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:17,266
Don't stare at him.

571
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:18,467
Put your hands down.

572
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,166
Poke your ass up.

573
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:25,000
Doing it slowly is embarrassing.

574
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,934
And please don't go silent on me.

575
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:40,467
We're trying to figure out what this is.

576
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,834
Like I said, I'll just go take a shower.

577
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:46,000
-You don't have to go that far.
-It's not "that far."

578
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:49,934
To be honest, I've always dreamed of
removing toilet paper from your anus.

579
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:51,767
What?

580
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,834
-I think you should let him.
-Why?

581
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,633
-The timing's perfect.
-Make today special.

582
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,500
-"Make today special"?
-I want this.

583
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:04,300
I've been waiting for a moment like this
for so long.

584
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:07,300
It's a little embarrassing to tell you,
but it's true.

585
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:10,033
-He's such a kind man.
-Indeed.

586
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:14,734
This is so embarrassing.

587
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
-Would you? From both sides.
-Sure.

588
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,333
We should make it easier for Fujimoto.

589
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,834
-Need a cue?
-Here goes.

590
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,367
Do it slowly.

591
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:40,567
Ready, go. Slowly...

592
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,467
-There's so much toilet paper.
-There's a ton.

593
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:51,333
That's gotta make you squeamish.

594
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,934
Kubota, don't let go.

595
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,166
Don't let go!

596
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,266
Don't let go. I'm not finished!

597
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,400
-Never let go!
-Yes, sir.

598
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:08,767
Here, sir.

599
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:16,633
-Hm?
-You're laughing.

600
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:17,734
No, I'm not.

601
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:19,600
Both of you are laughing.

602
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:20,867
No, I'm not!

603
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:22,967
The two laughing men are at it.

604
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:25,367
He's removing it now!

605
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,200
He is. It's really working.

606
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:29,734
Is that a baby sardine?

607
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,266
It's not a baby sardine.

608
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:32,266
Gone?

609
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:33,800
All gone.

610
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:36,133
What was that sound?

611
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:38,467
Everything's fine.

612
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
No way.

613
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:50,333
Why didn't anybody laugh?

614
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,567
Hey...

615
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:53,500
What did you use on me?

616
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:54,767
What was that "phssst"?

617
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,333
That was terrifying.

618
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:57,800
Wait.

619
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,800
What the hell was that?

620
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,166
If it's me, I'm finished.

621
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,734
Daisuke and Saito!

622
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,166
A double elimination?

623
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,133
You had no more chances.

624
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,367
Wait. Fujimoto was laughing, too.

625
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,233
Everyone was laughing, Mr. Matsumoto.

626
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:35,867
I couldn't really see Fujimoto.

627
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,800
If he didn't see, that's that.

628
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Others got off the hook for that earlier.

629
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:43,200
Let's look at Daisuke and Saito.

630
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:46,900
What was that sound?

631
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:49,600
Everything's fine.

632
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:51,900
Daisuke was...

633
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,033
Pretty much the whole time...

634
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:55,934
Look at that face.

635
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:01,800
Damn.

636
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,533
-So, that's it?
-That's it.

637
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:05,767
-Seriously?
-Saito and Daisuke...

638
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,200
You're out!

639
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:11,900
Well, it's like they all got to me.

640
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,367
But we do have to create
situations like that.

641
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,734
I was actually trying to fart.

642
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,700
But no farts came out.

643
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:23,233
I tried to pee,
but I couldn't do that, either.

644
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:24,967
To be honest,

645
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:30,467
I started to break when Kukky showed up
with that thing on.

646
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,200
I nearly lost it.

647
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:35,467
I really should have done something then.

648
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:38,266
But I was too passive. I was...

649
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
I let my guard down.

650
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:44,867
Well...

651
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,066
I knew it...

652
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,834
I shouldn't have actively participated
in a situation like that.

653
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:53,867
I mean, did you see
that toilet paper thing?

654
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,900
Just watching Fujimoto
trying not to laugh was intolerable.

655
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:01,033
You can't help but laugh
when someone tries not to.

656
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,800
My fate was sealed
the moment I stood there.

657
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:07,500
We still have three hours left.

658
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:08,900
Still only halfway.

659
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:10,934
Start!

660
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,333
Everyone's used up all their
prepared gags, right?

661
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,066
Our prepared stuff? Yeah.

662
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,800
Fujimoto, have you run out?

663
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:25,533
I'm not exactly out.

664
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,066
-This place is in such a mess.
-You're right.

665
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,367
-Can't we clean this up?
-Let's do it.

666
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,667
It's our first time in this area together.

667
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:37,033
-It is.
-You're right.

668
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:39,066
He has a kid?

669
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:41,166
I didn't know that.

670
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,567
Wasn't it funny when I did this?

671
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,633
You didn't do that.

672
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,734
-Ohchi did it.
-I made that.

673
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,400
-You didn't make it.
-I did.

674
00:34:54,734 --> 00:34:56,033
You didn't make that.

675
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,700
What was that?

676
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,734
What the hell was that?

677
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:06,433
You said I didn't make it.

678
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,300
Because you didn't make it.

679
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,367
What else should I say?
You didn't make it.

680
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,200
-That was the simplest straight-man reply.
-Seriously?

681
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:15,667
But I did make this.

682
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,200
No, you didn't!

683
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:19,367
-You didn't shape it.
-It just broke.

684
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:20,433
What happened?

685
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:21,533
We have no idea.

686
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:22,834
What happened, Hachimitsu?

687
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:25,700
I guess I got tired.

688
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
-What happened?
-It hit me all at once.

689
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:32,567
Of course.

690
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,734
I'm gonna watch it again.
He shocked me, too.

691
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,867
That was such a cheerful laugh.

692
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:45,500
You didn't make that.

693
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:53,133
Hachimitsu, it's disappointing to see you
go out like this.

694
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:55,066
This is how it ends?

695
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,100
A little before it happened,

696
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,600
I'd lost my focus.

697
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:02,233
I couldn't get why Fujimoto was
so persistent about something so trivial.

698
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,667
I thought, "When you think about it,
I made that prop."

699
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,934
But he kept at it.

700
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,767
-He kept insisting.
-You didn't make it.

701
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:16,200
I wondered why he was so persistent
about something so trivial.

702
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:21,133
This Documental might be
even more of a mental game than I thought.

703
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:24,734
Watching Kawahara and Anthony
keeping their faces expressionless,

704
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:27,467
I have to wonder
what kind of nerves they have.

705
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,867
The fact they don't laugh at something
so funny makes me wonder,

706
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:33,266
"Is something wrong with these guys?"

707
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:39,834
-Remember, the prize is 10 million yen.
-It sure is.

708
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,133
It's 10 million yen!

709
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,500
But remembering that puts pressure on me.

710
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,734
-Stop mentioning that.
-What a prize!

711
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,467
-Please, stop that.
-Losing a million yen is a bigger deal.

712
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,166
If I lose it...

713
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,000
You're already thinking of losing.

714
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:56,934
I borrowed the money.

715
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:59,266
-From whom?
-Bike Kawasaki-Bike.

716
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,100
What? He had one million?

717
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:03,734
-No, he gave me 200,000.
-You borrowed here and there?

718
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:05,100
How about Kawahara?

719
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:07,033
I just happened to...

720
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:12,700
-I happened upon it.
-What does that mean?

721
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:17,033
Fujimoto, how did you get a million yen?

722
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,100
I used my savings.

723
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:23,233
Excuse me, can I have your autograph?

724
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:25,567
Your autograph.

725
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,633
Okay.

726
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,300
-As a group?
-What?

727
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:32,367
Do you want us to write it as a group,
or one from each?

728
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:34,800
-One from each, so 10.
-That many?

729
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,000
Okay. Thank you.

730
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:38,000
Got a pen?

731
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:39,834
-I have one.
-Okay.

732
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,467
-Could everyone gather around?
-Here's your pen.

733
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,867
-That's a thin pen.
-Sorry.

734
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:47,600
Could you write, "Takeda Tetsuya"?

735
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:48,800
"Takeda Tetsuya."

736
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,467
-"Dear Takeda Tetsuya..."
-No, sign it as Takeda Tetsuya.

737
00:37:52,633 --> 00:37:54,433
Please sign it as Takeda Tetsuya.

738
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:56,433
-Like this?
-Yes. As "Takeda Tetsuya."

739
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:58,367
TAKEDA...

740
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,500
How do you write "Tetsuya" in Kanji?

741
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,867
-Any way you like.
-But...

742
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:03,433
-Hiragana will do.
-Okay...

743
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:04,600
I prefer it that way.

744
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:07,166
-Like an autograph?
-It's fine like that.

745
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:11,500
Thanks. They'll be overjoyed to receive
Takeda Tetsuya's autograph.

746
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,700
But I'm not Takeda Tetsuya.

747
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:16,300
It's for a friend back home in Kansai.

748
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,934
-Could you address it to them?
-"Dear Friend Back in Kansai"?

749
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:22,166
No, "Dear Kansai-ite."

750
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,233
"Kansai..."

751
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:26,934
-"Kansai-ite."
-"Kansai..."

752
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:28,367
"Kansai-ite."

753
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,700
Great. Thank you so much.

754
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,033
No problem.

755
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:35,367
Who is this joke for?

756
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:37,900
Can I have your autograph?

757
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:39,266
Sure.

758
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,967
This is bothersome.
Could you just write it here?

759
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:47,233
Could you write it here?

760
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:49,900
-On your face?
-Yes, "Good luck."

761
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:53,066
Could you write, "Good luck"?

762
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:55,567
GOOD LUCK

763
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:56,700
Who is this for?

764
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,166
Thanks so much!

765
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm a big fan of yours!

766
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:01,934
-Thanks.
-You know him?

767
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,333
Of course I do.

768
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,133
I've been a fan forever.

769
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
I'm not on TV that much.

770
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:09,867
You're Haruka Igawa, aren't you?
Haruka Igawa.

771
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,333
You're Haruka Igawa, right?

772
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,200
-Okay.
-Thanks.

773
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,300
Lastly, can I get your hand print?

774
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:21,600
If you don't mind.

775
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,967
-Do you have a print set?
-I'll go get it--

776
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:26,467
That's usually for sumo wrestlers.
Go find one.

777
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,233
You're not a sumo wrestler?

778
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,734
Can you pull your thing out for me?

779
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,700
I want to slap it here.

780
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:36,100
-What?
-Can I slap your thing here?

781
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,800
-You want a print of it?
-I do.

782
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,934
-You want a dick print?
-A peni-print.

783
00:39:40,266 --> 00:39:41,934
-A peni-print.
-Penis?

784
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,400
I don't want to.

785
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,734
Please.

786
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,867
I can't do that.

787
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:49,133
Pretty please.

788
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,266
Do it for him. Then he'll leave.

789
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:54,467
-Just get it over and done with.
-I can't miss this opportunity.

790
00:39:54,734 --> 00:39:56,166
You can leave your shirt on.

791
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:57,700
Sorry for the inconvenience.

792
00:39:57,967 --> 00:39:59,767
I've never made a dick print before.

793
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:01,433
It's a "peni-print."

794
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,433
He already has three autographs.

795
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,533
Yes. I've got three.

796
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,500
Not many people give peni-prints, right?

797
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:09,333
So, can I take a print?

798
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,834
I really don't want to.

799
00:40:11,934 --> 00:40:14,233
-Will you use the marker?
-Yes.

800
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:17,000
-You'll draw the ink onto it?
-Just the underside.

801
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,166
-Seriously...
-It won't take long.

802
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:20,900
Excuse me.

803
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:22,266
I won't be long.

804
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:25,066
-Sorry.
-Don't pull it.

805
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,467
Sorry. I won't be long.

806
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:27,967
That hurts?

807
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:31,767
Shall I bring a thicker marker?

808
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:35,033
Why is he doing it bit by bit,
line by line?

809
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,266
-You could do it yourself.
-Sorry.

810
00:40:38,533 --> 00:40:40,166
How about using some soy sauce?

811
00:40:40,233 --> 00:40:41,233
That'll work.

812
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,834
Dip it in soy sauce,
slap it on and get it done.

813
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:44,867
Sorry, but...

814
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:47,133
My parents own a sushi restaurant.

815
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,266
That gives more meaning to the soy sauce.

816
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,500
The gods will punish me.

817
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,033
I'll treasure the peni-print forever.
Sorry.

818
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,066
Let me dip it in.

819
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:56,767
Stop it, please!

820
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,166
-It'll be over quickly.
-Stop it, please!

821
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:00,633
Ready?

822
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,934
How is it?

823
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,000
Thanks so much!

824
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,700
Please look at this.

825
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,367
This is the worst!

826
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,567
I'm going home. Thanks so much!

827
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,233
That was scary.

828
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,600
Terrifying.

829
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:28,467
Kawahara, do you have any gags?

830
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:29,533
Yes, I do.

831
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:30,900
I've never seen yours.

832
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,066
Really?

833
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:33,834
-I do.
-You do?

834
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:35,400
Show me.

835
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:36,900
Okay.

836
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:39,934
-This one's new.
-Sounds good.

837
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:41,400
It's a greeting joke.

838
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,200
"It's very nice to muscle you."

839
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,367
My body's not quite there yet.

840
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:50,600
Don't show it, then.

841
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:52,266
I'm planning on working out.

842
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:57,667
Will you really work out?

843
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,900
Yes. After all, I have this joke.

844
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:01,333
The joke came first?

845
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:05,600
Regardless of which comes first,
isn't the quality of the joke...

846
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,834
a bit too low?

847
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:11,166
Shall I help you kill some time?

848
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:14,734
-Shall I do that popular thing?
-What?

849
00:42:14,934 --> 00:42:16,100
The Pikotaro thing.

850
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:18,100
Pikotaro.

851
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,033
-Pikotaro.
-It's been trending.

852
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,700
He goes, "I have a pen..."

853
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:25,567
-I'll do an unfunny version of it.
-Huh?

854
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,400
-That sounds even better.
-May I?

855
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,100
Ba...

856
00:42:35,734 --> 00:42:37,000
Nana...

857
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,500
Banana!

858
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,934
-He sure makes it unfunny.
-That's amazing.

859
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,834
He's been trying to spread this.

860
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,500
He makes it unfunny.

861
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:48,900
Then he says, "That gag's not funny."

862
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,100
B...

863
00:42:51,567 --> 00:42:52,934
Oo...

864
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,767
Boobs!

865
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,767
Seriously, stop being such an idiot!

866
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:14,900
-Stop being such an idiot!
-You lost to Pikotaro?

867
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,100
What the hell was that?

868
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:20,800
-That wasn't even remotely funny.
-Not funny at all!

869
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:23,000
It wasn't funny at all!

870
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,133
I told you.

871
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm lucky I've seen this before.

872
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:30,133
I warned you it's not funny.

873
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,100
-Well, I had no choice, right?
-Yeah.

874
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:43,033
But that really wasn't funny.

875
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,467
-I know. That's why I did it.
-Okay.

876
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,767
Did you really know it wasn't funny?

877
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,433
Of course. That's why--

878
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,200
-It's funny because it's not funny?
-That's why I did it.

879
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,033
Daikichi laughed so hard
when I showed him, he hit the floor.

880
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,533
I thought, "This will work."

881
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,367
Well, you can't help but laugh.

882
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:02,100
I had some close calls
from the very start.

883
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:05,800
I held on to it somehow, but in the end,
I just couldn't pull through.

884
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:08,834
Sometimes the least funny things
become the funniest.

885
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,133
Kubota hits the spot for me.

886
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:15,100
I knew I was in trouble the moment I saw
he was one of the members.

887
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:19,066
I think Kawahara hasn't shown
his true potential yet.

888
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:23,734
I look forward to seeing what
he does from here on.

889
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:26,400
NEXT EPISODE

890
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:29,500
SEASON 1 FINALE

891
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:38,667
Dodge-bee.

892
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,867
What the hell is that?
It's not dodgeball?

893
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:43,133
It's dodgeball using a Frisbee.

894
00:44:43,967 --> 00:44:46,667
Dodge-bee is... A moth landed on my arm!

895
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,467
Why?

896
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:52,100
They're too soft. Isn't that hot?
