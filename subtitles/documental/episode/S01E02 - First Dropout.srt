1
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,817
THIS PROGRAM IS THE RECORD
OF A "BATTLE" AMONGST COMEDIANS.

2
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,787
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE QUALITY,
IT IS MOSTLY UNEDITED.

3
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,456
AS SUCH, VIEWERS MAY ENCOUNTER
EXPLICIT CONTENT.

4
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:29,597
Comedians usually take turns at making an
audience laugh within a given time frame.

5
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:32,800
But on this show,
10 comedians are confined to one room.

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,302
They have to make the other nine laugh.

7
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:38,672
But they have to do it
without laughing themselves.

8
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,976
This might actually be the simplest way

9
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:45,813
and the best way to decide who truly is

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,182
the funniest person.

11
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:51,385
I must admit,
this is sort of an experiment.

12
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,488
I brought 18 robot model kits.

13
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,093
Another thing is,

14
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,764
I do the TV show You Mustn't Laugh
at the end of each year.

15
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:09,970
It's become a highly entertaining show
for all ages.

16
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,106
That's great, but it can be limiting.

17
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,678
This sucks!

18
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:21,081
I wanted to get rid of all the shackles.

19
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,885
There are moments when you laugh,
even though nothing special has happened.

20
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,623
I've been wanting to create something
based on that for several years.

21
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:33,627
There is a six-hour time limit.

22
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,230
-One man wins.
-We won't need six hours.

23
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,932
No need for six hours, right?

24
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,267
THE ENTRY FEE IS ONE MILLION YEN

25
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,971
THEY MUST MAKE THE OTHERS LAUGH
FOR A 10 MILLION YEN REWARD

26
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,806
Is this for real?

27
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,441
You can do whatever you want.

28
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,144
The funniest person wins.

29
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:51,712
You have six hours.

30
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:56,150
-It may seem long, or the time may fly.
-I'm scared.

31
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,586
For the next six hours,
good luck to you all!

32
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,291
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Kyojin, from All Hanshin.

33
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,594
-No, you're not.
-I'm Kyojin.

34
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,162
Jimmy?

35
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:09,730
-You're Kyojin?
-Yes.

36
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,434
Pretty much everyone laughed.

37
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,470
I didn't laugh.

38
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,607
They're mother and child.

39
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:21,742
Are you hungry?

40
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:26,780
Yellow card.

41
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,650
-Yellow?
-You only get a yellow card for that?

42
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,821
I'm not sitting next to Daisuke.
He makes me laugh.

43
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,591
-You make me laugh, too.
-That's not fair.

44
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,861
-We're on.
-We are.

45
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,763
They're mother and child.

46
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:51,532
Are you hungry?

47
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,702
-That's for the parent.
-This one is the mommy.

48
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,938
-I thought so.
-Why is your pinky bent like that?

49
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,610
Mommy has the flu,
so she can't feed the baby.

50
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,679
He's crazy.

51
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:06,947
He's scary.

52
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,782
-Mommy has the flu--
-What?

53
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,584
Can you please be quiet?

54
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,588
It's tough not to laugh at this.

55
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,757
-He's crazy from the get-go.
-One, two...

56
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,192
Stop it.

57
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:19,627
Ouch!

58
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,795
What the hell are you doing?

59
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,931
I just wanted you to be quiet.

60
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,799
What did you use?

61
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:26,834
That hurt!

62
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,270
Did you throw fire at me?

63
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,241
That was really hot.

64
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:37,111
-He hit him with fire.
-Apparently so.

65
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,613
-It felt like fire.
-Show us your back.

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,881
Take a look.

67
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,650
Am I okay?

68
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,318
What's with those muscles?

69
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,686
Your back is gross.

70
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:46,754
Gross.

71
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,089
-He has old man skin.
-He's full of holes.

72
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,191
-The fire must have done it.
-The fire!

73
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,359
-Fire holes.
-Sorry.

74
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:53,727
Don't throw fire at me.

75
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,362
It wasn't fire. Sorry.

76
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:57,498
Anyway...

77
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,532
Look at my cans.

78
00:04:58,599 --> 00:04:59,867
It's too early for that.

79
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:03,003
-Can I do my can thing first?
-We still have five hours to go.

80
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,505
Please wait.

81
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,774
-One can...
-Five hours?

82
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,175
Two cans.

83
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,877
Three cans.

84
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,313
Four cans.

85
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,582
Five cans.

86
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,017
Six cans.

87
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,086
-Watch him.
-Yeah, watch!

88
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,523
Damn, now I have to recount.

89
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,426
One can, two cans, three cans, four cans,

90
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,362
five cans, six cans, seven cans,

91
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,998
eight cans,

92
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,300
nine cans.

93
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,603
-There is nothing in this bag.
-Okay.

94
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,272
-Nine cans.
-Okay.

95
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:46,947
The ninth edition of The Shincho Weekly
has been canned.

96
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,720
I don't feel any pressure.

97
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:57,091
I don't have to worry whether my jokes
work or not, because this time,

98
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,026
nobody's supposed to laugh.

99
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,661
If they laugh, they lose.

100
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,163
With a rule like that,

101
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,366
I can do whatever I want,
with no pressure at all.

102
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,002
I'm going to perform a bunch of new gags.

103
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,471
What was that just now?

104
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,873
They didn't print it. Nine was canned.

105
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,843
Number "nine" went in the "can"?
It was a pun.

106
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,045
It wasn't funny at all.

107
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,680
I thought it was pretty good.

108
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:20,748
Pretty good? Thanks.

109
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:21,882
I still don't get it.

110
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,050
-Was it from the radio?
-What?

111
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,351
Was it played on the radio?

112
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,054
-Yeah. Um...
-On the radio? For The Shincho Weekly?

113
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,323
I threw in an impression
of The Shincho Weekly ad.

114
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,824
You can do impressions
of The Shincho Weekly?

115
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,592
Yeah.

116
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:35,596
The ninth edition of The Shincho Weekly
has been canned.

117
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,398
It should be higher.
The ad was spoken by a kid.

118
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,400
Try doing it at a higher pitch.

119
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,936
-The Shincho Weekly is...
-Pinch your nose.

120
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,339
The Shincho Squeaky is...

121
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,641
You said "Squeaky." It's "Weekly."

122
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:49,777
-He's good at it.
-You do it.

123
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,079
-The Shincho Weekly...
-It has to be higher.

124
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,480
Pinch your nose!

125
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,182
The Shincho Weekly...

126
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,617
Your voice is too low!

127
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,152
The Shincho Weekly...

128
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:01,121
-It's way too low!
-I've never even heard the original.

129
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,190
-Way too low!
-Why are you mad?

130
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,424
-I'm gonna kill him.
-Why?

131
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,692
Snuff him. Seriously.

132
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,029
But I'm scared. I think he knows capoeira.

133
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,165
Don't fight.

134
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,200
-Stop it.
-Know any moves?

135
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,935
Have some candy.

136
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,504
-Do I know any moves?
-Have some candy.

137
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,739
Shall I do one?

138
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,274
Can I do it to you?

139
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,442
Why? No. You're scaring me.

140
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,411
-Don't be violent.
-He's scary.

141
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,381
-I'm scared. Isn't he scary?
-I think you should do it.

142
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,550
-You said--
-Kubota, you do it.

143
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,451
-You said you'd kill me.
-Kubota, you do it.

144
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,387
You said you were gonna kill me.

145
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,389
I am seriously scared of him.

146
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,525
-That's what you said.
-You're turning this place into a slum.

147
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,727
-Then let me do my move.
-You are scary.

148
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:41,995
It's scary now.

149
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,064
-Just let me do one move.
-Let him.

150
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,233
-Let him do it.
-It won't hurt much--

151
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,402
-Of course it will!
-No, it won't hurt.

152
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,304
-Let's do it.
-Take it like a man.

153
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,206
No way.

154
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,042
-All you have to do is stand still.
-I said I'm scared.

155
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,777
Just let him do it once.

156
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,512
Let him do it to you!

157
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,016
-Well, that's it. Go for it.
-Why me?

158
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,018
Why me?

159
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,720
You take it!

160
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,626
-I guess you're the one.
-Let's decide by rock-paper-scissors.

161
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,095
-You and Jimmy do rock-paper-scissors.
-Why me?

162
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,831
-With Jimmy?
-It has nothing to do with me.

163
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,666
Jimmy, let's do rock-paper-scissors.

164
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,369
-That's not right.
-I know what you mean.

165
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,404
Do the "look that way" version.

166
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,473
-This isn't right.
-"Look that way."

167
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,774
This isn't right.

168
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,715
You don't need these.

169
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,750
They calm me down.

170
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,086
Who cares?

171
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,556
-No, no, no.
-Uh-oh.

172
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,925
-He's totally laughing.
-He self-destructed.

173
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,426
He's laughing hard.

174
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,095
-He can't stop laughing.
-Okay!

175
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,097
Saito was laughing, too.

176
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,033
Jimmy's out, but Saito is, too.

177
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,103
-You definitely laughed.
-Absolutely.

178
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,539
I want you guys to hide Daisuke's face.
His face makes me laugh.

179
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,541
-That's my line.
-Who's out?

180
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,645
Wait. It should be a yellow card.
Daisuke's face is...

181
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,947
This time,

182
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,483
it's not only one person.

183
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,020
The first person is...

184
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,221
Jimmy.

185
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,822
-No doubt about it.
-I admit it.

186
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,491
-He knows.
-I admit it.

187
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,692
And also,

188
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,396
-Saito.
-No way. I wasn't laughing.

189
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:23,897
-I didn't laugh.
-Saito laughed, too.

190
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,699
-I didn't.
-Saito, too?

191
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:26,867
I didn't laugh.

192
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,869
-And...
-What? There's more?

193
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,604
Fujimoto!

194
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,240
-These three laughed.
-They definitely laughed.

195
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,808
Let's check to make sure.

196
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,909
But I didn't laugh.

197
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,444
Firstly, we have Jimmy.

198
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,047
-I laughed.
-You know it, right?

199
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,281
Let's watch it.

200
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,216
But I didn't laugh.

201
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,786
But you were kind of smiling.

202
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,989
-Look.
-That's a smile.

203
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,590
-He's laughing.
-He is.

204
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,492
That's not laughing.

205
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,962
He's laughing!

206
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,130
He's laughing, right? Right there.

207
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,600
-And Saito.
-I really wasn't laughing.

208
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,437
Let's watch. Saito was laughing, too.

209
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,606
But it may have been after the buzzer.

210
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,179
No, no. Don't get me wrong!

211
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,549
I thought I could laugh,
because Jimmy had already laughed.

212
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,118
That's not the point.

213
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:22,022
-I only laughed because Jimmy laughed.
-That doesn't make it okay for you.

214
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:22,923
But...

215
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,225
Those three get a yellow card.

216
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,394
-But that's not fair.
-You're right.

217
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,496
Then how about Kukky?

218
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,865
I might have missed him.

219
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,067
It was before Jimmy pointed his finger.

220
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,903
If Mr. Matsumoto didn't see it,
then that's that.

221
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,774
Well, I guess so. I am the judge.

222
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,610
I want you to stop attacking me.

223
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,546
-We're not attacking you.
-You're attacking everyone.

224
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,581
Everyone.

225
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,950
He hadn't even finished the set up
to his gag.

226
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,586
-You guys attacked me first.
-No, we didn't.

227
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,290
And Daisuke, I think you're using
the water bottle to hide your laugh.

228
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,626
-No, I'm not.
-Who drinks that much water?

229
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,228
Watch him carefully!

230
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,596
I'm thirsty.

231
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,866
-Seriously.
-Okay. Then drink it all at once.

232
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,635
I can't. It's carbonated.
I won't be able to hold it in.

233
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,337
-He's a cheater.
-That's not good.

234
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,239
-I heard him chuckling.
-I didn't chuckle.

235
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,307
-You were.
-You kept cracking up.

236
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,176
What about him?

237
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,413
He's drinking wine all the time.
His mouth is always on the wine bottle.

238
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,848
-He's setting up a joke with that, right?
-No, I'm not.

239
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:22,783
You're not?

240
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,419
-Then stop it.
-He really does like wine.

241
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:28,321
Please watch everyone carefully,
Mr. Matsumoto!

242
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,158
I am, but it's hard to watch
all 10 of you.

243
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:34,027
But I promise I will keep an eye on Kukky.

244
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,596
-You should've got a yellow card, too.
-Sorry.

245
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,775
-Why don't you pick up where you left off?
-Fujimoto, can I?

246
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,244
-Oh, that's right.
-You should do it.

247
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,046
Fujimoto, don't run from it.

248
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,414
Seriously, no.

249
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,616
-I said no!
-What exactly will you do?

250
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,951
-A move...
-Are you crazy?

251
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,619
We don't need any moves!

252
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,556
He is so annoying.

253
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,258
-Let him do it once.
-That's a good idea.

254
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,660
-Will it hurt?
-It won't.

255
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,495
-Really?
-He said it won't hurt.

256
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,031
Then why do it?
I don't want to pretend it hurts.

257
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,432
How about someone else?

258
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,534
You talk too much. You do it.

259
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:15,702
I talk...

260
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,005
You talk too much. You do it.

261
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,941
-I wasn't talking.
-He wasn't.

262
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,343
He hasn't talked
since he got the yellow card.

263
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,112
-You're right.
-That's dirty.

264
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,481
-He's a coward.
-Do it, Ohchi.

265
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,883
-Anthony, try it on Ohchi.
-May I?

266
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,618
-No.
-Do it.

267
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,153
-Will it hurt?
-No, it won't.

268
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,255
Can I have you face the front?

269
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,558
-Put your right hand here.
-On his hip?

270
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,961
Spread your legs and look down.

271
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,964
I mean, stand up straight,
but point your head down.

272
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,133
Look forward...

273
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,168
-Jimmy, stop that.
-Seriously.

274
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,003
Watch them.

275
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,575
Hello.

276
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:58,979
Hello.

277
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,852
-He's laughing.
-Anthony, don't let up.

278
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,754
-Go all the way.
-He's laughing.

279
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,489
-Do more, Anthony.
-He's out.

280
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,391
-Attack more.
-I didn't laugh.

281
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,060
I did this. I just clenched my muscles.

282
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,364
-Can I do it to Fujimoto now?
-Fujimoto.

283
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,231
-Fujimoto.
-Fujimoto.

284
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,399
Can I do the same to you?

285
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,902
He is your junior colleague after all.

286
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:23,803
You do it.

287
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,843
-Poor guy.
-Let's not resort to violence.

288
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,344
-What was that for?
-Stop it.

289
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,814
-He shouldn't tell his senior what to do.
-But he doesn't have any hair.

290
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,816
-That hurt.
-I'll give you my hair.

291
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,785
-Jimmy's giving it to you.
-Thanks.

292
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,086
-This is yours.
-Lucky you.

293
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,955
You dropped your candy.

294
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,890
Oh, my candy, sorry.

295
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,559
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

296
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,127
His hair is so wet.

297
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,597
Put it on.

298
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,999
-What's up, Saito?
-Saito?

299
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,635
-Let's see Saito first.
-Okay.

300
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,671
Jimmy, look at Saito.

301
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,107
-Wait.
-Jimmy?

302
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,642
Wait a minute.

303
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,778
Oh, no. He's gone.

304
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:07,814
That's two players down.

305
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,549
Saito laughed.

306
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,986
But that means Saito is...

307
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,188
-Two of them laughed.
-Yeah, two down.

308
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,924
-He tried to hide in the sink.
-He has a yellow card.

309
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,526
Why did you wet your hair?

310
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,595
He tried to hide his laughter.

311
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,831
-That's not fair.
-I was just washing my eyes.

312
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,200
-Were you hiding your laugh?
-No, my eyes hurt.

313
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,436
Why did Saito laugh? What was it?

314
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,138
-He did it to himself.
-But I've only just started.

315
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,274
-He's gone.
-I'm out.

316
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,444
-That was pretty clear.
-They already have yellow cards.

317
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,513
Let's take a look at Saito.

318
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,549
-He laughed.
-But I was...

319
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,184
He laughed, but why?

320
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,752
Because of Jimmy...

321
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,021
I don't get why Saito laughed there.

322
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,757
Jimmy was making a funny face.

323
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,460
Let's take a look at Saito.

324
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,529
-Why did he wet his hair?
-I don't know.

325
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,867
Because Jimmy made a funny face!

326
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,069
Oh, no. He's gone.

327
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,271
No, I was crying.

328
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:05,538
I was crying!

329
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,308
And what about Ohchi?

330
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,476
I was just--

331
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,610
He definitely cheated.

332
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:14,180
-I was just clenching my muscles.
-Never do that again.

333
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:19,986
Hello.

334
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,823
Hello.

335
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,396
He's laughing.

336
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,332
-Anthony, don't let up. Go all the way.
-He's laughing.

337
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,600
I didn't laugh.

338
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,403
Everyone could tell
that I held it back, right?

339
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,039
-I clenched it in.
-Well, but...

340
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,474
-In Saito's case...
-Wait a minute.

341
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,377
I could tell he was being aggressive.

342
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,914
-He attempted to initiate something.
-I did.

343
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,616
-Because of that,
-Yes?

344
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:51,985
you get

345
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,987
an orange card.

346
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:57,090
Is it better than yellow?

347
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,794
He got a yellow card. Now he has this.
The next one means...

348
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,996
Yellow, orange, red is the way it goes?

349
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,765
-This is truly your last chance.
-Last chance.

350
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,601
-He's got bubbles now.
-What are you doing, Jimmy?

351
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,338
Just because you're not in the hot seat.

352
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,707
It's okay to laugh now?

353
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,810
-What are you doing?
-I'm shampooing my hair.

354
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,980
-He's crazy.
-You are really scaring me!

355
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,884
-Seriously, why are you doing that?
-Because my head started feeling hot.

356
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,853
-He was hiding his laughter.
-Really?

357
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,054
No, I didn't.

358
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,056
My head is so hot.

359
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,861
-Jimmy was totally laughing.
-Good luck, guys.

360
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,497
I only washed my head because
my eyes hurt.

361
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,532
I'll wash it off, then.

362
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,068
-No more shampoo, right?
-Do it in the bathroom.

363
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,169
I'll wash it off now.

364
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,171
-Not now.
-Not now, please.

365
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,742
-Don't wash your head in the kitchen.
-We cook food here.

366
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,076
Okay.

367
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,544
He's so dangerous.

368
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:52,746
Start.

369
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:55,482
Scary.

370
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,751
Jimmy, go wash your hair.

371
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,820
Daisuke's always drinking something.

372
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,189
Saito, what were you going to do?

373
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,091
Jimmy really is crazy.

374
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,494
Don't make me explain my jokes.

375
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,897
That wig looks good on everyone.
It's probably a good wig.

376
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,432
Do you look good in it?

377
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,268
That's way too high up.

378
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,837
-Yeah.
-Really?

379
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,006
You're scary.

380
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,610
What a lovely bath!

381
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:25,712
Lovely bath salts.

382
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,947
That iodine felt great.

383
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:29,916
What did he say?

384
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,318
-You're sopping wet. Dry yourself.
-I will.

385
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:33,920
Just a moment.

386
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,989
He can't untie the knot.

387
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,059
-I'm so refreshed.
-Your bald spot is showing again.

388
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,495
-That won't absorb any water.
-Not that material.

389
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,596
Not that thing.

390
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,367
-Use the sheep towel.
-This sheep's name is "Sheep."

391
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,136
-"Sheep."
-You're coming on strong.

392
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,371
Too strong.

393
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,239
What's wrong?

394
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,342
Why are you crying?

395
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,311
I got shampoo in my eyes.

396
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,014
Why do you keep walking around?

397
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,483
Where am I going bald?

398
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,920
-Everywhere.
-This bit is nasty.

399
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,154
It's nasty.

400
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,989
Okay, don't look at my bald spot.

401
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,459
And what's this?

402
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:16,262
-You have a completely bald patch.
-Actually, it's not a bald patch.

403
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,565
It's where I was electrocuted on my head.

404
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,236
-Electrocuted?
-Electrocuted.

405
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,339
Does electrocution cause baldness?
Does it just fall out?

406
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,740
You'll never understand...

407
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,075
I want a look.

408
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,244
Not the pain of electrocution.

409
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,880
Where is it?

410
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:36,783
It was electricity.

411
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,151
How scary!

412
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,519
I got electrocuted.

413
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,687
This might fix it.

414
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,655
Maybe this will fix your bald spot.

415
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,791
If he hits the exact same spot.

416
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,093
-Shall we try?
-I guess so.

417
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,462
-Everyone go over there.
-As long as it cures me.

418
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,498
-Over there.
-If it will help, sure.

419
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,766
Are you sure?
Consider it a medical treatment.

420
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,034
Medical treatment.

421
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,837
How nice of him to try and fix
your bald spot.

422
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,277
That was hot!

423
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,981
That was hot!

424
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,048
It was hot?

425
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:10,984
Did he get burned?

426
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,619
That's hot!

427
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,189
-Is my bald spot gone?
-Are you okay?

428
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,390
It's hot.

429
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:19,926
That can't be right.

430
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,028
It wasn't me. I just said it was hot.

431
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,130
-I didn't laugh.
-I'm sorry.

432
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,165
-I didn't laugh.
-Me, neither.

433
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,001
-Neither did I.
-I didn't laugh.

434
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,904
-What about that rubber band?
-I was just making a funny face.

435
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,306
-To make you guys laugh.
-You twisted your smile.

436
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,108
-That's a yellow card.
-He cheated.

437
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,477
All I did was this.
I thought it would be funny.

438
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,178
I didn't laugh.

439
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,947
Let him decide.

440
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,583
-Daisuke laughed.
-He did.

441
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,151
No, no, no.

442
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,387
-He used that rubber band.
-I didn't.

443
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,721
He used it to stop laughing.

444
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,124
The rubber band said,
"I'm holding back a smile."

445
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,059
No. I made a funny face. Like this.

446
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:54,861
To be funny.

447
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,830
Yellow card.

448
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,066
-You can't do that.
-That was wrong.

449
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,367
Let's watch it anyway.

450
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,741
That was hot!

451
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,679
He's smiling!

452
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,547
Don't ever try that again!

453
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,016
He was definitely laughing.

454
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,851
Never do that again!

455
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,588
I was trying to be funny.
It was a funny face.

456
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,590
-That should get a red card.
-Red card!

457
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,726
You were totally laughing.

458
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,097
-Never again, okay?
-That wasn't fair, Daisuke.

459
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:34,000
-It hasn't even been an hour.
-Was it really that funny?

460
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,970
And Ohchi's had a faint smile
the entire time.

461
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,438
Really?

462
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,741
You've had a faint smile the whole time.

463
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,743
-Get outta here.
-Wait.

464
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,378
Are faint smiles out, too?

465
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,814
-Did I have a faint smile?
-The whole time.

466
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,683
-I think we should skip Jimmy for a while.
-Good idea.

467
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,452
-There's sashimi in here.
-What?

468
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,153
-We have sashimi.
-We do.

469
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,556
-Want me to make sushi?
-No, thanks.

470
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,358
-Your hands are dirty.
-Right?

471
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,493
-Your hands are dirty.
-Why would they be dirty?

472
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,694
Stop it.

473
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,830
I just washed my hair.

474
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,432
-Why would they be dirty?
-That's what we mean.

475
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,967
Your head is dirty.

476
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,837
My head's not dirty.
It's been electrocuted.

477
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:12,805
The electricity disinfected it.

478
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,408
Please, I want you to be quiet.

479
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,543
Jimmy, stop drinking the water.

480
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:20,179
-Okay.
-You were hiding a smile with the bottle.

481
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,452
Don't drink that, either.

482
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,589
Stop that.

483
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,458
Of course they want him to stop.

484
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,663
You can't tell him too much.
But he really never stops.

485
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,032
Jimmy? That's a bit fishy...

486
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,566
I'm not doing anything.

487
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,903
Don't be short-tempered either.

488
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,806
Can I ask everyone to write
a message here?

489
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:49,509
It's for Master Daisuke.

490
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,010
Something short.

491
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,746
DEAR DAISUKE
"UFOS DO EXIST"

492
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,648
Saito was close.

493
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:58,117
-But he's not retiring.
-Apparently he is.

494
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,720
-Why are we writing this?
-Because he's retiring.

495
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:01,954
-Who is?
-You're lying.

496
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,489
-This dude.
-Master Daisuke?

497
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,391
Don't call the Master a "dude."

498
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,659
Wait, wait, wait.

499
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,195
-I'm not writing anything.
-Why not?

500
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,033
Because it's wrong.
We shouldn't write him a farewell message.

501
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,568
-But Master Daisuke is--
-He's not.

502
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:16,736
He's retiring.

503
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,104
Why?

504
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,375
You know Junichi Yaoi, the occult expert?
He's doing a special broadcast with him.

505
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,043
He's going to retire after that.

506
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,913
-About UFOs?
-Exactly.

507
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,049
-On a local TV channel?
-What?

508
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,351
Why would Master Daisuke be on local TV?

509
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,655
-It would be with a major network.
-Does that mean...

510
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,956
Will Hanako go solo?

511
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,058
Let's sit down.

512
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,593
-Will Hanako go solo?
-Sit down.

513
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,695
-Wasn't she arrested?
-We need to discuss this.

514
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:45,531
-She was, but the charges were false.
-They were dropped?

515
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,668
Pet theft, wasn't it?

516
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:51,571
What's he doing?

517
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,439
You catch, okay?

518
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:54,807
It's gonna fly.

519
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,009
You catch, okay?

520
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:01,013
Hanako is that serial killer
who dresses as a clown, isn't she?

521
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,616
That's John Wayne Gacy!

522
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,118
It's gonna fly. Catch it.

523
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:06,619
It's gonna fly--

524
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:07,954
Excuse me.

525
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,322
You're distracting us.

526
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,659
-Please.
-What?

527
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,428
What is it?

528
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,931
You want my autograph?

529
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:21,367
No, we're all writing a short message.

530
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,469
-Could you go first?
-One message each?

531
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:27,006
I already wrote "UFOs do exist,"
so anything other than that will do.

532
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,844
-We're writing a farewell message?
-We are.

533
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:33,613
Let me write something.

534
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:37,483
You made my shirt all dirty.

535
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,952
-I got your fuzz balls.
-You gave them to me.

536
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,754
You're just like Master Daisuke.

537
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,222
Master Daisuke isn't dirty.

538
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,591
Look at my sleeve.
It's like I've got ants.

539
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,760
-From the fuzz balls.
-Like Master Daisuke.

540
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,496
Master Daisuke's sleeves aren't dirty.

541
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,565
-Master Daisuke is...
-He has dirty sleeves.

542
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,134
-His sleeves aren't dirty.
-He had a ton of lint.

543
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:57,770
-His sleeves are clean.
-The lint's on his skin.

544
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,640
He's dirty around here,
but his sleeves are clean.

545
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:03,342
"Dai-bou."

546
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,211
That's his nickname.

547
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,980
Does the "bou" in "Dai-bou" mean "priest"?

548
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,483
-It means "gang."
-What a scary name!

549
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,889
-Jimmy, did you write your message?
-Yes.

550
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,394
"Everyone's on the boat."

551
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:22,762
What does that mean?

552
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,263
"Everyone's on the boat."

553
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,032
What does that mean?

554
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:29,168
-Did you get permission to do this?
-You'll get in trouble.

555
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,437
No, I didn't.

556
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,173
I'm sure he'll get upset.

557
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,609
I've heard rumors he's not happy
with you, too.

558
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:40,613
Well, it doesn't matter. He's old.
He doesn't scare me.

559
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,949
I'm going to tell you off on his behalf.

560
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,251
No, don't do that. It's not your business.

561
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,887
It's not your business!
Master Daisuke is powerless anyway!

562
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:50,857
-He's just got a big face.
-You should tell him off.

563
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:53,459
-He's like a loose stool.
-Seniors shouldn't fight.

564
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:54,961
Cut it out.

565
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,429
Let's stop this.

566
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,066
Shall I do one of my moves on him?

567
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,467
Come back.

568
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,202
He never gives up.

569
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,871
I have some moves...

570
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,614
When we reach a deadlock,

571
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,149
I don't want to get caught up in it.

572
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:22,822
As time passes, everyone will get
even more used to the situation.

573
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:27,860
So, I want to take advantage of that,
and be aggressive from the start.

574
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:32,231
I'll slip in a few light jokes,
and go on the offensive from the start.

575
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:50,082
You can't blame him.

576
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:58,591
You're scary.

577
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,962
I saw this on the Amazon commercial.

578
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:04,664
I had to get it.

579
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,034
-It's what the dog wears.
-Oh, that ad with the baby.

580
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,469
Because the baby cries at the dog.

581
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:12,672
So that's where it went.

582
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,807
Does this belong to somebody else?

583
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,475
It's mine!

584
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,379
I ordered one of these.

585
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,749
-But they ran out of stock.
-He got it instead?

586
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,352
-What were you thinking?
-Seriously?

587
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:27,887
Try it on.

588
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,556
You really want to try that on?

589
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,701
-Give me a hand.
-What's that?

590
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:44,170
I was given a big lucky flag.

591
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,205
I'll put this wig on.

592
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,507
-That's wonderful!
-Look at that!

593
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,710
-Take a look at that.
-Wow!

594
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,514
MASTER DAISUKE
GET WELL SOON

595
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,117
-You were given this?
-Yes, I was.

596
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,488
When he got sick,
his fans made it for him.

597
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:05,191
-He gave it to me.
-Awesome.

598
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:06,659
Way to go.

599
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:08,761
-Want to use it as a tablecloth?
-Sure.

600
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,630
-Move everything off the table, please.
-But I'm...

601
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,866
-Just a moment.
-Okay.

602
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,202
Daisuke, sit down.

603
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,337
-Where are you going?
-What's wrong?

604
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,239
Look. We have Daisuke and Daisuke.

605
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:21,974
It's not Daisuke and Daisuke.

606
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:23,876
There's pubic hair around his mouth.

607
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,978
Who put pubic hair on him?

608
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,114
This is not funny. Who did it?

609
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,382
This is beyond a joke.

610
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:32,752
Who put white pubic hair around
the veteran's mouth?

611
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,121
You can't do that. Anywhere but his mouth.

612
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,689
Where did Kubota go?

613
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,424
He's putting on the wig.

614
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,260
Can I come out?
I'm wearing that Amazon thing.

615
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,496
Is this on right?

616
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,798
Is this correct?

617
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,171
I look like Seiko Matsuda!

618
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,874
I look just like Seiko Matsuda!

619
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,344
Jimmy, right?

620
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,883
What were you trying to do?

621
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,318
-It wasn't that funny.
-What happened?

622
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,488
-What did you do with your eyes?
-You were just squeezing them?

623
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,757
I'm done for.

624
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,461
That wasn't fair.
His eyes were so bloodshot.

625
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,463
-Jimmy.
-You got me.

626
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,365
Let's watch it.

627
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:20,933
You're definitely out, Jimmy.

628
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,735
You suddenly exploded.

629
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,675
Fujimoto was close, too.

630
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,584
That one is tough to make a verdict on.

631
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,588
You're in danger now.

632
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,690
-This is your final chance.
-Okay.

633
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,359
That's so lenient.
It could've been a red card.

634
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,128
Exactly. I thought about it.

635
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,664
-Sorry.
-This is your last chance.

636
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,267
I know. But they keep on attacking me.

637
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,803
-No, we're not.
-We're all under attack.

638
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:01,874
I am the type of person
who laughs really easily.

639
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,176
When it hits the right spot,

640
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,446
I can't help but laugh.

641
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,450
When I used to watch
The Drifters' show, Hachijidayo,

642
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:12,985
I'd laugh a lot.

643
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,557
Start!

644
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:22,094
Can we play the game
"Who's Really Doing It?"

645
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:24,663
Let's play "Who's Really Doing It?"

646
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,932
-Was that the name?
-Yes.

647
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,033
No, it's not.

648
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,568
It's "Who's Really Doing It?"

649
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,470
-Really?
-Yeah.

650
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,173
What kind of game is it?
I've never heard of it.

651
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:35,708
Huh?

652
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:38,043
Anthony...

653
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:41,647
One of these sweet buns contains
spicy wasabi.

654
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,950
-It's sitting on the top.
-We can see it.

655
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,286
Guess which one has the wasabi inside.

656
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:48,821
We can see it!

657
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,189
You're gonna eat it?

658
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:53,893
You're eating it yourself?

659
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,528
He's cool.

660
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,633
I got the wasabi.

661
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,935
Of course.
You're the only one to choose from.

662
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:04,270
And we could see it.

663
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:05,604
There's still one left.

664
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,277
Give us another try. Eat up.

665
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,578
Is he okay?

666
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,780
-You spat it out.
-No, I didn't.

667
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,715
-That's a violation.
-It's still here.

668
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:18,350
There's one more.

669
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,286
That one looks safe.

670
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:21,787
It should be okay...

671
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:26,425
-I'm done for.
-You totally laughed.

672
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,528
That was definitely a laugh.

673
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,730
You laughed so normally.

674
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,667
-He laughed just like normal.
-He totally laughed.

675
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,935
Wait.

676
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:38,103
-You laughed like normal.
-Completely.

677
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:39,939
You forgot we're not just chatting.

678
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,508
He's here.

679
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,377
-He put his hand up.
-I'm sorry.

680
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:48,447
I'm sorry.
I don't need to check the video.

681
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,883
-Yellow!
-Just yellow?

682
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:54,253
Did you know Anthony
had his eyelids flipped?

683
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,255
-I had no idea.
-I noticed, but...

684
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,558
-He was giving a mean stare.
-Like Clint.

685
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:01,493
Like Clint Eastwood?

686
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:04,129
Why laugh?

687
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,398
But I can laugh now, right?

688
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,467
That didn't deserve a laugh.

689
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,369
-It wasn't that funny.
-Be quiet!

690
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:13,739
I can't keep all 10 of you alive
for much longer.

691
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,909
-Somebody will be eliminated soon.
-It's been an hour.

692
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,845
You're Clint Eyelid-wood.

693
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:20,913
I am.

694
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,685
You're Clint Eyelid-wood.

695
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,120
I am.

696
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,455
Start!

697
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,490
Wasabi is dangerous.

698
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:36,762
-Can you put this flag away?
-What do you think? Should we--

699
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,530
Stop it! It's mine.

700
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,299
Let's pack it up.

701
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,036
Fujimoto, you've been close to laughing.

702
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,604
But he keeps drinking!

703
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,440
You're close again.

704
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:55,948
Damn it!

705
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,182
Why?

706
00:31:59,018 --> 00:31:59,952
Why?

707
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:00,986
Why?

708
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:02,921
Why can't I drink?

709
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,024
-Damn you!
-Don't blame him, Jimmy.

710
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,025
Damn you!

711
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,794
We all agreed not to hide behind bottles.

712
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,229
Damn you!

713
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:11,630
Damn!

714
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,898
Jimmy Onishi!

715
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,534
You're out!

716
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,104
Damn you!

717
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,812
What you did was wrong!

718
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:28,881
-That's wrong.
-Don't blame me.

719
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,250
We all agreed not to hide behind bottles.

720
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:32,685
I wasn't hiding!

721
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,854
I was only drinking because
the wasabi was still hot.

722
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37,323
You are not nice!

723
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,994
You're out.
Leave your million yen and go home!

724
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,495
You make me mad.

725
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,331
What did I do?

726
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,100
You kept tricking me into laughing.

727
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:51,637
I only tried to stop you from drinking.
That's what we all agreed.

728
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,872
-Where's he going?
-To get his things.

729
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,008
Did he have any props left?

730
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,243
He brought quite a lot.

731
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,945
He had a lot.

732
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,648
I didn't get to use any of these.

733
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,783
-You should have used them.
-He's right.

734
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,087
This will change things.

735
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,855
It makes life easier.

736
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,791
It will be a lot easier now.

737
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,993
This is a big gain for us.

738
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:16,762
My million yen!

739
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,568
It's not easy to earn one million yen.

740
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,772
Sitting next to Daisuke was
my first big mistake.

741
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:31,343
Daisuke creates a subtle comic vibe.
You can feel it when you sit next to him.

742
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,079
That vibe was just too much for me.

743
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:35,614
It got to me.

744
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,316
Another thing was,

745
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:41,453
I went on the offensive too early.
That was another reason I lost.

746
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:43,889
I shouldn't have put on
this costume so early.

747
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,592
I had to go on the offensive.
If I just sat still,

748
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:50,329
they would have ganged up to attack me.

749
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,464
They were so sly.

750
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,767
Only one hour has passed?

751
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,636
-Only one hour?
-Only one-sixth.

752
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,138
Start.

753
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:01,507
Everyone cracked quite quickly.

754
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,476
Now that Jimmy is gone,
we'll see how things change.

755
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,645
-Pack this up.
-We've seen enough of it.

756
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,380
This is so...

757
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:12,918
It's like he really died.
He's dead on top of the big lucky flag.

758
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,722
Don't make your final farewells.

759
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:17,823
Say goodbye.

760
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,391
Ohchi.

761
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,426
Ohchi!

762
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:21,660
-Ohchi.
-Ohchi.

763
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:22,961
-Ohchi, Ohchi!
-Ohchi, Ohchi!

764
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,830
-He's not really dead.
-Touch him.

765
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,165
Just say goodbye.

766
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,268
-Touch him. He's super cold.
-I don't think we should touch him.

767
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,236
He's unbelievably cold. Touch him.

768
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,505
-Say goodbye.
-Then we can have sushi.

769
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,940
That's not a good idea.

770
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,909
Say goodbye, then have some sushi.

771
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,045
-This is not good.
-Ohchi, say goodbye!

772
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,181
This is your last chance!

773
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,583
Take a good look.

774
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,585
-Raise the cloth.
-Do it yourself.

775
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:49,188
Look. He's at peace now.

776
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,857
Look at this part, too.

777
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,293
There may be a message. Take a look.

778
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,029
Something may be written there.

779
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:58,864
Nothing there.

780
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:01,366
Good. Cover him up.

781
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,669
Next person.

782
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,838
I can't believe he's gone.

783
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:07,873
He really loved e-cigarettes.

784
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,609
-He loved baseball, too.
-He did.

785
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:14,613
Why is he smoking a bat?

786
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,153
That's sacrilege.

787
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,588
-You can't do that.
-Seriously.

788
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,122
That's going too far.

789
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:25,991
He'll become the undead.

790
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,894
-Stop it.
-You can't do that.

791
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:30,429
Master Daisuke hates the U.S.

792
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:33,599
-That's not funny.
-Make sure you never do that in America.

793
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,000
Play us a song.

794
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,102
Do, re, mi, fa...

795
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:38,904
Ohchi, look!

796
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,305
Ohchi, look.

797
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:43,709
Ohchi, look at him.

798
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,077
-Ohchi?
-Ohchi.

799
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,747
When you think about all the memories
we have...

800
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,016
-Take a look.
-Have some sushi, too.

801
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,652
-He played the melodeon.
-He smoked e-cigarettes.

802
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:58,056
-He loved smoking e-cigarettes.
-He loved smoking his melodeon, too.

803
00:35:58,524 --> 00:35:59,825
Master Daisuke!

804
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,894
Hanako misses you.

805
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:03,829
Oh, my goodness.

806
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:05,464
Come here, shithead.

807
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,699
-War broke out.
-Don't hurt me.

808
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:10,035
Stop putting the U.S. on him!

809
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,786
This is so sad.

810
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:30,422
-Kukky!
-Yes?

811
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,191
-Where are you?
-I'm putting on a jacket. I'm cold.

812
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:35,594
-You ran away from us.
-Is it cold?

813
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:38,630
-Aren't you guys cold?
-No.

814
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,898
It's not that cold.

815
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,502
Is wearing a jacket too much?

816
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,270
I think you should take it off.

817
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:46,905
Really?

818
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:53,011
I'm so cold.

819
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,488
That was a separate piece?

820
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,557
-What's "separate" mean?
-Detachable.

821
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:07,359
-It's unusual.
-Yeah, that hood.

822
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:09,461
-Hood? Is "Separate" a car?
-Ohchi.

823
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,264
Look at him.

824
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,733
-Want to wear this?
-Ohchi, look at him.

825
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,638
Ohchi!

826
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,006
Look!

827
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:25,377
-Look at him properly.
-I did. I looked at him.

828
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:35,487
What should I do about Ohchi?

829
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:39,224
-I hate being followed.
-I just want to smoke.

830
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:46,331
His testicles are twisted.
See, they're all twisted.

831
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:48,867
Ohchi.

832
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,037
Ohchi's getting close.

833
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,006
Please stop following me.

834
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,344
I'm going to take a shower.

835
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,047
It's hot.

836
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,323
-How about we all sit down?
-Okay.

837
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,724
-Let's sit for now.
-Okay.

838
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,726
-Let's settle down.
-Calm down for once.

839
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,064
This is so tough.

840
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,375
Oh, it's a male and a female.

841
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,179
We're missing someone.

842
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,248
-Where's Anthony?
-Still next to you.

843
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:38,950
Ohchi and Kawahara aren't here.

844
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,252
Sit down, everyone.

845
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:41,653
What are you doing?

846
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:46,658
Oh, no!

847
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,126
Oh, crap!

848
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,131
Does the school uniform make this
less funny?

849
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,733
I don't think that's the issue.

850
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,203
Whatever you wore, it wouldn't be...

851
00:38:58,537 --> 00:38:59,771
Just sit down.

852
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,573
Sit down.

853
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:06,812
Sit down.

854
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,680
Maybe it's less funny.

855
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:12,684
I passed a pro wrestling test
for the lucha libre in Mexico.

856
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:14,686
And today,

857
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:16,488
I brought a bunch of masks.

858
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:18,890
Would you mind looking at them?

859
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,727
I have some cool ones,
and some other ones.

860
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,830
-A whole variety.
-They all wear masks in Mexico.

861
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,998
-For pro wrestling?
-Lucha libre.

862
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,735
I want to show how great Mexico is.

863
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,369
That sounds nice.

864
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,971
I'll lighten things up a bit.

865
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:34,706
Lucha libre.

866
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,274
Lucha libre?

867
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,776
-Lucha libre.
-Lucha libre.

868
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,244
-Lucha.
-Lucha?

869
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:40,545
-Lucha.
-Lucha.

870
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,548
I have several hundred masks in my drawer.

871
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:47,018
Today I brought a dozen of the best.

872
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,920
Just wait and see.

873
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,389
Lucha is going to explode.

874
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,367
This is an old-style mask.

875
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,136
-Máscaras.
-I know that.

876
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:05,637
I've seen that one.

877
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,105
And?

878
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:08,573
They'll get funnier.

879
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:10,208
Should you be saying that?

880
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,377
-You're raising our expectations.
-It's okay.

881
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,446
-The next one's funnier.
-He sounds confident.

882
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:15,514
He looks fit.

883
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,983
-He's got a nice body.
-He must work out.

884
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:20,519
-He goes to the gym.
-Is that right?

885
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:24,089
He did practice some sport, right?

886
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,158
He actually does do pro wrestling.

887
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,194
-Are you ready for the next one?
-Sure.

888
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,430
He has hair now.

889
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:34,232
It's kind of cute.

890
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,368
That one looks like a clown.

891
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,703
-It's like a clown, right?
-With the nose and all.

892
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,541
When he jumps, the hair flaps up, right?
It makes him look dynamic.

893
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,543
Does your hair flap when you jump?

894
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:49,648
Maybe his role is to provide comic relief,
rather than big moves.

895
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,251
-Watch out!
-Ouch!

896
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,287
-Ouch!
-Are you okay?

897
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,889
-You killed the chair.
-It's dead.

898
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,090
Ow.

899
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:00,759
This is a serious accident.

900
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:03,295
Are they okay? Nobody's really injured?

901
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:04,796
Are you okay?

902
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,566
-That was dangerous.
-It's totally broken.

903
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,702
I've got more masks.
We don't want any injuries.

904
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,071
That was scary.

905
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,073
Is Fujimoto all right?

906
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,411
We have an expert.

907
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,279
Looking good.

908
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:23,849
-He's in the zone.
-Way to go.

909
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,451
You're pathetic.

910
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:28,153
Don't hurt yourself.

911
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:36,962
Ohchi?

912
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,396
Ohchi?

913
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:40,966
-What's wrong?
-Ohchi?

914
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,568
-What's going on?
-Nothing...

915
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:46,404
Picture in your mind what just happened.

916
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,608
-Are you ready?
-We lost a chair.

917
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:50,809
-Ready?
-Yes.

918
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,344
He fell down sideways.

919
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,247
One with hair again?

920
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,583
Did you add that yourself?

921
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:00,886
Did it really come like that?

922
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:02,787
He looks weak.

923
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:04,890
He does look weak.

924
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,426
You didn't add hair to look like
the wrestler who uses that mask?

925
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,761
This is how it came.

926
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,998
That was an amazing move you did before.

927
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:16,668
-Can you believe that?
-It was dangerous. There was a corner.

928
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,571
-I didn't know people fell sideways.
-Apparently they do.

929
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:22,507
Are you ready?

930
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:23,842
Okay.

931
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,722
You totally laughed.

932
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:39,291
It's too late now.

933
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,226
That's totally out.

934
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:44,329
There aren't many people who laugh
as easily as me.

935
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,665
That's how much I laugh.

936
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:51,436
I think I'm the only person who laughed
all the way through Forrest Gump.

937
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:57,275
-He's here.
-You laughed so hard.

938
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:00,211
I haven't even got a yellow card.

939
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:03,682
That's worth more than a yellow.
You belted out that laugh.

940
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,784
-It's a yellow card.
-Kukky...

941
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,186
Yellow card.

942
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,922
-Thank you so much.
-You're yellow for now.

943
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:12,891
-We get one chance each?
-I think so.

944
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,559
And Ohchi.

945
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:16,661
You're just slipping me an orange card?

946
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:20,398
I don't get any buzzers?
I'm just casually handed an orange card?

947
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:22,133
You've been smiling the whole time.

948
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,668
I've been patient with you.

949
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,071
-But I've been...
-You've been terrible.

950
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:29,407
Everyone keeps saying, "Ohchi, Ohchi!"

951
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:32,711
Sometimes, I laugh because
I know what they're capable of.

952
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:36,214
Whenever something happens,
I'll just try to be emotionally dead.

953
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,783
If I think about the person doing it,

954
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:39,985
I'll laugh in no time.

955
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,886
I can't do this.

956
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:44,522
When you focus on your offense,
your defense weakens.

957
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,124
-Exactly. I agree.
-Right?

958
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:48,560
-You become fragile.
-I'm in danger here.

959
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,629
I think I have to go on the offensive.

960
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,798
What color card did I get last time?

961
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:55,500
Was it orange?

962
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:57,669
Start!

963
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,005
-Yellow.
-Oh, it was yellow.

964
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:03,241
Shall we check who has what card?

965
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:04,809
-I'm orange.
-You're orange.

966
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,578
-I'm yellow.
-I'm yellow, too.

967
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,015
You don't have any.

968
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:12,150
-Not yet.
-Okay.

969
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,453
Anthony, Kubota,
and Kawahara are fine so far.

970
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:17,522
Scary.

971
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:20,125
What was that jacket all about?

972
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,360
-It gets cold and hot.
-No, it doesn't.

973
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,462
The AC has a problem.

974
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,164
You're the one with a problem.

975
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,699
Don't touch it. It's wet.

976
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:28,867
-Sweat?
-No, it's--

977
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,435
The problem is you.

978
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,003
There's tofu in here.

979
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:33,772
Wait.

980
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,809
What?

981
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:41,713
-Why did he laugh?
-What happened?

982
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:44,416
Damn!

983
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:48,720
-He was easy.
-What happened?

984
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,090
Damn it!

985
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:53,324
He totally laughed.

986
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,326
What's so funny about tofu?

987
00:44:55,627 --> 00:44:56,995
It wasn't that funny.

988
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,963
It was a weak jab at best.

989
00:44:59,164 --> 00:45:01,132
It was a super small jab of a joke.

990
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,333
Why did he laugh?

991
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:05,136
-No idea. He just said, "tofu."
-That's not all--

992
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,038
Show us what happened.

993
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:09,340
-What was it?
-It wasn't that funny.

994
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,443
-I didn't even realize.
-Reenact it for us.

995
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:15,980
-It's soaked in sweat.
-Yeah, it's wet.

996
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:18,316
That's not sweat. There's tofu in here.

997
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,118
He laughed again!

998
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:21,753
What?

999
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:22,754
Why?

1000
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:25,090
That's what finished you off?

1001
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:33,431
He let you go so many times.

1002
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,938
I still don't get it.

1003
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:43,908
-Was it some old inside joke?
-He uses "tofu" all time.

1004
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:47,011
-He uses tofu as a joke for everything.
-Now I get it.

1005
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:49,681
-It had built up.
-Over the years.

1006
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:50,815
All for today.

1007
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,151
And so when he said it today,

1008
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:55,653
I was ready to laugh.

1009
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:57,155
Good job.

1010
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,423
Good job.

1011
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:01,826
Damn it!

1012
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:04,062
-Good job!
-Time to go.

1013
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:06,931
At the 90-minute mark, you're gone.

1014
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,968
It's only been an hour and a half?

1015
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,970
Damn it!

1016
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:14,405
Why is he acting disappointed?

1017
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,375
What is there to regret
after laughing so much?

1018
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:20,979
-How can he be disappointed?
-He laughed the whole time.

1019
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:21,913
He did.

1020
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:24,349
It should be easy
to accept defeat after that.

1021
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:27,051
I was so sure I'd win today.

1022
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:29,020
-No chance.
-You always laugh.

1023
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:31,756
You spent more time smiling than not.

1024
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:33,424
You were cheerful the entire time.

1025
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:37,562
What was in your bag?

1026
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:38,997
Let us see.

1027
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,665
What was the best one?

1028
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:42,233
This bathrobe and...

1029
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:47,772
sunglasses.

1030
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,041
I wanted to wear these naked.

1031
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,310
-I might have laughed.
-Then what?

1032
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:54,345
What?

1033
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,848
What were you going to do?

1034
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:59,784
You were going to
say or do something, right?

1035
00:47:00,752 --> 00:47:02,320
No, I was just going to come out.

1036
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:05,957
Just come out?

1037
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:07,625
What shallow thinking.

1038
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:08,993
To be honest,

1039
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,062
I couldn't do anything at all.

1040
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:13,698
I have so many regrets!

1041
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:17,068
I lost because
I didn't go on the offensive.

1042
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:21,739
Trying to hold back your laughter
is the hardest thing to do.

1043
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,776
I laugh easily in everyday life.

1044
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:26,744
But I knew it.

1045
00:47:26,945 --> 00:47:29,314
I simply couldn't sit still.

1046
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:33,051
I had to either smoke,

1047
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:35,153
or drink water,

1048
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:37,589
or keep walking around.

1049
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:41,259
And Fujimoto kept talking.

1050
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:45,096
The moment I start to listen
to things like that,

1051
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:48,967
I can't help but laugh.

1052
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:53,404
Just remembering that makes me laugh.
I'm not meant for this show.

1053
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:58,276
That's still only two gone.

1054
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,312
Two people out in one hour and a half.

1055
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:03,915
-How's the pace?
-Pretty fast.

1056
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:07,018
-Several of us have no more chances.
-You're right.

1057
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:10,021
They are not allowed to laugh.

1058
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:15,093
But the prohibition of laughter seems
to contradict the creation of comedy.

1059
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:19,230
Why did you introduce that rule
for this show?

1060
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,966
It is a contradiction.
Comedy is a contradiction.

1061
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:23,768
It's two different sides of the same coin.

1062
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:28,439
For example,
there was a time in my life when

1063
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:32,377
I wanted to be the funniest man
on the planet.

1064
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:37,282
I put all my effort into it,
and tried my best to become that guy.

1065
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:39,317
But one day I realized,

1066
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:44,022
the least funny man in the world
is probably the funniest.

1067
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:49,560
So, no matter how hard I try,
I can only ever be second place.

1068
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,162
It hit me one day.

1069
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:54,766
Comedy is that kind of thing.

1070
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:59,470
Sometimes people laugh at
the worst possible moment.

1071
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:04,108
But when things like that happen,
that moment becomes comedy, too.

1072
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:07,211
-Show us your anus.
-Show us properly.

1073
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,018
Show us a bit more.

1074
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:24,662
Ready?
