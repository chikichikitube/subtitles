00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:18,519
THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES CONTENT THAT
MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

2
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:22,623
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:28,195
What kind of comedians do you think
are best suited to win Documental?

4
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,401
I think the answer to that question

5
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,370
will become a lot clearer this season.

6
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:42,610
I wasn't able to reach
a definite conclusion last season.

7
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:47,214
I'm still not sure, to be honest.

8
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,322
This is bad. Bad. Bad. Bad.

9
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,491
A monster has arrived.

10
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:02,897
Unfortunately, the more resourceful
comedians all have one thing in common.

11
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,199
They laugh easily.

12
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,470
This is a surprise.
Don't you all laugh too easily?

13
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,706
-He's right.
-How true. I'm a laugher.

14
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,008
I laugh so easily.

15
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,911
They have the same problem as boxers do.

16
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:20,714
Whenever they make an attack,
their guard drops.

17
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,852
The more moves they make,
the more they expose themselves to attack.

18
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,123
But if you don't mount an attack,
you won't land a punch.

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,025
That's the dilemma.

20
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,193
Who is it?

21
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,963
He's started already!

22
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,165
I'm not doing anything.

23
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,068
I'm not.
These are my normal clothes.

24
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:42,470
That's uncalled-for.

25
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,438
This time...

26
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,874
The time limit is six hours.

27
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,810
THE PLAYER WHO DOESN'T LAUGH
WINS 10 MILLION YEN

28
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:53,347
But if six hours have passed,
and we still have two or three people,

29
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,783
we'll implement the point system.

30
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,551
-What's that?
-Point system?

31
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,587
Over the next six hours,

32
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,723
the player who has accumulated
the most points becomes

33
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:04,925
the winner.

34
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,761
-This time we'll definitely have a winner.
-No draws?

35
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,730
IF THERE'S NO VICTOR AFTER SIX HOURS,

36
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,032
WHOEVER'S MADE THE OTHERS LAUGH
THE MOST WINS

37
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,934
So, be aggressive about getting laughs.

38
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,138
We will be recording who took out who.

39
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,310
These crackers are
a token of new friendship.

40
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,245
What are they?

41
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,647
-A token of new friendship.
-Why crackers?

42
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:28,582
-I'll go without.
-Crackers for friendship?

43
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,618
They make your mouth dry.

44
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,420
-Didn't you just laugh?
-I didn't.

45
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,522
The truth is...

46
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,091
That was quick.

47
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,360
That was probably Jimmy.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,028
I was just talking.

49
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,898
-The talking bit wasn't a problem.
-But you laughed, too.

50
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,432
You kept on smiling,

51
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,101
and then you went, "Ha ha ha."

52
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,235
That's laughing.

53
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:01,041
-We can use the bathroom, right?
-You're acting too restless.

54
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,010
Let's all take a seat, okay?

55
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,012
-It hasn't begun yet, right?
-Not yet.

56
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:05,946
We're still safe.

57
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,715
You're acting too restless, Saito.

58
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,584
This is your second time,
but it's nerve-wracking for us.

59
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,319
Let's all sit down first.

60
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,288
Okay, we're going to restart.

61
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,925
That's the cue. We're on again.

62
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,426
-We've restarted?
-Yes.

63
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,130
Everyone, sit down. Take a seat.

64
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,331
Yeah, let's sit down.

65
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:25,566
Sit down, Yoshimura.

66
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,968
-Let me put my bag away first.
-Fine. Go ahead.

67
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,169
-My bag...
-Ashtrays...

68
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,971
Do I need permission for everything?

69
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,306
No, it's just that...

70
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,041
Anybody need an ashtray?

71
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,910
-We don't need ashtrays.
-We're fine.

72
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,545
-It's smoke-free.
-No, it's not.

73
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,647
We can smoke here?

74
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,615
Well, this is kind of

75
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,117
nerve-wracking.

76
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,151
Shut up.

77
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,352
Why say that?

78
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,488
-Pass the crackers.
-Put them in the trash.

79
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,524
-No, pass them around.
-We should get this over and done with.

80
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,826
Pass them around. I'll finish it quickly.

81
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,995
-Let's all take a seat.
-Want to smoke?

82
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,332
Let him do the cracker thing.
Just get it over and done with.

83
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:02,102
-You're all talking too much.
-Things are so cluttered right now.

84
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,304
-It's too confusing.
-Let's settle down.

85
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,939
Let me explain the crackers.

86
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,541
We don't need an explanation.

87
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,475
Take a seat.

88
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,746
To my lost little lambs,

89
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,114
He's at it.

90
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,449
Little lambs?

91
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,684
Pray with me.

92
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:17,951
Amen.

93
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,421
Enough already.

94
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,689
The tenth month...

95
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,658
I mean, we have ten months to go...

96
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,327
Watch him do his thing.

97
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,762
Merry Christmas.

98
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,230
Merry Christmas.

99
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,366
It's time to light your crackers.

100
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,134
-Is that your joke?
-Yes.

101
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,703
Like a firecracker?

102
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,472
They don't make a bang,
so I'd like you to say, "Bang!"

103
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,342
The crackers don't make any bang sound
by themselves.

104
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:43,977
Bang...

105
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,814
-Is this your first time smoking?
-Yes.

106
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,649
-Listen, Jimmy.
-Yes?

107
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:52,252
This talk about crackers and firecrackers
is confusing.

108
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,388
It was a play on words, right?

109
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:55,689
Pack them up.

110
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,191
Put them away.

111
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:00,327
-Crackers and firecrackers?
-That was the joke. Sorry.

112
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,129
Isn't that too weak?

113
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,899
Well, you know. I'm...

114
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,468
-It's...
-Jimmy, stop.

115
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,769
Please take a seat.

116
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,537
You're bleeding.

117
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,539
Quit smoking! You're coughing!

118
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,607
Yeah...

119
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,676
Put it out. You've never smoked before.

120
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:16,877
Cut it out!

121
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,746
Can I get changed?

122
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,314
We told you to sit down!

123
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,582
But I want to change.

124
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,817
-There's no need to fight.
-What's wrong?

125
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,620
We all agreed it was getting
too noisy and confusing.

126
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,555
You guys, too...
Don't pick your nose!

127
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,090
Well...

128
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,925
-You're scary.
-Stop it, Kojima.

129
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,460
-Scary.
-That's not the point.

130
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,595
We all agreed...

131
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,629
Slow down.

132
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:39,032
But we all agreed to settle down.
Why has this become my fault?

133
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,568
Why are you worried now?
I always ignore you.

134
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:46,039
-Was that supposed to be funny?
-What's with you?

135
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,975
I'll never laugh at your reactions.

136
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,077
I won't laugh at them today either.

137
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,912
That's not what today's about.

138
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,148
It's not hard to keep a straight face
with you.

139
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,315
What does that mean?

140
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:56,984
-That means...
-We won't laugh.

141
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,420
To be honest, I haven't laughed at you
for the last three years.

142
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,688
The last three years?

143
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,557
Your act is one-dimensional.

144
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,093
You can't talk.
Your style is exactly the same.

145
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,129
-I noticed the likeness.
-What happens when they work together?

146
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,165
Yoshimura's act is similar, too.

147
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,433
-No, it's not.
-It is. We both yell a lot.

148
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,302
Stop it. Listen.

149
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,938
I was thinking that, as a way to start,

150
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:21,241
perhaps we could kick things off
by introducing ourselves.

151
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,178
I don't know the relationships
between you guys.

152
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,313
Maybe we should do something like that.

153
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,249
Is anyone meeting
Jimmy for the first time today?

154
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,052
I haven't met him before.

155
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,321
-I haven't either.
-Really?

156
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,589
It's my first time.

157
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,592
-We haven't met?
-It's practically my first time.

158
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,593
Really?

159
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,762
I've never seen him so close.

160
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,933
Look at him.

161
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,501
Look at him.

162
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,136
Yoshimura, don't be rude.

163
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,705
-He's your senior.
-He looks different up close.

164
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,641
-You'll never see him so close.
-No, thanks.

165
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,910
Yoshimura, face this way.
You're being rude.

166
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,446
-That isn't right.
-Yoshimura, you have to look.

167
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,716
You're not looking.

168
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,518
Look properly.

169
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,220
See how he bleeds?

170
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,888
It's his fault. Stop scratching!

171
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,590
Would you like a tissue?

172
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,692
No, thanks.

173
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,527
-Need a tissue?
-It's not bleeding.

174
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,797
Let's get self-introductions from
those who haven't met Jimmy before.

175
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,832
-Let me go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

176
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,902
-And I'll put my things in the locker.
-As you wish.

177
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,171
Today I want to learn how to smoke.

178
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,039
That's a cigar.

179
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,708
Just quit.

180
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,712
I went to my first cigar bar
the other day.

181
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,914
-A cigar bar?
-Yes.

182
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,549
It was so cool.

183
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,218
Which side are you supposed to light?

184
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,553
This one.

185
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,825
-You need to cut the end.
-Right, you cut this part.

186
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,126
Hot damn.

187
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,594
Hot damn?

188
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,834
That's your punchline?

189
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,104
Look at Fujimoto's face.

190
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,640
Fujimoto could be in trouble.

191
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,342
Does anyone want to drink this?

192
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,278
What is that?

193
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,713
Well...

194
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,315
What is it, Oshima?

195
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,117
Oshima is in trouble, too.

196
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,586
She is always putting something
in her mouth.

197
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,087
It's my breast milk.

198
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:15,923
For real?

199
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,526
-You're joking, right?
-I'm serious.

200
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,228
-That's real breast milk?
-Yes.

201
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,196
-Oshima...
-It's your milk?

202
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,599
-If your son knew, he'd cry.
-Is he an infant?

203
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:29,102
He's one year and eight months-old now,
but I still have milk.

204
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,103
Really?

205
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,205
That milk belongs to her baby, Efu.

206
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,878
What's she doing?

207
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,347
That milk was for Efu, but now he's like,

208
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,581
"Mama..."

209
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,184
-Have you ever drunk breast milk?
-No.

210
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,954
-Can I try some?
-For real?

211
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,889
Why not? You look like a baby.

212
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:49,957
Can I?

213
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,393
-Drink the breast milk.
-You don't mind?

214
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:54,761
Go for it.

215
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,130
You're amazing.

216
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,132
When else could I drink breast milk?

217
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,802
-You're amazing.
-Breast milk is good for you, too.

218
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,036
That's human milk.

219
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,806
-She's...
-Let me drink the breast milk!

220
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,576
-She's your junior.
-Is it really okay?

221
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:10,978
-Here goes.
-Okay.

222
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,045
From here?

223
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,380
Where else?

224
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,749
Don't get angry. I'll drink it.

225
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,420
How is it?

226
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:21,655
It's delicious.

227
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,490
-It's delicious?
-It's delicious.

228
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:24,424
Is it sweet?

229
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,426
-Delicious?
-Her breast milk is.

230
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,561
No way.

231
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,930
Jimmy, you look like you really want some.

232
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,131
Me?

233
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,967
-Jimmy.
-No, I'm...

234
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,936
You're undressing her with your eyes.

235
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,339
-I'm not. No way.
-But, if that's the case...

236
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,641
-You have unique tastes.
-No, I don't.

237
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,776
What fetish is that?

238
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,544
-It's not true.
-Shame on you.

239
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm not into that, but...

240
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,648
I thought he's amazing.

241
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,018
Drink up. It's yours. Really.

242
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,787
-I can't drink all of it.
-Jimmy...

243
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,624
We've never had a chance to meet
like this before, so...

244
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,226
Please, take this.

245
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,096
-What did she give you?
-What is it?

246
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,198
-What did you get?
-What is it?

247
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,401
Jimmy, what did you get?

248
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,504
-Jimmy, answer us.
-Look at it.

249
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,272
No, no, no.

250
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:13,807
Look at it, Jimmy.

251
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,009
I don't know why, but...

252
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,247
She gave it to you.

253
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,249
What is that?

254
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,184
What is that?

255
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,852
Jimmy, take a proper look.

256
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,789
Jimmy, look at what she gave you.
You have to look at it.

257
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,023
Seriously, what is it?

258
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,858
For some reason I got panties.

259
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,162
-They're huge.
-Are those Oshima's?

260
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,231
Aren't they huge?

261
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,634
-Her real panties?
-I guess so.

262
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,568
They are.

263
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:42,969
-Really?
-Yes.

264
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,072
-You wear pants like this?
-They're faded.

265
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,407
-The back looks clean.
-They're falling apart.

266
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,109
Did you play baseball in them?

267
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,344
They're covered in fuzz.

268
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,146
You definitely played baseball in them.

269
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,549
Wow.

270
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,285
You're laughing.

271
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,655
-You exploded into laughter.
-But who's out?

272
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,024
That will be a hard one to judge.

273
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,165
Oshima.

274
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,701
-You get a yellow card.
-Yes.

275
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:15,735
I know.

276
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,338
And you're always eating something,
aren't you?

277
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,075
-She's hiding her smile there, right?
-Yeah.

278
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,777
-That's cheating.
-It's not fair.

279
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,679
-We can't do that.
-It's not nice.

280
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,013
You can't do that.

281
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,248
Sorry.

282
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,983
Let's take another look.

283
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,320
-You wear pants like this?
-They're faded.

284
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,689
-The back looks clean.
-They're falling apart.

285
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,324
Did you play baseball in them?

286
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,559
They're covered in fuzz.

287
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,561
You definitely played baseball in them.

288
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,532
Well, I hadn't seen that angle.

289
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,267
He's laughing.

290
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,469
Jimmy's laughing right there.

291
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:50,737
No, I'm not.

292
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,207
-He laughed.
-Yes, he definitely did.

293
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,009
So Jimmy, you get

294
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,244
a yellow card.

295
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,112
-Bad luck.
-Yellow already?

296
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,547
You're in trouble.

297
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,049
But shouldn't Oshima get a yellow card,
too?

298
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,484
We already said that.

299
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,652
Yes, I laughed.

300
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,854
And Fujimoto is constantly...

301
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,256
How can I put it?

302
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,624
You're right.

303
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,292
I'm sorry!

304
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,860
What was that?

305
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,531
-What's so funny?
-What's with that apology?

306
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,066
-I'm counting on you.
-Thank you!

307
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,141
Restart.

308
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,945
We should put these away.

309
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,447
-There are no stains. Amazing.
-Put them away.

310
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,383
-But they're warped.
-They have fuzz.

311
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,817
-We should...
-Put them away.

312
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:38,919
Do they smell?

313
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,654
-Just put them away.
-Yeah, now.

314
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,123
But they really smell clean.

315
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,926
-She does her laundry. So what?
-That's enough.

316
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,794
-They're her white panties.
-Guys.

317
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,362
Is my ear bleeding?

318
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,830
-We said that before.
-Right?

319
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,300
-I offered you a tissue.
-All I need is this.

320
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,769
Kimchi?
He put that on standby ages ago.

321
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,137
Where am I bleeding?

322
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,205
Here?

323
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,473
-There.
-Don't do that!

324
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:01,675
That will hurt!

325
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,477
Kimchi stops the itchy!

326
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,080
That was a very high-brow joke.

327
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,850
You like puns, don't you?

328
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,452
I love them.

329
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,853
It started to sting.

330
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,822
-It hurts.
-You should wipe it off.

331
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,892
-It hurts a lot.
-First the cracker joke, now kimchi?

332
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,561
-Doesn't it hurt?
-It hurts. It hurts.

333
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,830
-Enough with the kimchi.
-Let me wipe it.

334
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,699
Don't use them! Stop it.

335
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,167
You can't use them.

336
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,502
Poor Oshima.
You ruined her panties.

337
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,004
Look at her.

338
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,539
Guys, I think...

339
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,441
-Wait a minute.
-What's with Oshima?

340
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,876
-That wasn't right.
-I think you went too far.

341
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:37,911
Oshima?

342
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,746
-Oshima!
-She's a lady, you know?

343
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,249
I'm sorry.

344
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,050
They're ruined.

345
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,319
My panties...

346
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:47,988
My dear panties...

347
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,323
You don't have kids.
You wouldn't understand.

348
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,792
-I treasured those panties so much.
-Right?

349
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,228
She probably wore these
when she was pregnant.

350
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,163
You don't get it. You don't have kids.

351
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,999
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

352
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,468
Those pants were so dear to me.

353
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,939
Fujimoto,
there's no need for you to wash them.

354
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,541
Fujimoto, why are you going that far?

355
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,444
Why did you wipe Jimmy's kimchi?

356
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,113
You don't need to cry that much.

357
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,582
You don't have kids.
You'd never understand.

358
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,917
-Does she have to cry?
-What happened?

359
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,353
Jimmy got kimchi on his face.

360
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,721
Saito wiped it off.

361
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,590
And you did it with my panties.

362
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,358
But he wouldn't use a tissue.

363
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,961
Guys. Stop. You simply don't get it.

364
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,263
I know what pregnant women are like.

365
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,898
These panties...

366
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,634
They remind her of when she was pregnant.

367
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,369
He's drinking her breast milk.

368
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,406
-Those panties are full of memories.
-Memory full panties?

369
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,007
Are they "memo-panties"?

370
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,676
They're "memo-panties."

371
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,044
Yoshimura?

372
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,213
She probably shouldn't have
brought them today, but...

373
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,249
-Yoshimura drank all of it?
-Yes, I did.

374
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,418
-Thanks.
-He drank all of your breast milk.

375
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,719
Thank you.

376
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,988
-Oshima, I'm sorry.
-It was delicious.

377
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,590
-The stain's coming out.
-From her memo-panties?

378
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,393
That's a bit much.

379
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,595
-That's not necessary.
-She'll cry again.

380
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,431
It's a tough stain.

381
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,032
Be careful with them.

382
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,600
You have dish soap on you.

383
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,768
That's... No.

384
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,105
Anyway, you're crying too much.

385
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,173
Oshima.

386
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,342
It's not that big a deal.

387
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,977
Yes! More. More. Go for it!

388
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,379
My memo-panties.

389
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,247
-Memo-panties?
-Beat them more.

390
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,116
Memo-panties require more care.

391
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,684
I'm using all my might.

392
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,386
Exactly.

393
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,528
Tell me if you see anyone laughing.

394
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,097
You laughed. You're gone.

395
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,631
You laughed, didn't you?

396
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,033
Not me.

397
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,402
Fujimoto, you should try harder.

398
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,205
What are you doing?

399
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,107
What purpose is that fulfilling?

400
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,408
Don't nod at us.

401
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,610
What?

402
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,780
I have to use my teeth.

403
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,548
I have to grind it.

404
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,951
Otherwise, the kimchi won't come out.

405
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,653
You wear a wedding ring and
you're biting panties?

406
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,756
They belong to the wife of another man.

407
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:06,292
-She's watching you do that.
-Stop sucking on people's panties.

408
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,529
She's my senior.
I never wanted to see a senior so sad.

409
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,498
Look at her.

410
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,032
Look how sad she is.

411
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,135
Someone's making a move.

412
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,403
So...

413
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,405
Let's end this!

414
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:20,440
RIght now!

415
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,176
-They're super-stretched now.
-They're clean enough.

416
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,145
I'm sorry!

417
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:29,883
I'm...

418
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:31,351
Kimc...

419
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,427
Jimmy...

420
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,429
-You're laughing.
-He is.

421
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,264
-You're laughing.
-No, I'm not.

422
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,232
-But you are.
-Take that off.

423
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,700
Kotouge, take it from him.

424
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:49,436
-You're laughing.
-I'm not.

425
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,537
I'm not.

426
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,406
You've seriously been washing
those panties for too long!

427
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:55,909
They're clean.

428
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,212
-What was that?
-Let's pour vinegar on them.

429
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,246
Vinegar!

430
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,714
-Hey.
-Don't do that.

431
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,284
-Vinegar should work.
-She'll cry again.

432
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:05,885
Just pour vinegar on it.

433
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,456
How dare you pour vinegar on my panties?

434
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,424
Because he was taking too long.

435
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,227
-This is too much!
-It's my fault for using them.

436
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,163
-This is too much!
-I wiped the kimchi with the panties.

437
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,933
-But vinegar can clean them faster.
-It's all over.

438
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,135
Jimmy, stop it.
That's not funny at all.

439
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,770
-It's all over.
-Vinegar will...

440
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,071
Jimmy, stop it.

441
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,806
Oshima, you're crying too much.

442
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,942
They're clean now.

443
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,544
-No more kimchi.
-You've cried enough.

444
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,812
I washed out the kimchi.

445
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,014
Take a look. They're clean.

446
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,816
-They're okay.
-Now we'll dry them.

447
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,284
They are super-stretched.

448
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,620
-That's not a hanger.
-Hanger...

449
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:41,955
Hanger.

450
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:45,191
Hanger.

451
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:52,065
I'm going to... I'm sorry.
My priest act didn't work at all today.

452
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,235
No one laughed at my priest outfit.

453
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:59,539
Well, that's only because
you were dressed like that from the start.

454
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,541
Are there any hangers?

455
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:02,809
I'll quit being a priest.

456
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,646
Everyone, look.
He's going to quit being a priest.

457
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,181
I'm quitting this priest act.

458
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,550
-Watch him.
-I'm quitting priesthood.

459
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,518
Good idea.

460
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,855
-You're laughing.
-I'm not. Stop that.

461
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,163
Huh? What is that?

462
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,265
What is it?

463
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,766
I'm done for.

464
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,770
-What is that?
-I have no idea.

465
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,172
-What is it?
-It stinks!

466
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,175
It stinks!

467
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,844
-What is that smell?
-Konnyaku.

468
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,913
Elephant yam jelly?
It stinks!

469
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,314
But what is it?

470
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,483
What is that supposed to be?
Seriously.

471
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,119
-I quit the priest.
-You're poking out on the sides.

472
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,487
Because the priest bombed.

473
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,459
That was...

474
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,828
He has the full spectrum of comedy.

475
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,898
-From puns to this.
-Help us understand.

476
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,233
What is it?

477
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,969
Why did he make whatever that is?

478
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,204
That's unfair. It's too much.

479
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,341
-Himura.
-Me?

480
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,710
I only laughed after him.

481
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,879
-You laughed before, too.
-You did.

482
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,381
You were laughing about the panties.

483
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,717
Himura laughed so hard
when I did the panties.

484
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,820
No way.
Daisuke has been laughing the whole time.

485
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,622
I heard you go "kyu kyu kyu."

486
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,123
You went "kyu kyu kyu."

487
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,224
Seriously.

488
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,060
No way. This is wrong.

489
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,832
Everyone, look.
He's going to quit being a priest.

490
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,367
I'm quitting this priest act.

491
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,236
-Watch him.
-I'm quitting priesthood.

492
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,137
Good idea.

493
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,542
-You're laughing.
-I'm not. Stop that.

494
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,614
See?

495
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,115
-Who is it?
-Himura.

496
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:50,950
-That's definitely out.
-I told you.

497
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:52,318
Himura did laugh.

498
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,721
-Himura laughed.
-But look at Daisuke now!

499
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,122
When he looks down!

500
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,626
-I think that's safe.
-But he really did laugh.

501
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,463
And I only saw Daisuke laugh
after the red light.

502
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:07,333
Daisuke, did you think his yam-jelly dick
was funny?

503
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,502
Yes. It was extremely funny.

504
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,640
But it stinks.
It really smells bad.

505
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,341
Please take a few steps back.

506
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:16,643
What is it?

507
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,244
What's that supposed to mean?

508
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,612
It's konnyaku.

509
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,114
I can see that.

510
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:24,450
Why did you dig out the middle
and sew another piece inside?

511
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:27,787
I used kite string to sew
konnyaku to more konnyaku.

512
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:29,589
You're not making sense.

513
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,258
Imagine him making that at home.
That's what's funny.

514
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:33,593
Jimmy, wear some clothes.

515
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,228
-Wait.
-We can see too much.

516
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,730
-But I'm...
-That rash is gross, too.

517
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,165
I'm done with the priest.

518
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,003
Restart.

519
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:46,973
-You stink.
-That's really bad.

520
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,641
That really smells, Jimmy.

521
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,710
We can see everything from the side.

522
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:51,778
I don't mind.

523
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,746
You had four BCG vaccinations.

524
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:55,348
You shaved?

525
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,550
He did.
We really can see everything.

526
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,619
You really shaved all your hair.

527
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,256
If we keep having fun with Jimmy
we'll be stuck on him forever.

528
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,925
-Tuck it away properly.
-Let's all just ignore him.

529
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,394
-His privates are...
-Tuck them properly.

530
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,163
Ouch!

531
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,631
That was hot!

532
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:13,700
That was hot.

533
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,667
That was hot.

534
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,470
-That was hot?
-Don't you mean, "That hurts"?

535
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,338
We say, "It hurts."

536
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,606
Was it hot?

537
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,109
You said, "Hot."

538
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,211
It definitely wasn't hot.

539
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,779
Right, Daisuke?

540
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,581
It can't be hot.

541
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,717
No way was it hot.

542
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,685
What's wrong?

543
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,822
He's laughing.

544
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,024
Mr. Matsumoto!

545
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,101
No way. That was safe.

546
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,302
Why?

547
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:50,937
You were laughing.

548
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,872
-You can't complain.
-What was hot?

549
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,308
-I scored that one.
-That was quick.

550
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,110
Too quick.

551
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,947
You were too quick.
I don't want to keep coming out like this.

552
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,548
-We're sorry.
-You're right.

553
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,884
But someone laughed.

554
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:07,787
Daisuke.

555
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,490
-It was a brave fight.
-But you laughed.

556
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,593
But, before I started cracking up...

557
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,496
Before I started to lose it,
Himura had already laughed.

558
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,398
That's not true.
When Jimmy said "hot" you went "puh."

559
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:20,600
You went "puh."

560
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,335
-Himura is right.
-You did.

561
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,804
What's your problem?
You were on the other side.

562
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:27,473
But because he stopped
on the verge of laughing more,

563
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,575
I asked Jimmy what he meant by "hot."

564
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,612
-His privates are...
-Tuck them properly.

565
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:34,347
Ouch!

566
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:35,915
That was hot!

567
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,683
That was hot.

568
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,951
That was hot.

569
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:41,754
-That was hot?
-Don't you mean, "That hurts"?

570
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,690
-Look at him.
-He should've been out then.

571
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:47,794
-But I didn't show any teeth.
-To be honest, that's...

572
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,329
Did you see Jimmy?

573
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,565
Jimmy...

574
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:58,671
Jimmy was laughing, too.

575
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:03,676
That's out.

576
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,515
The cameras didn't quite get Himura.

577
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:10,516
I wasn't laughing.

578
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,052
-I was busy explaining.
-Right?

579
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,488
I explained how Jimmy
was wrong to say "hot."

580
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,291
-Okay. I got it.
-That's it.

581
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,159
Nice decision.

582
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:24,063
-Why did you say that?
-You laughed too hard that time.

583
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,598
But what about before?

584
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:27,700
-I'm counting on you guys.
-Thank you!

585
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,936
-Don't make me so busy.
-Sorry.

586
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,205
We laugh too easily.

587
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,106
You're allergic to something.

588
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,076
Jimmy, put on some clothes.

589
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,147
Yoshimura always hides his face.

590
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:42,849
-No, I don't.
-That's not fair.

591
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,250
And Jimmy, back then...

592
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:47,720
We should stop eating and drinking
when we're about to laugh.

593
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:48,721
You're right.

594
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,457
-Let this be an honorable battle.
-I agree.

595
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:52,458
Restart.

596
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:55,761
Let's change the subject.

597
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,330
Jimmy, are you changing?

598
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,165
Will you cook something?

599
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:01,067
No, I'm going Chinese.

600
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,135
Going Chinese?

601
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,272
-You look more "Italian."
-Put on some pants, please.

602
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,607
I'm going Chinese.

603
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,408
Your top is fine.
Cover your bottom.

604
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:13,346
I think we should stop focusing
on Jimmy so much.

605
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,815
Definitely.
But it's all your fault, Fujimoto.

606
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:19,151
-Don't blame me.
-You always put the spotlight on Jimmy.

607
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,354
Fine. I'll put on some pants.

608
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,389
Stop doing that, please.

609
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:25,825
-I'll put on pants.
-Let's enjoy this.

610
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:28,694
Kojima hasn't been funny yet.

611
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,062
What does that mean?

612
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,999
-Talk like that leads to fights.
-He's right.

613
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,202
-You need to make a move.
-We're avoiding fights.

614
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:37,603
You never make a move.

615
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,639
Big words.

616
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,175
If that's how you're going to be.

617
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:44,744
Hey.

618
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:46,879
-Going somewhere?
-Home, perhaps?

619
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:47,880
Move it!

620
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,615
You know where I'm going.

621
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,618
-Are you going home?
-Of course not.

622
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:54,153
See you next time.

623
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,988
I'm not leaving. Why leave now?

624
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,057
Give me a good "I'm Kojima!"

625
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,026
"I'm Kojima!"

626
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,827
-No.
-I really want one.

627
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,462
We haven't heard it yet.

628
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:05,498
I'm Kojima!

629
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,465
Me, too!

630
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:07,600
No, you're not!

631
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,068
What a day!

632
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,069
Shut up!

633
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:12,838
Hm?

634
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:15,107
What are you doing to my gag?

635
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:18,911
You're right.

636
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,682
That's not how it's done.
Pay more attention to the set-up.

637
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,750
Idiot! Why kiss me?

638
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,619
What sort of joke is that?

639
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,188
Why kiss me?

640
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:30,323
I'm sorry!

641
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,993
What is with that apology?

642
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,828
You keep saying it.
"I'm sorry."

643
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,597
Stop it!

644
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:41,734
That feels good.

645
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,569
That feels good.

646
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:45,004
-Stop it.
-He's a senior.

647
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,605
-You're turning me on.
-Shut up!

648
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,807
-Saito.
-Stop it.

649
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:49,008
He's your senior.

650
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,276
You're turning me on!

651
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:51,210
Your tongue!

652
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,579
Saito, licking is going too far.

653
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,514
Stop doing that, Saito.

654
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,416
That feels good.

655
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,652
Stop it. I'm getting worked up.

656
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:01,787
Stop. It feels good.

657
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,290
Don't look at me while you do it.

658
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,392
Stop watching me.

659
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,094
That feels too good.

660
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:09,829
Saito.

661
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,597
We don't need that.

662
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,299
That's the right spot.

663
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,035
-That's enough.
-That's not why we're here.

664
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:19,839
-It's Jimmy's fault, too.
-Don't spit.

665
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,040
Quit that.

666
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,375
That's messed up.

667
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,143
That's messed up.

668
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,146
This is a baseball field.

669
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,515
Huh? What did he say?

670
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:32,218
-This is a baseball field.
-Baseball field?

671
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,220
Don't you mean "battlefield"?

672
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,921
Some people call it that, too.

673
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,157
Baseball field?
You think this is baseball?

674
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:44,363
-He said baseball field.
-He meant battlefield.

675
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,037
Watch his thing, Tsuda.

676
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,742
Everyone, come watch his thing.
But who's that?

677
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:57,843
Where are you going?

678
00:27:57,977 --> 00:28:00,012
Who just left? That's not fair.

679
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,514
You can't just leave.

680
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:04,917
-It's Saito. Come back in here.
-I have a question.

681
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:08,454
Firstly, why did Kotouge leave
when I started to prepare this?

682
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:11,690
When we do something,
the unwritten rules say we watch.

683
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,259
-Who are you?
-I'm Kojima!

684
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:14,360
-Me, too!
-Listen.

685
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,028
-What a day!
-Listen to me!

686
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,501
You're screwing up my gag.

687
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:25,938
You have to mistake my name...
I'm doing something!

688
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,306
Something showed up.

689
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,010
Something showed up.

690
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:32,611
It's creepy.

691
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:33,846
Kotouge!

692
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:38,584
Wait.

693
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,494
You totally screwed up my gag.

694
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,529
I apologize for that.

695
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:52,998
What's wrong?

696
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,001
When I saw the breast milk,
I said he looks like a baby.

697
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:59,738
-I didn't know he'd prepared this.
-Me, too. I'm sorry.

698
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,410
-It's my bad. It was my breast milk.
-No, I'm the one who ruined his joke.

699
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,612
You won't laugh now,
but I'll do it anyway.

700
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,514
Shove it in my face!

701
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:10,749
What a day!

702
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,457
-That's scary.
-It's not scary.

703
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:20,626
-It's noisy.
-It's not noisy.

704
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,761
I don't want to suck it now.

705
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:23,762
No breasts.

706
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,931
I don't want to suck it now!

707
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,807
-The jokes got into a traffic jam there.
-They did.

708
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:36,075
Yes, sorry about that.

709
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,443
Let's sit down.

710
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,978
Jimmy, how did that thing go?

711
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,380
You know.

712
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,782
With your phone.

713
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,818
You watched too much porn.

714
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,554
They sent you a huge bill, right?

715
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:49,588
It worked out.

716
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:50,923
How much was it?

717
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,591
400,000 yen.

718
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:56,195
That's a lot.

719
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:57,897
400,000 yen?

720
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,466
-What did you watch?
-You got shafted.

721
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:01,834
400,000?

722
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:03,536
A sumo wrestler.

723
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:05,070
-You got changed?
-Yes.

724
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,957
Weren't you about to do something funny
with that wood drum?

725
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,826
-Good point.
-You just whacked it loudly. It was scary.

726
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,963
-What's it for?
-Well, I didn't plan anything special.

727
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,465
-You just wanted to thump it?
-No, well...

728
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:37,836
I actually used one of these
the very first time I went on stage.

729
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,838
Show us what your first act was like.

730
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,073
Don't you want to see?

731
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,042
-I want to see.
-I want to see.

732
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:44,443
Do it.

733
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,578
No.

734
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,348
Why won't you do it?

735
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,686
It's embarrassing.

736
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,589
Okay. Just show us a short version.

737
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,390
It wasn't long to begin with.

738
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,659
Do it.

739
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:04,196
-His first ever act?
-I'd like to see that.

740
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,131
-Do it.
-I don't want to!

741
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:07,266
Make it short.

742
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:08,467
It is short!

743
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,637
The long version will do.

744
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:12,972
I said it's short.

745
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,006
An un-long version.

746
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,441
That would be short, too.

747
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:17,843
A super-long version.

748
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:19,545
That's short, too.

749
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:21,280
-Semi-long?
-What does that mean?

750
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:22,748
Don't complicate things.

751
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:24,650
Super-long isn't short.

752
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,518
Doesn't matter.
It's all about tempo.

753
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,288
Do your act.

754
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,457
Do your act. We want to see it.

755
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:32,992
I've never seen you solo.

756
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,327
You went to the trouble of
bringing that here.

757
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:36,462
The thing is...

758
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:39,031
It's very different
from what I do with Anjash.

759
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:40,466
We don't need excuses.

760
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:41,767
Why not!

761
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,403
What a day!

762
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:47,740
What?

763
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:53,445
"What a day!"

764
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,015
That's the title
of my ex-girlfriend's porno.

765
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,185
By KING.

766
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,988
That's the title of my ex-girlfriend's
second porno.

767
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,057
Look at Oshima.

768
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,662
I'm coming all over.

769
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,697
That's the third. You know them all.

770
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,433
You know the titles
of all my ex-girlfriend's pornos.

771
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:15,668
Anri.

772
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,303
Yeah, that's her name.

773
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,005
Cat's Eye.

774
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:21,707
That's a different Anri.

775
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,110
How many jokes do you have about my ex?

776
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,112
-Kisarazu...
-That's another Cat's Eye.

777
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:30,349
Dog nose.

778
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,652
"Dog nose"?

779
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:38,324
"Dog nose"?

780
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:40,092
Cat's Eye...

781
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:46,131
-Dog nose? I get it.
-That's a little far off.

782
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,200
Think of another one.

783
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:49,568
"Cat's eye."

784
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,070
"Dog nose."

785
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,438
Add one more.

786
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:55,974
Strawberry candy.

787
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,447
"Strawberry candy"?

788
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,117
What did he say?

789
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,986
"Strawberry candy."
That's not a wordplay on anything.

790
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:09,855
-Strawberry?
-"Strawberry candy."

791
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:12,024
Where did "strawberry candy" come from?

792
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,459
How long is your career?

793
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,928
Forty years.

794
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:17,329
Forty years?

795
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:18,764
You're scratching too much.

796
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,300
We'll see your brain soon.

797
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,102
-Unless you stop.
-That's too much.

798
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,470
You're already going bald.

799
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,905
-We'll see your brain.
-Don't get excited.

800
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,275
Hold on. I built up too much earwax.

801
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,711
-You built up too much earwax?
-I did. Sorry.

802
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,317
-Kojima secretly hid his drum.
-Don't tell everyone.

803
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:41,687
-Kojima's trying to hide his drum.
-Don't put it back on the table.

804
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:42,988
Let's see your solo act.

805
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:45,657
My solo act?
It's really not worth watching.

806
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:49,061
Are you saying you only brought that
to scare us by whacking it?

807
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:52,364
All it did was interrupt us.
Every time someone made a move.

808
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:53,599
When do you hit it?

809
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,234
If it's just for hitting.

810
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,803
This is just my image, okay?
My image.

811
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:00,672
What do you mean by that?

812
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,709
-I'll give you a cue.
-He'll say something for you to thump.

813
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:06,211
Try calling me "Oshima."
This is just an example.

814
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:07,312
Hey, Oshima.

815
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,380
I'm Kojima!

816
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,419
Do you follow me?

817
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,120
That's the full package?

818
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,089
-Is that all?
-You're wasting the drum.

819
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:18,791
No, I repeat this over and over.

820
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:25,297
-You'll do that over and over again?
-Right!

821
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,833
There was no reason for that.

822
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,234
There was no joke.

823
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:30,803
Don't you need a joke?

824
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:32,571
The rules are unclear!

825
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,411
Yo!

826
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,747
Jimmy, why wash your hands now?

827
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,751
They got covered in Tique
when I rinsed my hair.

828
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,254
-Chick?
-Cheek? He got covered in cheek?

829
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,624
-Cheek? Is that a dialect?
-Tique is...

830
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,060
It's a brand of pomade, right?

831
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,463
-Cheek?
-Tique.

832
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:58,764
It's like wax.

833
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:01,667
-Yeah. It's an old brand.
-You use Tique?

834
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,901
Don't hide it.

835
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:04,369
We noticed.

836
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,271
It's too big not to notice.

837
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,707
I've never seen a wooden drum
get so few laughs.

838
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:13,145
I've never seen someone use a wooden drum
and get as few laughs as you.

839
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:14,580
But he's that type of guy.

840
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,715
Not many people use wooden drums anyway.

841
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,917
But if we played one,
we'd get more laughs.

842
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:21,453
There's a wooden drum
standing right next to you.

843
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,556
You could play Kotouge a lot better.

844
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:27,392
-Play that other drum.
-He's not a drum.

845
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:28,894
Ow!

846
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:31,263
That hurt!

847
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:33,532
That hurt!

848
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:35,634
That hurt!

849
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,207
Who was it?

850
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:43,842
Who was that?

851
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,011
It wasn't me.

852
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:48,113
-I didn't laugh.
-It wasn't me.

853
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:49,915
That had to hurt.

854
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,783
-That's painful.
-Poor guy.

855
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,187
-You hit him so hard.
-Couldn't you predict that outcome?

856
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:58,624
People end up with fractured skulls
when you hit them that hard.

857
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,459
I might be out.

858
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,064
Oshima.

859
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:09,201
-Oshima laughed? Really?
-No way.

860
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:11,503
I'll give you an orange card.

861
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,740
-That was me?
-This is your last chance.

862
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:19,645
-Play that other drum.
-He's not a drum.

863
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,146
Ow!

864
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,348
That hurt!

865
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,517
That hurt!

866
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:29,254
You're laughing! That's a laugh.

867
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:33,325
You were all smiles.
Just like you were a pin-up girl.

868
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:37,329
You had a nice smile.
Like in a three-page full-color feature.

869
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,969
There's a bump. He has a bump already.

870
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:45,938
-It's a dent, actually.
-Yeah!

871
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:47,372
-Yeah!
-He's dented.

872
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,575
If he was a kid, he'd be dead.

873
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:51,376
-I'm sorry.
-I'm fine.

874
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,544
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

875
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:53,845
You really thumped him.

876
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,818
-I'll have to forget about that one.
-It's only been an hour.

877
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:01,920
Are any of you hungry?

878
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,489
-It's only been an hour.
-Will you make something?

879
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,657
I feel like something.

880
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,025
Only one hour?

881
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,027
Something would be nice.

882
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,295
Or is it too early?

883
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:13,632
Okay, here we go. Restart.

884
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:22,608
Who wants to eat?

885
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:23,842
We have sashimi.

886
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,044
Just like last time.

887
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,613
Jimmy, do you want some?

888
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,182
-You can have all of it.
-No, I don't like sashimi.

889
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,516
What a hit.

890
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,385
-How bad did it hurt?
-I'm sorry.

891
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:35,520
He caught me by surprise.
I went stiff.

892
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,855
Won't you guys eat?

893
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,557
This isn't the time for sashimi.

894
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,792
I don't need sashimi now.

895
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,661
How about bread? We have baguettes.

896
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,596
-We have rice.
-I'll bring it.

897
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,931
I think...

898
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:48,367
Before we eat, you should do your thing.

899
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,736
-As punishment for that hit.
-Yeah.

900
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:53,138
-It won't end otherwise.
-I don't mind, but...

901
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:54,373
What kind of act is it?

902
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,541
It's a short skit. It's one I do solo.

903
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,744
-Have you forgotten it?
-Not at all.

904
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,679
It's really short.

905
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:01,947
We don't mind.

906
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,686
-You're going to do it?
-Sure.

907
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,055
Of course, I don't want to.

908
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,966
It's called
Stories Too Suspicious to Believe.

909
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,870
"I heard this from
the friend of a friend..."

910
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,085
My old routines were all like that.

911
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:43,221
What did it even mean?
That was too difficult.

912
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:45,524
-Your old routines were like what?
-Okay...

913
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,792
What did that mean?

914
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,327
Try doing the whole thing,
until the punch line.

915
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:51,463
Don't explain how it works.
Just do it.

916
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,499
-It doesn't have to be perfect.
-Just show us.

917
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,735
Wait. I'm so nervous, I forgot it.

918
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,272
You forgot it?

919
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,774
-That killed it.
-Sorry.

920
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,943
-What did you heat up?
-Huh?

921
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:06,311
What did you heat up?

922
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:07,979
Strawberry candy.

923
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,751
No, you didn't.

924
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,620
-That's not what you heated up.
-It was rice, right?

925
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:23,095
You said something stupid,
then you laughed at it yourself.

926
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,731
-You laughed at your own joke.
-You laughed so hard.

927
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,700
-It was your own joke.
-It was yours.

928
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:30,035
Hey!

929
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:31,737
Stop grunting, Jimmy.

930
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,610
You guys keep me so busy.

931
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,879
You're in here so often this time.

932
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,347
You laughed.

933
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,350
I think Jimmy wins a point this time.

934
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:47,152
I won a point?
Yay.

935
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,122
The one who laughed was...

936
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,491
Saito.

937
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,259
Me?

938
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,994
It was you.

939
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,230
It was you, without doubt.

940
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,565
-Me without doubt?
-You without doubt.

941
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:03,101
-You must have laughed.
-Without a doubt.

942
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,171
-That killed it.
-Sorry.

943
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,607
-What did you heat up?
-Huh?

944
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,008
What did you heat up?

945
00:40:10,342 --> 00:40:11,510
Strawberry candy.

946
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,115
You were out there.

947
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:18,984
That was out.

948
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,286
That was too suspicious.

949
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:24,389
Why else would you eat bread after
he said "strawberry candy"?

950
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:30,095
-Nice judgment.
-I'm clamping down on things like that.

951
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:31,630
That was great refereeing.

952
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,533
That's me. Sorry.

953
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,168
-What is it?
-Sorry.

954
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:39,204
-You suck.
-You suck.

955
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:44,442
-That was the worst timing ever.
-You totally screwed it up.

956
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:47,078
That was a close one.

957
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:49,314
That sure was close.

958
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:51,750
No, you screwed up. Completely.

959
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,152
-It wasn't close at all.
-It finished ringing.

960
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,154
Don't act like it all went to plan.

961
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,590
That one didn't work.

962
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,295
Restart.

963
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,533
This sucks. The moment I got changed,
somebody went and laughed.

964
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,669
-It was just a coincidence, right?
-Yes.

965
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,737
-Sorry.
-You can't help things like that.

966
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,940
Stuff like that happens.
Nobody's to blame.

967
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:17,509
-Let me try again...
-Didn't you guys see me laugh?

968
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,911
-We didn't.
-It's because you were eating.

969
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:23,181
But they have cameras on us
from every angle.

970
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,784
-I'm going to have some water.
-Actually...

971
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,587
My mother turns 70 years old this year.

972
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:35,293
She has this photo of when she was 15.
It's an old black and white photo.

973
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,495
She's using a hula hoop.

974
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:40,632
She has this really great expression
on her face.

975
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,067
Will you take a look?

976
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,635
Sure.

977
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:51,543
Who's that?

978
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:59,517
It's my mom.
The thing is, her farts stink really bad.

979
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:04,256
When we were kids, we nearly wet ourselves
laughing every time she farted.

980
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:08,960
We would all scream,
"That stinks! Open up the windows!"

981
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:12,130
But for some reason,
one day when she farted,

982
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:14,065
we were screaming like normal,

983
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:16,067
then Dad went up and slapped her.

984
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,708
My mom got slapped for farting.

985
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,052
How strong was the slap?

986
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,921
What does that matter?

987
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:38,623
-I'm just curious.
-Give us an idea.

988
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:41,893
-Make the fart sound first.
-She farted...

989
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,029
-Prrtt!
-Then my dad went up and said,

990
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:45,697
"Your bowels are rotten!"

991
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:48,533
-Wow.
-That was strong.

992
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,268
-Show us again.
-That was tough.

993
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:54,272
Who wants to be slapped?

994
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,346
-I'm curious to see how hard the slap was.
-Yeah.

995
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,582
-It shouldn't hurt with that on.
-Really?

996
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:05,850
If it's a clean hit.

997
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:09,487
First check where his cheek is.
So you don't swing and miss.

998
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:11,423
Be careful.

999
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,391
That's better.

1000
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:14,759
Sorry.

1001
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:27,806
Daisuke?

1002
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:29,341
-Everyone okay?
-What's wrong?

1003
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,342
You're okay?

1004
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:33,878
Fujimoto is close...

1005
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,880
My mum was 14 in that photo.

1006
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,784
He's on the borderline the whole time.
I'll have to warn him.

1007
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,252
She was a javelin thrower.

1008
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,021
She was 14.

1009
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:46,157
Amazing, right?

1010
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:48,360
She was a javelin thrower.

1011
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,929
She made the national championships.

1012
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:53,331
-Take a good look
-Wow.

1013
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:54,933
THE JAVELIN THROWER

1014
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:58,069
-Fujimoto, did you see the photo?
-I saw it.

1015
00:43:58,203 --> 00:43:59,371
Take a closer look.

1016
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,172
Take a good, proper look.

1017
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:03,775
-Look for 10 seconds.
-The javelin thrower.

1018
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:05,176
She threw javelins.

1019
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,581
Hey!

1020
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,850
Why didn't you all laugh, too?

1021
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:15,020
Look.

1022
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:17,756
This is so funny.
She threw javelins.

1023
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:20,525
How could you hold back a laugh?

1024
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,329
You can't bring in a photo like this!

1025
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,400
-That one got him.
-It was a nice, clean hit.

1026
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,435
-You're in trouble.
-Yeah, I laughed.

1027
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:31,736
That was...

1028
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:33,605
That was funny.

1029
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:38,676
Yeah, I know. I deserve a...

1030
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:42,680
You're kidding!

1031
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:44,916
Wait a minute.

1032
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:47,085
Wait just a minute.

1033
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,421
-Just kidding.
-You scared me!

1034
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:53,691
Well, I laughed so much,
I couldn't complain if it was red.

1035
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:57,195
-That belongs in a textbook.
-Tsuda gets a point for that.

1036
00:44:57,262 --> 00:44:59,330
It belongs in a textbook for comedy.

1037
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:00,932
That really was funny.

1038
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:02,934
Why didn't you guys laugh, too?

1039
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,537
You're right.
If you didn't find that funny,

1040
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:07,806
there's probably something wrong with you.

1041
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:11,943
You have to laugh at that!

1042
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:16,414
Have you ever seen a black-and-white photo
so full of movement?

1043
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,884
Is that thing glued to her back?

1044
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:21,686
She can't really be twirling it.

1045
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:26,157
-Fujimoto, did you see the photo?
-I saw it.

1046
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,459
Take a closer look.

1047
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,260
Take a good, proper look.

1048
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,696
-Look for ten seconds.
-The javelin thrower.

1049
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:32,864
She threw javelins.

1050
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:37,235
You can't blame us.

1051
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,704
-That hit the spot.
-It sure did.

1052
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:41,573
They locked onto Fujimoto there.

1053
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,408
But it was funny. You all are.

1054
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:44,876
Tsuda did well there.

1055
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:47,178
You're all funny. What can I do?

1056
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:52,183
Here we go.

1057
00:45:56,688 --> 00:45:58,123
Tsuda earned a point there.

1058
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:01,392
That one came out of nowhere.

1059
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,329
I'll dry these.

1060
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:10,401
Look at this.

1061
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:13,004
Um, wow.

1062
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,106
That's amazing!

1063
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,175
Wow!

1064
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:19,310
Does it work on konnyaku?

1065
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:22,046
What would happen to the konnyaku?

1066
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,015
That is way too lame.

1067
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:26,251
I guess that's all.

1068
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,019
Try under the konnyaku.

1069
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:29,687
Why do that?

1070
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:34,592
Here it comes.

1071
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:39,430
Ow!

1072
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,701
No doubt there.

1073
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:49,274
-Nice work, Jimmy.
-Real nice.

1074
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:52,844
You laughed so hard.

1075
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,646
-Is that a red card?
-It must be.

1076
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:58,550
-Where has your concentration gone?
-You're right. Sorry.

1077
00:46:58,616 --> 00:46:59,951
What happens if you laugh?

1078
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:04,756
This will be his first card.

1079
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,858
Kojima.

1080
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:09,594
-I knew it.
-He laughed?

1081
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:12,630
-What about Kotouge?
-Doesn't he get one?

1082
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:14,332
-He laughed?
-I did, too.

1083
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:16,134
He laughed the hardest.

1084
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,169
-I did.
-We all thought it was him.

1085
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,206
-He totally lost it.
-I have to admit that one.

1086
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:23,274
I'll take another look.
Kotouge wasn't...

1087
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,009
I thought you all saw Kojima.

1088
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,115
Ow!

1089
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:32,717
That's a laugh.

1090
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:34,219
He laughed so hard!

1091
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:37,155
You can't complain there, Kotouge.

1092
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:42,860
-That's a nice result.
-What a laugh.

1093
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:46,698
The judge is getting tougher.
Be careful about hiding your face.

1094
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:49,300
And we all have cards.
It could be over in a flash.

1095
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,135
Is anybody yet to receive a card?

1096
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:52,837
I haven't got a card yet.

1097
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:54,606
-Wow.
-That's amazing.

1098
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:56,708
-Who has two points?
-I do.

1099
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:58,009
Two of you?

1100
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,111
-I have one yellow card.
-Me, too.

1101
00:48:00,178 --> 00:48:02,280
-One more, and I'm out.
-Jimmy, too.

1102
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:04,582
If we get another yellow card, we're out.

1103
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:07,085
One false move, and we're out.

1104
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,228
Restart.

1105
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:23,568
That vacuum was amazing. It's funny.

1106
00:48:23,635 --> 00:48:25,703
-That was spectacular.
-Let's do it again.

1107
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,971
His balls were amazing.

1108
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:28,406
They got sucked right up.

1109
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:31,109
-Jimmy has huge balls.
-They got sucked up the tube.

1110
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:32,710
I think they reached here.

1111
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:34,579
-That far?
-I think so.

1112
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:36,914
-They went up this far.
-Let's do it again.

1113
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:39,050
-They couldn't go that far.
-They did.

1114
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:40,585
Seriously. They did.

1115
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:42,553
-You should take that off.
-Really?

1116
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:45,089
Everyone should watch this.

1117
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,458
-Seriously.
-Can I lift this up?

1118
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:48,493
Do the balls.

1119
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,094
-Balls?
-Balls.

1120
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,232
Ow!

1121
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:56,234
That hurts!

1122
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:57,735
No more!

1123
00:48:59,504 --> 00:49:01,372
I'll go into rectal prolapse.

1124
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:03,708
Only if we'd sucked your anus.

1125
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:07,378
Why don't we fix that dent in your head?

1126
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,080
-Good idea.
-Sorry about that.

1127
00:49:09,213 --> 00:49:10,682
It's somewhere around here.

1128
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,651
-Will this fix it?
-Let's try.

1129
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:16,321
Ow! Ow!

1130
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:17,755
Ow! Ow!

1131
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:18,756
That hurts!

1132
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:19,791
That hurts!

1133
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,327
That really hurt. Again.

1134
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:24,896
-The dent got bigger.
-Of course. That hurt.

1135
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,732
We sucked his head right after
sucking Jimmy's balls.

1136
00:49:27,899 --> 00:49:28,900
You're right.

1137
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:31,436
Suck his head up into the tube.

1138
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,104
-It won't fit.
-Like Jimmy's balls.

1139
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:34,272
Go slowly.

1140
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:36,240
-Try your lips.
-That's contagious.

1141
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,179
We just sucked his balls.

1142
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,016
Use your tongue.

1143
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:46,551
Go with the tongue.

1144
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:00,498
-I'm not going next.
-Nobody wants to go next.

1145
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:03,000
You sucked Jimmy's balls,
then he licked it.

1146
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:06,037
-That's too much.
-Let's decide by rock-paper-scissors.

1147
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,207
-I have germ phobia.
-No way.

1148
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:10,608
Let's play that.

1149
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:13,044
Before we play the game,
let's suck his balls.

1150
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:14,946
To start afresh? Okay.

1151
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,514
Why start with his balls?

1152
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,384
-Do we need the balls?
-Let's play ball.

1153
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,820
We'll do his balls to reset things
before we do rock-paper-scissors.

1154
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:24,922
-That's better.
-Let's remove the pipe.

1155
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:28,292
Won't that pull on his balls harder?

1156
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:30,061
This stinks.

1157
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:33,231
This seriously stinks.

1158
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:34,832
It really does.

1159
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,834
-That stinks!
-What the hell?

1160
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:39,937
-That is intense, Jimmy.
-We have to play this.

1161
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,005
It really stinks.

1162
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:42,774
That's foul.

1163
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:45,943
-That's foul.
-We have to suck his balls first, right?

1164
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,478
We start with Jimmy's balls.

1165
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:50,715
-It's like an opening ceremony.
-We can't start without it.

1166
00:50:50,782 --> 00:50:52,150
But his balls really stink.

1167
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,154
Start with his pole.

1168
00:50:57,288 --> 00:50:58,322
That hurts!

1169
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,191
Damn you. My pole...

1170
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,459
He got your pole?

1171
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,327
He got my intestines.

1172
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,096
Your intestines?

1173
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:07,865
-What happened?
-He sucked my intestines down.

1174
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:13,004
Are you okay?

1175
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:15,773
Of course not. That hurt.

1176
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:19,110
-Are you okay?
-Like I said. Of course not.

1177
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:20,978
What happened?

1178
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:23,648
-Does it hurt?
-Is it "hot"?

1179
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:25,650
Look at my balls.

1180
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,084
They've been reshuffled.

1181
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,394
They've been reshuffled?

1182
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:39,397
What the hell does that mean?

1183
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,534
What does "reshuffled" mean?

1184
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:46,571
-Reshuffled?
-That sounds quite...

1185
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:50,107
Your balls got reshuffled?
That's playing dirty.

1186
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,542
That's not fair.

1187
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,578
That's ridiculous.

1188
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:55,847
This is getting ridiculous!

1189
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:58,282
-We had a good laugh.
-You sure did.

1190
00:51:58,382 --> 00:51:59,617
Unfortunately,

1191
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:02,453
I think I could call all of you out.

1192
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,856
Really?

1193
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:07,058
But there were two clear outs.

1194
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:08,559
Tsuda and Yoshimura.

1195
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,263
Now, you all have one.

1196
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:14,031
It really is a coincidence.

1197
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,402
Start with his pole.

1198
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:20,438
That hurts!

1199
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,340
Damn you. My pole...

1200
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,641
He got your pole?

1201
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:25,576
He got my intestines.

1202
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,678
-Your intestines?
-Are you okay?

1203
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,814
Of course not.

1204
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:31,682
Look at my balls.

1205
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:33,117
They've been reshuffled.

1206
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:40,725
I took that "reshuffle" up close.

1207
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:43,828
But it was true.
His balls had been reshuffled.

1208
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:47,365
At first, I had no idea what he meant.

1209
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:50,801
But after a closer look,
I realized they had been reshuffled.

1210
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,338
Not just up and down.
There was a lateral transfer, too.

1211
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,910
Restart.

1212
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,414
Shall we continue?

1213
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:06,617
If we're continuing,
we need to suck Jimmy's balls again.

1214
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:08,119
His balls again?

1215
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,521
-Or was that enough?
-I think so.

1216
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:12,189
I think that's enough.

1217
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:14,625
-He's at it again.
-Don't wash your head there.

1218
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,093
-Stop it.
-Give me a break.

1219
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,563
My head's too hot.

1220
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:21,399
-It's too hot?
-There's no need to use soap.

1221
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:23,901
-What are you washing it with?
-Dish soap.

1222
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,603
Your hair will get stiff.

1223
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,538
Wait up. I still have some kimchi.

1224
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,340
-Kimchi?
-What do you mean?

1225
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:32,109
-I'm covered in kimchi. It hurts.
-That's your fault.

1226
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,446
But we need his balls
for the opening ceremony.

1227
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:37,882
Let's decide who's next
by rock-paper-scissors.

1228
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:38,816
Yeah.

1229
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,117
Why not?

1230
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:42,153
-What was that?
-You still have foam.

1231
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,088
You're still covered in foam.

1232
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:46,591
-You still have foam.
-Hurry up.

1233
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,261
Hurry up.

1234
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:55,900
This is my bubble dance.

1235
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,738
Why won't it wash out?

1236
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:06,243
Hey!

1237
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:10,047
Quit that!

1238
00:54:10,114 --> 00:54:11,148
What's wrong?

1239
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,284
-He keeps getting me.
-Oh, my.

1240
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,454
Stop it. Seriously.

1241
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:18,556
There's foam here, too.

1242
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:27,131
Not much time has passed.

1243
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,367
-An hour and a half.
-Is that all?

1244
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,702
Was anyone out after 90 minutes last time?

1245
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:33,237
Really?

1246
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:34,739
I think there was.

1247
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,374
Jimmy was out.

1248
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,275
Can I wash my hands?

1249
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:43,614
-No, thanks.
-Why? It's just...

1250
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:46,984
...a towel.

1251
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,759
-I let my guard down.
-You sure did.

1252
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:56,093
Who was that?

1253
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,395
Daisuke?

1254
00:54:57,662 --> 00:54:58,596
You, right?

1255
00:54:58,663 --> 00:54:59,764
What happened?

1256
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:00,998
I just...

1257
00:55:01,332 --> 00:55:02,633
Seriously...

1258
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:06,370
I was just talking with Jimmy
like I normally would.

1259
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:09,407
-You can't do that.
-That's a no-no.

1260
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:10,474
That's your bad.

1261
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:12,076
Is this the end?

1262
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:13,344
Your attention slipped.

1263
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,212
It's your second time on the show.

1264
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,015
-Daisuke?
-Yes.

1265
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:19,116
Daisuke laughed.

1266
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:22,687
Let's take a look.

1267
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:25,589
I think there was.

1268
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,324
Jimmy was out.

1269
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,160
Can I wash my hands?

1270
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:34,532
-No, thanks.
-Why? It's just...

1271
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,368
He laughed!

1272
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:40,304
Yellow!

1273
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:44,642
-What a waste.
-That has to hurt.

1274
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,511
That means he's out. You're out.

1275
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:49,647
No!

1276
00:55:49,714 --> 00:55:51,582
-But you really did laugh.
-You did.

1277
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,350
Don't do this to me.

1278
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:55,619
Nobody even tried to make me laugh.

1279
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,356
All I did was offer Jimmy a towel.

1280
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:00,791
He said, "No, thanks."

1281
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:01,959
I thought, "Why?"

1282
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:04,095
I lose a million yen for that?

1283
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:05,463
You giggled.

1284
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,365
What was so funny?
We need an explanation.

1285
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:12,036
-Well, Jimmy was soaking wet.
-Because he just washed his head.

1286
00:56:12,103 --> 00:56:15,239
So, I offered him a towel
to wipe himself dry.

1287
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,308
But he said, "No, thanks."

1288
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:19,910
But he was soaking wet!

1289
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,579
-Why is that funny?
-It's funny!

1290
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:24,014
That's what we call "everyday life."

1291
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,223
We'll be making stricter judgments
from here on.

1292
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:33,557
Well, he will.

1293
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:36,127
He will be really strict.
Even just a smirk...

1294
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:37,728
A smirk will get you a card!

1295
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:38,896
You're not the judge.

1296
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:41,599
-But he's right. I will be tougher.
-You will, right?

1297
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,367
-Hurry up and leave.
-Bye!

1298
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,202
I still don't get what was funny.

1299
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:47,772
Jimmy was washing his head.

1300
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,640
He was soaking wet.

1301
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:52,376
When I gave him a towel he said,
"No, thanks."

1302
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:53,744
That's not funny.

1303
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:54,979
It was funny!

1304
00:56:57,948 --> 00:56:59,683
What is this?

1305
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:04,421
Why did I eat a steamed bun,
then go and wash my hands at that moment?

1306
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:07,224
What was that?
I don't find it funny at all now.

1307
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:09,426
-No, thanks.
-Why? It's just...

1308
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:12,763
I gave him a towel. He said, "No, thanks."
That was it...

1309
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:17,001
I think I'd been numbed by it all.

1310
00:57:17,301 --> 00:57:19,003
Somebody laughed.

1311
00:57:19,336 --> 00:57:21,205
The alarm went off.

1312
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,110
The thunder noise came and we restarted,
but I guess

1313
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,479
I wasn't concentrating.

1314
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,048
It's a six-hour-long test.

1315
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:34,285
It's all about concentration.

1316
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:38,022
And how long they can maintain it.

1317
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:42,293
I think one's ability to concentrate
varies with age,

1318
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:46,430
but two hours is probably
the best you can hope for.

1319
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:50,100
But they must maintain concentration
for three times longer than that.

1320
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:55,773
So, I imagine that keeping concentration
for that long would be no small task.

1321
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,075
I think that can be said.

1322
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:01,679
If that's what makes Documental tough,
what makes it fun?

1323
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:05,182
It's fun when players
lose their concentration.

1324
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:08,319
That may seem like a contradiction,

1325
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:10,855
but when somebody lets down their guard,

1326
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:12,823
and you sneak up on them,

1327
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:16,260
you find yet another kind of comedy.

1328
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:22,233
-You must be Director Izutsu.
-No, I am not.
