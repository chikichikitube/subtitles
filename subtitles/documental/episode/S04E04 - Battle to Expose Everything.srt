00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:22,390
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,661
The "mental" in Documental
is about mental toughness?

4
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:31,198
I haven't stayed on long enough
to feel mentally pressured yet.

5
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,467
I always get eliminated early.

6
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:37,004
I haven't been pushed so far
that I got all stressed. Not yet.

7
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,708
When it starts,
it's like you keep on bombing, right?

8
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:46,213
But that might make me laugh, too.
The fact that nobody's laughing.

9
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,849
I laugh at almost anything.

10
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:53,721
Of course I laugh at funny things,
but I laugh when they're not funny, too.

11
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,794
Nipple beams. They point outwards. Heart.

12
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,130
You laughed.

13
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,600
When you look at people who do comedy,

14
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:11,739
you'll find they're the kind of people
who have quite the imagination.

15
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,410
They laugh at even the simplest of things
because they over-interpret them.

16
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,213
That happens a lot.

17
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,551
Isn't it amazing? It goes like this.

18
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:33,754
It's that slow?

19
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,991
-By the time you get to...
-Huh?

20
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,894
-Yellow.
-Okay. Sorry.

21
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,562
It was such a natural laugh.

22
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,664
-A word for this photo.
-i love you.

23
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:48,769
Wait a minute!

24
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,504
You're eliminated!

25
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,042
Is Iio laughing?

26
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,513
I'll make that an orange card.

27
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,116
Why did I put that in my mouth?

28
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,925
He endured so much.

29
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,968
Here we go.

30
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,803
And your voice got so small...

31
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:26,640
That came too soon.

32
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,509
Is the meat ready?

33
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,644
-It's ready.
-Thank you.

34
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,446
-Do you want some?
-Yes.

35
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,982
Kurosawa, you don't have a mirror, do you?

36
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,418
-This is all I have.
-Can I borrow it?

37
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,385
-Sure.
-Thanks.

38
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,787
There's a mirror back there.

39
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,256
But I shouldn't be away
for too long, right?

40
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,693
-You're gonna wipe it off there?
-Well, yeah.

41
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,860
I see.

42
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,967
You only use one sheet?

43
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,768
One sheet can't be enough.

44
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,137
-Actually, one sheet's enough.
-Is that so?

45
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,373
Surprisingly enough.

46
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,010
-It comes off in one swipe, right?
-It does.

47
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,446
-Your makeup remover is amazing.
-But...

48
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,814
You can't wipe it quickly.

49
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,917
You have to let it soak as you go,
and slowly scrape it off.

50
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,253
-You figured that out by yourself?
-Yeah. You push down...

51
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,288
It's coming off!

52
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:17,124
-Push down, and scrape off.
-Your face look smaller.

53
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,093
-Really?
-Your face looks smaller.

54
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,060
That's nice.

55
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,795
-It's ready to serve.
-Thank you!

56
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,297
-Wow!
-Thank you.

57
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:24,264
We have meat!

58
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,767
-Here comes our meat.
-Wow, it looks so good!

59
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,535
-Here. I'll get some sauce.
-Okay.

60
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,605
-It needs sauce.
-Thank you, Miyasako.

61
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,041
-Wow!
-Awesome!

62
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,476
This looks so yummy!

63
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,045
-The restaurant came to us!
-This has to be good!

64
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,314
-The sauce looks great!
-He made the sauce?

65
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,182
-Awesome!
-It looks yummy!

66
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,485
It looks really yummy. It really does.

67
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,886
You can't eat it.

68
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,488
Huh?

69
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,324
I'm the one who cooked it.

70
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,061
All I said was, "It's ready."

71
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,863
But you didn't pay for the meat.

72
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,600
But they said I could eat what I wanted,
and that I could cook.

73
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:00,834
Only I cooked it.

74
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,470
-But you said it was a treat for everyone.
-You did.

75
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,073
I meant that showing you how I cook
was a treat.

76
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,041
-Huh?
-Huh?

77
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,175
-Huh?
-Huh?

78
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,119
-So we can't eat any?
-No, because it's mine.

79
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,122
-There's too much to eat by yourself.
-I'll leave some.

80
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,730
You don't go to a restaurant and
eat other people's leftovers, do you?

81
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,533
This is seriously tasty.

82
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,102
I made a thick sauce,
so it wraps around the meat.

83
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,438
-You know that Okinawan sauce?
-A.1.

84
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,573
I made it similar to A.1. sauce.

85
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,008
You made it a bit sour?

86
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,778
It's delicious!

87
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,047
-We've waited enough.
-Let's eat.

88
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,818
Whoa!

89
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:52,453
He stabbed us.

90
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,825
I'm full. I'm tossing this.

91
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,561
-You can't do that.
-It would be a waste.

92
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,396
Well, then...

93
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:06,600
Pair up and perform gags for your partner.

94
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,536
-Perform gags?
-Why do we have to do that?

95
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,206
You want to eat, right?
I don't want to fall victim.

96
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,373
What do we have to do?

97
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,243
Perform a gag at full-throttle.
It can be someone else's.

98
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,345
Someone else's gag? That's not right.

99
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,248
Give us an example first.
I don't know anybody else's gag.

100
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,083
But I don't have any originals.

101
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,152
Yes, you do. It goes like this.

102
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,721
That's his, all right.

103
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,790
-Is that a gag?
-Must be.

104
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,626
-It's just my self-introduction.
-To start things off.

105
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,395
Saying "I'm Miyasako" is an introduction.
But you go...

106
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,465
-Right?
-Your introduction gag.

107
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,501
-That one.
-Which one?

108
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,637
-You can eat some.
-Thanks.

109
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,540
-I don't get it.
-Me neither.

110
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,976
-Because I did a gag.
-Someone else's gag?

111
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,477
-That's how it works?
-Yep.

112
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,312
This looks seriously tasty.

113
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,715
That is crazy tasty.

114
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,286
What the hell?

115
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,592
-He ate it this time.
-What was that first thing?

116
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,262
It was a practice swing. Like in golf.

117
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,463
-For eating?
-Yeah.

118
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,998
A practice swing for eating?

119
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,767
"First Witness, Chopsticks Expert."

120
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:15,903
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

121
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,071
-That was okay?
-Anything goes?

122
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,207
-Thanks.
-That was perfect, right?

123
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,009
Here I go.

124
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,380
Delicious!

125
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,815
I knew it.

126
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,850
Wow!

127
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,419
-It's really tasty.
-Yeah, it really is.

128
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,254
How about that?

129
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,992
I'm here to play "The Nose."

130
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,231
-Nose? A runny nose?
-He's "The Runny Nose"!

131
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,302
-Kukky laughed, right?
-Who was that?

132
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,270
-Was it me?
-Probably.

133
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,606
-Hang on. What about Itoda?
-Maybe.

134
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,275
-For this face?
-Which face?

135
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:56,410
It may be me.

136
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:57,945
Mr. Matsumoto.

137
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:00,247
I stayed silent and kept a straight face.

138
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,616
There are two this time.

139
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,687
I think Daigo deserves
a point for that one.

140
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:07,754
Yes.

141
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:08,956
Kukky was...

142
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,861
Well, let's take a look at Kukky.

143
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,762
I think he was laughing.

144
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,232
-But it was hard to tell under his makeup.
-I see.

145
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,401
-The makeup isn't a trick to hide.
-I know. Let's take a look.

146
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,104
How about that?

147
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,441
I'm here to play "The Nose."

148
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,715
-I held it back. I sure did.
-You think so?

149
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,650
-Did he hold it back?
-I did, right?

150
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,318
What do you think? Was it okay?

151
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,120
-Only just.
-I think it was okay.

152
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,223
But there's one more.
Itoda was close, I think.

153
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,558
-Me, right?
-Yeah.

154
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,860
How about that?

155
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,230
I'm here to play "The Nose."

156
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,635
What do you think?

157
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,304
-How should I call that?
-You think that's laughing?

158
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,074
You're defending yourself like that
a little too often, Itoda.

159
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,809
-I do that a lot?
-Yeah.

160
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,078
-Was it too much to overlook?
-Really?

161
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,413
There, there.

162
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:07,648
I understand.

163
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,383
Is Kurochan the only one?

164
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,919
-He has no cards?
-For the moment, yes.

165
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,854
-What are you doing here?
-Eh?

166
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,925
-If trash like you wins, I'll beat you up.
-Don't call me trash, or stardust.

167
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,960
He didn't. And you haven't done a thing.

168
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,161
That's not true!

169
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:24,097
You're right.
I think Kurochan is on zero points.

170
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,967
-He made Fujimoto laugh.
-Yeah. Well, I did it to myself.

171
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,902
And the thing with the milk.

172
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,371
If he keeps this up,
who knows what'll happen?

173
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,840
-He keeps getting us on the counterattack.
-Yeah.

174
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,642
-We give him the ammo.
-Exactly.

175
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,645
-It's your fault for setting him up.
-Yeah, you're right.

176
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,219
-Here we go. It's restart time.
-The meat has a real sweetness to it.

177
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:50,624
-Yummy.
-Delicious.

178
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,294
I think no one is expecting
a zombie to come in now.

179
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,796
-Like it?
-It's delicious.

180
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,164
-It's sweet.
-Right?

181
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,599
This will be a first for this show.

182
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,836
We'll have one zombie trying to take down
the other nine.

183
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,110
Here we go.

184
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,981
Zombie Time!

185
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,383
I forgot about that!

186
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,418
Just Nobu, right?

187
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,987
-Just Nobu?
-I think so.

188
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,722
He's the only one, right?

189
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,725
If no one laughs, that may make me laugh.

190
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,693
-Exactly.
-On the flip side...

191
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,694
Hey!

192
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,464
Hey, stop it!

193
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,533
I can't take it anymore!

194
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,769
It's insane!

195
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,841
The zombie room
is filled with water this high.

196
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,512
The zombie room...

197
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,080
Up to here...

198
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,449
The whole time.

199
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,952
-Look at his back.
-It's not wet.

200
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,621
-You're right.
-His back is dry.

201
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,156
-How did...
-Only his front...

202
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,724
Were you floating like this?

203
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,060
No, it was up here!

204
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,395
But your back is dry.

205
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,763
Huh?

206
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,867
Maybe I was like this.

207
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,337
Like I said, right?

208
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,706
Do not enter that room!

209
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,442
The zombie room is really scary!

210
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,745
-Did it start to flood after you arrived?
-No.

211
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,548
-It was from the start?
-They threw it in like this.

212
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,016
So it was after you arrived.

213
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,685
They can fill the room
by throwing in water?

214
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:26,987
This whole time?

215
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,422
This whole time.

216
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,757
The staff here are crazy!

217
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,994
And in the water, there are...

218
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,462
-What?
-What's in it?

219
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,465
Knights with spears. Doing this.

220
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,866
-Knights?
-Knights?

221
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,136
How do those underwater knights breathe?

222
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,137
Right.

223
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,540
-Something like this.
-They come equipped.

224
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,242
-Like a ninja?
-So they aren't ghost knights?

225
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,513
They're packed on all four sides.
Doing this.

226
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,681
All four sides?

227
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:55,949
Knights with spears?

228
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,851
Really, be careful.

229
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,519
-Okay.
-He's leaving?

230
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,687
And...

231
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,191
And?

232
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,466
Mao Daichi gives her best wishes.

233
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,734
-For real?
-Wow.

234
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,403
-I wonder why.
-Did you see her?

235
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,304
Thanks.

236
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,972
Does she know we're doing this?

237
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,308
She knows. Apparently she's a fan.

238
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,210
Did she watch any of this today?

239
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,078
Apparently she did.

240
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,346
-Really?
-On the monitor?

241
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,881
What did she laugh at?

242
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,350
She's sitting behind Mr. Matsumoto.

243
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,985
-What?
-Right now?

244
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,653
As a special guest?

245
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,755
-That's a first.
-They're co-hosts?

246
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,958
It's a Matsumoto-Daichi special program.

247
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,060
This show has changed.

248
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,762
So both are the MC?

249
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,531
It's a double MC, I think.

250
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,166
Is that so?

251
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,040
Flowerfield High School's cleanup hitter.

252
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,911
He probably doesn't hit many.

253
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,281
You shouldn't do that
with Ms. Daichi's gift.

254
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,183
She's watching us now, right?

255
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,651
That wouldn't feel nice.

256
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,656
-I think it's up to the individual.
-Is that so?

257
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,125
-Yeah, they can leave anytime.
-It's up to them.

258
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,662
-So we can move on and do our own thing?
-And forget about him.

259
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,632
-Oh, I want to eat some.
-Aren't you leaving?

260
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,235
It's delicious! What is this?

261
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:25,272
-It may be the best steak I've ever had.
-It's so good.

262
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,542
-Maybe it's the sauce.
-Yeah, that sauce is awesome.

263
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,911
-It would go great in a steak bowl.
-Yeah.

264
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,146
-Right?
-With lettuce at the bottom.

265
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,215
I'll go back once!

266
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,186
I'll retreat once.

267
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,254
And I'll be back.

268
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,592
Terryman and meat...

269
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,062
-That steak suits you.
-Terryman really likes meat.

270
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,197
It really suits you.

271
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,668
Depending on your emotional state,
that zombie could've made you cry.

272
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,537
It was a tearjerker.
But he showed great mental strength.

273
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:58,772
He did.

274
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,575
But I bet he goes home,
drinks a highball and cries.

275
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,212
He'll scream in the middle of the night.

276
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,086
Things kind of stopped.

277
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,356
-Things kind of stopped.
-They have a bit.

278
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,392
I'll sit myself down,

279
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:23,063
then roll back up and become Kaoru Yumi.

280
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,282
Kukky...

281
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,026
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

282
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,129
You should know by looking at me, damn it.

283
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,834
I was in the band Bakufu Slump.

284
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,137
Which one?

285
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,172
I'm BBQ Wasada.

286
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,609
-Was there such a member?
-I don't think so.

287
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,611
-I remember Papala.
-BBQ Wasada?

288
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:12,879
I'm Papala.

289
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,180
You changed it?

290
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,251
-Did Papala look like this?
-No.

291
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:19,753
Is that a hat?

292
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:20,954
It's a hat.

293
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,789
-It's a piece of tape.
-It's a hat.

294
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,791
-It's a hat?
-It's a hat.

295
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,926
-Why are you here?
-It's a hat... Huh?

296
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,495
What are you doing here?

297
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,431
I heard you were doing
a good location shoot.

298
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,900
Oh, he's that director, Shinya Yamamoto.

299
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,268
-On location?
-On location.

300
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,103
Songs...

301
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,505
Songs are...

302
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,774
You can really feel it, right?

303
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:47,213
I said that looking at great scenery
like this might give me good songs.

304
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,183
You mean that it might inspire
an idea for a good song?

305
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,218
-Is he BBQ Suekichi?
-No, BBQ...

306
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,255
Actually, he went through some changes
and now he's...

307
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,890
-I'm Funky Sueyoshi.
-Funky...

308
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,725
-Your voice is back to normal.
-Why?

309
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,171
Are you Papala?

310
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,341
Are you asking me?

311
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,611
I'm Sumiko Nishioka.

312
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,113
Right?

313
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,283
-The dominatrix?
-Sumiko Nishioka?

314
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,684
Of Nabe-Pro.

315
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,619
For real? At this timing?

316
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,056
Can I return to normal?

317
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,960
Do as you wish.

318
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,629
That didn't go well.

319
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,698
It was a little complicated, right?

320
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,634
The way I incorporated so many things.

321
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,637
Bakufu Slump was a bit hard
to comprehend, right?

322
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,040
-The focus kept shifting.
-You're right.

323
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,608
You kept changing course.

324
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,810
We didn't know how to react to you.

325
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,346
-I didn't think it out.
-Think first next time.

326
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,881
You're so right.

327
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,050
-Good point.
-I get it.

328
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:58,685
He's back.

329
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,355
He spent ages back there.

330
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:03,857
This is all we get?

331
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,859
Unbelievable.

332
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,227
-No way.
-He's serious.

333
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,995
After all we've been through?

334
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,030
After such a long wait, is that all?

335
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:14,033
I started feeling hot, so I changed.

336
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,936
But wasn't that other shirt cooler?

337
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,205
I wonder what he watched growing up.

338
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,408
-What?
-Like, what comedy shows?

339
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,176
Firstly, what is that?

340
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:24,744
They're overalls.

341
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,246
-I know.
-I was getting hot.

342
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,114
Huh? Is that all?

343
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,382
Yes.

344
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,050
What's funny about them?

345
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,485
What's funny?

346
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:36,689
Hang on...

347
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,559
We have to make each other laugh, right?

348
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:43,363
You got changed into those overalls,
but what's funny about them?

349
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,064
What's funny?

350
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,468
It's not like that...

351
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,770
-You're not trying to be funny?
-No.

352
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,906
I just changed because I was hot.

353
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,375
-We're not kids, you know?
-Yeah.

354
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,743
You're not kids?

355
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,479
We're adults, so that won't make us laugh.

356
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:00,814
As an example.

357
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,981
Is that a paradox?

358
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,884
That's not quite a paradox...

359
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,822
-Your sides are open.
-Huh?

360
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,557
-The sides are open.
-Open?

361
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,559
-Significantly open.
-Here. Here.

362
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,594
-Look at your sides.
-Here.

363
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:15,995
Why? Is it broken?

364
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,131
He's so annoying.

365
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,201
Is something going on?

366
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,874
-Who's that?
-Who is...

367
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,175
Who are you?

368
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,578
My name is Daisuke Kishi.

369
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,813
I'm at Uzumasa Studios, on a break.

370
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:38,251
-I'm just taking a walk.
-Without taking your wig off?

371
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,520
I'm going back to the set after my break.

372
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,821
How long is the break?

373
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,491
-Eighty-three hours.
-That's super long.

374
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,659
If you have three days off, you should...

375
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,962
-Take the wig off.
-And go home.

376
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,997
-Look. Your head hurts.
-His wig hurts.

377
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,632
But I have to go back.

378
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,667
-Did you buy something?
-What is that?

379
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,369
This is...

380
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,444
It's a hamburger made of fish.

381
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,714
-A fish burger?
-A fish burger.

382
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,850
-A Filet-O-Fish.
-I got three of them.

383
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:14,988
-You'll eat three of the same burger?
-You could've made one of them meat.

384
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,657
Isn't that shirt too big?

385
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,363
It's size XS.

386
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,466
-XS?
-It's XS.

387
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,067
You mean XL, right?

388
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,869
-It's XS.
-In which country?

389
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,237
It's made in Africa.

390
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,641
-Are they that big?
-Yeah, the pattern looks African.

391
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,243
It's an African shirt.

392
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:39,879
What role are you playing?

393
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,449
-The one I'm filming now?
-What's the title?

394
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,787
The film I'm shooting now is called
Daisuke Kishi: The Male Ninja-Girl

395
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,022
So you're the star.

396
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,590
A "Male Ninja-Girl"?

397
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,459
-You have an 83-hour break?
-Even though you're the star?

398
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,595
-They're filming inserts now.
-Insert shots?

399
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,196
How many inserts do they need?

400
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,099
-Maybe he's good at swordplay.
-Right. Can you show us?

401
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,334
Okay.

402
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,904
-If he's the star...
-There must be many baddies.

403
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,806
-He must be really good.
-I am.

404
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,475
-Can anyone start?
-Anyone can start.

405
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,053
Hold on a minute.

406
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,795
-His wig hurts. I knew it.
-It must be the wrong size.

407
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,264
It's too small.
That's why it hurts so much.

408
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,266
Moving around makes it hurt.

409
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,535
-Are you a poor swordsman?
-Yes.

410
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,110
Ouch.

411
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,480
Hold on a minute.

412
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,317
What is this?

413
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,925
-We thought that, as a period film star...
-You'd be good at swordplay.

414
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,027
You started all this.

415
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:03,830
So...

416
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,501
Behavior like that isn't...

417
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,603
-That was cheap.
-That was scary.

418
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,904
That was dangerous.

419
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,840
Adults shouldn't do things like that.

420
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:18,978
Watch out.

421
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,491
-He's a two-sword man?
-He looks strong. Dual wielding.

422
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,363
The eyes must hurt.

423
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,274
-Amazing.
-He's good.

424
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,210
-He's strong.
-I knew he'd be good.

425
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,313
-Thank you.
-What happened to that mirror?

426
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,683
-Kurochan, is that really...
-Yes?

427
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:58,885
...because you're hot?

428
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,019
Yes.

429
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,156
-Aren't you hot?
-If that's true, then I'm sorry.

430
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:04,424
I spoke inappropriately.

431
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,459
-I'm so hot.
-Is it that hot?

432
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,660
Aren't you hot?

433
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,729
-Why don't you undress?
-That hot?

434
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,297
-Can I undress?
-Sure.

435
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:14,767
It's so hot...

436
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:24,677
Who laughs at that?

437
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:26,079
Huh?

438
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,049
-How was it?
-You know.

439
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,321
Were you watching?

440
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:44,530
And before we know it...

441
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,632
Yeah, there's not much time left.

442
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,843
-It was an ice bucket challenge.
-Does anybody still do that?

443
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,411
Who tagged you?

444
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,315
I'm not quite sure.

445
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,850
You did it without knowing?

446
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,488
Sorry about the wait!

447
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,924
Well, well.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

448
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,694
Thanks for waiting, everyone.

449
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,896
Let me solve your problems.

450
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,198
Okay? Go ahead.

451
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:23,302
I truly am sorry to have kept you waiting.

452
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:26,005
-You'll listen to our problems?
-And give advice.

453
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:27,807
About anything.

454
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:31,244
-Anything? Including love and work?
-Even how to lose weight.

455
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,678
Well, actually...

456
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:37,116
Shoulders get stiff in your forties,
and I'm pushing 50 now.

457
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,486
Mine gets sore. It's hard to lift my arm.
What should I do?

458
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,821
Eat sumo stew.

459
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:43,923
Sumo stew.

460
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,058
-That was a quick response.
-It was.

461
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,360
Eat more vegetables.

462
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,496
-Sumo stew has a lot of vegetables, right?
-That's right. Yes.

463
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,732
-Next.
-Well...

464
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:56,035
-I live in an apartment.
-You live in an apartment. Okay.

465
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:59,539
It's actually quite a nice
apartment, however,

466
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,441
my neighbor's dog is very noisy.

467
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,877
Eat piping hot sumo stew. Okay?

468
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,312
Really hot.

469
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,314
Eat sumo stew.

470
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:13,252
You get irritated because you're hungry.
Eat sumo stew. Right? That'll fix it.

471
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,155
-Is sumo stew the miracle cure?
-Yes, it is.

472
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,324
Pro wrestlers eat it too, right?

473
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,027
It has vegetables, meat, fish. Everything.

474
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,196
-I have a toothache.
-A toothache?

475
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,431
Eat sumo stew.

476
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,334
On the left side.

477
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:31,604
The right side hurts?
Eat sumo stew on the left.

478
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,574
Right? It's good at improving
your blood circulation, too.

479
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,310
-Sumo stew cures everything?
-Sumo stew.

480
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,346
Sumo stew fixes everything.
I owe everything to sumo stew.

481
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:41,948
-So, you done sumo?
-Huh?

482
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,082
No, wrestling.

483
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,219
-Arm wrestling.
-Arm wrestling?

484
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,221
Arm wrestling.

485
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:51,624
-How are your stats?
-My stats? Well...

486
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,326
Six wins...

487
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:54,994
27 losses...

488
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:56,796
937 ties.

489
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,764
-So many ties.
-Wow.

490
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,700
-That's a lot of ties.
-It sure is.

491
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,704
-You can tie in arm wrestling?
-You can. Scary, isn't it?

492
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,806
-Do you eat sumo stew?
-I eat sumo stew.

493
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,476
-You eat but you're weak?
-That's what helps me draw.

494
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:12,178
It's too scary to go without.

495
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:14,714
-What kind of sumo stew do you like?
-What kind?

496
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,716
Good question. What's your name?

497
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,918
I'm Terryman.

498
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:21,220
Terryman! That's nice.

499
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,757
What flavor sumo stew?
I like my mom's recipe.

500
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:30,529
-You like your mom's sumo stew?
-Enough with the Terryman character.

501
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:32,164
What is all this?

502
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:34,166
I'm trying to figure it out, too.

503
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:38,037
But I want to eat sumo stew. Right now.

504
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:40,306
-So that's how you feel.
-I see.

505
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,742
I need to eat sumo stew
more than anyone, right?

506
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,277
-Is that it?
-Yes.

507
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:45,478
What's he doing?

508
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,947
The ice bucket challenge.

509
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,216
-I think he should do it.
-Yeah.

510
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,754
Okay, here I go.

511
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,522
Miss Mako!

512
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:06,465
I'm cold! I'm cold! I'm cold!

513
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,168
Sumo stew! If you're cold, eat sumo stew!

514
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,038
-Sumo stew!
-Sumo stew!

515
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:13,839
Ooh, sumo stew!

516
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:15,775
He's good.

517
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:21,013
-Are you cold?
-I'm cold.

518
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,415
Of course he's cold.

519
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:23,849
Want to borrow my T-shirt?

520
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:24,984
-May I?
-Sure.

521
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,455
Wear my T-shirt if you're cold.

522
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,392
How many did he bring?

523
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,795
He was wearing two.

524
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,931
I'm cold. I'm cold. I'm cold.

525
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,300
The wind. It's so cold.

526
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,035
It's cold. So cold...

527
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:56,615
You drank it?

528
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,851
You shouldn't do that.

529
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:00,653
It's full of minerals.

530
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,022
-He swallowed.
-Because it's made of seaweed.

531
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,057
I'm fine.

532
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,926
-Seaweed?
-It's made of seaweed.

533
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,828
-Is that sex lube?
-It's sex lube...

534
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,731
-Drink it next time you're ill. It works.
-Is that so?

535
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,066
But he told you to eat sumo stew.

536
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,735
You shouldn't drink sex lube.

537
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,503
-Eat sumo stew.
-Sumo stew!

538
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,339
-Have you ever drank this?
-No. I eat sumo stew.

539
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,012
I can't watch this.

540
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,383
What's wrong with him?

541
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:33,919
What are you doing?

542
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:36,655
-What are you doing, seriously?
-Why are you chewing?

543
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,158
Because it's hard to swallow.

544
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,895
-Like jelly.
-What category of humor does that fit in?

545
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,897
It makes me sick.

546
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,202
-Do you have a headache?
-I'm just a little feverish.

547
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:51,937
You keep saying that.

548
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,906
-Do we have a thermometer?
-It's okay.

549
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,274
Let me feel your head.

550
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,842
-Your head's hotter.
-Ouch!

551
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,278
Huh? Who hit me?

552
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,013
He forgot.

553
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:06,886
Why did you hit me?

554
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,488
Because your head was hotter.

555
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,324
By the way, you know...

556
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,427
We're not getting any Zombie Time.

557
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,462
It's because he's alone. You know...

558
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,531
-I see.
-It's hard to do it alone.

559
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,200
So we need to increase
the number of zombies, right?

560
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,602
Enough is enough. We need to make a move.

561
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,772
-Okay.
-Well, well, well...

562
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,008
-Well, well, well.
-Well, well, well.

563
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,043
This is hard.

564
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,646
I brought a costume, but...

565
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:37,783
I doubt I'll get a chance to wear it.
Can someone wear it for me?

566
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,751
Like who?

567
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,453
It has to be someone that fits.

568
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:41,520
Daigo.

569
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:44,757
This is it.

570
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:47,993
That'll suit...

571
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,496
-Daigo.
-Or perhaps maybe Iio.

572
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,797
Me?

573
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,332
It's a high cut leotard.

574
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,667
-Is that all?
-Yes.

575
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:56,435
-You're showing it first?
-Yes.

576
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,370
Iio or Daigo will wear it.

577
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:01,574
If Kurosawa makes a choice, we'll wear it.

578
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,242
-Then, Fujimoto.
-Why?

579
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:07,079
-That's not right. Why?
-It would be a waste otherwise.

580
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:10,716
But why choose me all of a sudden?
Didn't you say either Daigo or Iio?

581
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:12,751
You might as well.

582
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:14,453
What do you think?

583
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,055
It will be super funny.

584
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:17,723
-And it's gold.
-Nice color.

585
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,892
If it was silver, maybe not,
but it's gold.

586
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,327
This?

587
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,496
-But, yes...
-And it's flashy.

588
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:24,930
What's going on?

589
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:30,836
He's watching something.

590
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,642
It's his mother.

591
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:38,878
-His mother-in-law?
-He really likes her.

592
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,680
He has photos, too.

593
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,249
Is it a video?

594
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,285
Looking like this at age 60 is amazing.

595
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,321
-She's sexy.
-Maybe she really is a witch.

596
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:50,956
-Yeah.
-She sure is.

597
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,026
What's he doing?

598
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:57,730
Haranishi...

599
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,733
-Haranishi came, too.
-Half of Haranishi.

600
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,735
-Haranishi is...
-He's hiding.

601
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:03,969
This DVD's amazing.

602
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,771
I'm so happy you wore it for me.

603
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:07,606
What's with the traffic jam?

604
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:10,976
-His belly button looks weird.
-It's like a crater.

605
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,945
-What is that?
-Is something inside?

606
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:15,314
-It's huge.
-There's nothing underneath?

607
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,815
There's nothing. Why ask?

608
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,250
Is your belly button raw?

609
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:19,518
-Is it raw?
-It's raw.

610
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:21,320
-Why is it like that?
-It's like...

611
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,722
There's a huge hole.
Is your belly button raw?

612
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:25,291
-Here?
-Yeah, there.

613
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,861
-You added something, right?
-Like a belt buckle.

614
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:29,962
It's perfectly round.

615
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,231
-Is your belly button raw?
-It's raw.

616
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:33,933
What's a "raw" belly button?

617
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,501
A raw belly button.

618
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,237
A raw belly button?

619
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,440
His balls...

620
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,277
-His belly button is poking out.
-Belly button...

621
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:53,586
-Ah, this isn't it. I did it wrong.
-She was recording?

622
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,020
-Wow.
-What?

623
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,989
-She recorded that earlier.
-No way.

624
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:58,157
It's a voice recorder.

625
00:30:58,257 --> 00:30:59,458
Why did you record that?

626
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,029
Did we have a sound like that?

627
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:08,367
Kurosawa, you told me to wear this,
but now you're...

628
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:09,668
There's nothing for me?

629
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:12,037
-She wants you to dance, right?
-What's that?

630
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:19,538
To a world I haven't seen yet

631
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:20,973
Haranishi...

632
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,683
-That was...
-Not yet.

633
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:35,688
Even if I become a tapir

634
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:38,824
Or if I return to my senses tomorrow

635
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:44,496
I will live on tomorrow

636
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:50,736
I don't know the map from here on

637
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,872
What is the correct answer?

638
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,108
What is the...

639
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,009
Right?

640
00:32:57,076 --> 00:33:01,347
The way that time stops

641
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:05,351
You have even less of an idea

642
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:11,824
The way that time stops

643
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,294
What is freedom?

644
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,063
What is freedom?

645
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:21,166
Do you know

646
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,535
the answer?

647
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,037
Please help me.

648
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:30,209
Help me.

649
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,145
Please. Somebody.

650
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,348
I don't like this.
I really don't like this.

651
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:38,717
Anybody.

652
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,086
Please, help me.

653
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,490
Please say something. Anything.

654
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,227
Give them the punchline.

655
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:51,830
-The punchline? The punchline is...
-Please.

656
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,432
There is no punchline.

657
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,001
I've never set up a joke
with a punchline...

658
00:33:58,771 --> 00:33:59,972
I'm begging you.

659
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,241
Nishizawa, please.

660
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,676
Has anyone seen my Puma wallet?

661
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:07,179
-You're that kid from before?
-It's the same kid.

662
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,381
I can't find my Puma wallet at all.

663
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:12,618
Yeah. So, none of you took a Puma wallet?

664
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,187
Like we told you, it's not here.

665
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:16,922
It was definitely here.

666
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,024
-Were you practicing judo?
-Judo...

667
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:22,561
Well, I wear this when
I'm not practicing judo, too.

668
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:25,464
-That's your casual wear?
-I wear this casually, too.

669
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,467
Did you steal a Puma wallet?

670
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,937
-We didn't steal any Puma wallet.
-No. We haven't seen it.

671
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,573
I definitely lost it around here.

672
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:35,974
-Puma?
-Puma.

673
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:37,676
-Puma? It's not here.
-What color?

674
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,378
-It's blue checked.
-Blue checked?

675
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,147
-Shall we look for it?
-Yes.

676
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:45,350
Why did you drop your wallet
to begin with?

677
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:46,718
Huh?

678
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:48,754
Why did he go?

679
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,360
You, come on!

680
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,597
You, you, you, you, you, come on!

681
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:02,000
You, you, you, you, you, come on!

682
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:04,937
You, you, you, you, you, come on!

683
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,505
What character

684
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:09,141
What character do you usually play?

685
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,883
What character

686
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:21,086
What character do you usually play?

687
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,191
Usually

688
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,194
Usually I play cheerful characters

689
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,698
Usually

690
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,233
Usually

691
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,001
What

692
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:39,271
What goes through your mind
when you're doing it?

693
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:45,544
All of the members are finally here

694
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,814
We are rangers

695
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,749
Rangers

696
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:54,553
We are rangers

697
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:59,057
You are as cute today as ever

698
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:02,160
One step forward, two steps back

699
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:05,364
Always humble

700
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:08,367
Teddy Bear

701
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:11,503
Cute Bear

702
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:15,107
Teddy Bear

703
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,876
Teddy Bear

704
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,212
That was exhausting.

705
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:23,982
Goodness...

706
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,186
-Who was that?
-Damn!

707
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,088
-That was so long.
-Wow.

708
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,523
Wait a minute.

709
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,793
So long!

710
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:39,798
-That went on for ages.
-It did. I'm sorry.

711
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,234
-That took forever, right?
-It was so long.

712
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:43,802
That was so long.

713
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:45,671
Daigo!

714
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,408
-Really?
-Daigo...

715
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:52,444
To be honest, for several tens of minutes,

716
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,680
he's been virtually laughing
the whole time.

717
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:57,349
Maybe it was around the "Teddy Bear" part.

718
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,954
Always humble

719
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:05,123
Teddy Bear

720
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:08,460
Cute Bear

721
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,530
Teddy Bear

722
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,502
-Well, that was... You know...
-I know.

723
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:19,204
-I'll count that.
-It added up.

724
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,572
I'll count that one.

725
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:23,241
-I've already got an orange card.
-He already has.

726
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,877
-That means...
-Right. He is eliminated.

727
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:27,279
He's a zombie.

728
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:33,919
Now we'll have Chidori Zombies.

729
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:37,022
-Zombie Nobu is a bit depressed right now.
-You're right.

730
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:39,891
-Can I do anything with him like that?
-Right.

731
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,360
-Daigo, shall we?
-Okay.

732
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,961
Oh no. Zombie Daigo.

733
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:46,331
-You must keep it tight from here on.
-Why didn't you help me?

734
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,433
Don't forget, Kurochan's still unscathed.

735
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,835
-That's right!
-Yeah.

736
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,103
He doesn't laugh at all.

737
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,805
-You never laugh.
-How are we supposed to get him?

738
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:54,906
Yeah, but...

739
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,442
-This'll be tough.
-It's not good at all.

740
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,112
He's the kind of guy that drinks
sex lube...

741
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,882
I wonder why. Really, why?

742
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:05,717
I think...

743
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,922
I made this face that said,
"What's so funny about this?"

744
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,724
I kept that on the whole time.

745
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:15,794
So, I didn't have my normal face.

746
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:19,431
I was in some kind of character.
I had that face on the whole time.

747
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,100
I'm frustrated. Very much so.

748
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,806
But that foursome.

749
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,208
Of course you'd laugh.

750
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:33,011
One of them was an animal.

751
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:36,048
And the animal had the sharpest moves.

752
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,552
Teddy Bear

753
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:46,625
Let's go.

754
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:55,867
If Kurochan doesn't have a card yet,
we should all try to make him laugh.

755
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:56,968
You're right.

756
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:01,606
-I have no idea what he finds funny.
-He just doesn't laugh. Really.

757
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:02,941
Can't we tickle him?

758
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,711
Apparently tickling isn't allowed.

759
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,415
Please don't yank it.
I'd like you to take it off slowly.

760
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,185
Sorry. I do appreciate you taking it off.

761
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,089
You look like Oshima with that on.

762
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,423
-She does.
-Yeah.

763
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,225
-Like Oshima.
-Really like her.

764
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:22,060
You two really are a matching pair.

765
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:24,529
-They're a trio.
-Oh, a trio. Right.

766
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:28,333
-What's with the dog?
-I thought it was cute.

767
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,302
-And I felt shy.
-Is that Murakami?

768
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,104
-Murakami?
-Is it Murakami?

769
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:33,438
-Murakami...
-Oh!

770
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:36,408
The body belongs to Kurosawa,
the face is Oshima, and...

771
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:38,710
-That's the trio.
-Morisanchu all in one.

772
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,845
-I see.
-Wow.

773
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,012
The full set.

774
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,714
-What's that?
-Who's that?

775
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,750
Mich... I mean, Janet Jackson.

776
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,685
-Janet Jackson.
-Wardrobe malfunction.

777
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:49,788
-At the Super Bowl halftime show.
-That controversial one.

778
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:50,989
Lucky us.

779
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:54,893
Welcome to our lucky town

780
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:59,664
Here we have...

781
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,502
I'm Janet Jackson.

782
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,638
-Right, at the Super Bowl.
-That controversial one.

783
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:11,343
Nogera, nogera

784
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:16,114
Nogera, nogera

785
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:22,821
Nogera, nogera

786
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,124
What does "nogera" mean?

787
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:28,260
I hadn't thought about that.

788
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:29,928
-Just for the mood?
-I see.

789
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:31,129
That's amazing.

790
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,332
-That was good.
-Amazing.

791
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,202
You can't just say random things, right?

792
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,537
He's wearing that again.

793
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:41,773
What I was wearing before
was a little weird.

794
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,277
-You look hot.
-I am hot.

795
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:48,980
-May I take it off?
-You should take it off, if you're hot.

796
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,082
I'm so hot.

797
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,319
Huh? When did this happen?

798
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:57,622
What's this?

799
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,090
Huh?

800
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:00,959
What's this rubber?

801
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,661
Take it off! Take it off!

802
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:04,262
Take it off!

803
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,432
Take off this rubber.

804
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:11,636
Take it off.
Wearing something like this is weird.

805
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,605
Take it off. You have to.

806
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,074
I can't go around looking like this.

807
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:20,712
It's still on!

808
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,482
-You want us to stretch it?
-Stretch it, and take it off.

809
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,319
Take it off. Stretch it properly.

810
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,355
-Are you okay?
-After all...

811
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,394
That won't do at all.
Take it off properly!

812
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,164
Take it off, from a distance.
From a distance.

813
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:40,565
Do it

814
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,033
properly.

815
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,270
-Properly.
-You want it off, right?

816
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,606
Yeah, but look. Take it off here.

817
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:48,874
No, that's wrong.

818
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,842
No, take if off! Take if off!

819
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,278
-Take... Take it off.
-Take it off, right?

820
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,447
Hey, that hurts!

821
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:57,682
There.

822
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:01,920
You told us to take it off.

823
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:04,356
You wore it yourself.
Of course it comes off.

824
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:06,458
It won't come off by stretching anyway.

825
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,693
I'll put my clothes on.

826
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:09,928
I'm so hot.

827
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:16,935
What?

828
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,805
I knew it! It's still on!

829
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:24,175
Stretch it and take it off!
Stretch it properly!

830
00:42:26,578 --> 00:42:28,480
It'll be the same thing over and over.

831
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,949
-Is there more to it?
-You'll do that forever?

832
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:32,651
Are we doing this again?

833
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:38,056
Stop cocking your head.
That's how we feel.

834
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:39,457
Right.

835
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:42,260
Stop it.

836
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:44,162
Show us your capoeira.

837
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:45,830
-Capoeira?
-Capoeira.

838
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,966
-You practice it, don't you?
-Yes.

839
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:49,834
-Right.
-You fight while dancing.

840
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,643
He looks strong.

841
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:04,349
Sorry, that's enough. I'm sorry.

842
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:07,285
Don't...

843
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,287
Don't ever do capoeira again.

844
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:10,188
Huh?

845
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:13,158
Don't stand right in front of me.

846
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,596
-Go for it more, Kurochan.
-It's your big chance.

847
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,932
According to the rules of comedy,

848
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:23,234
when he says stop, you have to go.

849
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:24,269
Why?

850
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:25,937
-You stink...
-Why?

851
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,038
You stink!

852
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,341
I don't have bad breath,
just a rotten stomach.

853
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:32,410
Miyasako.

854
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,112
Miyasako.

855
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,648
Miyasako.

856
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:38,550
Ouch! Reaping sword!

857
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:42,454
Ouch! Reaping sword?

858
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,822
Reaping sword...

859
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:48,927
Miyasako!

860
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,129
-You're still coming?
-Wow.

861
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:52,864
Miyasako!

862
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,566
Miyasako, why?

863
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,767
Why?

864
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:56,701
Hey.

865
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:57,936
Look at me properly.

866
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,173
Closed-fist punch, Genichiro Tenryu.

867
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:06,144
What kind of joke is that?

868
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:09,347
Stop getting in my face.

869
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,416
Miyasako!

870
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,019
I knew it would end like that.

871
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,988
What the hell are we doing?

872
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,065
Did you go to Stinky Breath High?

873
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,933
Eh, Stinky... No!

874
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,969
-Who did this?
-Your high school...

875
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:32,737
Who left a porn magazine here?

876
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:34,773
A porn magazine?

877
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:40,645
Who left a porn magazine here?

878
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:46,184
Of course I got a hard-on.

879
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:48,686
In the middle of a serious battle.

880
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,290
What were you thinking?

881
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:58,596
Who put it there?

882
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:06,771
Is it me?

883
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:08,239
I may have done it.

884
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:09,674
That was savage.

885
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:13,044
-You're insane.
-You're like a male porn star.

886
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:16,047
-You got a hard-on in the middle of this?
-For real?

887
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,850
That's Miyasako for you. He gets hard.

888
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:20,752
-That's amazing!
-That's Miyasako.

889
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:25,090
Being able to get a hard-on in a situation
like this is what makes Miyasako special.

890
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:27,892
-He's cool with things like that.
-Right?

891
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:29,294
-Wow.
-Amazing!

892
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,996
He may even get harder
in situations like this.

893
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:33,898
-Who was it?
-Maybe me.

894
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:35,834
Who was it?

895
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:37,035
It was you!

896
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:39,604
-Iio?
-It was Iio.

897
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,641
Who left a porn magazine here?

898
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,280
Of course I got a hard-on.

899
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:51,649
In the middle of a serious battle.

900
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,353
What were you thinking?

901
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:01,659
Who put it there?

902
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:07,699
Damn.

903
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,534
-You were on orange.
-Yes.

904
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:12,103
Since you're on orange,
it means you're eliminated.

905
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,347
What genre of comedy is it
when you show a hard-on?

906
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:24,516
"Exposing erect penises humor."

907
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:29,220
-You crossed the line with that girl.
-I definitely did not.

908
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,389
If you can get a boner in this situation,

909
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:34,025
you must have crossed the line with her.
Don't lie.

910
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:35,193
I didn't do it.

911
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,829
-Iio, good job.
-Good job!

912
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,697
-Good job.
-Good job.

913
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,866
It was a great performance. Thank you.

914
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,668
-I'm counting on you guys.
-Thanks!

915
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:46,070
-He got a boner...
-I'll miss him.

916
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,175
-It won't be the same without him.
-At the very end, he got a boner.

917
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:55,947
I never imagined Miyasako
would come out with a hard-on.

918
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:58,116
He got me.

919
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:01,953
Every time someone laughs,
Mr. Matsumoto enters the room, right?

920
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:04,422
It's actually a great relief.

921
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:09,260
When Mr. Matsumoto enters
with a smile on his face,

922
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,663
we know what we're doing is funny.

923
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:14,699
Without that, it would just be scary.

924
00:47:14,766 --> 00:47:15,767
Yeah.

925
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,142
-Kurochan has no cards, right?
-So far.

926
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:27,312
-What makes you laugh?
-What's the hardest you've ever laughed?

927
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:29,080
Axel Hopper.

928
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:30,181
Axel Hopper?

929
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:33,585
-The "Pan-Pan, Spa-Pan-Pan" guy?
-No way! Well, he is funny...

930
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:37,589
Well, I prefer that type of comedy.

931
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,758
I don't really understand
complicated jokes.

932
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:42,927
-So you laugh at Axel Hopper?
-Rhythm acts?

933
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:43,995
Yes.

934
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,599
"Stupid tempo." Right?

935
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:49,000
Fujimoto, you can do it.

936
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,271
Why don't you sit and watch Fujimoto's
impression of Axel Hopper up close?

937
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,207
Here goes.

938
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:00,545
Stupid tempo

939
00:48:02,847 --> 00:48:03,915
He's not laughing.

940
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:05,516
-He doesn't laugh.
-Not at all.

941
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,785
-It has to be Axel?
-You need the real deal?

942
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,687
-It's a little different.
-Of course!

943
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:13,091
-I wasn't just "a little different."
-He wasn't even close.

944
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:16,094
Why are you scolding me?

945
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:18,963
Tell us what makes you laugh.
We don't have a clue.

946
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,132
In daily life, what makes you laugh?

947
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:22,834
I like dirty jokes.

948
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:24,769
But you didn't laugh at him.

949
00:48:24,836 --> 00:48:26,938
It was too realistic.
I just got surprised.

950
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:30,241
-Too realistic? It was 100% real.
-What dirty jokes?

951
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,043
Well, if there's a dick,

952
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:36,314
and you touch their balls,
I'll imagine how good it feels.

953
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:37,649
-What the hell?
-What?

954
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:39,884
Watching something like that
makes me laugh.

955
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:42,220
You laugh when someone touches
a guy's balls?

956
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:44,856
Then I'll touch someone's balls.
You'd better laugh.

957
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:47,759
-Exactly. You said it.
-If a senior show his balls,

958
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:49,694
you'd better laugh when I touch them.

959
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:52,664
-Whose balls will make you laugh?
-Yeah. Whose balls?

960
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,465
-Whose balls...
-Among us, whose?

961
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:55,900
Play "Choose the Balls."

962
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:58,503
Now it's time for "Choose the Balls!"

963
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:10,615
Me?

964
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:12,517
I simply want to see them.

965
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:14,018
-Jun's balls?
-Yes.

966
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:15,920
Showing my balls isn't...

967
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:18,256
-I don't want to touch his balls.
-Me neither.

968
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:19,724
They're nice and clean.

969
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:22,460
He simply wants to see them?

970
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:25,330
-Will Miyasako do it?
-Mine are biggest...

971
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:28,700
Why does he "simply want to see"
Itoda's balls?

972
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,542
Why so slow?

973
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,117
-He is clean.
-They're surprisingly cute balls.

974
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,656
-How do I...
-How should he do it?

975
00:49:51,923 --> 00:49:53,157
How should I touch them?

976
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:54,959
-You'll touch them?
-Sure.

977
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:56,627
How should I touch them?

978
00:49:57,028 --> 00:50:01,132
Between the sky and you

979
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:05,937
Another day of cold rain

980
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:10,341
In order to see you smile

981
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:14,645
I will even become evil

982
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:19,317
Between the sky and you

983
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:20,651
I find it quite funny.

984
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:25,223
Another day of cold rain

985
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,994
In order to see you smile

986
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:34,265
I will even become evil

987
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:37,168
-Your eyes met?
-They did.

988
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:47,245
It stinks already.

989
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:50,381
-Seriously?
-That's wrong, Jun.

990
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:53,317
-That's not right. Not right at all.
-What the hell!

991
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:55,319
-Jun, that's not right.
-Jun!

992
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,788
-Sorry.
-That was a surprise.

993
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:58,322
Clean it...

994
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:00,324
-Clean it up!
-Jun!

995
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:02,894
-Seriously?
-Kurochan, clean it up.

996
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,861
I finished.

997
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:05,663
-What were you thinking?
-I'm sorry.

998
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,266
-What were you thinking?
-What an idiot.

999
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,868
He's an idiot.

1000
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:14,972
-What were you thinking?
-Sorry. His touch was stimulating...

1001
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:16,874
-The stimulation was...
-Hold this.

1002
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:18,309
Poke it in here.

1003
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:22,680
Why do I have to clean up your piss?

1004
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,449
-Hold it yourself.
-I'm sorry.

1005
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:26,217
No more is coming out?

1006
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:28,252
You are still tinkling!

1007
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,087
-Still a lot more coming.
-There is.

1008
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:32,523
-What were you thinking?
-Piss is nasty.

1009
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,558
I'm sorry.

1010
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:34,892
Is this for real?

1011
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:37,295
-For real?
-Don't just give me one sheet.

1012
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:41,032
One sheet means I get piss on my hand.
That's a smile on your face!

1013
00:51:42,066 --> 00:51:43,067
You got him?

1014
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:44,836
He was smiling just now.

1015
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:49,974
I told you, I'm a sucker for dirty jokes.

1016
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:53,744
-Your idea of a dirty joke goes beyond...
-Oh, my gosh!

1017
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:55,580
What were you thinking?

1018
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:58,349
The "Don't give me one sheet" line
was sly.

1019
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,451
It's because you gave me only one sheet.

1020
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:02,386
You only handed me one sheet.

1021
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:04,655
That was gross. I don't want to walk here.

1022
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:07,558
-Mr. Matsumoto, you have to tell him off.
-What is this?

1023
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,894
I know that "anything goes,"
but that was...

1024
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:12,296
Someone will dispose of it.

1025
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:14,899
-Being sorry isn't enough.
-You can't do that.

1026
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:17,335
But we're laughing our asses off
in the back.

1027
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:20,371
I hadn't seen the tip of a guy's dick
open to piss in ages.

1028
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:26,644
In order to see you smile

1029
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:31,015
I will even become evil

1030
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:33,918
-Your eyes met?
-They did.

1031
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:41,392
-What were you thinking?
-Sorry. His touch was stimulating...

1032
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:44,095
Why do I have to clean up your piss?

1033
00:52:44,362 --> 00:52:45,930
-Hold it yourself.
-I'm sorry.

1034
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,498
Is this for real?

1035
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,901
-For real?
-Don't just give me one sheet.

1036
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:53,704
One sheet means I get piss on my hand.
That's a smile on your face!

1037
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:55,673
You got him?

1038
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:58,442
-Kurochan, yellow.
-Okay.

1039
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,511
It's a yellow card. That was worth yellow.

1040
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,680
-Kurochan, finally...
-He finally crumbled.

1041
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:03,748
The last stronghold.

1042
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:06,851
I was able to keep a straight face
with Jun.

1043
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:08,853
But Kukky was...

1044
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:12,323
When I handed him the paper he said,
"Don't give me just one sheet."

1045
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,725
I thought, "Yeah, he will get pee on him."

1046
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:15,726
Of course I would.

1047
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:17,695
What kind of genre does he find funny?

1048
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:20,565
I can't understand why
