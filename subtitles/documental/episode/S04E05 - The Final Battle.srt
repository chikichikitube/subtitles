2
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,018
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,921
GAMES PLAYED AMONG CONTESTANTS ARE FILMED
WITH GREAT CARE FOR THEIR SAFETY.

4
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,556
PLEASE DO NOT TRY THEM AT HOME.

5
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:27,561
For once in my life,
for this one time only,

6
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:30,731
I want to focus on winning.

7
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,935
I think I have quite a strong defense.
I really do.

8
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:39,173
I'm pretty sure I can defend myself
against those who do high-level jokes.

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,442
This will be the one.

10
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:46,380
I think I'm getting closer to winning
each time.

11
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,683
I want to go home and slam it down.

12
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:52,153
10 million yen, right in front of my wife.

13
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,758
Always humble

14
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,962
Teddy Bear

15
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,131
Cute bear

16
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,735
Teddy Bear

17
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,471
Teddy Bear

18
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,208
-I've already got an orange card.
-He already has.

19
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,844
-That means...
-Right. He is eliminated.

20
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,548
Who left a porn magazine here?

21
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,052
Of course I got a hard-on.

22
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,556
What were you thinking?

23
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,528
You're eliminated!

24
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,232
-For real?
-Don't just give me one sheet.

25
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:49,003
One sheet means I get piss on my hand.
That's a smile on your face!

26
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,971
You got him?

27
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,740
He was smiling just now.

28
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,243
ATTACK POINTS
KUKKY = 4, MIYASAKO = 3, FUJIMOTO = 2,

29
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,914
KUROCHAN = 2, KUROSAWA = 1,
NISHIZAWA = 1, ITODA = 0

30
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,455
-Let's go.
-Why is that piss still there?

31
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,492
It's proof that he's working here.

32
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,194
We don't need the smell of piss
as proof he's working.

33
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,830
-I apologize for the inconvenience.
-Not at all.

34
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,434
-You were quick to start cleaning up.
-You showed no hesitation.

35
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,403
Did you do that as a part-time job?

36
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,572
What kind of part-time job is
"piss wiping"?

37
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,840
-How would I find it?
-Like a cleaner.

38
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:27,875
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,610
But nobody specializes in piss.

40
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,046
-Did you work full-time?
-Who works full-time?

41
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,982
A full-time piss wiper?
I've never heard of that.

42
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,584
-Did he smile a bit?
-I didn't.

43
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,918
-You did smile.
-I didn't.

44
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:38,953
You did.

45
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:43,724
I look like I'm showing off my muscles,
but I'm checking the smell of my armpit.

46
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,758
That's funny.

47
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:45,793
Really?

48
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,860
Keep it coming.

49
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,829
-Keep it coming?
-I think I'll laugh.

50
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:52,933
It's carnival time!

51
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,835
Yay, yay

52
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,503
Shave, shave

53
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,006
My bikini line is so clean

54
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,507
Take this!

55
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,578
That's...

56
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:05,946
So small!

57
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,383
It's not small. It's an anaconda.

58
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,218
It's nothing like an anaconda.

59
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,320
It's as small as a turtle's tongue.

60
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,955
No, it's not. It's huge.

61
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,724
But Miyasako's was bigger.

62
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,659
That's because he had an erection.

63
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,162
It's so small. I want to see it.

64
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,632
That's small.

65
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,136
You've been targeted.

66
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,938
Why? Why?

67
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,272
Maybe she wants to fight.

68
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,108
Look. She's got her weapon...

69
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,115
Ouch! It really does hurt.

70
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,522
Bring it on!

71
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:51,859
Ouch!

72
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,193
Ouch!

73
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,395
Ouch!

74
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,329
Ouch! Ouch!

75
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,398
Get possessed by the devil!

76
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,200
Ouch!

77
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,171
My urethra hole opened up.

78
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,807
-That's enough.
-Really, that's enough.

79
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,475
-Stop it.
-We don't need that.

80
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,277
-Did you try to do it?
-What?

81
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,645
Did you try to pee?

82
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,514
Peeing is my thing.

83
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,982
-Your thing?
-It's mine.

84
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,584
-"The Art of Peeing" is his.
-Peeing is an art?

85
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,486
"The Art of Erections" is mine.

86
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:24,324
Trying to do any Pee Art here
won't lead to anything.

87
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,726
No one will laugh.

88
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,562
I want to eat that meat again.

89
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:29,763
It was delicious.

90
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:30,764
-It was?
-Yes.

91
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,232
It was super delicious.

92
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,502
Do you want to order food? Something?

93
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,838
But the zombies will come pretty soon.

94
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,541
-That's right. The zombies.
-Any minute now.

95
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,244
-Yeah. We have three zombies now.
-Once they start, they'll keep coming.

96
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:46,613
-We can't kill zombies, right?
-That's right.

97
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,049
-They're allowed to laugh.
-Yeah.

98
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,851
Their laughing won't end it.

99
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,487
The zombies...

100
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,293
All we can do is endure them.

101
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,901
We'll just have to hang in there.

102
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:13,841
-We're beyond a staring contest, right?
-No way.

103
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,876
-Not now.
-That would be brutal.

104
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:20,481
Zombie Time!

105
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,548
That scared me.

106
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,284
It's been a while.

107
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:25,619
Yes.

108
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,254
-That came suddenly.
-I'm cold.

109
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,790
-At long last.
-I think we should...

110
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:33,227
-Hello!
-Hello!

111
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,429
We're Chidori. Thanks for coming.

112
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,898
You know what?
Tokyo has the best sushi bars.

113
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:41,568
-Indeed. It's the home of Edo-style sushi.
-Let me play a sushi master.

114
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,071
-Okay. I'll be a customer.
-At an authentic bar.

115
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,307
Excuse me. Do you have room for one?

116
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,475
Velcome.

117
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,077
-Welcome?
-Blease.

118
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,478
-Please?
-Blease.

119
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,247
-Please?
-Blease.

120
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,749
A few side dishes for starters?

121
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,918
Okay. I'll leave it up to you, thanks.

122
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,153
And for you.

123
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,122
It's a very small and cold egg custard.

124
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,724
Who wants it like that?

125
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,759
Give us a big warm one!

126
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:06,960
And for you.

127
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,731
It's fatty saury. I removed the entrails,
then I put them back in.

128
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,432
Why would you do that?

129
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,102
There's no point in removing them
in the first place.

130
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,537
-And for you.
-Here we go.

131
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,472
-It's fried chicken.
-Fried chicken?

132
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,675
Fried chicken at a sushi bar?

133
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,678
-That's wrong.
-Next dish.

134
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,348
Yellowtail filet.
To cook it evenly, I slashed it 800 times.

135
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,416
That's too many.

136
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,685
-I put curry on top, too.
-Curry!

137
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,188
Curry on top of yellowtail?

138
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:35,989
Eat up.

139
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,093
Now it's time for nigiri-zushi.
There you go.

140
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,596
-Try guessing what it is.
-Mystery sushi?

141
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,365
Yes, it's tuna.
But to be specific, it's cheek meat.

142
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,701
I see. You use unusual parts.

143
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,770
-Are you ready for nigiri-zushi?
-Please.

144
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,639
-Try guessing what it is.
-I wonder if I can.

145
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,808
I can't tell.

146
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,177
-It's dolphin. This part.
-Don't give me that!

147
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,245
-Next.
-What's this?

148
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,480
-It's hammerhead shark. This part.
-Gross!

149
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:01,648
-Next.
-What's this?

150
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,984
-Atlantic footballfish. This part.
-Gross!

151
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,652
-Next.
-What is it this time?

152
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,488
-Two pieces of squid.
-Two pieces of squid!

153
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,993
After all that,
I get two normal pieces of squid?

154
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,561
Please be quiet!

155
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,464
-Says who?
-There are other customers.

156
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,868
The customer over there is Mr. Kakuei.

157
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,136
-Tanaka?
-Tanaka.

158
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,138
He's dead.

159
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,373
He's alive!

160
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,175
There are many such cases in Japan.

161
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:31,111
-Mr. Kakuei Tanaka is actually alive?
-Yes.

162
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,513
The customer behind him is...

163
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:34,948
Mr. Ken.

164
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:36,750
Takakura?

165
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,719
-Shimura.
-Shimura.

166
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,389
The Shimura who's still alive.

167
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,324
The customer behind him is...

168
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:45,926
Yu.

169
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,494
Yu?

170
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,730
Mr. Yujiro Ishihara?

171
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,398
-Gida.
-Gida?

172
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,800
Great Gidayu?

173
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,471
Who calls Great Gidayu "Yu"?

174
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,106
Mr. Gidayu, ready for the check?

175
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,708
Now we have Gidayu's payment scene!

176
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,412
For the first time
in the history of comedy!

177
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,316
Great Gidayu's payment scene!

178
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,020
-That'll be 180,000 yen.
-180,000 yen!

179
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,490
What did he order?

180
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,558
-Whelk shells.
-Whelk shells?

181
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,160
-Two thousand pieces.
-Two thousand!

182
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,361
To go.

183
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,164
I've had enough.
Give me the check, please.

184
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,301
-That's 3,800 yen.
-That's kind of reasonable.

185
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,836
That's it. Thank you very much!

186
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,144
Get hard!

187
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,347
I used sex lube.

188
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,215
It's still limp!

189
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,885
Get hard!

190
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,220
No matter what I do, it's limp!

191
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,890
He was like this the whole time.

192
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,927
Behind that door. Like this.

193
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,029
We waited forever, but it's limp.

194
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,532
I borrowed sex lube, but it's limp.

195
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,902
In the end,
they told me to put on a condom.

196
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:03,937
Because it's limp.

197
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,908
I even tried a new way of doing it.

198
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,910
-But even then...
-It stayed limp.

199
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,011
I'd never seen that.

200
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,447
Usually it's like this.
But he did it like this.

201
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,816
It was like a trap for eels.

202
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,552
I considered giving him a blowjob.

203
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:24,057
Everyone was waiting for me to get hard.

204
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,928
They all wanted me to get hard.
The staff kept coming in to check.

205
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,130
Then they'd report how hard I was.

206
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:31,665
To their boss.

207
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,734
"It just got slightly bigger."

208
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,303
That's tough.

209
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,372
When that happens, it stays limp.

210
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,407
It won't get hard?

211
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,676
It's not easy to get a hard-on.

212
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:46,480
I thought that he might end up
peeing with that on.

213
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,883
-Inside the condom?
-And the condom would get full of pee.

214
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,618
I was afraid he'd do that.

215
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,086
I can't piss either.

216
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,959
-I thought about it.
-Huh?

217
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,094
-Now?
-Now he pees.

218
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,430
Damn!

219
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,165
-No way.
-Wait a minute!

220
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,833
It was me who ended up peeing.

221
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:10,504
-Hey!
-Hey!

222
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,509
-Nobu made his move.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

223
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,110
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

224
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,612
What were you thinking?

225
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:19,880
Damn it!

226
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,416
He caught me off guard!

227
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,818
Be careful,
or you'll really be in trouble.

228
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,553
What kind of competition is this?

229
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,055
Really.

230
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:33,060
And your underwear are scattered
all over the place outside that door.

231
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,429
You had them on until the last minute?

232
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:36,730
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

233
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,266
-Pee...
-Damn.

234
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,834
-Miyasako!
-Yes.

235
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:42,869
You laughed, right?

236
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,371
I did.

237
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,705
And...

238
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,340
Itoda.

239
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,709
You laughed too, right?

240
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:51,611
I did.

241
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,180
Let's take a look.

242
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,283
I can't piss either.

243
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,022
-I thought about it.
-Huh?

244
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,157
-Now?
-Now he pees.

245
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,493
Hey!

246
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,399
Itoda joined in there as well.

247
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,935
We had a complete laugh from Itoda, too.

248
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,337
-That was insane.
-"The Pissing Zombie."

249
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,873
They put up a good fight, but Itoda

250
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,008
and Miyasako,

251
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,477
you're eliminated.

252
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:34,354
You did exactly the same skit
yesterday at Lumine.

253
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,555
That's right.

254
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,158
My daughter laughed so hard at that skit.

255
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:43,096
-I didn't expect a reenactment like that.
-That was too much.

256
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,732
I wanted to make you laugh
the orthodox way.

257
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,368
I wanted to make you laugh with my quips.

258
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:53,073
You stopped being orthodox
the moment you got naked.

259
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,510
We stopped being manzai artists
the moment we got naked.

260
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,480
You're right.
There's not much time left. Let's go!

261
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,082
Ah, damn it!

262
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,117
Damn it, they got me.

263
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,786
-There's nothing you can do.
-There's so much piss.

264
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:07,754
Piss!

265
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,289
What will happen now?

266
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:11,858
Let's go.

267
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,294
-Good luck guys.
-Thank you.

268
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,863
Which way? Oh, this one.

269
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,066
I deserve it. I laughed my ass off.

270
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,034
Huh?

271
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,235
-Now?
-Now he pees.

272
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,171
I haven't laughed like that in ages.

273
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,841
I hadn't burst into laughter
like that in ages.

274
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,877
However, I was definitely
going to get a hard-on.

275
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,446
I was determined the moment
I received this offer.

276
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,348
Who left a porn magazine here?

277
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,217
Of course I got a hard-on.

278
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,587
I did get a hard-on.

279
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,658
So, in that respect,
as far as I'm concerned, I won.

280
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:49,462
Well, I did a few things that
I had planned to do,

281
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,066
but that lead to nothing at all.

282
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,534
It's me.

283
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,803
I'm Master Hamburg!

284
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,006
Now, I'll offer you hungry...

285
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,741
I feel no sense of achievement.

286
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,810
After all, all I did was pee.

287
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:08,415
In order to see you smile

288
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:12,519
I will even become evil

289
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,655
-Your eyes met?
-They did.

290
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,030
So, I have no idea what's funny,

291
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,099
or how you can make them laugh.

292
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,269
When they're in that space,
I have no idea at all.

293
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,642
We don't know who has
how many points, right?

294
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,411
-You've been getting a lot, Kurochan.
-Here we go.

295
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,914
-You're in the lead.
-No, I'm just...

296
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,150
No, no. I think you have
quite a few points, Kurochan.

297
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,119
Maybe I should do something.

298
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,554
-Shall we?
-I think we should.

299
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:48,922
Right? Let's do it.

300
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,825
All this muddling around...
I should just kill you all.

301
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,026
This is just...

302
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,195
But I'm running out of stuff.

303
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,097
Me, too.

304
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,366
I've run out.

305
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,067
"The Run-Out Family."

306
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:05,772
-I've only got Tenga eggs left.
-How many times are you going to use them?

307
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,906
You're right.

308
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,275
Where did it go?

309
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,344
-Do I have anything left?
-It's cold. I'll put some pants on.

310
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,181
-This totally sucks.
-It's cold.

311
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,219
Wow, it's cold.

312
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,553
Yeah, it is.

313
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,834
Isn't this amazing? This scene is amazing.

314
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,238
-It's out of a movie.
-Yeah, this scene is amazing.

315
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,675
It's hard to make people laugh.

316
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,114
Scary, scary, scary.

317
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,284
Think what Nishizawa is feeling
hearing that comment.

318
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,488
-What?
-All of my glasses have gone somewhere.

319
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,757
It's so cold.

320
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,206
Yes?

321
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:32,752
These...

322
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,955
Do you buy them one at a time?

323
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,925
-I buy them in bundles, actually.
-Really.

324
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,294
It looks like a Pietro dressing.

325
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,030
-Do you use it yourself?
-Never.

326
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,466
How do you use it?

327
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,470
How do I use it?

328
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,676
It makes things more slippery.

329
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,311
And...

330
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,914
The way I like to use it is,

331
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,951
I get someone to apply
the lube on my balls,

332
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,420
then I have them scrape their nails.

333
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,721
I see.

334
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,091
It contains paraben.

335
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,712
Shall we do kendo?

336
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,514
Okay.

337
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,083
You'll hold it there?

338
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:49,829
With one swing.

339
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,608
I used to play softball.

340
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,010
-You are quite strong.
-Yes.

341
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,780
What should I do?

342
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,382
-May I?
-What?

343
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,251
-May I go for it?
-Of course.

344
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,418
Thank you.

345
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,385
Your outfits are similar.

346
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,960
In the end,
everyone is wearing a similar color.

347
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,195
You're Wada, from the faculty of commerce?

348
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,364
-Masaki?
-Masaki Wada.

349
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,134
What?

350
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,703
It's the crash test thing.

351
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,016
The crash test thing.

352
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,019
What was that? Do they sell that? Scary.

353
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,087
What was that?

354
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,757
Will you look at a photo of me from
elementary school?

355
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,426
My T-shirt...

356
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,561
"Family Computer."

357
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,430
-Wow. The "Famicom."
-How nostalgic.

358
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,731
-A Famicom T-shirt.
-Wow!

359
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,634
-Wow.
-Do Famicom T-shirts even exist?

360
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:35,702
Right.

361
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,237
"Family Computer."
I grew up with a Famicom T-shirt.

362
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,842
This is from our family trip.
My father took the photo.

363
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,044
My sister is biting my mom's hand.

364
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,146
Who develops this kind of photo?

365
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,583
-She's biting hard.
-Look. We're holding both hands.

366
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,151
In front of a phone booth.

367
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,120
It must have been the only sign.

368
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,556
Holding hands. We were so close.

369
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:00,660
My sister is biting Mom's hand,
but her face is totally deadpan.

370
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,662
-Her face is totally...
-Here we go.

371
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,933
Zombie Time!

372
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,843
-Bring it on. We'll never lose.
-We'll never lose!

373
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,344
-Come on.
-Huh?

374
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:19,879
We're going to beat you!

375
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,148
-That's our line!
-It sure is!

376
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,817
How many times do you think
our team has won?

377
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,887
-The number of times you won is...
-It makes no difference.

378
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,423
They call this guy "The Iron Anus."

379
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:32,692
He will never let one out!

380
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,227
Let's do this.

381
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:36,963
Let's go.

382
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,499
-Stick it in.
-Here I go!

383
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,034
Hang on. Wait a minute...

384
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,769
Can you moisten it first?

385
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,405
-I'll use the narrow one.
-Okay.

386
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:48,007
-He licked it.
-You should change the adapter...

387
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,843
The bigger adapter...

388
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:54,347
-I didn't think Iio did these things.
-Yes, I'm surprised.

389
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,382
He has really old-looking balls.

390
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,184
-Like a grandpa.
-Yeah.

391
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,886
I'm 48, you know.

392
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,354
-Let's go.
-Okay!

393
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,260
-Can you hold this for me? Okay!
-Go for it.

394
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,562
-He really put it in.
-Slowly!

395
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,497
-Slowly, okay?
-Take it slow.

396
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:12,799
Three, two, one...

397
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,200
Brother.

398
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:15,268
Brother...

399
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,838
-It's halfway in.
-Smell it?

400
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,007
Brother.

401
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,475
It's not in yet.

402
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,078
-I can't smell it.
-Really? I can.

403
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,412
Want to use the lube?

404
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:28,748
-Oh, that's right.
-There's some here.

405
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:31,150
-Give them some of your lube.
-Sure.

406
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,052
-Is this lube, too?
-Yes.

407
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,587
Mine's in quite deep.

408
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,657
-Want to put in on yourself?
-Put it directly on his anus.

409
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,926
-You're applying it directly?
-No.

410
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,127
The anus is better.

411
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,196
-Thank you.
-Wow.

412
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,064
-I'll move your balls a bit.
-Sure.

413
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,599
You move them like that?

414
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:49,068
-Maybe you should let it drip down.
-Relax.

415
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,369
Wow, that's...

416
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:53,005
This lube is stiff.

417
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,708
Nobu's balls
look like the back of a kid's head.

418
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:56,709
Be careful.

419
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,778
-Is it in?
-It's inside.

420
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:00,713
-It's really inside.
-Enough.

421
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,515
-Be careful!
-Jun, that's enough.

422
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,550
Be careful. It's inside.

423
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:06,018
Here we go.

424
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,954
Hold it in place yourself, Iio.

425
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,790
-Push on my cue.
-What a foreign object!

426
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,159
It's leaking...

427
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,564
-Nothing's coming out of Nobu.
-Nothing.

428
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,533
Okay, okay! I'm full!

429
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,567
Okay!

430
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,136
You're full?

431
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,850
That was close.

432
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,051
That stunk.

433
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,654
-A lot came out.
-A lot indeed.

434
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,790
-Yay, yay, yay, yay.
-So, he's out.

435
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,925
I can't take Iio's farts.

436
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:47,426
What the hell was that game?

437
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:49,428
Okay.

438
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,798
-Fujimoto.
-Yes?

439
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:53,599
You're eliminated!

440
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,101
Yay! We did it.

441
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,675
You were so close.

442
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:07,980
So close.

443
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,886
-Nothing's coming out of Nobu.
-Nothing.

444
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,922
Okay, okay! I'm full!

445
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:16,956
Okay!

446
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:18,424
You're full?

447
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,800
I thought,
"If Nobu can piss, why can't he fart?"

448
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:29,068
Nothing came out at all.

449
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,437
-We took one down, so all's good.
-We're good.

450
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,307
How could he do something like that?

451
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,643
-Okay, okay! I'm full!
-That was...

452
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:41,781
I was thinking,
"After all these years as a pro..."

453
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:46,018
All that added up in my head,
and I burst into laughter.

454
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,655
The most dangerous one in there was...

455
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:51,991
Kurosawa.

456
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,194
She was like...

457
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:58,397
She kept mumbling,
like she was chanting a Buddhist sutra.

458
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:02,301
"This is wrong. I'm almost 39.
I can't be doing this.

459
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,872
"No way. I'm 39. Should I quit?
Maybe I should I quit."

460
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,341
She kept on going, and it was like...

461
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:13,446
She was really losing it.
Look at what this can do to a person.

462
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,882
What kind of show is Documental?

463
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,190
-10 million yen is just around the corner.
-But we're...

464
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,558
What should I do?

465
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:27,226
But you're right. It is.

466
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:28,227
Here we go.

467
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:31,297
This will probably be your last chance.

468
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,366
-Let's go!
-Who'll play the straight guy?

469
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,336
What should we do?

470
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:39,272
It will be one of us, right?

471
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,741
One of us will get it, right?
As things stand.

472
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,142
If we don't laugh.

473
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,945
But which of us will
keep the ball rolling? Me?

474
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,348
I'm not sure about this,
but I'll give it a try.

475
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,851
-Try what?
-That game.

476
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,253
-What? You'll do that?
-Yes.

477
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,188
-Really? In your anus?
-You can't!

478
00:25:56,689 --> 00:26:00,493
-Think I shouldn't? Nobody would marry me?
-I couldn't watch it.

479
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:04,931
If you went out of sight and
did it yourself, that may be better.

480
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:08,734
-I don't want to see your anus in person.
-Then I'll go somewhere else.

481
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:11,037
I wouldn't be able to unsee it.

482
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,073
I need to turn things around...

483
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:16,542
Nishizawa, did you know about my sweater?

484
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:18,744
-This sweater.
-What is it?

485
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,181
You'll be really surprised.

486
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,584
It's super small.

487
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,286
What? You were wearing that?

488
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,488
-It's actually this small.
-Super small.

489
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:33,025
-Wow, that's some amazing material.
-Yeah, it stretches.

490
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:34,493
Isn't it small?

491
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,395
-How did you wear it?
-It's so small!

492
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:37,697
-Right? Look.
-No way!

493
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,732
-I was wearing that.
-It's super small.

494
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,868
It's gotten even smaller.

495
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,203
Yeah, it keeps shrinking.

496
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,273
-As time passes?
-Yeah, it ends up becoming this small.

497
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,274
That's tiny!

498
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:49,675
That's too small.

499
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,310
-What a liar.
-Honestly.

500
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,912
-Ouch! Ouch!
-How did you go?

501
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,513
-Actually...
-Ready?

502
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,449
I don't know how to put it in.

503
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,918
Is it in your anus?

504
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,354
-Is it in your anus?
-Yes.

505
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,922
-Is it really your anus?
-Yes.

506
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:05,324
-Of course it is.
-Do you mean her vagina?

507
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,727
She doesn't know much yet. I mean...

508
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,529
It's a delicate subject.
She doesn't know everything.

509
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,497
Okay.

510
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,600
-And she's a lady. Stop saying "vagina."
-I didn't.

511
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:17,269
-You did.
-If she didn't put it in her anus...

512
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,038
"Is it really your anus?"

513
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,406
He mimicked me.

514
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:25,478
What?

515
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:30,649
-It's over?
-Like that?

516
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,785
-Wait, wait!
-I wasn't looking at all.

517
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,489
It's finished!

518
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,924
-What?
-What a relief.

519
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,127
That last buzzer...

520
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:45,398
I was afraid you'd mistake it for
Kurosawa's fart and start laughing.

521
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:51,303
This time we do have a winner!

522
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:52,705
There is?

523
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,841
We employed a point system.

524
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:58,344
The winner is...

525
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,382
Kukky!

526
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,084
I did it! Wow!

527
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,352
I did it! Wow!

528
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:07,420
I did it! Wow!

529
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,788
Really? Seriously?

530
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:09,955
Seriously.

531
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,425
It really was close. Just one point.

532
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,926
Kukky won by one point.

533
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:15,528
Really?

534
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,196
No way. No way.

535
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,031
For the first time in my life!

536
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:23,402
Here's 10 million, plus my one million.

537
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:25,404
That means Kukky won 10 million.

538
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:27,106
You may put it in the bag.

539
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,342
Kukky is the winner!

540
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:31,710
Congratulations!

541
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:33,879
Wow!

542
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,714
My first win ever! Thank you!

543
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,584
You were scary. You were amazing.

544
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:43,222
Wow! You were amazing, Kukky.

545
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,424
I got a shitload of money.

546
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,793
This is nasty.

547
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,995
-Really nasty.
-It's for real.

548
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:51,797
-Nasty.
-It's all true.

549
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,600
After a three million yen investment,
you got a return.

550
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:55,701
-You're right!
-Wow!

551
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:56,836
But that was close!

552
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,238
That's what you call guts.

553
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,678
Really? Really? I won?
It's the first time in my life.

554
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,380
I've never been number one
in anything before.

555
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:09,982
My first time ever.

556
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:13,018
We thought you had scored
quite a lot of points.

557
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,587
-Really?
-It was a clean sweep.

558
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,689
-That's so nice to hear.
-However,

559
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,325
you had no idea until the end?

560
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:20,893
No, I didn't.

561
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,296
I knew I was slowing down towards the end.

562
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:27,366
I sensed I was getting weaker.

563
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,702
I was wondering what I should do.

564
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,804
I tried to make a conscious effort.

565
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:32,938
After all,

566
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,709
I was dishing out my three millionth yen.

567
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,611
Ready, go!

568
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:47,486
I couldn't just let them
keep on taking my money like an idiot.

569
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,356
Boobs, boobs!

570
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,962
That may have been in the back of my mind.

571
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:00,232
It helped tighten my belt.

572
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:02,668
Where's the money now?

573
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,905
I don't have it. They took it.
They took it away...

574
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,540
Do you think it's safe?

575
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,276
Someone said, "I'll look after this."
Then it was gone.

576
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,478
-Will I get it back?
-Who took it?

577
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:15,748
It was some kind of assistant.
Wearing a uniform.

578
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,850
I've never seen them before.

579
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:19,985
Never in my life.

580
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,121
I don't even think they were from Amazon.

581
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:25,324
I think the right person won.

582
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:30,629
He's been a great contributor to the show.
I didn't want him to end as a contributor.

583
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:35,000
He went from being a contributor
to becoming a winner.

584
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:37,970
There was a scene where Miyasako
came in quite aroused...

585
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,471
Of course I got a hard-on.

586
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:43,842
What were you thinking?

587
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:49,648
I don't know how much I should say,
but in Miyasako's case...

588
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,485
He gets more excited
when there are lots of people around.

589
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:58,490
Last season, Kasuga was quite sensational.
This season, there was urination...

590
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:02,761
I really think that was
quite an amazing feat.

591
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:06,498
When you consider the fact
he was trying to make people laugh...

592
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,301
Usually, people can't pee like that.

593
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,770
Even if you want to,
it just doesn't come out.

594
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:14,607
Nothing happens.
Like when you're at the hospital.

595
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,142
It just doesn't come out
when you need it to.

596
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:19,878
So in that situation,
with all those people around,

597
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,614
being able to pee at that timing...

598
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,251
I knew it, but yeah.
Itoda really is insane.

599
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:27,987
He's absolutely insane.

600
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,788
He sure is crazy.
