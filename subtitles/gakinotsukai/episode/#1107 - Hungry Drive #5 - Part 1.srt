1
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,980
Leaving the NTV building, where are these 5 going?

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,310
I'm so hungry

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,160
Yeah my stomach is growling

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,180
I haven't eaten anything since last night

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,160
- Why is that?

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,070
- Why is that?
 - To make myself hungrier

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,400
Just for this episode, I made myself hungrier

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,780
I'm just straight up hungry

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,820
Yeah I'm just hungry like always

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,020
I can keep eating forever

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,510
I don't need to make myself hungrier or anything

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,870
Tanaka ...

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,670
you're not that hungry right?

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,490
No no that's not true

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,470
Are we there yet, Endo?

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,270
The restaurant?

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,620
We'll find a nice place soon

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,560
I'm so goddamn hungry

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,470
- How hungry?

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,780
- How hungry?
 - How much sushi could you eat?

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,490
I could eat 100 pieces

22
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,070
- For real?
 - Yeah 100

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,780
100 ... isn't that much

24
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,360
- 700 pieces
 - That's right

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,750
- Now you're talking
 - 700 pieces?

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,780
I could eat 700, 1400 pieces

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,330
"Up ahead there is a Kentucky Fried Chicken"

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,640
- Kenta?
 - Kentucky!

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,310
- That's a great idea
 - Let's go, let's go!

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,730
- Let's gooo
 - KFC is pretty poggers right?

31
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,700
- It's OK if we go then?
 - Yeah for sure

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,290
How many pieces?

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,290
How many pieces could I eat?

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,020
- Not the pieces?
 - The fillet sandwich

35
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,380
Yeah I'll order that

36
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,130
If you eat something like that ...

37
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,960
- Eh?
 - What do you mean?

38
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,240
it's just ..

39
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,620
It's really something!

40
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,760
- Here we go
 - Be careful

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,430
- Oh here it is
 - This is it

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,780
Uwah looks delicious

43
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,470
- Looks damn tasty!
 - Tasty!

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,910
Let's order whatever we want

45
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,240
- So hungry
 - Yeah super hungry

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,110
For now can I get two coleslaws?

47
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,870
- You need to get some meat

48
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,110
- You need to get some meat
 - OK you order then

49
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,200
Just keep ordering after each other

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,560
Can I get one piece of this?

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,960
Cut it out man

52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,530
You're barely eating!

53
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,530
This is just for now

54
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,940
Make mine a combo please!

55
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,240
Chicken fillet

56
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,220
So loud

57
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,800
What drink would you like?

58
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,440
A big cola just for him

59
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,530
Get a large

60
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,090
This is just the first thing

61
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,110
Chicken cutlet sandwich

62
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,020
I'll get that too

63
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,780
Do you want a combo, or just the sandwich?

64
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,980
- The sandwich
 - The combo

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,820
For the moment, the sandwich

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,560
"For the moment"?

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,840
Alright that's good for now

68
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,330
Wait, wait a second

69
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,220
You didn't order yet

70
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,270
I'm ordering, I'm ordering

71
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,440
The Smile Chicken Combo

72
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,800
That item is for children unfortunately

73
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,600
I guess that's not happening then

74
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
For someone turning 50 next year, that's not happening

75
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,180
Then I'll just have this

76
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,620
I'm a gourmet eater

77
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,790
I want to eat lots of different things

78
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,380
Whatever they are

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,960
I hope my jaw doesn't hit the table

80
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,600
From opening too much?

81
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,780
I think you'll be fine

82
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,510
I've been anticipating this!

83
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,270
I'm absolutely starving

84
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,000
"Of course, the hungry five devour their meals"

85
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,730
You're fine with that?

86
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,890
Here are your large fries

87
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:10,420
(sorry no idea what they said here)

88
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,820
You're good with just that?

89
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,760
I don't think this is gonna be enough

90
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,000
but she already left

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,910
We can call her back for you

92
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,360
No no let's not bother her

93
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,240
"Hungry Drive has only just started,"

94
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,840
"there's no way they can be full already"

95
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,070
What happened?

96
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,200
Hamada-san ...

97
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,090
- Oh this is mine?
 - Yes it is

98
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,040
You put it in my basket

99
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,580
Oh my bad

100
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,330
"Was this a joke to lighten the mood?"

101
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,240
He said "This is so fun"

102
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,600
I'm saying this banter is so much fun

103
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,690
I'm saying Yoshimoto is so much fun

104
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,180
"The 5 were eating at a good pace,"

105
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,420
"then that man shows us how big his stomach is!"

106
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,090
This is so warm!

107
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,220
I'll eat that for you

108
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,360
Stop that, please

109
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,820
Are you serious? I ordered this

110
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,000
You're not just like, passing this off to me right?

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,930
I wa- I wanna eat that, please!

112
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,240
I wanna eat it too, let me have it

113
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,840
Yummy!

114
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,090
A brand new taste for me

115
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,440
Stop it!

116
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,530
We're pretty much done aren't we

117
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,040
What do you mean we're done?

118
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,310
This energetic-ness

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,220
The fries are finished!

120
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,160
You can have the last one

121
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,530
Didn't see this last one in there

122
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,930
Are you sure, I can have it?

123
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,510
That wasn't enough food!

124
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,020
That was a lot of unnecessary ad-lib

125
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,090
This is bad

126
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,470
- What do you mean "This is bad"?
 - No no I mean

127
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,310
It means you're hungry right?

128
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,180
There is no break from the Hungry Drive

129
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,000
They get in the car and seek out the next restaurant

130
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,780
We've been doing this show for so long,

131
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,290
I don't remember you guys saying "I'm hungry" this often

132
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,530
- You were just tolerating it?
 - Yes exactly, exactly

133
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,070
We thought it would be rude

134
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,200
Oh that's why?

135
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,200
They got caught up in "compliance"

136
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,760
I see, you were just tolerating the hunger

137
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,560
I'm reading Iida-bashi as Iida-meshi (meshi means meal/rice)

138
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,240
The bridge might be made of rice

139
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,070
I'm talking about rice man!

140
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,420
What the hell is IIda-rice?

141
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,790
"There is a PRONTO up ahead"

142
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,710
What is PRONTO?

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,760
It's like Satin (Cafe)

144
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,220
I wanna go there

145
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,240
Let's go, let's go!

146
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,420
They have like cakes and stuff

147
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,040
They have spaghetti too

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,730
Really?

149
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,810
We're here!

150
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,020
Pasta is great too

151
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,330
You think they could make me a large?

152
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,690
I came here before on a Drama location-shoot

153
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,760
"219 Locations around the country"

154
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,420
They have stuff like this too

155
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,960
"7 minutes since they ate KFC"

156
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,530
"What will they order?"

157
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,590
Stuff like this too huh?

158
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,710
Let's just get some Pasta, right?

159
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,300
2 servings, for us to share

160
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,420
- I wanna eat this
 - That looks good

161
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,870
- This is good too
 - Yeah it is

162
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,220
We could just order everything, you know?

163
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,110
Try everything

164
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,070
Wait wait wait

165
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,510
We have to drive again,

166
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,690
and we'll get hungry again anyways

167
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,640
So let's just try one thing here

168
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,830
- OK then let's get this
 - One serving

169
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,360
Just one is good right?

170
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,670
You're not hungry are you?

171
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,510
I am, I am!

172
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,020
That's why I'm asking if just one is good?

173
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,690
- Well, just one?
 - It's a bit unfortunate right?

174
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,330
So let's do this,

175
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,800
Does that have volume?!

176
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,300
Of course it has volume

177
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,270
If it has volume then it's good

178
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,600
Alright, so let's order this

179
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,220
We don't want like cake or anything?

180
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,530
- We don't
 - No we don't

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,440
"Endo will order for everyone else"

182
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,290
"What did he spot?"

183
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,420
That looks good

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,310
"Unexpectedly, a side order for the pasta?"

185
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,400
"Will he showcase his hunger here?"

186
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,360
- I ordered for us
 - Number 28 right?

187
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,780
- Will they make us a large size?
 - No unfortunately ...

188
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Uwah, really?

189
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,100
We might have to order again

190
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,640
"The pasta isn't here yet ... this is the peak of their hunger"

191
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,110
- This uh
 - A short cake?

192
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,890
I see why you want that

193
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,270
Tell us if you're gonna get something like that!

194
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,880
Not letting us have any

195
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,960
- Oh you can ha-
 - No whatever man you eat it

196
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,690
Please go ahead, this is good for me

197
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,130
Eat some man

198
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,540
He's not letting go

199
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,870
I don't this guy is hungry man

200
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,840
Just dig in man

201
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,840
But the junior is supposed to serve it!

202
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,360
He took so little

203
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
The hell is this?

204
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,710
That's a kids meal

205
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:10,711
Delicious!

206
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,200
"Their hunger does not seem to fade"

207
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:18,400
"Matsumoto, who wants even more food ... "

208
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,511
Allow me to enjoy this eel

209
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:25,977
Matsumoto-san is really slurping!

210
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,244
Alright then give this to him

211
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:35,844
Please eat this dish as well

212
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:38,488
I don't want them to mix together in here

213
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,622
Is it okay if I eat all this?

214
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,466
I don't want to be an entitled senpai

215
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:44,488
- No please enjoy
 - It's no problem at all

216
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,488
Really?

217
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,933
- It's not just "compliance" ...
 - No nothing like that

218
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:50,088
We should have ordered a bit more

219
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:53,555
That is really true,

220
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,244
that is, completely correct,

221
00:14:56,222 --> 00:14:56,933
That is,

222
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,288
That is, so true

223
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,977
Just two dishes, right?

224
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,466
This was nothing to me

225
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,022
- Shall we go?
 - Let's go

226
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:14,020
Let's go and prepare to eat again

227
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:18,711
Cause we're still hungry, right?

228
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,733
So hungry!

229
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:30,088
"They ate all this in 45 minutes"

230
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:43,800
I just wanna eat something with volume!

231
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:47,400
Is there any all-you-can-eat?

232
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:50,911
Something like a buffet

233
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,155
I've been banned from a few buffets, you know?

234
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,733
Oh cause you ate too much?

235
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,044
You can also get banned from those places that give you a prize

236
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:07,533
I've literally never done that

237
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:19,200
"So far it's been easy on their stomachs ... this next restaurant should change that"

238
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:24,333
- "Up ahead, there is a Baskin Robbins"

239
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,933
- "Up ahead, there is a Baskin Robbins"
 - Finally!

240
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,688
I've been waiting for this!

241
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,533
Hell yeah!

242
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,022
I really wanna eat that, sir!

243
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:35,144
I was wondering what might have been here

244
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:39,688
That's it!

245
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,133
"But first, a hearty ramen!"

246
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,711
Goddamn, I am hungry

247
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:52,422
Makes you hungrier, right?

248
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,488
Looks so tasty

249
00:16:56,844 --> 00:16:58,311
Wow, it's like this huh?

250
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:21,390
"You will get addicted to their hearty ramen!"

251
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,844
We should let the hungriest guys just start eating

252
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:34,200
What do you normally order from here?

253
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,906
I want to try their basic ramen

254
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,910
What about the fatty pork?

255
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:42,155
You guys are really something

256
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,244
You youngsters are amazing

257
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:50,422
Then I'll have the asari clam ramen! (A light dish)

258
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:54,666
Ramen is a great choice

259
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,755
So that means, we're sharing a bowl right?

260
00:17:58,027 --> 00:17:59,422
We're sharing the clam ramen, right?

261
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:02,333
Is that really proper?

262
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,022
5 men sharing a bowl

263
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,600
Eat from the same bowl one after another?

264
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:08,777
Yeah just one bowl is ...

265
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,822
That doesn't really jive with the "compliance"

266
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,977
You're using that word wrong man

267
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:15,911
First choice then,

268
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,711
The tontoro

269
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,244
Which size?

270
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:20,755
Standard, or large?

271
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,422
Extra large?

272
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:23,711
The standard right?

273
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,288
- The price is not that different Tanaka
 - It's cheap!

274
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,311
The standard-

275
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,466
Be a man, dude!

276
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,600
I wanted to try the Gyoza too

277
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,977
But it's too late now

278
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,533
Excuse me, server!

279
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,866
- No no, no need to bother
 - Sorry can we order some more?

280
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:50,044
Is it too late for Gyoza?

281
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,911
No it's no problem, just 4-5 mins more

282
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:54,644
I want you to take your time though,

283
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,688
But we're on a schedule, so just forget it then

284
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,311
I think it will be fine

285
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,711
I can make it in that time

286
00:19:03,244 --> 00:19:05,111
I really want you to take your time though

287
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,955
Let Matsumoto have his Asari Ramen

288
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:53,644
I'll that some of that too though

289
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,666
We're not splitting this?

290
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,222
We're all on this table though

291
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,844
How about I just pass this bowl down?

292
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:19,955
Don't pass it down after one bite!

293
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,377
You're passing it back?

294
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:48,355
Of course, we ate some of it!

295
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,400
The bowl returns?

296
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,377
I thought it ended after the first bite

297
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:54,711
Please dig into the pork!

298
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,222
Are you sure I can have it?

299
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:59,266
I'll try the noodles then

300
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,266
No we said the pork

301
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:15,955
Give that to Matsumoto-san

302
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:22,622
"Give that to Matsumoto-san"

303
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:27,400
Endo, everyone should eat this

304
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,088
Is it okay if I eat it all myself?

305
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:31,022
You don't want this?

306
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,577
Ignored?

307
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:38,311
He ignored me?

308
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:39,977
Yamasaki?

309
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:41,666
Yamasaki!

310
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:08,222
Hold on I have to eat it twice? That's unfair

311
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:10,333
What's unfair?

312
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:16,266
That I get to eat two, is that OK with you guys?

313
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,088
I guess that is unfair, but I decided on this system

314
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:22,133
There's no helping it I guess

315
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:27,044
Isn't it better to pass this heavy dish around a bit more?

316
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:38,333
I mean this in a good way,

317
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,266
the noodles are not decreasing!

318
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:42,010
Is it OK?

319
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:46,066
That I get to eat all of these leftover noodles

320
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:49,222
No no please dig in

321
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,844
This is a good quantity, right?

322
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:00,577
Tanaka you can finish that

323
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,565
I wish I could finish it, but oh well

324
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,800
- Looks tasty
 - So tasty

325
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,622
Stop splashing them around

326
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,511
You barely ate it!

327
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:18,244
You ate so little!

328
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:24,453
I don't remember it having this much fat

329
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:35,355
Ok let's go goddamn I'm hungry

330
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,044
- Different stomach for desert!
 - Baskin Robbins!
