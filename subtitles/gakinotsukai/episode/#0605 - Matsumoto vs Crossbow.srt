1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,086
This is where we film Gakitsuka

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:08,692
It's a spring day and there wasn't a man who is usually in a dressing room like everyone else.

3
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:13,497
Tajima the manager came into the room.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,720
Hamada san.

5
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:21,238
Matsumoto san asked me to call everyone immediately.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,006
What do you mean?

7
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:27,244
We'll be having a talk show here today.

8
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:28,545
Why?

9
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:34,284
Matsumoto san said he will explain. So right away.

10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,653
Where is he?

11
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:39,322
Um, I'm not sure...

12
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:41,792
How can we get there when you're not sure?

13
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:45,128
Please, I beg you.

14
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:46,863
I don't understand...

15
00:00:55,038 --> 00:01:00,277
共同11

16
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:00,310
This way, please.
共同11

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,581
This way, please.

18
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:08,785
We should go back.

19
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,420
Is that him?

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,590
They set up something.

21
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,900
-You are late. -Huh?

22
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,602
You are late.

23
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:27,737
It's not like we're late.

24
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,106
Huh?

25
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:32,042
We came here soon enough.

26
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,545
We were gonna have a talk show but you suddenly called us.

27
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,250
I've been thinking about doing some challenge thing.

28
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:53,029
However, I think a challenge with the same degree of risk as before will not satisfy viewers, especially housewives.

29
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:55,866
Do you really have to do that?

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,771
I've been listening to you and I had enough of your bullshit!

31
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:06,443
What are you doing?

32
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:10,647
You don't have a sense of urgency!　A sense of urgency!

33
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:13,683
Hey,  bring that thing!

34
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:15,652
Yanaoka!

35
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:18,021
Why are you yelling?

36
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:23,760
What was brought is a doll looks just like Matsumoto.

37
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,796
What is he showing us?

38
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:31,468
I'm showing you what I'm going to do.

39
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,004
Complain afterwards.

40
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:36,973
Crossbow.

41
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,175
Crossbow?

42
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:39,910
I'm going to use a crossbow.

43
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,182
What Matsumoto is going to do is the following:

44
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:49,019
He will stand in front of 12 bolts, and push the button himself.

45
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,658
And at the same time he will dodge all the incoming bolts immediately.

46
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:57,694
You can't do this.

47
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:58,895
This is serious.

48
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:08,271
Well, let's see how lethal this weapon is.

49
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:10,473
In 5 seconds,

50
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:11,641
4

51
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:12,409
3

52
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:13,210
2

53
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,010
1

54
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:24,487
Scary!

55
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:25,488
Scary!

56
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:30,527
I'm ....

57
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:32,562
It completely pierced the neck.

58
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:34,698
I will challenge this.

59
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,499
No, don't do it.

60
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,235
If something happened to you.

61
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:42,572
Why shouldn't I? Tell me 8 reasons, each of you.

62
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:43,940
8 reasons?

63
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,710
Why shouldn't I?

64
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,245
Why not?

65
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:52,682
Because you probably will loose your life.

66
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:57,854
Who gives you a guarantee that someone's not aiming a crossbow at you when you wake up in the morning!?

67
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:07,097
Tajima, what does the company think about this?

68
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:08,932
Is this okay?

69
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:11,468
Osaki is okay with this.

70
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:15,105
The boss said yes.

71
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:16,573
Just because he said yes...

72
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:19,576
When I clap, move to the side.

73
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:22,946
That's different.

74
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:24,547
You're too slow.

75
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:26,283
Clap.

76
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,387
Not really different.

77
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,324
What's that?

78
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,459
I have this on my arms.

79
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,528
You were weighing youself?

80
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:42,232
You should have mentioned that.

81
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,068
Clap again, please.

82
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:51,141
You didn't move your legs.

83
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:53,143
Only upper body.

84
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:57,180
Yet I'm a person who will show real power when the time comes...

85
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,983
as you've seen before.

86
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:11,728
Hey, why don't we do a different thing that can involve everyone here?

87
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,163
"A different thing that can involve everyone here"

88
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:14,331
Enough of whining!

89
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:21,905
What did he just say?

90
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:22,806
I don't know.

91
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,342
Worthless.

92
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:26,543
Worthless.

93
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:27,644
Worthless.

94
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:28,645
Worthless.

95
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:36,619
Asshole!

96
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,465
We're saying because we're thinking about you.

97
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,301
But if you insist.

98
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:54,237
We're just worried.

99
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:58,908
If you really think about me, you should watch over what I do, shouldn't you?

100
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,254
Prepare for it.

101
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:13,390
So that I can start.

102
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,292
The decision finally has been made.

103
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,963
While 12 sharp bolts are being set,

104
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:25,301
Matsumoto is trying hard to focus.

105
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:29,873
Matsumoto consitently simulates his evasion tactics.

106
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,144
What is his goal? What is his message?

107
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:39,082
Seeing his serious look, we have to do nothing but agree to participate.

108
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:48,191
Does he really overcome this challenge that threatens his life?

109
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,397
He'll do it.

110
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,746
Well then, I'll do it.

111
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,049
Watch me.

112
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,417
Of course.

113
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,456
It's happening.

114
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:21,758
It's time.

115
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,762
Once he push the button, all the bolts will be released towards Matsumoto.

116
00:07:44,214 --> 00:08:02,532
"To little kids in front of TV: This is very dangerous. Do not try this at home."

117
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,977
I can't do this.

118
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,011
Huh?

119
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,446
I can't.

120
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,680
Why not?

121
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:24,654
Look down there.

122
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:30,360
Oh...

123
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:35,298
We put the warning just in case.

124
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:42,238
We do this because little kids may try this.

125
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:50,280
I think chances are low but we can't say it won't happen.

126
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,817
I... um...

127
00:08:56,219 --> 00:09:04,994
Whatever happens, I absolutely don't want little kids to get hurt.

128
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:09,499
I don't want little kids to get hurt!

129
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,104
Well said, man.

130
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:17,106
You're the man, Matsumoto san.

131
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:18,741
He's the man!

132
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:24,847
We should celebrate!

133
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,428
Idiot!
