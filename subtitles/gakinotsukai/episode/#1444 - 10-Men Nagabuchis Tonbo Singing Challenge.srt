00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,120
Let's all sing as Nagabuchi Tsuyoshi~!!

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,160
This is, you know...

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,900
an ill-advised project, I believe.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,220
I feel like the staff forced this onto us.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,220
Well at last year's "No Laughing"...

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,160
Endo started singing "Tonbo" (Dragonfly).

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,220
And then Matsumoto sang it.
- I did adlib and join.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,820
I also joined in a little and this is based off that.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,400
A moment in last year's "No Laughing".

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,560

27
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,600
At the time, did Yamasaki or Tanaka think of joining in?

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,460
We did!

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,760
"But what if I sing over!?"

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,660
I was debating that.

31
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,240
That's what we're gonna be doing today, without singing over, with 10 people.

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,160
Tanaka, this is gonna take a lot of effort.

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,360
Can we do this?

34
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,700
Here it is.

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,340
When are you going is the question.

36
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,120
The last one, we all sing!

37
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,940
The last one we all sing and the real singer will probably come out.

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,280
Extravagant!

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,200
We all know he's not showing up.

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,320
So in addition to us, we invited these members. Come in!

41
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,940
Since this is a challenge of 10, we invited these 5 to participate.
(Junichi Komoto, Shoji Tomoharu, Nozomu Iwao, Kazuhiro Fujiwara, Takafumi Inomoto)

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,360
There's no order here.

43
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,420
There's no, "Who's top?". It's with us 10.

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,200
So let's get this challenge started!

45
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,780
A review of tonight's rules.

46
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,020
"Tonbo" is split up into 10 parts.

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,600
The 10, will sing a verse when they think it's their time.

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,540
If they can sing it without singing over anyone, they clear!

49
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,480
Can't stop until you finish the song!

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,720
We attempt an unexplored challenge!

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,880
How's this gonna work?

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,420
Endo was saying he'll be top, tho, huh?

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,900
Yea, yea, that'll eliminate one verse.

54
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,740
That's true.

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,740
Alright, let's do this in one-shot!!

56
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,980

You did, right?

65
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,320
It sounded like everyone was singing.

66
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,820
I wanted to sing, too! I held back.

Let's just go! Let's just go!

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,680
So no Endo-san then, right?

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
That's irrelevant!

70
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,260
For real, there's no Sr./Jr. or if you're a Nagabuchi fan or anything like that.

- Sorry. Sorry. For real.

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,700
But Non-chan, you sang already.

181
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,060
Yea, I did go earlier.

182
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,240
I didn't even know Non-chan went.

183
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,120
There's no distinction, so I can't tell.

184
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,660
I want you to make it so I know it's you.

185
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,140
Express your individuality.
- OK, I understand.

186
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,260
Let's get to, "Big Tokyo".
- Let's get to, "Big Tokyo"!

187
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,400
Yea, up to there...

188
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,740
That's a lot of pressure.

189
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,380
That's why I said this is gonna be harsh.

These two.

203
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,380
Sense it.

204
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,080
You're neighbors, you should sense each other.

205
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,460
I wanted to sense him, but I couldn't see him while turning.

206
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,300
Shoji could see.

207
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,260
Right?

208
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,760
Was it on purpose?

209
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,700
It wasn't on purpose. I just wanna sing soon.

210
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
We all wanna sing soon.

211
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,080
You haven't sung yet.

212
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,780
For real!

213
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,820
I do wanna sing!

214
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,900
Dishonest. That's dishonest.

215
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,960
Not dishonest. So I can sing for real, right?

216
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,380
There's this sense of, "Maybe it's okay if he doesn't sing" so...

217
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,820
I'm so nervous now.

218
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,260
It's fine, right? I can sing, right?

219
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,760
If that's the case, then that would be bad.

220
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,200
Also Non-chan. The way you sang...

221
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,020
Isn't that a little too expressive?

222
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,420
You said you couldn't hear me.

223
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,940
Which are you? #3?

224
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,080
Right now, I'm #3. I mean I've been recently singing.

225
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,100
Recently?

226
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,660
I dunno. It's not like it belongs to me.

227
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,760
That's not the case!

228
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,120
It sounds like it's yours.

229
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,680
I just meant #3 is my most common.

230
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,160
But we did clear, "that booming city, Big Tokyo."
- We did! We did!

231
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,140
So the question is #6.

232
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,640
Alright, let's get the next one!

233
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,440

No, you've been waiting for so long, I thought you were going for the hook.

251
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,580
That's what I thought.

252
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,120
That's why I went here.

253
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,440
Yeah, there's no hook here.

254
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,240
I was offering it to you.

255
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
This is what you were waiting for?

256
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,020
Who waits for the line before the hook?
- What'd you say?

257
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,560
You'd think he'd want the hook.

258
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,500
Don't make it seem like I can't read the situation!

259
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,740
That's not what I'm saying, but...

260
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,260
Can we take a break?

261
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,900
Let's take a break, one time.

262
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,140
This ganging up, ain't right!!

263
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,760
The group takes a break.

264
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,180
Wanna mix it up, one time?

265
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,240
Really mix it up?

266
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,020
Really mix it up. I mean...look at Hamada-san's.

267
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,000
Hamada is singing "Clop-clop" a lot, huh?

268
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,620
It's totally fine. It's totally fine.

269
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,560
But I think we can clear it on the next go with what he have.

270
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,140
Eh? Me being the hook, right?

271
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,340
You're gonna say it!!

272
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,320
And all that time waiting and it wasn't even that funny, huh?

273
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,460
Finally unveils, and it's flat chested.

274
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,180
Completely different from what I expected.

275
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,200

276
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,580

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,100
Though, I would like to see one where we're ALL out, at least once.

281
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,740

282

283
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,460

Don't you want stuff like this?

289
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,760
They'll think, "Wow, comedians are so intuitive."

290
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,720
We can read between the lines.

291
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,460
If we were 100, they'd keel over.

292
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,180
Alright, let's really mix it up.

293
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,560
Let's mix it up then.

294
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,420

295
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,920

301
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,480
but his voice was super weak.

302
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,720
Was it?

303
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,140
You didn't think you'd be singing alone.

304
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,960
I realized, "I'm singing alone."

305
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,620
It tightened up!

306
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,660

307
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,940

Komoto, where do you wanna go? Pick.

316
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,120
The only issue is the level of the mics.
- We can adjust them.

317
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,240
Carry our mics?

318
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,500
We can just take it, like this.

319
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,620
We're talking about the height.
- Oh, height.

320
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,160
You don't even know what we're talking about!

321
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,580

00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,920
Back to square one.

356
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,380
Z-Zero?

357
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,600
That was a good one.

358
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,460
I was surprised when I was singing by myself.

359
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,460
Everybody.

360
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,720
No good!

361
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,420
We used up all our luck earlier.

362
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,460
I don't think this "Tonbo" is possible.

363
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,560
As Matsumoto predicted...

364
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,380
did they run out of luck?

365
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,260
They continue numerous attempts, but...

366
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,220
they find themselves stuck on part 1!

367
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,040
♪ Clop-clop on...

Aren't you singing over everybody!?

370
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,100
Now you're singing all of a sudden.

371
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,700

But you'll go for the "Clop-clop"!!

377
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,340
I was thinking about goin, tho.

378
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,240
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

379
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,920
Natural. Go natural.

380

We can do this!

381
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,760
(Next: A shocking conclusion for the 10!?)

382
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,620
Natural. Go natural.

383
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,500
