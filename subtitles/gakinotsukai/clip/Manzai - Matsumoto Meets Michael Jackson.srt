00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,500
(Hamada reading aloud viewermail)

2
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:03,600
"We're told Michael Jackson is due to visit Japan soon...."

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:06,599
"....given that Matsumoto-san and Michael Jackson are such good friends..."

4
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:10,099
"....is it true that MJ hangs out with Matsumoto-san at his house whenever he visits Japan?"

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,800
I guess you could say Michael and I go back a long way...

6
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,699
....back to the time he made his earlier trip to Japan!

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,350
Wow! Was it a chance first encounter?

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Not really, I went to see him in concert.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,800
What's so special about that?!

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,199
No, no, that was just how it all began!

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:24,799
Ok.

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,500
I was in the front row!

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,600
No kidding?

14
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,850
I guess Michael sensed something special in me then!

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,500
Of the several ten-thousands in the audience, I guess he was struck by how I was looking at him!

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,100
I guess I really stood out!

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,100
You can really tell, 'This guy's a hard-core fan!'

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
The intensity with which I was watching his act must have carried through to him!

19
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,299
I guess it was from the second half of the show that Michael would just stand right in front of me....

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
...and do THIS!!

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,400
And that's when he started visiting me, and hanging out with me at my place!

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,700
Many times, huh?

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I guess so!!

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Right, but the guy wants to know what the two of you would be upto!

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, he would help out around the house in many ways!

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
With what?!

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, for example - when I would be doing the dishes, he would be waiting next to me patiently with a towel to dry them off!

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,799
What a nice guy!

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh yeah, for sure! - and then when I'd have to lift something heavy like a table....

30
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:23,099
...Michael would stand at the other end, and give me a hand picking it up!

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He's such great guy, and pretty handy that way!

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,299
And then, when you had to make those tricky maneuvers with long items of furniture....

33
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,599
...Michael would know exactly how far to back up before swerving!

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,700
This one time, Michael backed so far up, it was just amazing!

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,500
You just can't make sudden, sharp turns with those long tables, otherwise - BANG! - you'll end up banging your elbow against the wall, you know?

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,299
Michael wouldn't do that - he'd go back all the way, and THEN make the turn!

37
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:44,849
He really got it!

38
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
That's when I realized just how supremely awesome the guy really was!!

39
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:51,849
That IS pretty awesome!

40
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,799
You wanna know something else? - we both have the same tastes, Michael and I!

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,900
Absolutely, SPOT ON!

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,900
You're a jackass!

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We even laugh at the same things!

44
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,799
How come he laughs at everything you find funny?!

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,199
Like, say for example, when you serve a bowl of hot miso soup, and then set it on the table....?

46
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,550
....and the bowl starts to slide, and it makes that funny slipping sound sometimes?

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,199
We just like totally crack up at that, Michael and I!

48
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,000
And then he does that famous 'hoo-hoo-hooooo' yell!

49
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,199
Oh yeah, it's a riot!
