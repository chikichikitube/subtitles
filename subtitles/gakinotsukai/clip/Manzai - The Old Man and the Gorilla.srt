00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We're told Mr Matsumoto is a fearless person, but can you narrate 
 to us the most life-threatening situation you've been in so far?

2
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:14,382
did the guy actually call you "fearless"?

3
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:19,483
let's see now, the most dangerous experience I've had till now would be....

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,854
...I guess it'd have to be the time I was whacked by a gorilla!

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
where was this?

6
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:31,194
around here.....it went BAM!!

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,300
I meant where were you when this happened!

8
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,269
well let's see...I was playing baseball...

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
WHERE!?

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,350
in the field, in the field!

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
which field?!

12
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:44,475
let's see now - it was the Amagasaki baseball 
 field (Matsumoto and Hamada's hometown in Hyogo prefecture)

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
huh! You've never told me this story before!

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,250
Really?...(politely)..well, can you please listen anyway.....?

15
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:55,752
Wham! You remember, I used to hit homeruns all the time back then, right?

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
OK, if you say so...(stiffening up out of respect) - aye,aye cap'n!

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,750
my adolescence was all about homeruns, man!

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
what're you, an idiot?....enough already!

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,700
Wham!!!   Man, did I strike the ball hard back in the day!...SMASHED it 
 clear out of the field, and it broke the glass in someone's house!

20
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,471
Oh, really?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, so I make my way over there to apologize....

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,100
but when I got there, there he was....the Gorilla!

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,950
really? a Gorilla? you don't say!

24
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,084
Well...actually, there was an old man too....AND a gorilla!

25
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,054
Oh, I get it, the gorilla was with the old 
 man at his place! I get it now!

26
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,356
He said, 'What do you plan to do about this window kid? I 
 just replaced the glass after it was broken a while back!'

27
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:38,528
And through it all the gorilla was like this...(sways and swaggers about menacingly)

28
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:43,130
Sounds like a yankee punk gorilla staring at you up and down!

29
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:44,840
Go on....

30
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,340
well, I was like all...bowing down low...being humble, you know?...

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,700
....just genuflecting and flopping before the guy, you know?....

32
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,810
I was also just a kid back then, remember?....

33
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,510
And just then, the gorilla pushes the old man aside....and....

34
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,150
wow! he stepped out in front of him, did he?......and?....

35
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,750
'Why the hell don't you just apologize punk?!'

36
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,190
wait...hold on a second here....

37
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,160
(gestures: 'aren't you getting ahead of the story here?')

38
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,160
The gorilla spoke?

39
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,500
No, that's what the old man said!

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,000
Aaaaaah, I get you now -  had me going there for a while!

41
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:14,020
...no, it was the old man, of course....(chuckles to 
 himself at the idea of a gorilla talking)

42
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,250
thanks, ok i get it now... startled me there for a minute....

43
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,170
And so the old man asked me why I wouldn't apologize....

44
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:21,240
....and then it was like,'Oi, oi, oi, oi!'

45
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,750
wait, wait, wait, hold on a minute again!..the 
 gorilla threatened you with,'Oi, oi, oi, oi?'

46
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,900
no, no, that was the old man again!

47
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,610
aaah, i got you -  so it was the old man talking again

48
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,550
.....wow...the old guy sure has a lot to say, didn't he?...and then?

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,300
well, so the old man was like,'Oi, oi, oi, oi!'...right?

50
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:39,880
And I was humbly like,'Well, I don't see why I should apologize, 
 since I will definitely compensate you for the damage done.'

51
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:44,140
....and when I said that, it just stepped out menacingly and was like,'YOU 
 THINK COMPENSATING FOR THE DAMAGE IS GOING TO MAKE EVERYTHING OK?!?!'

52
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,160
wait, wait, wait, hold on just a minute again!...this was the goril.....?

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,750
no, no, it was still the old man, the old man!

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Ok, i get it - so it was the old man again...........the old 
 guy sure keeps stepping out into the front a lot, doesn't he?

55
00:02:54,174 --> 00:03:03,670
With the old guy stepping out so many times, you'd think the poor gorilla would start to feel cramped and crowded out - he'd think 
 'Should I just squeeze myself to the front from the side somehow? Why doesn't the old geezer just get out of the way?'

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,500
And then it was like......BAMMM!!!......I don't know if it was a big rock or a 
 desk lying around or something that was dashed to the ground...and it said....

57
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,610
Oh wow!...and then?....

58
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,690
'DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FUCK WITH A GORILLA AND GET AWAY WITH IT?!?!'

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,500
eh?..stop!...wait, wait a minute....was this the gorilla?

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,500
no, no, the old man, the old man again!

61
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,750
and then ......(in a soft voice) 'just compensate us for the damage'

62
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,750
THAT was the gorilla speaking!

63
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,750
Eh?!

64
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
OK, so THAT was the gorilla speaking!

65
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:34,710
For the first time, the gorilla spoke

66
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,750
Pretty chilled out gorilla! - not in the habit of getting angry is he?

67
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,750
He just says softly,'Compensate us for the damage'!....oooooh, wow!

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Weren't you in the least bit startled when the gorilla started speaking?

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, that part didn't startle me, not really!...I was 
 a wild and reckless guy back then.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,500
But really....isn't it odd and funny?....I mean why should anyone have to apologize...if you 
 compensate for the damage, that should be the end of story, right?.......

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
He was like, 'You bruised me right here in my arm!'

72
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,850
Wow, you injured the guy?

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That was once again the gorilla I'm talking about....

74
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,000
Eh?!

75
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,000
You mean the gorilla addressed you formally and said, 'You have injured me!'.....?

76
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:12,000
And then he walks up all of a sudden, and....

77
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,450
Wow, that must have been scary!

78
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,400
He must have been around this tall, right?

79
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:15,500
Sure, he was a big, tall gorilla!

80
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,700
BAM!!!!

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Wow, did it break your jaw?

82
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:21,310
No, it was the OLD MAN who got whacked!

83
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:23,210
Eh?!

84
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,650
Weren't they living together happily all this time?

85
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,800
'That's how much destructiveness I have pent up!'............

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
All right, that's enough!

87
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:40,850
..........was what the old man finally said!

88
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,850
Eh?!

89
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,250
Man, what a strange, scary day it was!

90
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,350
But no one whacked or even touched you!
