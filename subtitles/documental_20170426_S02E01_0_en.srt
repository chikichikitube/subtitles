1
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:18,619
THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES CONTENT THAT
MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

2
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:22,623
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,814
-Mr. Matsumoto.
-Howdy.

4
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,983
-Thank you for coming.
-You're welcome.

5
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,085
So, this is the beginning of Season Two.

6
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,520
HITOSHI MATSUMOTO

7
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,556
Season One of Documental was a huge hit.

8
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,961
We've been saying this
right from the start,

9
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:04,031
but this is very much an experiment.

10
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,334
I wasn't sure how it would go.

11
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,638
But I did hear a lot of positive comments
about the show.

12
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,039
-Indeed.
-Yeah.

13
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,074
PROFESSIONAL COMEDIANS

14
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,409
Jimmy...

15
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:16,477
Jimmy?

16
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,345
Excuse me. I'm going to stand.

17
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,615
THEY MUST MAKE THE OTHERS LAUGH...

18
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,717
That's hot!

19
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,321
WITHOUT LAUGHING THEMSELVES

20
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,857
A SIX-HOUR BATTLE ROYAL

21
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,058
Ow!

22
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,226
Ouch!

23
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,494
That hurts.

24
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:37,398
MORTAL COMBAT

25
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,534
"THE NO-HOLDS-BARRED SHOW"

26
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,470
Do I think it worked?

27
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,441
I think that my feelings about the show
and our viewers' reaction to the show

28
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,377
could be somewhat different.

29
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,747
However, we didn't end up with
one clear winner last time.

30
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,650
NO ULTIMATE WINNER

31
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,519
Some people were okay with that.

32
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:01,288
Others wanted to see a clear,
ultimate winner.

33
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,390
There were different opinions on that.

34
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,393
FOR 10 MILLION YEN

35
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,030
-Dodgebee.
-What the hell is that?

36
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,098
Not dodgeball?

37
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,800
A BATTLE OF THE MINDS

38
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:13,968
A BATTLE OF STAMINA

39
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,970
What if we all go home with nothing?

40
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,705
THE STAKES ARE BIG

41
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,406
Should we try an impression?

42
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,443
THAT'S WHY THEY PLAY DEFENSIVELY

43
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,380
We had players who wouldn't
go on the offensive, and to make it worse,

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,651
they stepped back when somebody else
went on the offensive.

45
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,854
That's like the old style of
Japanese judo.

46
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,157
They must go on the offensive.

47
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,926
Score points. Avoid stalemates.

48
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,060
BATTLE AGGRESSIVELY

49
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,263
A SIX-HOUR-LONG BATTLE

50
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,764
Is this guy okay?

51
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,399
Let me do my move.

52
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,769
NEW RULE CHANGES

53
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,540
This time I want to make sure we have...

54
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:56,877
A DEFINITE WINNER

55
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:00,481
I want to make it impossible for
passive players to win.

56
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:05,252
ONLY THE PLAYER WHO COMPETES AGGRESSIVELY

57
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:09,290
WILL BE CROWNED WINNER

58
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,560
You might call it an improvement.

59
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:16,697
We will be adding even tougher new rules.

60
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,969
I think these new rules will make
what's funny about the show more obvious.

61
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:25,739
That's how this season will unfold.
Probably.

62
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,210
BEFORE THE BATTLE

63
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,013
I am certain

64
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:36,216
that on this season of Documental

65
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,587
we will be crowning our first winner.

66
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,956
I'm nearly positive.

67
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,391
We'll have our first champion.

68
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,160
THE FIRST EVER CHAMPION

69
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,495
It's going to be a historic moment.

70
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:52,633
I'm absolutely trembling with excitement
already.

71
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,646
SIX HOURS LATER

72
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:14,088
AFTER THE BATTLE

73
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,992
Three, two, one...

74
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,961
-And we're filming.
-Good work, everyone.

75
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,263
That was an amazing battle.

76
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,799
It was an amazing battle.

77
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:30,471
That's the kind of battle I wanted to see.

78
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,406
IT'S HIS KIND OF BATTLE

79
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:33,907
-Right?
-Yes.

80
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,609
How can I put it?

81
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,512
It showed what happens

82
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,582
when comedians are really pushed
into a corner.

83
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:56,430
Excuse me.

84
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,432
-Good morning.
-Hi.

85
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,868
This is for you.

86
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,269
What is it?

87
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,244
Yes?

88
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,646
Hello.

89
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:13,814
Hello.

90
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:22,890
You scared me. What is it?

91
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:24,191
For you.

92
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,561
The invitation...

93
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:31,865
You're right.

94
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,468
Then we'll do this.

95
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,842
-What?
-For you.

96
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,850
Again?

97
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,724
Looking forward to it?

98
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,193
Documental...

99
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,230
Hello.

100
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,265
Hello.

101
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,971
I know what this is.
It's for Mr. Matsumoto's...

102
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,540
Hello.

103
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:15,542
Hello.

104
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,711
-May I have a bit of your time?
-Yes?

105
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,117
So it came, huh?

106
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:24,752
I see.

107
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,593
Excuse me.

108
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,428
Hello.

109
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,898
I know what this is.

110
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,770
It wasn't like I was bullied.
They just had fun with me.

111
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,172
-They teased you?
-Yes. Well...

112
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,742
-They didn't call it "bullying" back then.
-So, you were bullied?

113
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,077
-Yes.
-Excuse me.

114
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,278
Yes?

115
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:52,780
This is for you.

116
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,616
An invi... invi...

117
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,492
'Twas in the morning sunlight,

118
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,761
beckoned by the swaying plum blossoms,

119
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,831
that I tried cleaning up outside
the entrance to my house.

120
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,066
I caught a cold.

121
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,203
It is still quite chilly.

122
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:22,176
I send you this invitation
with my best intentions.

123
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,380
I sincerely hope you will join me

124
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,816
with one million yen on your person.

125
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,786
I am hosting a Documental.

126
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,625
Twice in a row? For real?

127
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,729
Why didn't he pick Kurosawa?

128
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,532
Please be honest.
Will you accept the invitation?

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,869
At the moment, it's 50/50.

130
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,774
I have prepared 10 million yen
as the champion's prize.

131
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,376
Whether to participate or not,
the decision is yours.

132
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,912
It's an invitation from
the great Mr. Matsumoto.

133
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,048
-You're quick.
-Of course, I'll participate.

134
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,585
It's an honor to be invited
by Mr. Matsumoto himself.

135
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,521
But this is scary.

136
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,657
Life couldn't be better now.
I've been waiting for this.

137
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:17,297
If you are willing to participate,
I will contact you again

138
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,600
about the time and venue.

139
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,870
I look forward to your reply.

140
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:28,075
May the coming spring bring
great happiness to each of you.

141
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,977
Sincerely, Hitoshi Matsumoto.

142
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,280
There's no way I'd say no.

143
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,816
There will be 10 million yen,
right there.

144
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,784
Of course, you'd fight for it.

145
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,121
I can't believe any comedian
would turn down this opportunity.

146
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,390
I am very grateful.

147
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,159
And I'm excited about it, but...

148
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,363
I don't have the one million to compete.

149
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,700
When we filmed the last season,

150
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,136
it was a new experience for all.

151
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,139
I think the players were
grasping in the dark a lot.

152
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,177
But this time, each participant will
have already seen Season One.

153
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,813
They'll have that in mind.

154
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,415
PREPARING FOR MORTAL COMBAT

155
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,617
And that means,

156
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:14,388
I doubt we'll have anyone come in
completely unarmed.

157
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,491
EACH WITH THEIR OWN TACTICS

158
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,862
I expect they'll come up with
a number of different strategies.

159
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:28,068
WARFARE THAT DISREGARDS
THE CODE OF ETHICS THAT BINDS TELEVISION

160
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,872
I heard a bit about
Amazon's thoughts on the show.

161
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,276
Apparently they're
quite tolerant of dirty jokes.

162
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,511
TOLERANT OF DIRTY JOKES

163
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,648
I don't know if that's true or not,
but I guess it is.

164
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,584
I was even told that,
as long as we don't zoom in,

165
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,687
we can even show penises.

166
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:52,960
I thought,
"Oh, they really are the Amazon."

167
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:41,501
THE COMEDIANS ARRIVE AT THE BATTLEFIELD

168
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,945
Here goes.

169
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,195
Well, for the first participant...

170
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,731
Obviously, no one else is there.

171
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,534
He must be nervous.

172
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,740
I'm Yoshimura,
from Heisei Nobushikobushi.

173
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,243
I shall definitely win. Just watch!

174
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:28,281
My first response to his casting was,
"He's the least likely guy to win."

175
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,250
THE LEAST LIKELY TO WIN

176
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:34,588
Would any professional comedian ever laugh
at his cheap, shallow comedy?

177
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,356
CHEAP, SHALLOW COMEDY

178
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:41,128
There may be one thing that
differentiates me from the others.

179
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,029
I'm the silliest.

180
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,233
"THE WILD CANNON COMEDIAN"

181
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,536
This is crucial to boost both
my skills and my career.

182
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,304
I must win this title.

183
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:54,074
I've never won any awards.

184
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,209
Not for sketch comedy or manzai.

185
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:00,881
If I don't win this, I won't be able to
call myself a professional comedian.

186
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,150
I must win, no matter how I do it.

187
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,351
VICTORY BY ANY MEANS

188
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,986
It's simple. Make them laugh.

189
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:09,055
It makes no difference whether it's
the public, or comedians.

190
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,390
They're all just people.

191
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,025
I'm extremely confident.

192
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,460
How could I put it?

193
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,430
It's like we'll have a bunch of
hard-hitting, high-flying wrestlers,

194
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,299
and he'll be pinching them.

195
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,867
THE SMALL TECHNIQUE EXPERT

196
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,970
That's a role he'll probably find
for himself.

197
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:28,208
There's a chance he will create
something funny with that role.

198
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,347
This is exciting.

199
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:38,552
I can imagine it wouldn't be nice
to be first.

200
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:43,190
Of the nine other participants,
you have no idea who is coming next.

201
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,165
It's all coming back to me.

202
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,804
It's you!

203
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,940
No way!

204
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,708
Yoshimura?

205
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:08,748
So, this makes it
his second time on the show.

206
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,618
I am Daisuke Miyagawa. I'll do my best.

207
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:17,023
When I received the invitation,
I really thought hard about my reply.

208
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,626
But I ended up coming.

209
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,197
After actually being on the show,
at the end of the day, I guess I had fun.

210
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,000
Just being in that special place.

211
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,169
HE WANTS TO STAY IN THAT
"SPECIAL PLACE"

212
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,372
I think that's why I was drawn
to this second season.

213
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,975
Can he win? Well...

214
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,810
He does have experience.

215
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,045
I think his chances are quite strong.

216
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,081
WILL PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE
HELP HIM WIN?

217
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,751
I always used to make up games,
just for fun in the dressing rooms.

218
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:47,787
I'll play those old games,
and when everyone's off guard,

219
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,956
I'll take them out. That's my plan.

220
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,260
I called one "Analympics."

221
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,930
To be honest,
I plan to blitz them with that again.

222
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,934
He'll be very different
from the Daisuke you see on Itte-Q.

223
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,336
THE FACE HE CAN'T SHOW
ON PRIME TIME TV

224
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,805
I think we'll get to see that.

225
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,008
I will show my butthole.

226
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,611
I think I can take down two or three

227
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,680
with that strategy.

228
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,751
You sat there before, right?

229
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,686
-I did, but... Yeah.
-Right?

230
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,888
I feel more relaxed here.
I'll sit here.

231
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,623
It's a relief to have you here.

232
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,259
It must be different for first-timers,

233
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,129
compared to those with experience.

234
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,363
But...

235
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:35,302
I don't necessarily think that
the experienced players have an advantage.

236
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,070
You're a fierce opponent, too.

237
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,682
-Who is it?
-I have no idea.

238
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,026
It's you.

239
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,297
I am Miyuki Oshima,
from Morisanchu.

240
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,232
So, I'm here.

241
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,902
On Documental.

242
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,837
I got the invitation...

243
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,573
I have no idea what will happen.

244
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,608
She really is funny.

245
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:19,346
There are few female comedians
who could put up a decent fight here.

246
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,147
THE FIRST FEMALE COMPETITOR

247
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,351
But I expect big things from Oshima.

248
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,987
The thing about Oshima is,
her poker face is funny.

249
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,823
EVEN HER POKER FACE IS A WEAPON

250
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,991
People may even laugh at that.

251
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,195
And when push comes to shove,

252
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,330
she can go fully nude.

253
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,165
SHE CAN GO BUCK NAKED

254
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,668
Whether or not that happens,
we'll have to see.

255
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,571
"Can you do it?"
"Can you really make them laugh?"

256
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,606
That's what the invitation meant to me.

257
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,475
So, I will go on the offensive.

258
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,443
Her defenses are weak.

259
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,911
WEAK DEFENSE

260
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,613
After all...

261
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,083
Oshima tends to laugh easily.

262
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:03,656
People often say to me,
"Your husband is rich. Why do you bother?"

263
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,492
They're probably thinking that now.

264
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,761
But we have separate bank accounts.

265
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,930
I use a SIM-free cellphone.

266
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,333
They are cheaper.

267
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,535
It costs 1,200 yen a month.

268
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,806
How many shows would I have to do
at Lumine to earn this much?

269
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,777
How many times would I have to show
my butt to get this amount of money?

270
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,146
Think about that before you judge.

271
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,313
ONE MILLION YEN

272
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,115
-Has it begun?
-Not yet.

273
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,384
-You're building something already.
-I'm not.

274
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,420
-It's cold in here.
-I'm totally normal.

275
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,426
Someone's here.

276
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,268
This is bad. Bad. Bad. Bad.

277
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,603
A monster has arrived.

278
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,138
I see.

279
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,140
I think they may have been surprised

280
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:57,877
because they expected the comedians to be
members of the Yoshimoto agency.

281
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,281
Hi, I'm Yuki Himura
from the duo Bananaman.

282
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,851
I have really been
looking forward to this.

283
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:05,952
I will do my best.

284
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,689
It reflects how Mr. Matsumoto is such
a "pure" person.

285
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,460
I mean, it couldn't get simpler.

286
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,428
We get locked in a room,

287
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,497
and the strongest wins.

288
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:22,268
I think Himura will really be
a tough competitor.

289
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,705
It's like he has a black belt in comedy.

290
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,374
THE BLACK BELT COMEDIAN

291
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:34,314
I think we should consider him
as a contender for the crown.

292
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,616
-Where should I sit?
-Anywhere.

293
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,651
-Probably somewhere around here.
-There?

294
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,821
-But I don't want Himura here.
-There's no other place.

295
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,657
It would be an understatement to say
I laugh easily.

296
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,660
If I find something funny,
I won't be able stop myself.

297
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,731
If I do laugh, I'll just have to accept
that they were too funny.

298
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,099
But for the moment,

299
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,802
I want to have fun.
I want to enjoy the battle.

300
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,470
That's my biggest focus now.

301
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,040
The contest will be a hybrid of
"pro wrestling" and "street fighting."

302
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,010
I look forward to having someone
make a move on me.

303
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,145
There's no point in dodging every attack.

304
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,315
I'll take a few punches on the chin,
and sidestep some others.

305
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:13,219
That's what Documental is all about.

306
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,421
This will be a fun six hours.

307
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:19,325
Ideally,
I'll make every single one of them laugh,

308
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,695
and then take the 10 million yen.
Ideally...

309
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,101
-I'll sit next to you, Daisuke.
-Please, give me a break.

310
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:32,438
-I always end up with a monster here.
-Yes, Jimmy was a monster.

311
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,907
-I'm not a monster.
-You are!

312
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,608
-I'm not a monster.
-Not so fast.

313
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,744
He slapped his money out already.

314
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:41,281
-This can't be true.
-This is fun. It's amazing!

315
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,283
I thought we'd all be Yoshimoto.

316
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,151
Everyone was Yoshimoto last time?

317
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,252
Give me a break.

318
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,355
That face is going to get me every time.
Go over there.

319
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:50,590
Seriously. Move.

320
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:54,727
Now they have no idea who will be coming.

321
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,497
I can imagine that would be unsettling.

322
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,303
-You're a threat.
-And we didn't expect you to be here.

323
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,971
-Really?
-I really was surprised.

324
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,739
-You didn't expect me?
-Not at all.

325
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:08,741
Someone's here.

326
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,713
It's Koji.

327
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,016
I told you.
Not everybody's Yoshimoto.

328
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,919
No way.
This time is going to be tough.

329
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,390
Hi. I'm Kazuya Kojima from the duo Unjash.

330
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,026
I will definitely win today.

331
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,329
Take a step back with that microphone.

332
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,164
Hey!

333
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,500
And stuff like that.
I'm powerful, right?

334
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,002
HE'S POWERFUL?

335
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,638
That was impressive, right?
That's what I do.

336
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:42,008
When I first saw his name,
I thought it was a misprint.

337
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:46,446
I thought,
"Hmm? What? Who the hell are you?"

338
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,781
Why was I selected?

339
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,751
Mr. Matsumoto must really like me.

340
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:55,755
It's not a funny joke, but the fact
he keeps saying it is even unfunnier.

341
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,958
He keeps making that same joke,
over and over.

342
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:01,260
It must have got a couple of laughs, once.

343
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,831
But for the past four years,
he's been making that same bad joke.

344
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,901
The only thing left to say is,
"Who the hell are you?"

345
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:12,605
I don't think he'll go on the attack much.

346
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:13,940
AN EXPERT IN DEFENSE?

347
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,809
But I think his defenses are weak, too.

348
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,048
-Why you?
-Hey, I'm your senior!

349
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,785
-When will you learn?
-They will bug each other all day.

350
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,855
My comedy is simple and, um...

351
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,556
Straightforward.

352
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,358
MR. STRAIGHTFORWARD SIMPLE

353
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:35,094
To be honest,
most people don't laugh at me.

354
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,363
But comedians find me funny.

355
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,034
He is different from Yoshimura.

356
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,935
How can I put it?

357
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:46,873
He's a dunce at comedy,
but we'll see how that pans out.

358
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,541
THE DUNCE

359
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:50,743
-Another unexpected competitor.
-Really?

360
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,078
-No way.
-He's dangerous.

361
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,981
I'm laughing already
just thinking about what'll happen.

362
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:57,817
-The scenery from here is funny already.
-This is bad.

363
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:00,153
-I have Oshima in the background.
-I'm Kojima!

364
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,888
-That wasn't a cue.
-He meant her.

365
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,623
Don't use your best joke already.

366
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,958
-It wasn't a name gaff.
-Messing up already?

367
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,998
Well, Kojima is an idiot.

368
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,101
He has weird reflexes we can't control.

369
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:25,778
-You're back?
-Again?

370
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,814
This is his second time, right?

371
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,216
This guy showed up again?

372
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,552
He came again.

373
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:36,456
I'm Fujimoto from the duo Fujiwara.
This is my second time participating.

374
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:41,060
Last season,
I made it to the final four.

375
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:44,797
This season,
I hope to actually win.

376
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:47,166
I could have refused,

377
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,837
but I didn't want to regret
that decision later.

378
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,206
When I imagined a second season,

379
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,175
without me in that room,

380
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,644
it just didn't feel right.

381
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:02,648
Fujimoto isn't really one to
initiate things,

382
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,517
but he is a mood-maker.

383
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:08,755
He can create chaos within that room

384
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:14,060
and as a by-product of that chaos,
he may be able to trigger some laughter.

385
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,162
I think he'll do that for us.

386
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,800
-I forgot my million yen.
-Really? Then you have to leave.

387
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,101
-Seriously.
-Get out.

388
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:24,303
-Don't say that.
-You're way too relaxed!

389
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,571
This is my second time.

390
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:28,841
I tend to talk too much.

391
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,743
I'm always talking.

392
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,678
I'm always moving around, too.

393
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,948
I think that led to my success
in the last season.

394
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,750
ALWAYS ON THE MOVE

395
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,586
Unfortunately, Fujimoto has a weakness.

396
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,022
He tends to laugh too easily.

397
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:44,857
He laughs at accidental humor.

398
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:50,897
Fujimoto, red card.

399
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,101
Just before I lost, I had a tiny little
thought creep into my mind:

400
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,570
"I don't want to be here anymore."

401
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:01,440
That marked the beginning of
my downfall in the mental battle.

402
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:03,843
It's something you must
experience yourself.

403
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,145
Only those last four people
will understand.

404
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,047
What's this?

405
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,416
That's our question.

406
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,618
-It's not just Yoshimoto?
-It's not fair.

407
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,487
Oshima, quit making that face.

408
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:16,522
-It's too soon.
-I'm not.

409
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,257
-You did.
-I didn't make a face.

410
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,693
-You had a funny air about you.
-I did nothing.

411
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,828
Please stop it.

412
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,663
-Kojima's here, too.
-I am.

413
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,631
-Actually...
-Why are you here?

414
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,166
What's that supposed to mean?

415
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,268
See. He's bad news.

416
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:31,537
-Stop doing that.
-You can't do that.

417
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,140
-Stop it.
-Don't go full-throttle so soon.

418
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:36,375
-He was being rude.
-We have six hours.

419
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:40,479
Comments made from a straight-man
perspective make you laugh more.

420
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:46,419
Hello.

421
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,020
Give us a break!

422
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:49,589
This guy is funny.

423
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,324
-He's funny.
-He really is.

424
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,358
He's funny.

425
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:56,929
I'm Saito, from the trio Jungle Pocket.
I have come to take that 10 million!

426
00:24:58,064 --> 00:24:58,965
Okay!

427
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:02,001
I like this player.

428
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:07,306
He possesses a quality
that I don't have at all.

429
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,976
A UNIQUE CHARACTER

430
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:14,814
I think that Saito will probably be
a constructive player.

431
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,483
This is a surprise.
Don't you all laugh too easily?

432
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,417
We're laughers?

433
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,086
-Good point.
-How true.

434
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,188
-I come from that family.
-The Laughers.

435
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,323
-I'm a laugher.
-Me, too.

436
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,427
Saito seems quite calm and composed.

437
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:33,499
My only weapon is the fact
that I went to acting school.

438
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:38,104
I was trained at the
Bungakuza Theater Company as an actor.

439
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,175
I believe that my acting skills
are my greatest weapon.

440
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:46,679
That's what makes him different
from most comedians.

441
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,615
He is a curve ball of sorts.

442
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:53,519
When I watch him,
that comes across strongly to me.

443
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:56,622
He makes me laugh quite a lot.

444
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:01,260
Wouldn't it be nice if
the audience laughed more at him?

445
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,398
Why does he bomb so much?

446
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:07,867
Sometimes it makes me wonder.

447
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,337
-We have a whole variety of comedians.
-Amazing.

448
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:12,838
This is amazing.

449
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,675
We still have three more coming?
This is enough already.

450
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:17,310
She's making a move.

451
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:18,444
Cut it out!

452
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,246
Quit making that face.

453
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,882
You don't need to use that here.

454
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:25,451
-I'm not pulling a face.
-Yes, you are.

455
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:26,953
She had a baby.

456
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,255
She has a little kid.
Think about that.

457
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:32,591
-She's a mother. Mommy.
-Think about where she's coming from.

458
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,466
-I hate this.
-They get more extreme at the end, right?

459
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,569
Wow.

460
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,172
-I see.
-Him?

461
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,607
-Hello.
-He's the guy who grows on you.

462
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,677
I'm Tsuda, from the Yoshimoto duo Daian.

463
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:53,713
This guy...

464
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,484
I thought it might be nice to invite
a full-blown old-style comedian for once.

465
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:02,421
HE STILL REEKS OF
OLD-STYLE OSAKA

466
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:06,292
I thought that throwing someone like him
into that room

467
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,728
might be worth a try.

468
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:13,032
To be honest,
I haven't even thought about what I'll do.

469
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,401
People usually make fun of me.

470
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:18,637
If nobody makes fun of me,
I might not do anything.

471
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:22,141
Wowowow! Wowowow!
I'm giving you a Wow!

472
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,079
He has a lot of power.

473
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,948
You're lucky to have been called.

474
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,649
I like him. This is bad news.

475
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:33,119
-He's really funny, right?
-He is.

476
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:34,720
Thanks, guys.

477
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,958
He has quite a thick skin.

478
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:42,495
I think he'll hang in there
until the later stages.

479
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:47,033
I have a feeling he'll be one of
the final participants.

480
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:51,470
I prepared half of the million yen myself,
and for the rest...

481
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:55,041
I married into my wife's family
and got it from her grandma.

482
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,843
HE BORROWED 500,000 YEN
FROM HIS WIFE'S GRANDMOTHER

483
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,947
These members are totally different
from what I expected.

484
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,449
Sure was different.

485
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,451
I have no damn idea what you expected.

486
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,120
-Why are you so aggressive? Cut it out.
-What's this?

487
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,990
-Take it easy. We're just chatting.
-Let's enjoy this.

488
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:13,559
We didn't all make predictions, you know?

489
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,366
-He opened the door with vigor.
-Who is it?

490
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,670
-It's Kotouge.
-The guy with all the momentum.

491
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,273
-He's on a roll.
-He sure is.

492
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,242
I'm Kotouge, from the duo Viking.

493
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,445
How am I?

494
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:35,081
Well, my heart is thumping.

495
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,882
He's an interesting player.

496
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:39,885
I wonder how he will get involved.

497
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:44,557
Kotouge has been on a real hot streak.

498
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:50,296
I do want to participate in this.

499
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:53,532
If I were to turn down this opportunity,

500
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,668
I would just be running away.

501
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,436
I'd be running away from comedy.

502
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,572
To be perfectly honest,

503
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,843
it's not like I'm motivated to win
the 10 million yen prize money.

504
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,845
It will be insanely funny in there.

505
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,014
I just want to stay in that room
for as long as I possibly can.

506
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,484
HE WANTS TO EXPERIENCE IT
FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE

507
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,452
He actually laughs easily.

508
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:17,389
On TV, he plays the straight man
who makes funny quips.

509
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,425
He creates laughs by getting angry.

510
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:20,626
THE ANGER ARTIST

511
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:24,497
But, even though most viewers
probably wouldn't expect it,

512
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,232
he laughs at the corniest stuff.

513
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,933
HE LAUGHS AT THE SILLIEST THINGS

514
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,071
Having watched the first season,
I think this is all about "Big Laughs."

515
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,439
NOT SUPERFICIAL JOKES

516
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:36,942
Since I was born with these genes,

517
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,812
I would like to use my head.

518
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,213
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS HEAD

519
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,850
He has a number of issues
in his private life as well.

520
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,586
He got involved in some messy stuff.

521
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:51,524
He might want to escape into work.

522
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,226
I talked to Kotouge about this.

523
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:55,494
That's right.

524
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:57,463
-About Documental.
-Yes, he did.

525
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,766
-After the show?
-He came up and said it looked like fun.

526
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:02,935
I did. Yes.

527
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:05,604
Fujimoto said it was the best gig
he had last year.

528
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:06,639
That's right.

529
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,307
It was just as I thought.

530
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,843
So I said,
"If you ever get the offer, take it."

531
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,178
-That's right.
-Wow.

532
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,246
-We did talk about that.
-Wow.

533
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,953
Seriously?
He armed himself with a prop already?

534
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,154
Who is it?

535
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:25,858
He's started already!

536
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,126
You already started!

537
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:28,527
I'm not doing anything.

538
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:31,230
I'm not.
These are my normal clothes.

539
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,765
That's uncalled-for.

540
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,471
-This is how I want to start.
-Already?

541
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:40,506
That's too quick.

542
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:42,942
I'm Jimmy Onishi. I'm back for revenge.

543
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,710
I will...

544
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:47,613
definitely win,
and take home 10 million yen!

545
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:50,849
I'm wearing a costume and some makeup.

546
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,585
There's nothing wrong with that.

547
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:55,387
This isn't to make them laugh
at the start.

548
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:59,091
I just want to slip in a jab
before it starts.

549
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,194
I figured he'd be participating...

550
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,396
It's like...

551
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:07,733
he's a gift from another planet.

552
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,603
It's impossible for us earthlings
to understand him.

553
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,571
A GIFT FROM OUTER SPACE

554
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:14,907
That's pretty much it.

555
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:19,278
Apparently he was very confident
going into last season.

556
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:23,349
I'm glad that people liked
what I did last time,

557
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,618
but it hasn't led to any new work.

558
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:28,254
I think people don't know how to cast me.

559
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,622
NO EXTRA WORK

560
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,657
-What are you doing?
-Go wash your face!

561
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,460
-Wash that off. Now.
-Seriously.

562
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:37,229
-We have to make a fresh start.
-You're playing dirty.

563
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:38,430
This is a fresh start!

564
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,132
I will definitely win.

565
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,800
Then I'll buy an apartment.

566
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:45,237
I want to live near a convenience store.
Somewhere convenient, um...

567
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:48,073
I want to live somewhere that is
easily accessible.

568
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,875
He's an idiot,

569
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:54,213
but when it comes to comedy,
he can learn and make progress.

570
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,217
I suppose he will have thought up
some kind of plan.

571
00:31:58,484 --> 00:31:59,551
Are you serious?

572
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:02,554
-Is that your own money?
-Of course, it is.

573
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,217
-I can wash it later.
-Okay, you're fine for now.

574
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,253
What a wide variety.

575
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:36,021
This will be amazing.

576
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,058
Why is Oshima acting so innocent?

577
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:40,893
She's building something already.

578
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,594
-What's with you?
-Nothing.

579
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:45,664
The more I know you,
the more I'll laugh, so I'm trying to...

580
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:48,534
That scared me.

581
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,436
Why is he angry again?

582
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,741
What a mean look.

583
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,409
I want to vomit.

584
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:01,146
You all talk a lot, don't you.

585
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,916
You've babbled away the whole time.

586
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,419
-Because we're so nervous.
-Trying to hide the butterflies.

587
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,689
I saw each of your entrances.

588
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:14,259
I think that this lineup truly is amazing.

589
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:18,330
I'm a little worried this might end
in a flash.

590
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:21,934
-He's right.
-I could see that.

591
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,569
And Jimmy, that's not...

592
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,237
Can you have a word with him?

593
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,740
This is for everyone to laugh at
before we start.

594
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:29,808
That's a bit too much.

595
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,877
Don't the rules cover things like this?

596
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:34,279
From the start?

597
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,783
-This must be against the rules.
-He won't read the rules anyway.

598
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,352
If you're going to wear makeup,
be more flamboyant.

599
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,689
It's just subtle enough that
it's annoyingly weird.

600
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:45,657
That's why it's funny.

601
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,027
Does everyone have their million yen?

602
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:51,096
Please take it out.

603
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:52,765
All right?

604
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:56,101
Let's see the million yen in cash

605
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,437
that each of you brought

606
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,172
for this competition.

607
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:05,544
You have the same envelope.

608
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,746
-His has a currency strap.
-It does!

609
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:10,315
We have many UFJ Bank users.

610
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,184
Jimmy, what's that?

611
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:13,719
What's that?

612
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,187
My bible.

613
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,191
-Jimmy, that's...
-Just stop it.

614
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:22,928
You didn't have to fold your envelope
and put it away in your bible.

615
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:24,797
Like I've been saying,

616
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:29,067
it's the comments made from a straight-man
perspective that lead to actual laughter.

617
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:32,404
-That's true.
-But we can't just ignore something funny.

618
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:35,174
Unfortunately, straight comments
multiply the laughs.

619
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,309
-That's so true.
-It sure is.

620
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,445
Please pass around your million yen.

621
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,814
The straight-man role
is the crucial element.

622
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,881
Look at that.

623
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:45,818
If you sense something's funny,
you can't stop yourself.

624
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,586
You react with the perfect timing.

625
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:50,189
Wow.
I'm passing around millions of yen.

626
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,723
Jimmy did something again.

627
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,525
He'll check one million is there.

628
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:55,093
It's not all there.

629
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,897
The straighter the comeback,
the funnier it becomes.

630
00:34:58,997 --> 00:34:59,932
How true.

631
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,201
Look at that.

632
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:05,704
That is amazing.

633
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,674
And I wonder if you've all
noticed something.

634
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,243
There is 10 million yen here now.

635
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,213
The winner of this competition
takes home 10 million.

636
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:16,181
That's how it's supposed to work.

637
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:19,451
But that doesn't mean
you actually win 10 million yen.

638
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,220
It's only nine million in profit.

639
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:23,889
Leave the rest to me.

640
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,524
Really?

641
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:29,027
WHOEVER DOESN'T LAUGH
GETS 10 MILLION YEN

642
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,562
PLUS MATSUMOTO'S MILLION YEN

643
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,831
-Wow!
-That's 11 million yen!

644
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,268
Look at that.

645
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,670
-The currency strap is yellow.
-For real?

646
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,507
Amazing.

647
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,142
That makes more sense.

648
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:46,812
Exactly. This is how it should be.

649
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,816
But this looks a bit ugly,
so we'll be giving the winner this.

650
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:51,850
New bills.

651
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:56,889
And my contribution goes here.

652
00:35:57,456 --> 00:36:00,359
To actually see that with my own eyes
is truly amazing.

653
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:03,762
One of you will be taking this home today.

654
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,432
-"The Japanese Dream."
-Come on!

655
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,800
That's the Japanese Dream.

656
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,202
Please take a seat.

657
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,203
Come on!

658
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:15,908
I believe that you've all seen
the last season of this show.

659
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:18,043
I'll be using these again.

660
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,245
-Red and yellow cards.
-Okay.

661
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:22,214
In extreme cases,

662
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,550
I may use the red card
without any warning.

663
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,886
-But I doubt that will happen.
-Okay.

664
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:31,924
If you get two yellow cards,
you will be removed from the competition.

665
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,458
Two yellows and we're out.

666
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,328
In that case,
you go home without your million yen.

667
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:37,963
Only two yellows?

668
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,398
Are we clear?

669
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,800
And one more thing. This time...

670
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:44,970
The time limit is six hours.

671
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,339
But if six hours have passed,

672
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:51,243
and we still have two or three people
remaining,

673
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,879
we'll implement the point system.

674
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:55,647
-What's that?
-Point system?

675
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,616
Over the next six hours,

676
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,752
the player who has accumulated
the most points becomes

677
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:02,988
the winner.

678
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,757
-This time we'll definitely have a winner.
-No draws?

679
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,659
IF THERE'S NO VICTOR AFTER SIX HOURS,

680
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,028
WHOEVER'S MADE THE OTHERS LAUGH
THE MOST WINS

681
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:11,997
So, be aggressive about getting laughs.

682
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:16,168
We will be recording who took out who.

683
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,736
I see.

684
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,471
You can't win by keeping quiet?

685
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,239
You can't win if you play it safe.

686
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,742
-We have to mrrrm mrrm...
-Sorry?

687
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,644
We have to make a move, right?

688
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:26,945
That's right.

689
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,580
He's got it.

690
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,015
We have to make a move.

691
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,784
And we've also prepared a few props.

692
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,120
They're over here.

693
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,090
You don't have to use them.

694
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:41,059
What are these clips?
Maybe they're for your nipples.

695
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:42,761
-That sounds useful.
-Okay.

696
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,496
-Good luck to you all.
-Thank you.

697
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,765
-Let's do this!
-Let's have fun.

698
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:49,234
-Are you serious?
-We should have fun, right?

699
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,203
Right?

700
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:54,473
We'll get to witness the ultimate show.

701
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:56,274
It's okay to lose.

702
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,243
What's with the shirt?

703
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,646
This isn't for laughs.
I liked the design.

704
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:01,913
You like how it's funny.

705
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:04,650
If you weren't after laughs,
you wouldn't wear that.

706
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,184
Is it that funny?

707
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,353
-Yes, it is.
-No, it's stylish.

708
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,988
Or you're a werewolf.

709
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:13,091
This is bad. Really bad.

710
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,760
Well then,

711
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,562
let us begin!

712
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:21,400
-We can't laugh anymore, right?
-This is it.

713
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:23,168
-No more laughing?
-Right.

714
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:24,469
The battle starts now.

715
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,505
Everyone. Have some crackers.

716
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:27,939
Crack...

717
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,207
-Take one.
-For us?

718
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:30,776
Yeah. It's nice to meet you.

719
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,345
This is my first time with Jimmy.

720
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:35,580
-It's nice to meet you.
-The honor's mine.

721
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,450
Please take these crackers as
a token of new friendship.

722
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:41,420
-What are they?
-A token of new friendship.

723
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,055
-Why crackers?
-I'll go without.

724
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,556
Crackers for friendship?

725
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,525
They make your mouth dry.

726
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,061
-Didn't you just laugh?
-I didn't.

727
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,195
The truth is...

728
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:52,898
That was quick.

729
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,567
-That was probably Jimmy.
-Yeah, Jimmy.

730
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,436
-He was laughing.
-Yes, he laughed.

731
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,639
-The decision's been made.
-No way.

732
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,675
-It was Jimmy or Yoshimura.
-Jimmy laughed.

733
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,112
It wasn't me.
I was just being normal.

734
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,580
Are you an idiot?

735
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,483
You laughed just like normal.

736
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:13,819
-He did.
-You laughed, right?

737
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:16,054
You were smiling the whole time, right?

738
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,390
You laughed the whole time.

739
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:20,325
You've been on the show before.

740
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,360
-Did I laugh?
-You absolutely did.

741
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,263
-You laughed.
-That was shocking.

742
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,766
You laughed before the start,
and never stopped.

743
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:28,867
The whole time.

744
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:30,869
He has the cards.

745
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,038
Not so fast.

746
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:34,773
-How quick!
-You laughed too hard.

747
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,441
You get an orange card.

748
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:39,377
ORANGE CARDS ARE WARNINGS
LESS SERIOUS THAN YELLOW

749
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:42,047
-You call that laughing?
-You really were laughing.

750
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,548
You laughed!

751
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:45,050
-Why crackers?
-I'm fine.

752
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,618
Crackers for friendship?

753
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,420
They make your mouth dry.

754
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,222
The truth is...

755
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,591
That was quick.

756
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:54,993
I was just talking.

757
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,863
-The talking bit wasn't a problem.
-But you laughed, too.

758
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,397
You kept on smiling,

759
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:01,032
and then you went, "Ha ha ha."

760
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,167
That's laughing.

761
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:04,002
You went, "Ha ha ha."

762
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:05,437
That's laughing out loud.

763
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:07,572
This is your second season.

764
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:11,309
-I hate having the clock stopped so early.
-Our thoughts exactly.

765
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:12,644
Are you nervous?

766
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:14,679
You have a weird pimple.

767
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:16,047
Please stop that.

768
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:17,616
It will become funny.

769
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:18,683
Mr. Matsumoto!

770
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,585
-It's bleeding.
-Stop sucking us in.

771
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:21,553
It's bleeding.

772
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,488
Blood's coming from his weird pimple.

773
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:25,557
-I have to take a look.
-For real?

774
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,693
-It's bleeding.
-It is!

775
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,796
No more messing around, okay?

776
00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:33,665
-We get a cue?
-Yes.

777
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,634
Let's pour vinegar on them.

778
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,004
How dare you pour vinegar on my panties?

779
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:40,906
Because he was taking too long.

780
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,040
This is too much!

781
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,475
It's my fault. I used them.

782
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:45,310
Ow!

783
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:47,579
That hurt!

784
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,614
What are you doing to my gag?

785
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:51,817
My fingers are too weak.

786
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,486
They'll go rusty.

787
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,556
-What's he doing?
-He's not getting our point.

788
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,525
-Huh?
-What is this?
