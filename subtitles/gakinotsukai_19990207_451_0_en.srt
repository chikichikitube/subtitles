1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,589
* Itao is watching! *

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,250
Downtown's Gaki No Tsukai's first. . .

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,839
"Knock away winter's coldness! Blazing Badminton Match!"

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:15,169
Well, let's get started!

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,039
Today, all of us are going to shake off the winter--

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,800
Okay, let's go!

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,050
First, we have Hamada-Endou team!

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,530
And next we have Matsumoto-Tanaka team!

9
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,700
- Haha. A dropkick!

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,160
- Okay, everyone! To the court!

11
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,030
- That sounded defeated at the end!

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,890
* Match start! *

13
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,269
- That was in!

14
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,040
- Which one was it? In or out?

15
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,180
We've got money on the line!

16
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,870
- Just a minute. Look over there.

17
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,309
- Who's that? - Is that. . . ?

18
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,180
That's Itao-san, isn't it?

19
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:47,819
- Ah! It is!

20
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,879
* A figure similar to Ittsuji Itao from 130R is looking down from the veranda *

21
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,780
- Is he worrying you? - Well, it is a little hard to do with him staring.

22
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,890
- He is staring pretty hard.

23
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:00,579
- Maybe someone should go up there?

24
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,780
- Fujiwara! (Downtown's manager)

25
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,450
- Itao's up there.

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,460
He's up there watching us.

27
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,400
- That is Itao.

28
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,530
Manager Fujiwara goes up to ask Itao to return to his room, because it's worrying the crew.

29
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:26,620
- Excuse me. Um...

30
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,890
Knowing that Itao is watching. . .

31
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:32,709
It's making it a little difficult for us.

32
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,050
- Why?

33
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,790
- Well, performing in front of someone they know...

34
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,849
makes them feel weird, knowing that it's you watching.

35
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,569
- Well just tell them "Don't worry about it".

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,070
Then you can just go ahead with it.

37
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,479
- We'd like to get done soon though.

38
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,819
- Ah. That's fine. I was about to step out.

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,719
- Oh, is that so?

40
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,400
Then hurry up and go.

41
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,229
- Are we okay now? - Okay. Let's go.

42
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,280
* The match resumes *

43
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,449
- That was out! Out!

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,090
- Look at it! It's way out!

45
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,870
- You can't swipe at it. Can't swipe at it!

46
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,939
- Again.

47
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,350
Eh, Fujiwara. Didn't he say he was leaving?

48
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,319
- Well, I did go up there and talk to him. Sorry.

49
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,490
- But didn't he say he was going somewhere?

50
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,040
- Yes. He was going out, so would be able to play.

51
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,000
- He hasn't even changed clothes.

52
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:53,099
I think the way you said it was too polite.

53
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,229
Maybe if you made it clear that this is a problem.

54
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,150
This time, numerous people go to talk to Itao.

55
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,770
- You guys could have kept going, couldn't you?

56
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,310
- Well they say it's hard to work with you staring.

57
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,980
- Why is that?

58
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,550
You don't have to say stuff like that.

59
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,529
Right?

60
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:28,289
- They are saying that it's difficult to work.

61
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,629
Oh, really?

62
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:31,560
- It's making them tense.

63
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,199
- Well, maybe it is.

64
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,449
- I understand. I get it. - Thank you very much.

65
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:43,199
* Finally, Itao returns to his room *

66
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,710
* The match resumes *

67
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:51,019
- I saw that! I saw it!

68
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,759
That was out! Out!

69
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,800
- This is Set Point!

70
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:12,560
- It's Set Point!

71
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,040
- Um... Wait a minute.

72
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:19,659
Sorry.

73
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,430
- Him again?!

74
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,519
Once again, Itao is watching the shoot on location.

75
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,069
- Does someone have my cell phone?

76
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,569
Yeah, Matsumoto. Call him.

77
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,420
- Hello.

78
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,040
- Itao? - Yes.

79
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,850
- Hey. It's Matsumoto. - Ah. Good morning.

80
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,540
- You probably already know this, but we're shooting on location today.

81
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,349
- It looks like you are, doesn't it?

82
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:59,680
- Well, sometimes you seem to be getting in the shot by accident.

83
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,679
- Ah! Is that so?

84
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,500
But, on the other hand. . .

85
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,779
I kind of thought of that.

86
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,829
But you're the one that came here on your own.

87
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:13,000
- That is true, but...

88
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,230
what are you doing?

89
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,919
- Well today is a day off for me. I was going to go out for a little while.

90
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,309
- At what time?

91
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,920
- I'll just step out, then.

92
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:26,929
- Really? Well, whenever you're ready.

93
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,509
- But what's is with all of this?

94
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,089
Normally, you'd be fine.

95
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,440
* Suddenly Itao gets mad * - You decide to shoot on location here.

96
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:46,730
- Well, do you mind if I put you on with Suga-san?

97
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,050
- Sure.

98
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,750
- He seems like he wants to talk to you.

99
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,340
- Hello.

100
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,890
* Because Itao is getting angry, they pass the phone over to producer Suga *

101
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,460
Hi, this is producer Suga from Nihon TV.

102
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,619
- Ah, hello. - Good mo~rning!

103
00:06:57,619 --> 00:07:00,149
We wouldn't have a problem if it was just the general public.

104
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,569
But now they're all thinking, "Isn't that Itao?"

105
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:07,220
And the viewers are going to be look up there too.

106
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:13,839
- I get all that, but you came here and this is MY house.

107
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,739
What's with all of this?

108
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,040
Was it something I did?

109
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,919
- No it's not like that at all.

110
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:26,270
- But you are talking like I did do something wrong.

111
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:33,139
Even though I'm a fan of Nihon TV. That's unfortunate.

112
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,950
- Well, we thank you watching and supporting us, but...

113
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,320
- That makes you feel bad, doesn't it?

114
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:49,620
Getting told something like that over the phone.

115
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,599
- I am personally asking you.

116
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:56,499
It is rude for me to ask something like this of you.

117
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,410
But for obvious reasons, we're here covering an event, and would appreciate your cooperation.

118
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:06,329
*Producer Suga brings up the idea of giving some money in return *

119
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,219
- Well, if there's nothing else...

120
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:14,639
I mean, if I'm not going to get anything else from Nihon TV.

121
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,290
Something heartfelt.

122
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,190
- Once again, we're trying to shoot here, so we're asking for cooperation.

123
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,249
- Well, that has some substance to it.

124
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,249
- Thank you. Without a doubt, when we finish, you can feel free to do as you please.

125
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:35,349
- Well, there's no reason for me to make demands, then.

126
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,690
* Finally, Itao returns to his room again *

127
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,630
- I never thought he'd get angry like he did.

128
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:51,980
But let's do this before he comes back.

129
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:55,299
- When we left off, it was Set Point.

130
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,149
* The match resumes *

131
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:05,539
* This time Itao is calling Matsumoto on his cellular phone *

132
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,550
- Hello?

133
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,069
- Hello. It's Itao.

134
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:14,189
Do you mind putting Suga on again?

135
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,009
- Hello. - Hello.

136
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,380
You know what happened before?

137
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:28,269
All that stuff that started to take form...

138
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,150
Are you going to be paying Yoshimoto? (Itao's and Downtown's Talent Agency)

139
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:35,659
Then are they going to be spreading it on to me?

140
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,969
- This is more of a personal matter, isn't it?

141
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:43,460
So it should be fine if I just pay you directly, correct?

142
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,820
- Well, if you put it like that... that's completely fine with me.

143
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,229
But when you do, make the check out to "130R's Itao".

144
00:09:55,939 --> 00:10:00,349
As an "Appearance on a TV program" fee.

145
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,710
- HUH?!

146
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,529
- Did something just come up?

147
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,879
- A fee?!

148
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,740
- Of course so.

149
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,749
If I were an amateur, you probably wouldn't have a problem.

150
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,630
- Wait a second.

151
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,099
* This time, Itao is requesting an appearance fee *

152
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:21,099
This is a shot on location, so it's not like we asked him to be here.

153
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,479
- Tell him an "I'm sorry, but..." type of thing.

154
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,090
His wife is probably behind this, calculating the plan.

155
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,279
It's like he's doing all this for his wife.

156
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,590
- Hello. As for the fee...

157
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:40,389
It will be paid to Yoshimoto, assuming you do this.

158
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,100
- So all of that is okay? - Yes, yes.

159
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:47,289
- If that's true, do you mind if I just come and get it myself?

160
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:49,029
- HUH?!

161
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,210
- I'm was just about to go out.

162
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:57,879
- You mean if you come and get it? - Along those lines, yeah.

163
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,310
I'm not really saying anything.

164
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,490
I'm just saying, in case if you to say so...

165
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,439
I'm the one that brought up the whole fee thing.

166
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,329
So I don't know whether I can come collect it or not.

167
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,769
But if it came down to it, it would be fine if I just came down there, wouldn't it?

168
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,509
I am already going out and all.

169
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,560
* Suga reluctantly bargains with the persistant Itao *

170
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,319
- He said he's coming down personally to get the money.

171
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,769
- He hasn't changed clothes at all!

172
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:45,319
- Didn't he say he was going somewhere?

173
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,060
- He said because he was going somewhere, he'd just come get it.

174
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:54,269
- You were going somewhere? - Yes, I was about to go.

175
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:56,709
This flew into my house, by the way.

176
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
- This one just flew in?

177
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,480
- Maybe my wife appeared on camera too...

178
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,660
- Well, we don't know if that happened.

179
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,980
- But we know that I was in the camera.

180
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,469
- We will cut that out, in postproduction.

181
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,370
- But since I was on film...

182
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,300
- Will that might be, but those shots were no good.

183
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,249
- But I think you got my wife on camera.

184
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,220
So, you're all the staff?

185
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:50,120
* For some reason, Itao suddenly takes a photograph *

186
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,999
- Well, this is what we talked about...

187
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,490
* Suga hands the promised money over to Itao *

188
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:00,399
- Haha. He was covering it up.

189
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:05,659
- Sorry for all the trouble.

190
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,749
Sorry for bothering you.

191
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:15,209
- So what do we do about the wife, if we got Itao's wife on film too?

192
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,819
-If that happened, instead of an appearance fee...

193
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,209
she'd probably take us to court.

194
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:23,879
- Probably, that's why he took that evidence photo.

195
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,459
- Just in case it came to that?

196
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,870
- So, who won and who lost?

197
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,290
* Everyone loses their will to continue the shoot *

198
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,319
- In the end, both teams lose.

199
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,560
- Everyone loses.

200
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,399
* Everyone loses! *

201
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:46,199
- Well, it can't be helped.

202
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:49,610
* This story is fiction. *
