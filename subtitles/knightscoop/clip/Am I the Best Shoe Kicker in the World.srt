why was i doing it the whole time??

27
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,460
when did you realize you were good at shoe kicking?

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,920
pretty soon after i got into elementary school...

29
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,860
is when i started... but this is really, like, poor people's culture

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,380
poor... po-

31
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,660
well, poor people kinda just make games and play with what they've got, right?

32
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,720
that's kinda, the background that i got into it with

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,340
will i... be playing against you?

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:23,980
oh, really?

35
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,420
but... to beat me, just investigating here... would be too easy, huh?

36
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,100
yeah you're right

37
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,660
i want to play against someone better

38
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,940
well, i'd like to introduce...

39
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:40,540
weclome! this is Morishima Hiroaki! a goal scorer in the soccer world-cup representing Japan!

40
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,640
oh

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,000
Cerezo Osaka’s... ambassador

42
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
his face doesn't really look like he cares huh??

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,340
well, i think he doesn't know who you are!

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,500
sorry

45
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,300

46
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,700

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,760

49
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,360
BUT! what is it that you were confident in??

50
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,880
i think i will definitely beat you at shoe-kicking

51
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:08,919

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,220

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,460

54
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,060
