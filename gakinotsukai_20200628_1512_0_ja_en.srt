00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
High Tension The Best Ten

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
A stage where comedians raise their tension to the limit and show their ultimate talent

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Homemade High Tension The Best Ten

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,440
Good afternoon!

6
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,940
We're always high around the house.

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,360
But you know... we've all been watch� proceedings all night...

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,280
Right now we're in a very dangerous situation as this is my first job alone...

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
We will give you a chance to appear in the show.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
Yes, yes, it's late night.

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
I have money.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
We called various agencies.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,280
297 entertainers are going to be in the show.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
I can't even earn electricity bill.

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
Well, today...

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
No, I'm not talking about that.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Today, we are going to have a live broadcast with the entertainers who passed the original VTR screening.

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Yes, there are people who haven't been able to stop the water supply.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,280
And now that the staff's movement is restricted, it is impossible to prepare costumes and props.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:38,280
Therefore, we will use things that are at home and things that can be purchased at supermarkets and convenience stores to show high tension.

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Please prepare it yourself.

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,280
That's why I have a sense.

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Certainly.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,280
I think you can see the brightness of the light.

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,280
Let's go to the ranking.

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,280
This week's 10th place is...

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
51 points.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Amagie-sama, please.

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,280
For the world, Kogoriko Tanaka Naoki!

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
Kaneda-san

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Yes

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,280
As usual, you're in 10th place

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,280
On the contrary, I think it's a great sense of stability

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,280
You're going to keep this 10th place

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Wait.

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Hey, senpai, are you talking?

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Oh, wait.

38
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Right now, where is the living room?

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,280
I'm in the living room, waiting to be served.

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Are you the waiter?

41
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,280
No, I'm not the waiter. I'm always bad-mouthing.

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,280
You're not the waiter?

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,280
The comedians are not the waiter.

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,280
What did you do during the quarantine?

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:06,280
I watched the past contents of the child's user again on Hulu.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,280
You've been doing it all the time.

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
I've noticed.

48
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,280
This program is pretty interesting.

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Then I'll do it right away.

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,080
But Mr. Hakano, this time, all the comedians are shooting a video.

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,680
I'd like you to watch it now.

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,880
Understood.

53
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,080
This week's 10th place, Naoki Kogoriko Tanaka,

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,880
please welcome Amabie-sama for the world.

55
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,680
Did you shoot this when you were alone?

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
I wonder what it is.

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,680
I think he has a son.

58
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
There should be more voices.

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,680
He is a little bit concerned.

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
He is.

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,680
No, no, no, there should be more.

62
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
In front of the neighborhood.

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,180
Well, yes. This is the limit of the Japanese household affairs.

64
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,680
That's right.

65
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,680
There's no sound at all.

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Yes.

67
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
No, there's no sound.

68
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,680
No, there's no sound at all.

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Thank you very much.

70
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Are you excited?

71
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Of course I was going to be more excited, but when I was standing by, I met Koichi's son a little bit.

72
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Let's continue. The 9th place this week is...

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,680
88 points. The old man who broke at Stay Home. Shimafuri Myojo, Seiya.

74
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Congratulations!

75
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Tsuya-san, it's your first time on the show, right?

76
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Yes, it is.

77
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Where are you sitting right now?

78
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
This is the living room.

79
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Living room?

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
This is the only place I can relax.

81
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Is that so?

82
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Have you seen the show?

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,680
It's a one-yen coin.

84
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,680
What?

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Is this a radio?

86
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Yes, it is.

87
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,680
It's as if the radio is helping me.

88
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,680
Thank you for the tip

89
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,680
But Matsumoto-san, he has a special skill that he has acquired during this stay home period

90
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,680
That's right, I have been training my body like a bodyguard at home

91
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,680
I can put the ball on my head in this small space at home like a play

92
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,680
It's the most attractive thing that I think of downtown

93
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
This is amazing

94
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Oh, amazing

95
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
What is that?

96
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
It's a dice.

97
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
It's a dice.

98
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
It might be better to have it done.

99
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Here we go.

100
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Is it really done?

101
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
It's done.

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Wow.

103
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
What is the charm of downtown?

104
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
What is the charm of downtown?

105
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
However...

106
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,700
The lady started figuratively

107
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,960
Shooting dip

108
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,160
I've got an upset voice

109
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:28,300
Like groomed

110
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,580
This was a funny gag

111
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,120
Seriously?

112
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,080
That's awesome

113
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,260
It was just a vibrato

114
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,660
Do it as gently as 10 times as usual

115
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,740
Sorry

116
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,200
The old man who broke down at the home of the Shio-Uri Myojo Seiya

117
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,200
The old man who broke down

118
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:10,200
100, milk, 111, right, circle, city office, district office, flower, flower, flower

119
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Flower water, stupid, sorry, ramen, gold, gold, gold, anniversary

120
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,700
80, Bush, President, Lindberg, Spielberg

121
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
Won't you prom corectly?

122
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:29,200
Generousel

123
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,680
Harts

124
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,360
my

125
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,980
now

126
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,400
Alter

127
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,680
Ten

128
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,900
현

129
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,380
House

130
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,380
The second half was good, wasn't it?

131
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,380
I think the second half was really good.

132
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,380
Thank you very much.

133
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,380
But I thought you were more out of voice in the first half.

134
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,380
That was the limit in Setagaya.

135
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,380
Tanaka-san.

136
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,380
Yes.

137
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
How was it? Watching that?

138
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,380
I'm also from Setagaya, but I thought it was okay to speak out so much.

139
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,380
Let's continue.

140
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,380
This week's No.8 is...

141
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,380
No.136, Shibata-shou Shibata-shou, the head of the Jichō-kacho, Junichi Komoto!

142
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,380
Congratulations!

143
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,380
Hello!

144
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,380
Nice to meet you.

145
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,380
So, you're home now, but is anyone home?

146
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,380
Right now, my wife, son, and daughter are home.

147
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,380
There are a lot of them.

148
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,380
All of them?

149
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,380
There are a lot of them.

150
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,380
Yes.

151
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,380
All of them are gathered here.

152
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,380
I don't laugh so much that I don't have any proof.

153
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,380
By the way, I heard that your son participated in this high tension.

154
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,380
Thank you.

155
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:37,380
Also, the 10th and 9th places are not so loud.

156
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,380
As a Setagaya group, I will definitely show you that you can do this much in Setagaya.

157
00:09:44,380 --> 00:10:02,380
Let's teach Katakuri

158
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,880
It's okay now! Let's fix your shoulder joint!

159
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
It's starting!

160
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:21,380
First, to fix your shoulder joint, move your shoulders a lot!

161
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,200
イハ and costs

162
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,200
イハ Gex

163
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,380
The spin is spirit

164
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,060
Let's spread this pain down, down

165
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,500
I found a solution, Kojima!

166
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,140
There was movement

167
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,420
It's moving, it's moving

168
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,420
From the kitchen to the bathroom,

169
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,420
I learned from my child.

170
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,420
If you take a bath, you'll be fine.

171
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,420
My son is taking a picture of my son.

172
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,420
Thank you very much.

173
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,420
That was wonderful, Komachi-san.

174
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,420
But after the son took the picture,

175
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,420
I couldn't hear his laughter at all.

176
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,920
Yes

177
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,420
It's getting better

178
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,920
What happened, Go-moto-san?

179
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Now I'm sad

180
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,420
I'm doing it well but no one is laughing

181
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
It's amazing

182
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:43,920
Yes

183
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,420
Let's continue

184
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,920
This week's 7th place is

185
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,920
253 points, 27 points

186
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
Shimawari Myoujo, Soshina

187
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Congratulations!

188
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
Congratulations!

189
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Congratulations!

190
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Congratulations!

191
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,920
I think the color of the curtains is the same as that of the Seiya-san.

192
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Is it different?

193
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
It may be similar.

194
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
It's similar, isn't it?

195
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
It's similar.

196
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
The fan is the same as the Seiya-san.

197
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Really?

198
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,920
You're the one who's imitating it!

199
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Mr. Toshino!

200
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,920
You were scared, right?

201
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,920
You were scared, right?

202
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,920
How about you, Shimomira?

203
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
You don't have any work, right?

204
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,920
I work on remote recording like this

205
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,920
But on the contrary, I don't have any work with people

206
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
I see

207
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,920
I went to the studio for the first time in a while

208
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,920
I recorded with the person who appeared

209
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,420
That was last week's Downtown Deluxe.

210
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,920
Oh, that was it.

211
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,920
I was told that I shouldn't greet the audience in the downtown of Takada.

212
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Yes, yes, yes.

213
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Matsumoto-san was sitting in the front room and I was sitting there.

214
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Oh, that's right.

215
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,920
At that time, I was wearing a suit with a slightly lighter color than emerald green.

216
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,920
That's right. I remember.

217
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
He said to me,

218
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
What color is that?

219
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
He said to me.

220
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
What color is that suit?

221
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Yes, yes, yes.

222
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
I really couldn't think of anything.

223
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
No, no, no.

224
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
No, it's okay.

225
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,920
I replied in a weak way.

226
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,920
I've never seen him laugh so much.

227
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Thank you very much.

228
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,920
I didn't say that to Okamoto, but I'll say it to Nakamura Shota.

230
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Are you okay?

231
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,920
He's the next top.

232
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Did you see the three's high tension?

233
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,920
I saw it. It's called low-class.

234
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,920
I feel like it's Setagaya wherever I go.

235
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,920
I was high-tension like Minato.

236
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,920
This week's 7th place, Shimowari Myoujo, 27 POTS!

237
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
What? It's making a lot of noise.

238
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
I'm not going to do it.

239
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
It's out.

240
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
This music is not good.

241
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
You're wearing a long hat.

242
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
We've done it before.

243
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
There's no pattern at all.

244
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,920
No, no, no, no.

245
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
No, no, no.

246
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Thank you very much.

247
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,920
How was it?

248
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,920
No, not really.

249
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
That's right.

250
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Among the 97 candidates, the ones who didn't make it to the top of the list are the ones who are just a little bit behind.

251
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
They're about to reach the top 10.

252
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Let's CUT marca into two

253
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,480
Then, it's time to serve нельзя

254
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:47,760
mussteını

255
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,740
It's done

256
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Hey, don't forget to save the

257
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,420
Hahaha!

258
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,280
I'm pou manga.

259
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,400
This is your business Sp Yani School Kyou.

260
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,920
I wish he had a Javelin.

261
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,220
Yes, I played him many times!

262
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,400
It is absolutely no fool or human feeling.

263
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:25,740
He was used by theêThe żeby全選'

264
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
It would be nice if you show this one.

265
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,740
This girl uses it a lot.

266
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,740
It has a sense of movement.

267
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,740
Showing the silhouette of the Arnold.

268
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,740
From the outside and from the outside.

269
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,740
Hey, it's good, it's good

270
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,740
Amazing, it's really good

271
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,740
Due to the influence of the new corona, there is no work

272
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,740
The only thing that was saved was the delivery man Hamada's treat

273
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,740
The 6th year of his career, Nanoharao Azuma!

274
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
It's pretty spacious.

275
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,740
That's right.

276
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
That was close.

277
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,740
That was close.

278
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,740
From a dancer to an artist, a man who has a beautiful body

279
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,740
has borrowed his wife's power to become a high tension stage

280
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,740
10 years of experience in the entertainment industry, Kevin

281
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Wife?

282
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
Oh, is that so?

283
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,340
Ernie is so sweet

284
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,300
It is so gonna be like Hawaii

285
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,360
Yea

286
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,020
if you put the voice together

287
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,320
What happened?

288
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,320
I'm not going to use Twitter.

289
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
No!

290
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,320
He's not satisfied with his work, he's going to do 50 push-ups with these two.

291
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,320
He wants to pay for the three months' rent with his TV character tonight.

292
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Yoshimatsu Gorilla!

293
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,520
PUBG

294
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,960
This is going to be rough

295
00:19:12,440 --> 00:18:57,380
выз

296
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:13,600
Something's in the eye

297
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,460
Aww

298
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460
OK!

299
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,460
My eyes hurt.

300
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,460
You're still standing.

301
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,460
I'm still going.

302
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
I'm scared.

303
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
I'm still panicking.

304
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
See? It's going to happen.

305
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
Ouch!

306
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,460
It's going to happen.

307
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,460
OK!

308
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,460
OK!

309
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,460
OK!

310
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,460
OK!

311
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,460
Sorry, but I can't do this.

312
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,460
OK!

313
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,460
I don't like this.

314
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
This is a big problem.

315
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
Really?

316
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,460
OK!

317
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,460
OK!

318
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,460
OK!

319
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,460
OK!

320
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:12,460
That was the best show ever!

321
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,460
I think it was good, right?

322
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Everyone was pretty good.

323
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,460
Everyone was better than Tanaka.

324
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
That's true.

325
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,460
I was watching and thought,

326
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,460
how can I do this with high tension?

327
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,460
You still have a lot to learn.

328
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,460
6th place is...

329
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,460
389 points. This is the real Mofunyo.

330
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,460
Tenjiku sensei, Kawabata-sumi.

331
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,460
Congratulations.

332
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,460
What is Mofunyo?

333
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,460
Don't act like you don't know.

334
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
What?

335
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,460
Are you really a shiba?

336
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,460
Did you see the high tension with other people?

337
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,460
I didn't see that.

338
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,460
Why?

339
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,460
Why?

340
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,460
Sorry, I was just sitting there.

341
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,460
You are really a devil.

342
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,460
What were you doing during your stay?

343
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,460
I was drawing.

344
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,460
Oh, you have such hobbies.

345
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
You showed me something.

346
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:31,460
This is a little beard, but it's a little NLDK.

347
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,460
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

348
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
I have it.

349
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,460
No, no.

350
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,460
I'm writing what I don't have.

351
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Oh, really?

352
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,460
This is not.

353
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,460
It's the one that seems to be able to take the kebab that was raised by a woman.

354
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,460
I have quite a lot of this.

355
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
I have it.

356
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,460
No, not at all.

357
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,460
I'm writing a story that I didn't think about it.

358
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,460
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,460
No.6 of this week, Tenjiku Nezumi and Kawahara Katsumi.

360
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,460
This is the real Mofun-nyo.

361
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,460
Will it be high tension from here?

362
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,460
Thank you for waiting.

363
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
Thank you for waiting.

364
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:42,460
Okay, under the nose, under the nose, under the upper lip, between the upper lip and the lower lip, in the middle, here, from here, to the top of the knee plate, to here, this width, this width beam, beam!

365
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,460
Cat, cat, cat.

366
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,860
