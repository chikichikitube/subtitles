1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai Arahen, the 28th year's new regular show, Nishikawa Kiyoshi Audition!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He really wants to be the regular of this show.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sure he will.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
He will?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why would he?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He said he would never lower his gyala.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He's very strong.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's amazing.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He said he would never lower his gyala from 250.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I thought that was amazing.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The host of the comedy show, Nishikawa Kiyoshi.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He led the Mantaifumu with Yoko Emeyashi and became the leader of Yoshimoto.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He wanted to become a regular of Gaki no Sky.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So, Nishikawa Kiyoshi held an audition for Gaki no Sky.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If these 5 people can join, wouldn't it be a bit awkward?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's not awkward at all.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, it's better if they don't join.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But...

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But what?

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No way!

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know!

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm doing it!

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, I'm not sure.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Tanaka is still not well.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He's not well.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How many times do you say that?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He's really not well.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm getting thinner.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You're right.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm getting thinner.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm getting thinner.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I wonder if he was doing RIZER, but he's getting thinner at the same pace.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is a lie.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He's doing RIZER.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I see.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Mental RIZER.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Mental RIZER.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm fine.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm fine.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's call him. Please come in.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Please come in.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Please come to your seat.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Please come in.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Can I sit down?

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I met you guys about 4 years ago

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I felt like I was at the edge of death

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So I'm a little nervous today

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
One more time!

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm scared of this

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
One more time

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Please do it regularly

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How about it? Could you tell us the good points of each member?

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The first thing I want to say is how serious Tanaka san is.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He is the person I can trust the most in the entertainment world.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, is that so?

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hose san, you have moved to Rakuoka.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I think that is great.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thank you.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It is difficult to go to Osaka after realizing that place.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It is great.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Matsumoto-san, you've become rounder since you had a child.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're really great, but you're really polite.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You've done a good job with the morning greetings and the afternoon greetings.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You've become able to do it properly.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I was really surprised.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
After all, you have to have children.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I see.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I shot the full-body shot of you, but at that time, thank you for the first email.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What kind of email was it?

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I was told to do my best in Medama.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I was told to come back soon. I'll be waiting at the scene.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is that true?

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes, it is.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I was called Medama right away.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Were you called Medama?

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well...

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Since I was little.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, you were called Kanade-san.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't usually call him that.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So, if you get this regular, would you be okay with a medallion?

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If I could, I would have stopped him at Nishikawa-kun's place.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have a lot of juniors, so I have a lot of juniors.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I have a lot of juniors, so I have a lot of juniors.

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I also got it back right away.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll do my best to fix it quickly and get back to the scene.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I changed the mat to a lip.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry for that.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What did you say?

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Lips.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sure you'll forgive me for the ad-libs I do on TV.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Is that okay?

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry about that.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Endo-san.

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Endo-san.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Endo-san?

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry, but I can't think of any comments.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What do you mean?

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm not sure where to praise you.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So you don't have any good points to praise me?

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, that's not what I mean.

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It seems like you have something you're good at.

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Good? Good?

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I haven't watched TV much, but I can imitate.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We are the most unprofessional in the field of impersonation.

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
In that field...

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Here is the information.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Bobby Orokon is in the film.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What are you doing?

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's not me.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I didn't do it.

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who said it was me?

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I came from far away.

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Not me.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The end.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you very much.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Does that mean it's not similar?

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No, no.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It means that you have been shown various things.

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Can I ask one more thing?

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes, yes.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What is it?

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Mr. Morishige rides a motorcycle and starts the engine.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's great.

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Excuse me.

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The end!

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's not that similar.

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I usually do this in front of the mirror.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I laugh at myself.

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, really?

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's good, isn't it?

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It is.

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think it's good.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes.

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Do you have any ideas for a one-shot gag?

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A one-shot gag?

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you have any ideas for a one-shot gag?

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Do you want to think of something right now and do it?

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, if I had any, it would be very beneficial.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It would be very beneficial for the regular audience.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, you're suddenly going to say a lot of things today.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So, in that case, I won't forgive you!

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Everyone laughed.

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I won't forgive you.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Can I do it again?

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
One more time?

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes.

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I won't forgive you!

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's cute.

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's really cute.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I might change it.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Really?

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes, I won't forgive you.

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm doing well now.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll do my best.

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What do you think?

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Is there anything else you want me to do?

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I want to see your reaction.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I want to see your reaction.

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I want to see it.

165
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I want you to prepare it.

166
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's like this.

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Ah, I see.

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I wonder if Nishikawa-kun can do it.

169
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What's in the box?

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ah, yes.

171
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's the way to do it, right?

172
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Rather than doing it.

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Start!

174
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Please be careful.

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You have to be careful.

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Please be careful.

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If you go too far, it's dangerous.

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's going to cut through the rubber.

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That's right.

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I saw it.

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What? You saw it?

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I saw it.

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Wait a minute.

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You shouldn't do that.

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You shouldn't do that.

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's going to get caught and fall.

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I was surprised.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He's so mean.

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He's a scoundrel.

190
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Scoundrel?

191
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He has a scary reaction.

192
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's true.

193
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He's very brave.

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He'll be fine as long as he's not hurt.

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's see the reverse.

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I won't forgive you!

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is good.

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This is good.

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I think we should stop the scene.

200
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's too short.

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's too short.

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It hurts.

203
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It hurts.

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I've been watching Matsumoto-san for a while.

205
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
His facial expression has a lot of different patterns.

206
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He's like that.

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I want to see his facial expression.

208
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I want to see it.

209
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I see.

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The one shot gag was amazing.

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The one shot gag was amazing.

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It expanded the range of the video.

213
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What is this?

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If you look at the front,

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If you look at the back of the curtain, the face is hidden behind it

216
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The curtain will open at the end of the scene

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So you can show various expressions

218
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Interesting

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Do it again

220
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
One more time

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
16!

222
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
3!

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
2!

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
1!

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
16!

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
3!

227
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
2!

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
1!

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's the same.

230
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's not different.

231
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It was the same.

232
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It was the same as before.

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You don't need to do the ka-ka-ka sound.

234
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Ka-ka-ka.

235
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's right.

236
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
3, 2, 1

237
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I can't shake it

238
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's not necessary

239
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
End

240
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
3, 2, 1

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's impossible

242
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's impossible?

243
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's not that bad

244
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm doing a comedy, but I can't shake it with that face expression

245
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I think I can do it.

246
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I think I can do it.

247
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Please forgive me.

248
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't do it.

249
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Nijigaya, you can't say, please forgive me.

250
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's not good.

251
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll do my best.

253
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Next, I want to see number 3.

254
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This is a number.

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Number?

256
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So it's a level.

257
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There are numbers from 1 to 5.

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You can choose one of them.

259
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I want you to shout out various things with the voice that matches the level.

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Shout?

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Shout.

262
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What was your wife's name at first?

263
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Nishikawa.

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Her name is Helen.

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If you call her name, she will scold you when you go home.

266
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But this is just a part of the audition.

267
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes, it's just an audition.

268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's fine if you're just saying that you did it.

269
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You're really good looking.

270
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What happened?

271
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's been over 50 years since we got married.

272
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We've never called each other by our names.

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Really?

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But today is just an audition.

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You did well.

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You did your best.

277
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If you pull, you will get the same level.

278
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Level?

279
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes, can I?

280
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Four.

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Furen!

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Four.

283
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Four is good.

284
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's great.

285
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's really good.

286
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's good.

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay, let's go.

288
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Furen!

289
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Are you watching?

290
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No, you don't need to.

291
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You don't need to?

292
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You don't need to.

293
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Please put your knees back.

294
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll do it.

295
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But if you suddenly choose 4 and 5, what will happen?

296
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
As for the luck...

297
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay, let's take it.

298
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay.

299
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's different from before.

300
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's different from before.

301
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's different from before.

302
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry, but I think all of them are 4 and 5.

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's not true.

304
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
How lucky are you?

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Tanaka-kun, do you have anything to say?

306
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I've experienced it myself as a kid.

307
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I was shot with a gun every season.

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It was a prank.

309
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm ready.

310
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hey, Nishiki!

311
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:41,660
wet because I hear you

312
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:47,880
let's take it

313
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,360
and

314
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
If it's not the beat, it's not the heart.

315
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
How was it?

316
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
It was good with the right.

317
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,360
If I had hit the heart with the left, I wouldn't be able to perform this much.

318
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
I would have died instantly.

319
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
But in the end, it was the heart, right?

320
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Yes.

321
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,360
He's been singing for a while now, so I want to see some good parts of him.

322
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,360
He's been releasing a lot of records.

323
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Can you sing a little bit?

324
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
That's a good idea.

325
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Can you sing the song called Road?

326
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
The song called Road.

327
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
That's the name of the song.

328
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Can I sing a little bit?

329
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Yes, please.

330
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,360
I think it was happiness when it was nothing.

331
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:53,360
The night that is nothing, the night that will never return

332
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Excuse me

333
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Your voice is very good

334
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
Thank you

335
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,360
If I had listened to it a little more, I might have cried

336
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
That's right

337
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
You sang it so well

338
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,360
Maybe you would have cried while singing

339
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,360
I can't sing Kanda-wa

340
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
If you sing, you'll cry.

341
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Let's go.

342
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
I want to see it closer.

343
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
No, not at all.

344
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Please, Kanna.

345
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Have you already forgotten?

346
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:37,360
We went to the Yokocho's place together in a red hand-picked muffler.

347
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,360
We said, let's go together.

348
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,360
I was always wait for you.

349
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,360
I didn't afraid of anything,

350
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:04,360
when I was young.

351
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:15,360
But your kindness scared me.

352
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
That's all.

353
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
You really feel like crying.

354
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,860
I'm sure I'll cry.

355
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,360
But there are five teachers here.

356
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,360
I'm not going to be embarrassed or feel inferior.

357
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,360
I'll remember my initial intention and not forget the past.

358
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,860
You can't cry when you're done.

359
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,360
I don't think I can cry when I'm done.

360
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,860
You can't cry when you're done.

361
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,860
I don't like it. I'll end up lying to myself.

362
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,860
You'll end up lying to yourself?

363
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,860
I don't sleep at all.

364
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
You too?

365
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
I don't sleep at all.

366
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,860
On Monday, the 17th, at 10pm, the 90th episode of Gakunosukai Special Broadcast!

367
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,860
We'll be welcoming guests and we'll be doing a waiting game without smartphones!

368
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,860
Please, if there's alcohol, this is the ending!

369
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,860
Don't miss it!

370
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:22,460
Can you do a

371
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,460
I've never done that.

372
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
I'm not good at it.

373
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,460
I'm not good at it.

374
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,460
The general gag is the word.

375
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:33,460
Kanaga-kun, can you two fight with each other?

376
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
With Kanaka-san?

377
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,460
Yes.

378
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,460
It's the first time.

379
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,460
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,460
I can't talk to you.

381
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,460
Start!

382
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,460
What are you looking at?

383
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,460
I'm not looking.

384
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,460
You've been looking at it for a while, haven't you?

385
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
No, that's...

386
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,460
You're mistaken, aren't you?

387
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,460
Why are you staring at me?

388
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,460
It's disgusting!

389
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,460
I'm telling you I'm not looking!

390
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,460
What's with your attitude?

391
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,460
Ask the people in this shop!

392
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,460
I don't have to ask!

393
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,460
Why?

394
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,460
You're staring at me all the time!

395
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,460
It's not just because I have big eyes that I feel that way!

396
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,460
Don't use it! It stinks!

397
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,460
You're saying it too much!

398
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,460
Where did you sleep?

399
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,460
I slept right next to you.

400
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,460
What's wrong with you guys?

401
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,460
Shut up!

402
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
Chaos will occur.

403
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Shut up!

404
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
I don't like it!

405
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
He said it because he doesn't like it.

406
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Shut up!

407
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,460
What are you looking at?

408
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,460
I said I didn't see it.

409
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
Don't look at me.

410
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,460
I don't like it.

411
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
I don't like it at all.

412
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
Hey hey hey hey! Wait a minute!

413
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,460
What is it?

414
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,460
What are you doing?

415
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
You're not sleeping at all.

416
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Are you the same?

417
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,960
Are there only people who can't sleep?

418
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,460
I'm looking at Jiro Jiro, he said it was creepy, so stop it.

419
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
I'm not looking!

420
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
I said you were looking!

421
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
Why are you looking at Jiro Jiro?

422
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,460
Let's go to a prison.

423
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Apologize.

424
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,460
Apologize.

425
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
It's your fault.

426
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,460
It's not my fault!

427
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,460
I'm asking you to apologize.

428
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,460
Hey, stop it already!

429
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,460
What is this?

430
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,460
I haven't slept at all for 3 days!

431
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Shut up!

432
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,460
What's with your hair?

433
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,460
I haven't slept at all because of you guys!

434
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,460
We don't apologize.

435
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
It's our fault.

436
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,460
We don't apologize.

437
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,460
I haven't slept since 8 on Tuesday.

438
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
What day is it now?

439
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,460
I still have a heart attack and it's been 3 hours!

440
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,460
Where are you from?

441
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,960
I told you before.

442
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,460
You're the one who's causing trouble for everyone.

443
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,960
That's enough!

444
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
The end!

445
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
This is the worst.

446
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,960
Thank you very much.

447
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,960
I want to see this.

448
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
I want to see Jose-san's.

449
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
It's a live-action play.

450
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Yes.

451
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
What?

452
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,960
I think it would be a great point if you could do this.

453
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,960
I have a paper play here.

454
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,960
I'm doing it while looking at the picture.

455
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Helen's return.

456
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,960
It's starting!

457
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
It's not a return of the crane.

458
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
I have to say this myself.

459
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,960
One day, the boy climbed a mountain.

460
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Then, he met a girl with a long hair.

461
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
I thought it was a girl with long hair.

462
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
It's too early.

463
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,960
She was a beautiful blonde girl.

464
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
I was surprised.

465
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
What did you do?

466
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:38,960
I met you by chance while I was lost. Thank you for your help.

467
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,960
What's your name?

468
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
No, no, no.

469
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
You can't say it in English.

470
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Open the door and tell me your name.

471
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
You can't say it in English.

472
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Next one.

473
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,960
When I woke up in the morning and opened the door, I saw that Helen was folding a flag.

474
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,960
She was also folding your cardigan.

475
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,960
This is a cat.

476
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,960
The one who was chased wasn't a cat.

477
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
That's all.

478
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,960
The end.

479
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
How was it?

480
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,960
It didn't really become a reward for the family.

481
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
I don't understand the meaning.

482
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,960
But the picture doesn't look like a reward.

483
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Is it a problem with this?

484
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
I think so.

485
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
No, no, no, it was an audition.

486
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,960
If I didn't make it, I wouldn't have made it.

487
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I think so.

488
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,960
But it's really beyond my expectations.

489
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
It's amazing.

490
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,960
But I'd like to tell you about the failure later.

491
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
What? Later?

492
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
Yes.

493
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,960
By the way, what was the most difficult thing today?

494
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,960
It's all because it's my first experience.

495
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,960
The most difficult was the play.

496
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Good morning.

497
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
It was fun.

498
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Thank you.

499
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Good morning.

500
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
It was fun.

501
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Thank you.

502
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
The result is here.

503
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Thank you.

504
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,960
I don't know if I can smile or get angry.

505
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Failed!

506
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Can't you hear the reason?

507
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
I couldn't hear the reason.

508
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
I see.

509
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,960
I'll go to the office and check everyone's schedule.

510
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Can we talk a little more?

511
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
It's okay.

512
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Excuse me.

513
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,520
