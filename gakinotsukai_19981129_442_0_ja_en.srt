1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Last year and this year are completely different.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I was a little bit disappointed.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Usually idols put out calendars, but they do it beautifully and beautifully.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But this time, it's the opposite.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's a ugly calendar!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's try to do it for a year with an ugly face.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's what we decided to do.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's not enough to just do it like that.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No, no, that's not true.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
All of our staff, including the talent, are really all male.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No, no, no, no, no.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The back is especially terrible.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's a shame.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,420
This is a great

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,420
I'm going to make a show with a group of men.

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,420
No no no no

17
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,420
Please watch from here.

18
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,420
These guys

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,420
It's not strange anywhere.

20
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,420
It looks like you're motivated.

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,420
When you wear a tuxedo

22
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,420
Especially here

23
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,420
My father is a comedian

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,420
You can't see it!

25
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,420
This program is brought to you by the sponsors.

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,420
In the last episode, the person who was born during that month will be decorating the page.

27
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,420
As Mr. Matsumoto said, it's a punishment game.

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,120
The moment you do something, the face of that moment,

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,420
I'll make it into a calendar.

30
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,920
I don't want to see the ugly face I made.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,920
The ugly face when I forgive myself,

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,920
this will last for a month.

33
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,420
Are you ready?

34
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,920
The panel over there.

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,420
There are various things hidden there.

36
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,920
Please choose.

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Do something that you can see through.

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,920
I want you to capture that moment.

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
It's a little cruel inside.

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
Really?

41
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
There are some painful things inside.

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
I don't want to be in the video.

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
That's right.

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
First, Yamazaki Hosei who was born in February.

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
What kind of martial arts will he show us?

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Thank you for your hard work.

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
It's in order from A.

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Then I'll go with D.

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
D?

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Face-to-face tennis smash.

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
It's scary.

52
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
It's scary.

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Amazing.

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,920
This is a little dangerous.

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Please!

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Please watch carefully.

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Wait a moment.

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
How was it?

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
It's impossible.

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
It's impossible.

61
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Slowly, slowly.

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,920
I'll stop it with a nice shot.

63
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Here too...

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Hey!

65
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Hey!

66
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
How...

67
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,920
This! This! This!

68
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,920
This! This! This!

69
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
This! This! This!

70
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Stop! Stop!

71
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
That! That! That!

72
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Well, Yamaguchi-san.

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Is it okay now?

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
You got a pretty good one.

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Thank you very much!

76
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
But, how do you think?

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
This is really something!

78
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
This is amazing!

79
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
This is really something!

80
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
It's like a flower.

81
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,920
If you make it a flower,

82
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
the screen won't show, right?

83
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
The face.

84
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,920
But the moment you hit the target, the face after the hit is more interesting.

85
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Wait a minute.

86
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,920
It really hurts.

87
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Tears are coming out.

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Do your best.

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
This is hard.

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Wait a minute.

91
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Please.

92
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920
I'll make it fun.

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
It hurts.

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Why are you sweating so much?

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
I'm sweating.

96
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Let's see it again.

97
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Wait a minute.

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Ah, it's already been 2 people.

99
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Look at this.

100
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Ah, it's good.

101
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,920
This is the last one.

102
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
This is the face of February.

103
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
You don't like this, right?

104
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
As a talent, you don't like this.

105
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
I don't like this.

106
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Yuuki Yakon!

107
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Ton!

108
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Arale Yakon!

109
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Next up is the high school footballer who was born in August,

110
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Adachi Motoichi's challenge!

111
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
C!

112
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
C!

113
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Giant Shin!

114
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Okay, start!

115
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
That's it!

116
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,920
That's it!

117
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
That's it!

118
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Look at that! Look at that! Look at that!

119
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Look at it more! Look at it more!

120
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Look at it more! Look at it more!

121
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
You have to look at it more!

122
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Okay, okay, okay.

123
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Okay, that's good.

124
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,920
By the way, the first one was amazing.

125
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
It's scary.

126
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Look, look, look, look!

127
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Look!

128
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Stop! Stop! Stop!

129
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Go back a little! Go back!

130
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Put it back!

131
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
This is amazing!

132
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Okamoto Taro!

133
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Next is Hiroi Naoki

134
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,920
The next one to be chosen is the famous downtown manager, Kuchigawa.

135
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Please choose E.

136
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
E!

137
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,920
The first is the face cleaning.

138
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Oh, that's good.

139
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Start!

140
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
You should have done it earlier.

141
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Hey, stop that!

142
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
What are you doing?

143
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
It's funny.

144
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Stop it!

145
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
You're so funny.

146
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm asking you to do something.

147
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Try to put it back.

148
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,920
It's not a joke.

149
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Put it back.

150
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,920
When you lose this one, try stopping it.

151
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
This is a good one.

152
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
This is a good one.

153
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
At this time...

154
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
How should I say it?

155
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,920
This was interesting.

156
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Let's have Fujiwara-kun try something different.

157
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
I see.

158
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I haven't been able to film it yet.

159
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Next, the director who was born in June, Komunazaki, will challenge the kickboxer with his fierce kick.

160
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,920
I don't like this.

161
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
It's too early.

162
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Not yet.

163
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
I...

164
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
It's not yet.

165
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,920
So my ears are so pretty!

166
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,160
It's like that guy who's feigning in front of YoungTiThis quiet over there.

167
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,960
He's a really feisty boy.

168
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,920
You're like a move player.

169
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,420
Are you???

170
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,520
How about here?

171
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Ah.. this will be so hard.

172
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,560
Ahh so YOUre saying that this is hard, too.

173
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,260
Do you wanna go a bit further over there?

174
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
Ahhhh!

175
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,260
It's already a pekebo.

176
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,260
Tell Tell Bozu Tell Bozu

177
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,260
Fujiwara-san, can you do the part you did before?

178
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,260
Do your best, Fujiwara-san!

179
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,260
Okay, then...

180
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,260
Please!

181
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,260
Ouch!

182
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,260
I'll do it here...

183
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
And here...

184
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
This is a serious matter!

185
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,260
This is a serious matter!

186
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,260
I'm going to the toilet!

187
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,260
Hey! Hey!

188
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,260
I'm going to the toilet!

189
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,260
I'm going to the toilet!

190
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,260
Hey!

191
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260
That's hard!

192
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,260
The end

193
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:25,260
Next, the first appearance of the show, until October, Producer Kisarusa, what kind of face will he show us?

194
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
Please!

195
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Let's see!

196
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
It's a face!

197
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,260
It's a small face!

198
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
It's a big face!

199
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
It's usable, right?

200
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,260
It's usable around here.

201
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:50,260
This is the sound of a pig eating a pig in a port town.

202
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,260
Next is the 4th born, Kokoriko Tanaka.

203
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,260
She is a giant balloon that is fixed in a chair and blows up in the trainer.

204
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
The end.

205
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Ready, start!

206
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,260
Wow, it's coming.

207
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,260
I like the part where the balloon is in the front.

208
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,260
Oh, this is...

209
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,260
What is this?

210
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,260
What is this?

211
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,260
It's Nike!

212
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
Next, I'll go.

213
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
You'll go?

214
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,260
It'll be hard if I go after you.

215
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,260
I'll go.

216
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,260
I really don't like it.

217
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,260
K!

218
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
Face-to-face rap!

219
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,260
You're good at fighting.

220
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,260
You're close to the opponent.

221
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,260
That's good.

222
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,260
If you slip and your face goes in here...

223
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
You'll be able to get the momentum.

224
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,260
You'll be able to jump.

225
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,260
Who's going to listen to me?

226
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
Ready...

227
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,260
Go!

228
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:29,660
이라는 Mister

229
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,240
Wait.

230
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,160
The liero 2 is open.

231
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,540
He may not be opened, but it is ok.

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Why don't you know?

233
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm not sure.

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I can't move.

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm not sure.

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm not sure.

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You look like a grandpa.

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You look like a grandpa.

239
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You look like a Jigaraku Bicho.

240
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I can't move.

241
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Please open your eyes.

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If you don't hit it, it's a hit.

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Can I do it again?

244
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You have to open your eyes.

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I think it's wrong to open your eyes.

246
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't want to open my eyes.

247
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll start.

248
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Ready, go!

249
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You were more powerful than before.

250
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I thought I was going to hit you.

251
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I had more strength than before.

252
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's scary.

253
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's scary.

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Koji-san, you're really doing your best.

255
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm still fine.

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You're still fine.

257
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You're doing your best.

258
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
From here on, you have to be firm.

259
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Ah, I see.

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm the leader of the Fujiwara group.

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is it!

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is it!

263
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is it!

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is it!

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't like it!

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Usagi, Usagi

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Next is the famous director, Onuma.

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He is a huge face with three guns, and he is a real face.

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Let's go!

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Ready, start!

271
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, this is good.

272
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You should open it sideways.

273
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's just a spying.

274
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What is that?

275
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What are you doing?

276
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What is this?

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Open your eyes.

278
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Open your eyes!

279
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Open your eyes!

280
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What are you doing?

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's funny, isn't it?

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's funny, isn't it?

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What's with this face?

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's funny.

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Stop it!

286
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
A little bit forward.

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Look at this!

288
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What is this face?

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The next one to be chosen is the director of January, Tsumimoto.

290
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,320
He will receive a

291
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
falling shell from above with his brain and make a ugly face.

292
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Let's go!

293
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Hey!

294
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Hey!

295
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
There it is!

296
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
There it is.

297
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
There it is.

298
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
You didn't change your face.

299
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
My head is getting bigger.

300
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
That was funny.

301
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Your face is not getting bigger.

302
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,320
I'm not a gold digger.

303
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Next is Kokoriko Endo's neck washing brush.

304
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,320
The dog pulls off the brush that is between the neck of both.

305
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
I'm ready.

306
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Ready.

307
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Go!

308
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Wait a minute.

309
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Ouch!

310
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
It hurts!

311
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Show me!

312
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Wait a minute, Iwaruka!

313
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
What is it?

314
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
You're looking too high.

315
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I can't do it at all.

316
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
It's not ugly at all.

317
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Your face is like this.

318
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
How about something different?

319
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
I'll tell you why.

320
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,320
It's like blood is flowing from my neck.

321
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Really?

322
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,320
And finally, the down town hamada appears.

323
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,320
In front of him, a magic fire is burning up.

324
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
It's a big fire.

325
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,320
I hate this the most.

326
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
I can't move.

327
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
I got bitten.

328
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
I got bitten.

329
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
I got bitten.

330
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
I got bitten.

331
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Ouch!

332
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
What are you doing?

333
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Sorry.

334
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Do it again.

335
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Ouch!

336
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
You guys are so noisy.

337
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Ouch!

338
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
You!

339
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
You are hitting my ears.

340
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
What is Magic Fire?

341
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,320
So, I'm going to do it here.

342
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
I see.

343
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
This is scary.

344
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Is this distance okay?

345
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Really?

346
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Don't stop me!

347
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Don't blow.

348
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Is this live?

349
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,320
You should have said that earlier.

350
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
Is this live?

351
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Okay.

352
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
There are many behind you.

353
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
What?

354
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Please!

355
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
This is the scariest thing

356
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Ah!

357
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
You might burn your hair if you have water

358
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
If you don't have anything, pour water on it

359
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
You shouldn't hesitate

360
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Okay, let's go

361
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Please!

362
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Are you okay?

363
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Are you okay?

364
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
Are you okay?

365
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
Are you hurt?

366
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Do you need water?

367
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
You were really angry, right?

368
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
No, no, no

369
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Right?

370
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
I was surprised.

371
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
His lips were a little hot.

372
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,320
It's amazing.

373
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
It didn't break for a moment.

374
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
This is the part.

375
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,320
It's a mask.

376
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
It's a mask.

377
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
What is this?

378
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Who's going to hit the mother?

379
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
You can use a lot of it.

380
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Ah, seriously...

381
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Seriously, there's a lot of them!

382
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
What is this?

383
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Ah, I'm about to cry.

384
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm about to cry.

385
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
This is sad.

386
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
I'm going to be reborn.

387
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,600
There is something Atlanta shut off in fact...

388
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:38,200
Spitting out

389
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
The fire is also very strong!

390
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Very strong!

391
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
What is this?

392
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
A fire with a firecracker!

393
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Very strong!

394
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Let's see.

395
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
The fire is stronger than mine.

396
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
It's a firecracker.

397
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Yes.

398
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
This is a firecracker.

399
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
It's a little funny.

400
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,320
I'm death

401
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,460
Finally, fire..

402
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,380
What can I do about it..

403
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,340
It is so beautiful

404
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,820
N-Low can't even take picture that

405
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,140
аша looks only at one side of the world

406
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,420
to go for something else

407
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,420
I'm ready but when I'm in the corner, I'll go

408
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,420
I'm ready but when I'm in the corner, I'll go

409
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,420
The four cards were all in bad shape, but they were decided to be played by numbers

410
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,420
The last one is the world's best Heipou, Director Taipou

411
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,420
He will show his face with Marvado

412
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,420
Here I go!

413
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,420
What's going on with the K-POD end?

414
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,420
You scared me!

415
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
What's going on?

416
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,420
What's going on?

417
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
I'm sorry!

418
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,420
Next is the same producer who was born in November, Tsugaga Shosen.

419
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,420
His job is to be a carpenter. Will he be able to take good photos of his work?

420
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,420
Please!

421
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
It hurts!

422
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,420
What do you mean by it hurts?

423
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,420
You know, it's really...

424
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,420
It's really painful.

425
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,420
I'm sorry.

426
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,420
I'm sorry.

427
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,420
I'm sorry.

428
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,420
I'm sorry.

429
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,420
It's dangerous. It's dangerous.

430
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,420
I can't stand it anymore.

431
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:04,420
The 11th month is not going well, but Saito is challenging again.

432
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,420
What? He's running away?

433
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Oh god...

434
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,140
What is this?

435
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,140
What is this?

436
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,140
What is this?

437
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,140
It's a ghost!

438
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,140
This is amazing!

439
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,140
It's a ghost.

440
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,140
It's a monster.

441
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,140
It was a hard month in November, but Saito's expression was the final one.

442
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Just in case,

443
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,140
It's temporary.

444
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,140
It's finished.

445
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,140
It's a gorilla.

446
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
It's a gorilla.

447
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,140
It's a gorilla's child.

448
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,140
It's a gorilla's child.

449
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,140
What is this?

450
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
What?

451
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,140
He's saying it.

452
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,140
He's saying it.

453
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,140
What is this?

454
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,140
It's a photo.

455
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,140
It's either art or skin.

456
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,140
It's either art or skin.

457
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,140
It's a question.

458
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
It's a question.

459
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,140
I eat dog food at home.

460
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
I lick the back of my pants.

461
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,140
That kind of...

462
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,140
That kind of ghost.

463
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,140
The dog is running away!

464
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,140
Let's go for a walk.

465
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,140
The dog is running away!

466
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,140
This is a good present.

467
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,140
I've been with people like this for a year.

468
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:16,140
In November, everyone, really, don't do new challenges and overcome it.

469
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,140
It's already too late.

470
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,140
If you do things you don't really need to do, it's too early.

471
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,140
Don't do things like talking too much.

472
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,140
I don't feel anything.
