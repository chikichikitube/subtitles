1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Next, defendant, Onuma Akihiro, please come to the court.

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Defendant, Onuma Akihiro.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He is the famous director of the Gaki no Tsukai.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He is a character that people should love.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
However, the reality is very complicated.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It is clear that the people around him are causing a lot of trouble.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He was found guilty of murdering his wife.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He was sentenced to death and charged with the crime.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
All the evidence and testimony are true.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We will now begin the trial of Akihiro Onuma.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Prosecutor Hamada, please present the evidence and testimony.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Everyone, before that,

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Onuma-san is...

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes?

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He is wearing a uniform.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's right.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please refer to that. That is the Kyo-Bi fishing board.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's thick.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
By the way, that jeans was also given to me by the TV program.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Coincidentally, that jeans was not given to the band.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't get a jean like that, Kyo-Bi.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This time, I wanted everyone to understand the Onuma's location better.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We made a proof video.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That was a surprise.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I think Onuma-san had a lot of income back then.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But it was a surprise.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That was when Onuma invited me to a dinner with the three of us.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll pay for the rest, so eat whatever you like.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And the meal is over.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Onuma-san, I think 1000 yen each is enough for two people.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, really? Then pay for it.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Thanks for the meal.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, sure.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now, let's go.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How much was it?

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
1900 yen

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What? Then give me 50 yen

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's 50 yen, it's my money, give it back

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I invited him myself

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's 50 yen

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I didn't believe that he would get so angry at 5 o'clock.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I was surprised at that time.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That was when I was in the A.D.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
One day, it was time for dinner and we decided to order delivery food.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Onuma-san, I'm going to take out the food, what should I do?

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Food? What should you do? The food is expensive

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But this dough bento is 1000 yen, everyone will take this

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Ah, really? Well, 1000 yen is fine

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
30 minutes later, the food arrives

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hello! Thank you for waiting

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,720
And the bunch started collecting money from everyone and went to Onuma

56
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,120
Onuma-san, it's 1030 yen

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,280
What's 1030 yen?

58
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,520
It says 1000 yen here

59
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
Why is there 30 yen?

60
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
It's just a small amount

61
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,200
I didn't hear that!

62
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,880
You said 1000 yen

63
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,880
I won't pay you any more than that!

64
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
I was really angry.

65
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,880
I paid 30 yen and solved the problem, but I don't want to be involved with him again.

66
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,880
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,880
I was doing a program called Hatsumei Shogun Downtown.

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,880
I felt like I saw something I shouldn't have seen.

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,880
This program was held like every week after the recording of Hatsumei Shogun Downtown.

70
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:30,880
This program was used as a tool for many everyday items because there were many invented products attached to life.

71
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,880
After recording, there was a man who was making an uneasy movement while the staff was cleaning up.

72
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,880
Well, mayonnaise, tissues, vegetables...

73
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,880
There are so many things left over today.

74
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Onuma, who eats up the children he's going to use from now on.

75
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,880
And a lot of people.

76
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
You had all the necessary necessities.

77
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
I think you had a good life.

78
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,880
There is a 5 yen incident in the past, but you have a picture of it in the morning!

79
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
What do you think?

80
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,880
It was a promise to split the money.

81
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
You said you would split the money!

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Everyone is scared!

83
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,880
I think that's just my opinion.

84
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Well, you're right.

85
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,880
You said you would split the money, so it's 5 yen.

86
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,880
It's not about money or money.

87
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
That's right.

88
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Even if you pay 30 yen for the consumption tax, it's still 30 yen.

89
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,880
I get 1000 yen for lunch every day.

90
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Oh, I see.

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,880
And I didn't ask about the consumption tax.

92
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
You didn't ask?

93
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,880
How much did you pay?

94
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,880
I'm 35 years old.

95
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
35 years old?

96
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Yes.

97
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
What? Are you kidding me?

98
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Yes, I am.

99
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Oh, really?

100
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,880
You look very stylish.

101
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,880
I think you're stylish.

102
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,880
35 years old?

103
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Yes.

104
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Are you married?

105
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Yes.

106
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Did your wife decide that?

107
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,880
Well, I'm an independent renter, so...

108
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
What?

109
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm an independent renter, so...

110
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:38,880
I spend a month on my own, and...

111
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
You decide on your own?

112
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Yes.

113
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Okay, sit down.

114
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Next, please watch this VTR.

115
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,880
It was at a drinking party.

116
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,880
I met a person I broke up with.

117
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,880
I met her at the broken newspaper store.

118
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm going to sing.

119
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Hey Otomo, hurry up and put the song in!

120
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,880
The time is set, so if you don't play it, I'll be in trouble!

121
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,880
And two hours have passed

122
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Excuse me, it's time, so please go to the police station

123
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
Ah, yes, understood

124
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Mr. Ono, please pay the bill

125
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,880
Although he obviously noticed, the Ono who ignored Otomo

126
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,880
What's wrong? We'll pay for it too, how much?

127
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,880
It's okay, don't worry

128
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,880
I'll pay for this with my card, so please pay later

129
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Everyone, I'll pay for this, so you don't need to pay

130
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Really? I did it!

131
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Leave it to me, DENGA!

132
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,880
I'm calling the witness.

133
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Then, I'll call the witness.

134
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Then, witness, please come in.

135
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Please.

136
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Please come in.

137
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,880
He's the director of Otomo.

138
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
AKIRA HARUIN!

139
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
You're Otomo's mother!

140
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Well, regarding this...

141
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
I think you're going a bit too far.

142
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
I think he's lying.

143
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
No, I'm serious. Is this completely true?

144
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Yes.

145
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
This is true.

146
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
I just put my hand on it.

147
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
You took it away.

148
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Wait a minute.

149
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
What do you mean?

150
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
I put my hand on the card.

151
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Why did you do that?

152
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Why did you put your hand on it?

153
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
It's your card, right?

154
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Yes.

155
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Why did you put your hand on it?

156
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,880
No, I'll split it up with everyone later.

157
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
In a male team.

158
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
So, the card...

159
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,880
I have the power to grab the cards.

160
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
What do you do?

161
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Well, I do this...

162
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
You should have told us that!

163
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
That's not right!

164
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
It has nothing to do with your power!

165
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
That's not right!

166
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Do you have a card?

167
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Yes.

168
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Then you should have done that!

169
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,880
I leave it when I go out for drinks.

170
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
That's not right!

171
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
You're hiding it!

172
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,880
You invited him, didn't you?

173
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
You invited him, didn't you?

174
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Why did you leave your card?

175
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
But...

176
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,880
I thought someone had a card in the locker.

177
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,880
But you are the senior, aren't you?

178
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Yes.

179
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,880
If you invited him, you shouldn't have paid for the card.

180
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
I see.

181
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
I hate you.

182
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,880
I hate you. I hate you.

183
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,880
I hate you. I hate you.

184
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
I understand.

185
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
That was terrible.

186
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Thank you very much, Otomo.

187
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Next time...

188
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
There's more?

189
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Yes, we have another case of VTR. Please watch it.

190
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
The staff room for the kids.

191
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
As usual, they are working.

192
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Oh, you guys are hungry, aren't you?

193
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
I'll feed you, so follow me.

194
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Really?

195
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,880
The staff are surprised to hear that the famous Onuma is going to treat them to a meal

196
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,880
Onuma-san, where are you going?

197
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,880
Just follow me

198
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
Eh? Where are we going?

199
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,880
I thought there was another program recording here

200
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Oh, here it is

201
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
What?

202
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,880
This bento is delicious.

203
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,880
You guys should take one too.

204
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,880
I won't hold back.

205
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
Shogun-san, you're here again.

206
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Yes.

207
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Please, Shogun-san.

208
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,880
I'm Tsutsumimoto, the director.

209
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Shogun-san, what program is this?

210
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,880
This is a Japanese TV program called Koi no Karasawagi.

211
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Ha ha ha.

212
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,380
Yes.

213
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,880
So, you're not involved in the show?

214
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
No, not at all.

215
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,380
I see.

216
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,380
That's how it is.

217
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,880
I just thought, there's a good place nearby.

218
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,380
You said, there's a good place nearby.

219
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,380
That's close.

220
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,380
It's a different school of rock stars.

221
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,880
It's close, but...

222
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,880
The bento here is good.

223
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
But that bento was good, right?

224
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
It was good, but...

225
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,880
I ate it in the lobby.

226
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
You ate it there?

227
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
You didn't take it home?

228
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,380
No.

229
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,380
Why?

230
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,380
I don't know but...

231
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,380
You mean you're going to treat us?

232
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
I'm going to eat it as usual.

233
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:07,380
I think he understood the meaning of saying that he's going to treat us.

234
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,380
Stand up!

235
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,380
What do you mean?

236
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,380
Is this true?

237
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,380
I've been thinking about this for a while now.

238
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:25,380
When we were recording, we would bring a lot of bento to the show.

239
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,380
Quite a lot.

240
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,380
If there was any left over, we would throw it away.

241
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,380
You thought about that all the time?

242
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,380
Yes, I did.

243
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,380
To be honest, that's what happens on our show.

244
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:48,380
This is raw, so rather than throwing it away, it's better to eat it.

245
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,380
But I've been thinking about that for a while now.

246
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,380
Why did you eat it on the spot?

247
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:01,380
Well, if you're not careful, it's like a crime.

248
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,380
A crime?

249
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,380
A crime?

250
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,380
I have something else that is a bit easier.

251
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,380
Do you have a recipe?

252
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,380
It was when we were recording for the show,

253
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,380
I was with Oonuma-san and we were thirsty,

254
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,380
so we decided to go buy some juice.

255
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,380
It wasn't near here.

256
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,380
Next to Meiji Co. was the Japanese Youth Center.

257
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,380
We were trying to buy some at the store.

258
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,380
You found it there?

259
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:40,380
It was 110 yen, but when I tried to put it in, it was 150 yen.

260
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,380
Oh, I see.

261
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,380
You read it.

262
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,380
Yes. When I saw that, I couldn't drink it.

263
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,380
I couldn't drink it.

264
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,380
What is that?

265
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,380
What is that?

266
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
What is that?

267
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,380
You're being serious.

268
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,380
I can't drink it!

269
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,380
I can't drink it!

270
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,380
But you were scolded by him.

271
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,380
What?

272
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,380
You?

273
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,380
Yes.

274
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,380
You licked it?

275
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,380
No, I didn't.

276
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Really?

277
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:24,380
When I climb mountains, I think I can't help it because I brought it here.

278
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:31,380
But in Tokyo, the tourist fees are not paid.

279
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,380
Now, let's continue.

280
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,380
Still more?

281
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,380
That was when he went to Isawa Onsen in Yamanashi prefecture as a child's servant.

282
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,380
Hey, Onuma! Hurry up and change and let's go to the party!

283
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:01,380
Sakamoto-san, I'm a little worried, but I wonder if I'll be robbed of money or something?

284
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,380
Then, why don't you put it in that safe?

285
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:11,380
Oh, that? If it's that safe, is it okay? I'll do that!

286
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,380
I'm going ahead!

287
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:20,380
The party has started and the staff is getting excited.

288
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:30,380
Hey, Okonuma. How's the money? Did you put it in the safe?

289
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:40,380
Yes, I did put it in the safe but I was a little worried so I put half of it in the safe and brought the other half.

290
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,380
Really?

291
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,380
You are really cautious

292
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,380
So, how much did you bring?

293
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,380
2000 yen

294
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,380
2000 yen?

295
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,380
Then, you only put 1000 yen in the bank?

296
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,380
I was worried if something happened, so I split it into two

297
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,380
Chief, please tell us about the second case

298
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:15,380
Well, you know the story now, so you are the one who is right.

299
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,380
Yes.

300
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,380
Is there anything else that has been put in the safe?

301
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,380
When I came back and opened it, there was a letter of intent.

302
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
Did you pull it out?

303
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,380
I'm not joking.

304
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,380
It's not a joke.

305
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,380
Is this the truth?

306
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:47,380
When I travel, I have a habit of going to the safe and my wallet separately.

307
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:54,380
I think it's a good habit.

308
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,380
So, I'm not saying it's a habit, but I'm saying that I put in 1000 yen.

309
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,380
It's not something I did without knowing.

310
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
Thank you, Mr. Sano.

311
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
Thank you.

312
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,380
Now, finally, the VTR of the incident where the big-nose dog was seen in full force.

313
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,380
Was there in Yoshinoya?

314
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,080
That was when we were filming in Yoshinoya.

315
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,380
I remember this.

316
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,380
After the filming, the producer received beef bowl from the shopkeeper.

317
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Hey, you guys! I received beef bowl.

318
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,380
Share it with everyone.

319
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,380
Yay! I did it!

320
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,380
Looking at the scene, Onuma grabbed the AB.

321
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,380
Hey, what did you get earlier?

322
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,380
It's Yoshinoya's Tadaken.

323
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Give it to me. Give it to me.

324
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,380
It turns out that Eddie took the Tadaken.

325
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,380
That night...

326
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
Give it to me.

327
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,380
Today is a dinner. Hurry up and prepare it.

328
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Really? I did it!

329
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,380
It's been a while since they went out, so they are busy.

330
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,380
The destination they arrived at is Yoshinoya.

331
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,380
And of course, the payment is...

332
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,380
Please pay with this Tadake.

333
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,380
Chief Asai, I have a witness for this case.

334
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,380
Please come forward.

335
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,380
I'm Takahashi, the AD.

336
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,380
I'm the director of Shogen.

337
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,380
You all know this already, but Onoma is the director.

338
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,380
Takahashi is the assistant director.

339
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,380
We're all different ages.

340
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,380
How many tickets did you get?

341
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,380
I got all the tickets.

342
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
All of them?

343
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,380
All of them?

344
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,380
All of them?

345
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,380
All of them?

346
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,380
Shut up!

347
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,380
Hey!

348
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,380
That's right.

349
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,380
I thought at least one or two.

350
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,380
It's a bit embarrassing.

351
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,380
Actually, there's more to this story.

352
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,380
Onuma-san also received it.

353
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,380
What? Wait a minute.

354
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,380
That's not fair.

355
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,380
What's going on?

356
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,380
So rude.

357
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,380
What? What do you mean?

358
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,380
How much money did you get from the AD?

359
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,380
50,000 yen.

360
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,380
How many times did you take your wife with you?

361
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,380
5 or 6 times.

362
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,380
I think she got angry at the AD.

363
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,380
Angry?

364
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,380
What do you mean by angry?

365
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,380
You've been angry for a while.

366
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,380
Let's read the Gokko dictionary.

367
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,380
Do you understand?

368
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,380
Sorry everyone, but we have a scene in the waiting room.

369
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,380
This is amazing.

370
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,380
This is more than I expected.

371
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,380
It's more than I expected.

372
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
I didn't think it would be this good.

373
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,380
It's all over the place.

374
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,380
The eyes are dead.

375
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,380
To be honest.

376
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,380
The eyes are rotten.

377
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,380
I didn't see it like that, but I saw it today.

378
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,380
It was rotten.

379
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,380
It was rotten.

380
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,380
I think this is a complete crime.

381
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
A crime is...

382
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,380
It's a crime.

383
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,380
It's a crime.

384
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
Please announce the verdict.

385
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:53,380
The defendant, Onuma, has caused many incidents with his extraordinary sense of money, and has caused trouble to people.

386
00:21:53,380 --> 00:22:04,380
Therefore, the defense has no choice but to give you a fine of 1 million yen or a dance on the street.

387
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,380
But if we tell you the truth, we want to hit you.

388
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,380
But if that doesn't work, we'll have to do something else.

389
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,380
Dance.

390
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,580
There is no need to worry about weak.

391
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,380
Happy Birthday to you, Yamazaki-chan!

392
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,380
Happy Birthday to you!

393
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,380
Congratulations!

394
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,380
Thank you!

395
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,380
Before the party, please say something to Yamazaki-san.

396
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,380
I'm happy enough just with this.

397
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,380
Well, well...

398
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,380
Being born in the precisely Year of the Corn.

399
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,380
There have been...

400
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:03,480
Chair Khas Marcel's

401
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,080
There have been hard times for me, but...

402
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,180
I have put in effort to make it bigger and...

403
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
and...

404
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,380
It's going to make a 처음 in long journey

405
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:10,380
You're terrible.

406
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,380
That's terrible.

407
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,380
I can't even make a toast.

408
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,380
Thank you for watching!
