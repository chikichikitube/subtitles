00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
About a year ago, the two men of the Heipo Island were doing a punishment game of 24 hours of interview

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But what they saw was...

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If you're going, then don't ring the alarm!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's just a director, not a good one!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A director is not like that

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's not like he's a human being who's being punished, he's just a trash

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Mirba has become a VTR that gives a deep impression

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So...

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's meet in the second part!

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, the second part

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This time, to increase their mutual affection, they will challenge a heart-warming journey of a man.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The two men journey of Nadal and Heipo.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A journey of heart-warming and high-spirited travel.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So, Matsumoto-san, this is the second part.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, these two are actually quite compatible.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In Shimata, it's called the downtown of the Dine.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've never been told that.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I've never been told that.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Really? I thought it was written on the internet.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
When I went with Heibo, it was really scary.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Heibo is really good when he has the time to express himself.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But when he's gone, he's like...

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Wait, is this the one?

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is the one.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There are so many.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's the normal person.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There are so many.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's definitely not the normal person.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why? They are just ordinary staffs

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's not true

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
During the winter season, the day of the filming was blessed by the clear sky

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
From the Japanese TV channel, the location of the filming was Chiba prefecture

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He always complains about this kind of stuff

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't want to cry anymore.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're suddenly cold.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't want to see it anymore.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
From the beginning...

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The director, Heipo Sekai, is 64 years old.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He has been in the show business for 30 years.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He has shown extreme fear,

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
scorn,

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
lying, and problematic personality.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He has done it.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And so, he is going on a journey with Nagaru this time as well

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The journey's stage is at the clock station in Midoriku, Shibashi

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The journey's start is about to begin

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Good morning

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Good morning

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So you didn't ask what we are doing?

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No, we didn't

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The journey that you two are going on is here

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What? What is this?

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What is this?

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The person in the photo is from a house far from the people

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
A house?

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The owner of the house and the owner of the house are having a heart-to-heart conversation

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There are people?

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's not normal

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The first mission is to ask the locals to find the one-off inn in the mountains and have a heart-warming conversation with the owner there

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
To find the way to the destination, they ask the locals

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We're going to ask them too, right?

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's been a while

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Excuse me

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Are you asking the local?

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Excuse me

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Excuse me, hello

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I want to ask you about this mountain, how to go there?

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This way is the way to go

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Which way?

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Straight over there

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Wow, this is...

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you go straight, you will reach here

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thank you

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The mountain is this way

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The mountain is this way

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They are trying to get a good relationship, but they don't say anything

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They are asking questions

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They are not

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They are not coming to us

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And then

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Ah, let's go.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Is it okay to talk?

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ah, beautiful girl.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Beautiful girl.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Excuse me, Miss.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Miss.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Excuse me.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm a woman, so I want to talk.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Excuse me.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I want to talk to you.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Is it okay?

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Stop asking questions and get off.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I thought it was a beautiful place

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I thought it was a beautiful place

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This is Luan's healthy massage and relaxation salon

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
where he has several stores in the prefecture

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't say it's healthy

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What is the course chosen by the store?

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It feels good to be in the middle of the store

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But I'll wear my wall pants

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's amazing

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's a little clean

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Excuse me.

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is Mr. Seiya okay?

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, he's okay.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He's really okay, but he's asking.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Nanahara-kun, what's wrong?

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is a massage, right?

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes, it is.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're really good.

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can only hear the sound.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It feels good.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Wait a minute, this is a mistake.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is...

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hartford's reaction is so normal.

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Aoki-san is also smiling.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you very much. It was very pleasant.

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
After this, they continue to ask questions.

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Somehow I understand.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They know the way to the destination

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a sushi restaurant

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
After lunch, they go to the sushi restaurant

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How is the sushi?

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It looks good

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is it really okay?

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You can't eat it in one bite

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Eat it in one bite

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's delicious!

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Ah, I forgot to put it in my mouth

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's delicious

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's delicious

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Eat it in one bite!

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're a cockroach!

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Nadar, you're dirty!

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The two who finished their lunch at 2pm

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
They head to their destination by car with no car navigation

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Actually, from the current location to the destination, they leave the parking lot on the left

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They take a left turn and a right turn to reach the destination

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't you look at the map?

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't like it

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Will they be able to reach the destination?

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm back

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's left now

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's not right?

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's right

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's go right

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Let's go right

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Right is... which way is it?

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Right is right?

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Right is right

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is it here?

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's left

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's left

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Is this okay?

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Look at the map.

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I can't see anything because of this map.

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
To the right.

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There's a big water stream.

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Straight ahead.

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Is this right?

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll take a picture of the Hama-zushi.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You took a picture of the Hama-zushi?

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I should have taken a picture of the Hama-zushi.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Straight ahead.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Was it this muddy?

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't know.

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is the forest right? Which way is the forest?

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't know

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Wait, I'm scared I can't stop

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
After asking around, he decided to confirm the location

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What? What happened?

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Mr. Kondo

180
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Open it like this

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Ok, I'll open it like this

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What?

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't know where it is

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Excuse me.

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'd like to show you something.

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We're at Tokino Station.

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm not sure how to get there.

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you know where we are?

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We're not on the train.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're not on the train?

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What should we do?

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We're not on the train.

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So, what should we do to get here?

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, sorry.

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We're stuck.

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We're stuck.

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't know what to do.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He decided to go back to the station.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm sorry. Thank you very much.

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Where are we?

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't know.

202
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, come on.

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I told you that the train is running around here.

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's my fault.

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Please go back.

207
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't know.

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Where are we going?

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let's check it out.

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's stop pretending to know.

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I got it.

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's close

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He asked again

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I want to go here

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes, yes, yes

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
At the south exit, there is a place called Atemido-oka

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The person who knows the way told him carefully

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Go straight here

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I understood perfectly

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Go straight here

221
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This time he seems to have understood it properly

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It was a good explanation

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It was easy to understand

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is left

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is here, Hamazushi

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes, this is Hamazushi

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This is completely normal

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It was right after I said it

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It was straight

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The road is very clean

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Finally, he is on the right way

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This is it

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's go

235
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
He asks again near the destination

236
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Excuse me, can I ask you something?

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Can I ask you something?

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I want to ask you about the way, sorry for the inconvenience

239
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Ah, I see

240
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I understand

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Can you guide me? I have a car

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You can guide me

243
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, really? Thank you

244
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You can go home

245
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Thank you

246
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He is so kind that he will guide him to the destination

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Thank you very much.

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's great.

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You're going to follow that?

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm really grateful.

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't think there's anyone so kind.

252
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's hard to find.

253
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What do I do?

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Did you get this?

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's go.

256
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You're going to follow it?

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes.

258
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There's a field over the mountain.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Thank you very much.

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you very much.

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you very much

262
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Thanks to the kind person, we can see the goal

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's narrow

264
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is not a road for cars

265
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is a bit...

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's a mountain road

267
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
After driving for 4km, we finally reach the destination

268
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's quite a long way

269
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's a bit rough

270
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This is really...

271
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I can't believe it.

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's coming out.

273
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It looks like a forest.

274
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes, it's a forest.

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm scared.

276
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's scary.

277
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is it scary?

278
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes, it's here.

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I felt a strange feeling, so I was surprised.

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There is a goat.

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm scared. I can't do this anymore.

282
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Finally, we arrived at a house in the mountains.

283
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What kind of person lives here?

284
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Is this really the house?

285
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes, it is.

286
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Let's ask the people who live here.

287
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes, let's ask.

288
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Are you the residents of this house?

289
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yes.

290
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Thank you.

291
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm NADARU from Chikishiki Peppers.

292
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm the director of the program. My name is Heipo.

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm Murakami Mikiwo.

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Murakami-san.

295
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Murakami Mikiwo-san is 69 years old.

296
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He is the owner of the house he is going to take care of.

297
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What is the building there?

298
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This was originally built when I moved in.

299
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I used to be a housewife, but I like DIY, so I made it myself.

300
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Now I only use it as a warehouse.

301
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
When you work, do you go home?

302
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes

303
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I see

304
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Actually, Mr. Murakami, who has been living in the countryside for many years,

305
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
He moved here from the city to take care of the environment.

306
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm grateful to you.

307
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I helped you.

308
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I helped you.

309
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
They are helping Mr. Murakami with his farm work

310
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Is it okay to be so close?

311
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's okay

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Is this garlic?

313
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Can I smell it?

314
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Wow, amazing

315
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Wow, garlic!

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Wait, wait, wait

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Come here for a moment

318
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This is amazing

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This is amazing. This is garlic.

320
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The sin of harvesting is to harvest grass.

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The country boy Nadal is good at harvesting grass.

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's good.

323
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You have to do it properly.

324
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh no!

325
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh no!

326
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What the hell!

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Hey! Hey!

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Watch out!

329
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Wait a minute!

330
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Just let go!

331
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Straighten your back.

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And then you'll hit it.

333
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm scared!

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Is this okay?

335
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh no!

336
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What the hell!

337
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What is this?

338
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What is this?

339
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's no good

340
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Please do it

341
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Are you looking at it?

342
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What is this?

343
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a field work

344
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
They have harvested a lot of vegetables

345
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
To cook these vegetables, they go to Murakami's house

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Do you think there is a prison here?

347
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I definitely think so

348
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't think so. I'm not good at the countryside.

349
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I see.

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I was born and raised in Japan. I'm a real Japanese.

351
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm a great father.

352
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll call my wife.

353
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Your wife is here.

354
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Hello. Nice to meet you.

355
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Nice to meet you.

356
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Nice to meet you.

357
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I can't hold her.

358
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Why?

359
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't bite.

360
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's good.

361
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't look at my face.

362
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm so angry.

363
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm so sorry.

364
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm scared.

365
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's okay.

366
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Is that possible?

370
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No, please stop it.

371
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What are you doing?

372
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Ah, it's cold.

373
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You're noisy.

374
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No, it's not a problem.

376
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're a fool.

377
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What's wrong?

378
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's amazing.

379
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Did you get a hit?

380
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Did you get a hit?

381
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's good.

382
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He is making dinner with vegetables that he got from Murakami's field

383
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Heipo seems to be making a stew with radish

384
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Can you do it?

385
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yes, I can

386
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Soy sauce

387
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How long does it take?

388
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
10 to 20 minutes?

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I wonder why.

390
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's almost done.

391
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's hot.

392
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I wonder why.

393
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You should wipe it.

394
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If you do it like this, it will be white.

395
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
On the other hand, Nadaru is trying to fry onions and garlic.

396
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It looks delicious.

397
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I think this is delicious.

398
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's done.

399
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Onion and garlic.

400
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's really delicious.

401
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Can I add more salt?

402
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's delicious.

403
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I really did it with my own ability.

404
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's not bad, is it?

405
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's delicious.

406
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What?

407
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's a secret

408
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Next is the stewed radish that Heipo made with only soy sauce and salt

409
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It doesn't look bad, right?

410
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It looks delicious

411
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's a little hot

412
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's not too strong

413
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Wait a minute

414
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The soy sauce is too strong

415
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The soy sauce is too strong

416
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You should hold the soy sauce

417
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's okay

418
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm going to eat it all

419
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He's going to eat it all

420
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He's going to show it to us

421
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The Japanese style food seems to be a failure

422
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Next, Murakami-san will make pizza with his own hands

423
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It looks delicious

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It looks delicious

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's eat together

426
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What is this?

427
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's so dirty, even if it's a woman and a pizza.

428
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's so delicious.

429
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Pizza is delicious.

430
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Do you eat pizza like this sometimes?

431
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes, I do.

432
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's so dirty.

433
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I want to eat pizza sometimes.

434
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Please come here.

435
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
After the meal, Mr. Murakami's reflection is a hot topic.

436
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What was the reason for you to live here?

437
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I was born in the countryside, so Iwate.

438
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Iwate?

439
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I wanted to live here after I retired.

440
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Your mother is from Iwate?

441
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yes, she is 93 years old now.

442
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
She came here every year to play with us.

443
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
She is so nice.

444
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,120
I received a letter from her

445
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,520
From your mother?

446
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
Wow, that's amazing

447
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
I'll go and find it

448
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
This letter...

449
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
It seems to be touching

450
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,520
It's not sad at all

451
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,520
Iwate's mother will read the letter written to Murakami

452
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
I'm sorry for the long time I've been away

453
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,520
How are you all doing?

454
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Iwate is doing well.

455
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,520
It's cold every day, so I can't leave the hut.

456
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,520
It's especially cold this year.

457
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,520
I went to the hot spring with John and Sina.

458
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,520
I remember that I went across the river with a big bag.

459
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,520
Please go to Iwate. I'll be waiting.

460
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Be careful not to catch a cold.

461
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
From Grandma.

462
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
I can't believe you wrote such a great letter.

463
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
It's amazing.

464
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,520
My mother is 93 years old.

465
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
Really?

466
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
She is fine.

467
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
It's wonderful.

468
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,520
I can't write such a great letter.

469
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,520
I'm sorry I'm 93 years old.

470
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
What's wrong?

471
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Thank you.

472
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
What's wrong?

473
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,520
It's wonderful.

474
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
What?

475
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Did you get a call from your mother?

476
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,520
That's great.

477
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
He's a double.

478
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
He's talking about his parents.

479
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
He's a good boy.

480
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
He's a good boy.

481
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
He's a good boy.

482
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,520
I don't know why, but my father and mother are from the same hometown.

483
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
They're called Miyagi and Iwate.

484
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,520
My family is small, so they go to the hot spring.

485
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
But they overlap.

486
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
I know them well.

487
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
You don't have to cry.

488
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
It's okay.

489
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
It's not embarrassing.

490
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
It's not a big deal.

491
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
I'm not like that.

492
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,520
It's okay.

493
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,520
It's a treasure.

494
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Let's see your face.

495
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,520
I've never seen you being so serious.

496
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm serious.

497
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
I've never been like this.

498
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,520
I'm happy.

499
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
He showed his true feelings.

500
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
His tears of joy.

501
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,520
What is he thinking now?

502
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,520
I'm sure that the girl in the massage shop is a real girl.

503
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,520
Stop it!

504
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Stop it!

505
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
It's a family matter.

506
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
He kept saying that.

507
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
After this...

508
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,520
No!

509
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,520
It's out! It's out!

510
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,520
The man's journey continues on the forest

511
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,520
I was worried if it would work

512
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,520
I was worried if the tractor would work

513
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
Did you return the license?

514
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
Yes, I did

515
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
How much? 60?

516
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
I returned it at 55

517
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,520
That's fast!

518
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
How confident are you?

519
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Did you really write that letter?

520
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,520
I really wanted to live long

521
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,520
The staff didn't expect it at all, so it was a really bad atmosphere

522
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Why did you expect it?

523
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,520
It was a good atmosphere

524
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Oh, it's good!

525
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Shiopara 2019

526
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Shiopara's popular show, the bus tour that you must not laugh, will be held this year too!

527
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,520
The strongest comedy guests are waiting for you!

528
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Next week, the two men's tour will be completed

529
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:47,520
I can't do it anymore. I can't do it anymore.

530
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
Director, come here!

531
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Can they face the heartful ending?

532
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
They are really excited.

533
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Where is the guy who can't finish this?
