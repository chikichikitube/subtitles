1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first episode of Chikitsuki!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Nagashima Kazushige's complete production!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Karta Soda-Sensei!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ah, Karta-san

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What is it? It's a cy-break

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's really busy

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We don't have time

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The guest is a lazy person

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's go!

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There's a butt

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You were busy.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Mr.Kajisaki, sorry for the inconvenience.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What do you mean by your ass is cut?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm busy.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I didn't decide it.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The schedule is the producer.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What do you mean?

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It took 2 seconds to come out and kick ass.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is the first time.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I was kicked in the ass suddenly during the recording.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Why are you kicked?

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's a nose.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's over!

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It was hard, right?

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I thought about 44 or 45 patterns.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You thought about it seriously.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Did you draw it properly?

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Of course.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You have a good sense of drawing, right?

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you look at it, you'll know how much I have.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Kazushige Nagashima

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm talking to myself.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
With his free spirit, he appeared in 272 TV shows last year and took over the industry.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, I'll buy it.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now, the most passionate man's unexpected appearance will be revealed tonight!

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The rules are simple. The one who gets the most number of cards will receive a luxurious gift from Kazushige.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Is this the same as usual?

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The person who gets the most number of cards will receive a prize.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You've written the guide carefully, haven't you?

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, I've written it seriously.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not bad at drawing

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're checking it out

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
No, I'm not checking it

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm just looking at the quality of the drawing

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Nothing else

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's a pass

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's start

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
From the butt

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What?

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's fast

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You were looking

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I was looking

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I was looking

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I think I saw it clearly.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll read it until the end.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He is more of a boob than a butt.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I see.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What did you say?

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, no.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He is more of a boob than a butt.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Bigger?

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Bigger is also okay.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hamada-san, which do you prefer?

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The butt or the boobs?

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I think it's the boobs.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It was on the internet.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hamada-san loves boobs.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I love boobs.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It says that you love boobs regardless of the price.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hahaha

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Regardless of the price.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Even if it's small, it's boobs.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What about you, Matsumoto?

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm not that particular about boobs.

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The problem is the nipples.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hahaha

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's no use if you don't have nipples.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm quite a maniac.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What kind of boobs do you like?

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
As long as it's big.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For example, who is the old idol?

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Ah, if I had to say an old idol, it would be Kawaii Naoko-san.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Ah, that's true.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And, Sakakibara Ikue-chan.

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, if I say that now, my son will get angry.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Ikue-san, and...

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's a bit...

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm looking at you with that kind of eyes.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I wonder if there are people who hate boobs.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Kanaka-san, really...

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What's wrong with you? You're so gross.

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I feel bad.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What do you mean?

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I feel bad.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You don't have any sense of that.

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm not a teacher.

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's about the butt.

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
About the butt?

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You have to go in with your butt.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's printed.

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's better to have a big one.

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Who? Who?

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Momotaro Kawaii-Nago.

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's a big fan.

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He's a big fan.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He's a big fan.

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He's a big fan.

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
When I was a kid, I thought, wow.

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I thought so too.

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If you fail with your neck, then your butt is better

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But I don't fail with my butt

114
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You don't fail with your butt?

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But sometimes there are people who are really stiff

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're a genius

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I've seen someone who is really stiff

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You can't see it

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Then, let's start

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Unexpectedly, the middle name is Paolo

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're a bit off

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That was fast

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't know what to say.

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What is your middle name?

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I was baptized.

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I am Catholic.

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Paul?

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
My real name is Paul Kazushige Nagashima.

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I am baptized and enter the middle name.

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Christ's 12th century.

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I haven't heard of it.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Is this a family name?

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
My mother is Catholic.

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So my siblings were all baptized.

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I was baptized when I was in the second or third grade of elementary school.

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Isn't Paolo the most amazing place?

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's like a blessing place.

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's a moon-like place.

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The moon is coming more and more.

140
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There is no middle name called the moon.

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I know it.

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I thought you didn't know it.

143
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He didn't know it.

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I didn't know it.

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's start.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He complains to cover himself.

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
2

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's fast.

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's fast.

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's fast.

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I just saw it.

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's in front of you.

153
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm not a Hamada-san.

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're a Hamada-san, right?

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You always say something.

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
When we have a meeting, you always ask,

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What do you think about that?

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You don't want to do what you're told.

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You want to oppose something.

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Do you have such a thing with Hamada-san?

161
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
No, no.

162
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You do what you're told?

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Really?

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What kind of town is this?

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You know what Hamada-san is like.

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't know.

167
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Everyone's face is so pale.

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's like oil.

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He's nervous.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's true.

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Do you have a crush on Matsumoto?

172
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Not really.

173
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Not really.

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I just want to try it.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know if I should try it.

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So you want to try it when you think it's boring?

177
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I want to try it.

178
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I think your way of talking is good

179
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I've never heard that before

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's good

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I've never heard that before

182
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I've never heard that before

183
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How do you do that?

184
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Really, really

185
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Unexpectedly

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
When I go to your dressing room, I hear that you are a former producer and you work a lot

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's right

188
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why do you come to my dressing room?

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's fine

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Really?

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You do that on purpose

192
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I will definitely go to my senpai.

193
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're not a senpai.

194
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I am a senpai.

195
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You will go to Hamada-san's place, right?

196
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Of course.

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Are you coming?

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't know.

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This conversation is very troublesome.

200
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The guest is very troublesome.

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Please choose one.

202
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You guys will come to the kid's place, too.

203
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's really troublesome.

204
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Wait a minute.

205
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's our job.

206
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's do it together.

207
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Then we'll do it at once.

208
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's right.

209
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If we do it together, it'll be like a curry show.

210
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What's that?

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What's that?

212
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Curry show?

213
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's start.

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Looks are thinner than slender.

215
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's RU!

216
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You said it so suddenly

217
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's RU!

218
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's here again

219
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's always here

220
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's here!

221
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's like Masatoshi Hamada's Karuta tournament

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's like a big match

223
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's mix it

224
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's mix it

225
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let's mix it

226
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is also a woman's choice

227
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's a bit similar to boobs

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I have that feeling.

229
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
When you have legs, it's not sexy to have a gap between thighs.

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's right.

231
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But there are also people who like it to be rough.

232
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's right. There are people who like it to be rough.

233
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There are?

234
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Everyone is flat.

235
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Eh? Tanaka?

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm more of a flat person, and my butt is relatively flat.

237
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Because you're a butt skin?

238
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

239
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Because you're a butt skin?

240
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But before, I liked a person from Slender, right?

241
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Who?

242
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Who?

243
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The ex-wife of the previous one.

244
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I only talked about that.

245
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But if I only talked about that, I wouldn't like it.

246
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm like that.

247
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I want to talk about many things.

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You mean women.

249
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I want to talk about many things.

250
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What do you want to do with your butt?

251
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,200
I look at their drawing like this...

252
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,760
You don't like that?

253
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,560
Yes I do.

254
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,220
But I don't have the urge to hit them.

255
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,880
But Hamada-san?

256
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,820
I don't usually do that.

257
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,480
If it happens I do this sometimes.

258
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,780
I have never hit then.

259
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,240
What happens when you hit them?

260
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,640
Nothing.

261
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
....piano

262
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,940
There is only puttingSt reportedly

263
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,980
Say but lotis for example

264
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,700
I have something tell.

265
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,780
I want to say something from the bottom of my heart WH внутри

266
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900
It's allhaven'tbefine

267
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,340
Have Up

268
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,140
Don't add more

269
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,720
Ok leweat

270
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,220
Realistically, No.1 is Omi beef shatou-buri

271
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,720
D

272
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
D

273
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
It's D

274
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,720
It's here again

275
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,720
It's not a coincidence

276
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,720
It's all mixed

277
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Your tobacco shop is also a bar

278
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,720
All of them are here

279
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
It's easy to get

280
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
When did you start?

281
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Really?

282
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,720
I'm talking about Shiga's food.

283
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
You've been eating a lot of good food since you were little.

284
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
I think it's delicious.

285
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
I think so.

286
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
I think so if he says so.

287
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,720
I think Matsumoto-san's food is the best.

288
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
It's the best in this.

289
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
It's the best in this.

290
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
That's true.

291
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,720
For example, the stars go to listen to classical music or to watch ballet through year-end.

292
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
This is serious.

293
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
I think it's completely different from you guys.

294
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
It's a lie.

295
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
It's true.

296
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
It's true.

297
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
It's true.

298
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
What ballet did you go to watch?

299
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
There is no ballet.

300
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
There is.

301
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Like the lake in Hakujyo.

302
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I can't go to see such a thing.

303
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
What is it?

304
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
What ballet did you go to watch?

305
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
There is no ballet.

306
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
There are also those with a lot of muscles.

307
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
And the one with Kumakawa-san.

308
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
All of them.

309
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
All of them?

310
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
All of them?

311
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
All of them are the best.

312
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
What are you talking about?

313
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Not the cow, the best.

314
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
The best.

315
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Amazing.

316
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
The best.

317
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Not the beef.

318
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
You couldn't eat cup noodles when you were a kid.

319
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
When you were a kid?

320
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,720
I ate a lot of cup ramen.

321
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Really?

322
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I don't like it.

323
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Chicken ramen came out when I was in elementary school.

324
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,720
And potato chips with Calbee's consommé flavor.

325
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
That's very normal.

326
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
That's the first one.

327
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
What about the Rider card?

328
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
I forgot the Rider card.

329
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
And the Home Run card from Calbee.

330
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Oh, baseball.

331
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Like baseball.

332
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
That's right.

333
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,720
So you get a lot of them at home.

334
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
He sends me money.

335
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
What happened to your allowance?

336
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
My allowance?

337
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,720
When I was in elementary school and middle school, I was given a lot of money.

338
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
So for a year...

339
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Do you usually give money to others?

340
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
I gave it to myself.

341
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Of course, I gave it to myself for a year.

342
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
So everyone,

343
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,720
In New Year's greetings, the relatives of the parents give greetings.

344
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
I don't know what to bring.

345
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,720
I will show you where I give my drop balls.

346
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,720
It's a little complicated story.

347
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Well, there will be 40 people.

348
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Well, it's not 1000 yen per person.

349
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
It's not.

350
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Well, 100,000 yen is always...

351
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
400,000 to 500,000.

352
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Wow!

353
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
It's not much for a year.

354
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
I wonder if it was really 2000 to 3000 yen.

355
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Even if you collect all.

356
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
I collected all of them.

357
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
You collected all of them?

358
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
I collected all of them.

359
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
I'm about to cry.

360
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,720
I remember the scene of the sand.

361
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Why am I in the scene of the ghost?

362
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Let's start.

363
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Hebi-Rote, Seiko's red sweet pea.

364
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
He, He.

365
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
He, He, He, He.

366
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Oh, Hamada-san

367
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
It was there

368
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,720
This is originally your boyfriend's

369
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
No

370
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Ebirote

371
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,720
Seiko-chan

372
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Seiko-san

373
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,720
It's a big hit for Seiko Matsuda

374
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,720
I debuted in middle school about two years ago

375
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Didn't you say you liked Kawai Naoko?

376
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
How about boobs?

377
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
I like the body

378
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
I like songs.

379
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
You like Seiko's songs.

380
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
I like songs.

381
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
I like Gai Sweet.

382
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
You like Seiko more than Akina.

383
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Yes.

384
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
I like Akina too.

385
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,720
I was born in the year of the star.

386
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
I remember Akina's songs.

387
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
I like Yua Matsumoto's songs.

388
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
I like Yu Hayami's songs.

389
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
You were born in 1982.

390
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Everyone was in it.

391
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Akina-san was the only one who had a lot of production.

392
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,720
I still remember most of the production.

393
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
What about Chuu-san and Torio?

394
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
It's definitely Momoi-chan, right?

395
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
That's right.

396
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Momoi-san and Junko-chan, right?

397
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
That's right.

398
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
And Masako-chan.

399
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Hey, that's not it.

400
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
It's not that kind of person.

401
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Everyone is lined up.

402
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
That's right.

403
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Kama-san's idol?

404
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
But they're about the same.

405
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
They're the same.

406
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
But I think it's Mako-chan.

407
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Mako-chan from Ishida.

408
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Yaeba.

409
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
That Yaeba is cute.

410
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Mako-chan is still pretty.

411
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
She's cute.

412
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
She's still the same even after watching commercials.

413
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Who's your idol, Matsumoto-san?

414
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
I think it's Momoe-chan.

415
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Yamaguchi Momoe-san.

416
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,720
If I get invited to Momoe-chan's house, what should I do?

417
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,320
I was worried to the last minute, but I couldn't go.

418
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,920
I probably said,

419
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,820
Sorry, I can't go. I'm going home.

420
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
What are you worried about?

421
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,620
Are you still thinking about it?

422
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,920
I'll go to the front door, but...

423
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,420
Tomokazu is noisy.

424
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
That's impossible.

425
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,620
That's impossible.

426
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,820
He's noisy.

427
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,120
It's still going on.

428
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,020
It seems to be easy.

429
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,520
That was a little faster.

430
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,320
Right?

431
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,720
Ah, that's fast!

432
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,220
Kazushige's even more honest side is revealed!

433
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,720
That's amazing!

434
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,220
That's strange.

435
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,820
I heard you won a karate contest on a different show.

436
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:04,920
Yeah.

437
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,520
What?

438
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,020
What?

439
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,520
You're still doing it?

440
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,420
Yeah, I am.

441
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,820
You're not interested in karate?

442
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:15,120
Yeah, when I was in elementary school, there was a show called Karate Bakai Ichidai.

443
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,220
I wanted to do it, so I started to get interested in karate.

444
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,220
I'm not sure if I should do it or not.

445
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,220
I think you should try to get a blood test done.

446
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,220
You mean I should do it?

447
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,220
I'm scared because I don't want to do it.

448
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
The man who is scared of the man who is scared of the woman.

449
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,220
I don't like women who put perfume on their body.

450
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,220
I want to smell the body.

451
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,220
I don't know which one.

452
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,220
Do you smell the body?

453
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,220
I don't smell it.

454
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,220
You don't take a shower at all?

455
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,220
Yes.

456
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,220
I don't need a shower.

457
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,220
Hamada-san, this is becoming a strange Karuta.

458
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,220
Up until now, Hamada has been the one to win.

459
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,220
Who will win?

460
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,220
I'm starting.

461
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,220
The battle between the dreamy monster Egao.

462
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
10

463
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,220
10

464
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,220
Yes

465
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,220
What should I do?

466
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,220
That's what I'm talking about

467
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,220
I'm not motivated

468
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,220
I want to hear this story

469
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,220
I don't know

470
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,220
I don't know

471
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
I don't know

472
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,220
The reason why I don't know is

473
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,220
In the year when Mr. Egawa retired

474
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,220
It was the last year of Korakuen

475
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,220
The year I entered

476
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,220
I was a big fan of Ega.

477
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,220
I had a dream to fight against Ega.

478
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,220
I wanted to enter the pro-wrestling world.

479
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,220
Really?

480
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,220
I didn't have a partner who entered the pro-wrestling world.

481
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,220
I didn't have a partner.

482
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,220
That's right.

483
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:12,220
When I was 25, I was in the Giants after moving from Yakult.

484
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,220
Matsui was in the Giants.

485
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,220
At the Miyazaki camp, Matsui and I were newbies.

486
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Of course, the newbies are the last ones to bat.

487
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,220
I'm not a regular, so I'm close to Hikari.

488
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,220
I practice batting with Matsui.

489
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:36,220
At that time, Ega-san was throwing the batting gauge towards Matsui.

490
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,220
Oh!

491
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,220
Hey, hey, hey.

492
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,220
What does that mean?

493
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,220
Ega-san, of course, retired and it's been years, but

494
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,220
In the TV program, Ega-san threw the batting gauge towards Matsui,

495
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,220
and Ega-san probably had a plan to explain it.

496
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,220
I see.

497
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,220
Why is it Godzilla?

498
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,720
I'm fine with that.

499
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,020
Even though you want to fight so badly?

500
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,020
Even though I want to fight.

501
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,520
And then,

502
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,920
after Matsui finished his batting practice,

503
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,220
he immediately jumped in to get in.

504
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,120
And then Ega-san might do it.

505
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,220
And I immediately got out of the game,

506
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,920
and Ega-san was still there.

507
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,520
I thought I'd get in, but Ega-san didn't even look at me.

508
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
He went in.

509
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,320
And he got off the ground.

510
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,620
That was really a trick.

511
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,720
Matsui was J?

512
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
No, I didn't jump properly.

513
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Oh, I see.

514
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
You were pushed.

515
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
I was pushed.

516
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,720
I thought, Egawa-san is amazing.

517
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,720
I was watching, but why did I jump?

518
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
You didn't?

519
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Let's start.

520
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,720
The famous director of Miyazaki Hayao, Mukarinai.

521
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Mu.

522
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
It's Mu.

523
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Yes.

524
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
It's your first time.

525
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Ah, this side

526
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Miyazaki Hayou-san

527
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,720
I once did voice acting

528
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
In the movie, Ponyo on the cliff

529
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Ponyo's father in the movie

530
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
The one on the boat

531
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Yes, the one on the boat

532
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
I was surprised

533
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,720
In short, you have to match the voice and the picture

534
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
But it doesn't match no matter how long it takes

535
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Because he's blue.

536
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
No, no, he's not blue.

537
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
It's difficult.

538
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Eventually, the teacher said,

539
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
It's okay.

540
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Then, you can talk as you like.

541
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
He's not blue.

542
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
Everyone can match.

543
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Do you do that alone?

544
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
I do it alone.

545
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Whether there is a partner,

546
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
It's a partial shot.

547
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Why don't you match?

548
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
It's blue, isn't it?

549
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
I didn't know it.

550
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
It's a good match.

551
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
No, no, no. It's a good match.

552
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
It's a good match.

553
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Miyazaki sensei said,

554
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
this is not like Kazushige-kun.

555
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,720
So, Kazushige-kun, read this line to your own sense.

556
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
I read it.

557
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Then, I said, that's fine.

558
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Then it was over.

559
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720
I thought, this is not good with the picture at all.

560
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
I thought it was okay to finish it.

561
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
But later,

562
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
I changed the drawing after that.

563
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
You changed it?

564
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
I changed it.

565
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Wow, amazing!

566
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
It's a lot of trouble.

567
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
That's what happened.

568
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Since then, I've been calling you.

569
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Really?

570
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
I don't know if it's alive.

571
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
I think it was pretty good.

572
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
What?

573
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
I think it was pretty good.

574
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
What's that?

575
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Don't you have that kind of thing?

576
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Ateleco?

577
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
I've never done Ateleco.

578
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Don't you have Hamas?

579
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Oh, Mr. Matsumoto.

580
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
I have it.

581
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
Shrek

582
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Shrek

583
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
But in Shrek, it's not done properly

584
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
The pencil

585
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
The line of Shrek is just moving

586
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Sometimes it's done properly

587
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
The people over there all have their voices taken first

588
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
So they have their voices taken first

589
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,720
All of them have their voices taken first and then the animation is made

590
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Is that so?

591
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Then it's the opposite

592
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Have you ever been called Shrek while walking on the street?

593
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
No.

594
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
No?

595
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Shrek?

596
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Shrek?

597
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
But I've played it before, so maybe I've played it once.

598
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Next episode!

599
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
I'm late because I'm sleepy.

600
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,720
The second episode of the long-awaited Karta growth battle!

601
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
I went to the kitchen and found a knife.

602
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,720
He confessed his biggest slump in his life

603
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,720
And his thoughts about the 9th round

604
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,720
I don't want to be the coach of a baseball player

605
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
It's impossible

606
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Hamada-san, you don't understand

607
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,720
It's obvious that no one knows about this victory

608
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
I'm going to practice

609
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,240
