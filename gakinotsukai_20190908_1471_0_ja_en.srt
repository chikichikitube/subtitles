1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's so sad.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah, it is.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's so sad that we can't be with Downtown.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I don't know what to talk about.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But you're the senior.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Even if you say that, it's a long story.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, hey.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good morning.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hamada-san, what happened to your black outfit?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You can tell by my outfit.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Don't you miss me?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Everyone, do you know that today is Matsumoto's birthday?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's right.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And it's the Tokyo Olympics next year.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And I'm wearing this outfit.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Do you understand?

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I remember it from the past.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You mean that's what you're wearing today?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's right.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Up until now, he has been able to fulfill many of Matsumoto's dreams by doing black-and-white in the past 7 times.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The beginning is the world record of running and jumping.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And continuing to the first half of the long distance,

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the sky miracle play of skateboarding.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He hits back the 150km high-speed ball.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The world record of weightlifting.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The 50cm fire rainbow dance.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And he swam 25m in 10 seconds.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He set a lot of records.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What kind of challenge will Matsumoto face on his 56th birthday?

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I said it was okay, but I said I couldn't do it.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The most important thing for me is that he will do this for me.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Birthday present.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Birthday present?

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But you still don't know what you want to do, right?

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's watch this.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It was skateboarding.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Actually, he wants to do this.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No way.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a fishing rod.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's a double spin.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's a double spin while jumping forward.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This is the one you like the most.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is the one.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is it.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is the one that Kohei Ichimura showed at Rio Olympics.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is Matsumoto.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Matsumoto wants to do a triple.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, no.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why are you doing that?

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll change my clothes. Can you change yours?

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's go.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's do it quickly

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
After 14 years, Kuroko-shu has risen again

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi challenges Uchimura Kohei to defend

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He has the most strength in his body

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If you bring it, I'll talk to you.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's right.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Good morning.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Good morning.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm really sorry.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What are you doing?

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I told everyone.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's a strange request.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No, not at all.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What do you mean?

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If it's a woman, she'll give you a ring as a present.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If it's about this, it'll be a fishing rod.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm not a servant.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Thank you.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Thank you very much.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I mean, you are the one who is willing to do it.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm embarrassed, but I'm happy.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What is it?

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Ah, that's it.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Ah, you're crying a bit.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But I can't do this anymore.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Ah, but...

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's stand up.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's do it.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's do it.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's do it.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's do it.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's more expensive than I thought.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I know.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's do it.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's do it.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
First, Mr. Kuchimura.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's heavy.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's heavy.

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, no, no.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't hold this!

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Ouch!

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Wait a minute. What's going on?

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's push her down once.

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What's going on?

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Wait a minute.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What's wrong?

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What?

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Wait a minute.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Hey, sensei, sensei!

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We still have nothing to do with this.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,040
What are you doing?

110
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,380
They are not doing anything!

111
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,280
It came to us first

112
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
What about now

113
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,440
Are you upset?

114
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
They are not making me angry

115
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,960
You should go to apologize

116
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,580
No, we should go to see their situation

117
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,800
Museum has done something that upset people?

118
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
No, no, I didn't do anything.

119
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Why?

120
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,100
No response...

121
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,120
aganjou.

122
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,080
harden

123
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,120
The good lead

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
I don't have any plans to do it.

125
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm aware that I'm forcing myself to do it, but I thought I could do it a little more.

126
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
That's not true.

127
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,120
I've already lost my tongue and my sigh.

128
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,120
What did you think was cold?

129
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
I don't know who it is, but there was a guy who twisted my arm.

130
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,120
I thought, maybe this is it.

131
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I thought, I'll take this home with me.

132
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,120
I was watching Hamada's school days in Kuroko.

133
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Tanaka said, let's do it quickly.

134
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,120
I thought, is this a bad thing?

135
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Hamada, are you doing it properly?

136
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Sorry, sorry.

137
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
You should talk properly.

138
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,120
There are things that you don't understand.

139
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Yes.

140
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,120
I'll say it properly.

141
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
You!

142
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Yes?

143
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
You twisted your arm.

144
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
I thought you were going to say it.

145
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
I'm definitely going to check you.

146
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
I didn't twist it.

147
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,620
If you had worked a little harder, you could have done it.

148
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,620
I'm not doing my best.

149
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,620
You didn't get it, did you?

150
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,620
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,620
Please, do your best.

152
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,120
I can't finish this.

153
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,620
You don't have enough shako, right?

154
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,620
Yes, I don't have enough.

155
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,620
Let's go.

156
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,620
Let's go.

157
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,620
Are you waiting?

158
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,620
Please.

159
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,620
Let's go.

160
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,620
The second challenge.

161
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,620
The second challenge.

162
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,620
It's like this.

163
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,620
It's like this.

164
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,620
It's like this.

165
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,620
Excuse me.

166
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,620
Excuse me.

167
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,620
I feel refreshed.

168
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,620
I went to the toilet.

169
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,620
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,620
We were a little bit nervous.

171
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,620
I'm really sorry.

172
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,620
Let's start.

173
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
Let's start.

174
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,620
Please.

175
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,620
Watch out.

176
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,620
Hold his hand.

177
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,620
Right foot.

178
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,620
Hold his right foot.

179
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,620
Left foot.

180
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,620
Wait a minute.

181
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,620
What's wrong?

182
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,440
Now, don't moveヤ

183
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Hey, put the claw off

184
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:05,440
It'sแ

185
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,360
Wake up!!

186
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,600
Put the hawk and Fujiwara up

187
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,960
Okay okay

188
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,760
Okay, I'll get that one

189
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,580
A nice robin

190
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,880
Nice blobs

191
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
One more please

192
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,320
If anyone else got their heads measured, there's a risk

193
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,580
Your head

194
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,940
Isn't it better to put them mortise them?

195
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,980
Make mortise them

196
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,960
I'd like to mortise them

197
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,000
ya, mortise them

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,220
Should I?

199
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,040
Let's mortise those

200
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,100
How about that one?

201
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Stop it! Stop it!

202
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Give me your hand!

203
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Give me your hand!

204
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Give me your hand!

205
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Give me your hand!

206
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Hey!

207
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Mr. Matsumoto!

208
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
You're angry, aren't you?

209
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Yes, she's angry.

210
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Aga-chan, I'm going to the bathroom.

211
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:31,100
I was a little close. I thought I could have done it a little more.

212
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Well...

213
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
My head...

214
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,100
It hurts so much I can't think.

215
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
That's not true.

216
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Is that what it is?

217
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,100
I wanted to ask him about it.

218
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,100
He was like a stick.

219
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
He was pushing me.

220
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
He was shouting.

221
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
He was screaming.

222
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
I was scared.

223
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
I lost my sight.

224
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,100
The skin on your armpit is crooked.

225
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Tsukite, you're a goat, right?

226
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
No, I am.

227
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
What do you want to do?

228
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
What do you want to do?

229
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,100
I want to use the stick again.

230
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
I really hate sticks.

231
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,100
What is that? What is that name?

232
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
What kind of order is that?

233
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Where did you put it?

234
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,100
And where are you going to put it after this?

235
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
I'm curious about that.

236
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
We'll do our best next time.

237
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
It's okay.

238
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
You said you'll do your best next time.

239
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
It's okay.

240
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
I can see it.

241
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
We can do it.

242
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Don't be shy.

243
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Thank you.

244
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Thank you.

245
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,100
The third challenge to regain his spirit.

246
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
I used a stick because of that.

247
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,100
I was told that the stick was painful.

248
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
I didn't get hurt that much.

249
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
That's good.

250
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
I'm sorry.

251
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
No, no, no.

252
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
I'm sorry.

253
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,100
I'll do something like this.

254
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,100
What a strange request.

255
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,100
What a strange request.

256
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,100
I'll do my best.

257
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Let's do it.

258
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
What's wrong?

259
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,100
It's okay. It's really okay.

261
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Masamu-san, please turn your back to the front.

262
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Okay, right foot is okay.

263
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Put your leg on your hip.

264
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Lift it up a little.

265
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Are you ready?

266
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,600
Yes

267
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,100
Are you ready?

268
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Yes

269
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Ready, start!

270
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Go, go, go!

271
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
It's not going up at all

272
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
A little more, a little more!

273
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
Get up, get up!

274
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Get up, get up!

275
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Go, go, go!

276
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Go!

277
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,460
Don't you get in the way!

278
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,460
A little more!

279
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,680
I can't do it

280
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,120
Wait a minute

281
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
You got it.

282
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
Fuyuhara-san, you got it.

283
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Yes, I got it.

284
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Shijimono.

285
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Matsumoto-san, I got it.

286
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Umm...

287
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Yaegashi-san...

288
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Yaegashi-san, I got it.

289
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,360
The fearsome villain that obstacle a big deal

290
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,300
Ryuichi Chigawa

291
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,000
He wasn't nice to me

292
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,400
He just disappeared

293
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Get out!

294
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Get out!

295
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Get out! Get out of here!

296
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
There's no way I can do that!

297
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,400
It's all falling down on my face.

298
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,400
We talked about it, but we went overboard.

299
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Let's stop with the magic tape.

300
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,000
Like a

301
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,600
How many more times do you have to do this?

302
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,800
I'll break the rules and get out of here.

303
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,760
Let's do it next time.

304
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
I'm confident in the next time.

305
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,920
I'm confident in Tanaka.

306
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,480
I'm the only one who trusts Tanaka.

307
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,640
Please.

308
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,600
Thank you.

309
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,360
Don't be like a king of the cave.

310
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,480
Like a king of the cave.

311
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,960
I'm scared.

312
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
I'm getting nervous.

313
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Yamaguchi-san.

314
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Will he succeed in the next challenge?

315
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
They are very good at it.

316
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
They are good at it?

317
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
They are pushing me.

318
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
I'm relieved.

319
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,960
I'm relieved that they are in a good mood.

320
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Sorry.

321
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
No problem.

322
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
This is the last challenge.

323
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
I'm listening to you.

324
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,960
I want you to win the fishing rod again.

325
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
Let's decide.

326
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Thank you.

327
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Start!

328
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Fire! Please!

329
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
It's going to collapse!

330
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Once more!

331
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
From the back.

332
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Yes, yes, turn to this side.

333
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Then, bring your legs this way.

334
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,960
I did it before.

335
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Put your legs...

336
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
You did it.

337
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
You caught it.

338
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Slowly, slowly.

339
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Slowly, slowly.

340
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Slowly, slowly.

341
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Good, good.

342
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Your left leg.

343
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
I'll take your left leg.

344
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,960
I will hold him.

345
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
I will raise my hand.

346
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Please pull him back once.

347
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
I will pull him back.

348
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
I'll do it firmly.

349
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Ouch!

350
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
I'll go.

351
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Can I push?

352
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Ready, go!

353
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Ah! I got it!

354
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
I got it!

355
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Hold the ring.

356
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Hold the ring.

357
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Yes, yes.

358
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
It's okay.

359
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Ready, go!

360
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Okay!

361
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Go!

362
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Wait, wait, wait!

363
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
The rotation is different.

364
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
Stop!

365
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
It's looking good.

366
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
It's looking good.

367
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
It's going forward.

368
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
It's going forward.

369
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Right?

370
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Yes.

371
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Matsumoto-san, you can't rotate.

372
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
I'll do it again.

373
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Matsumoto-san.

374
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Mr. Kazama.

375
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Excuse me.

376
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Excuse me.

377
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Excuse me.

378
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
What's wrong?

379
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
What's wrong?

380
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:26,960
I was thinking of using the power of the wire to rotate it, but I thought that if I changed the magic tape to a string, I could make a reaction without pain.

381
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,960
I don't know what I want to do at all.

382
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,960
It hurts, and I don't like it.

383
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
I don't want to do that.

384
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
I really want to do it.

385
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,960
I want to do it with my legs only.

386
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Some people did it without knowing.

387
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Oh, that's right.

388
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Well, well.

389
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
It's no use doing it without doing it.

390
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,960
It's no use doing it without doing it.

391
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,960
After all, you guys just look at it like this.

392
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
You were looking at it, right?

393
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,960
I didn't cooperate at all.

394
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
I said it at the end.

395
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
What is that? I don't know.

396
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
I don't know.

397
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,960
I put it on and I got a lot of energy.

398
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
I'm not in the mood.

399
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
I finally did it.

400
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,960
I thought I could hold the ring.

401
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
I thought I could hold it.

402
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,960
That's a little different from my character.

403
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Let's cut that part out.

404
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
That's not it.

405
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
I see.

406
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,960
You know, you were shaking my hand.

407
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
I was saying, it hurts.

408
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,960
I was saying it hurts like I was in middle school.

409
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
You shouldn't have told me that.

410
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Can you see the beauty?

411
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Yes, I can.

412
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Stop using the harness.

413
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
I'm not going to do it.

414
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Oh, well.

415
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,960
I'm being told that I have a harness.

416
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,960
How do I get into the studio?

417
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,960
I don't have a harness anymore.

418
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
I wish I had a harness.

419
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
I didn't have a trough.

420
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,960
I'm going to do another show.

421
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Of the company.

422
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm going to start now.

423
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,960
The fifth challenge is no longer allowed.

424
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,960
I've seen it before.

425
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
You've seen it before?

426
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,960
I've seen it before.

427
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Ah, I see.

428
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Ah, I see.

429
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,960
It's okay.

430
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
My present.

431
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,960
I want you to sing it.

432
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
I understand.

433
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
A gift of justice.

434
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Let's decide with this!

435
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Yes!

436
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Let's go!

437
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Thank you!

438
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
First, I'll take this.

439
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Will it reach?

440
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Sorry.

441
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
I got it.

442
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
It's here.

443
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
OK.

444
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Patting.

445
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
OK.

446
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Please lift it up a bit.

447
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
You have to lift it up again.

448
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
It's already spinning.

449
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
No, no.

450
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Please clean it up.

451
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
It's here.

452
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Straight, straight.

453
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Ushiro, you're in the second round.

454
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
You can do it.

455
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
You almost kept it!

456
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,760
One more time!

457
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
One more...

458
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,160
Two times

459
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,720
Two times

460
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,000
One time

461
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,700
One time

462
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,400
One time

463
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
One time

464
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
On top

465
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
You did it!

466
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
You did it!

467
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Yeah!

468
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,400
After overcoming many hardships, Matsumoto successfully completed the spinning technique that surpassed Uchimura Kohei.

469
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,400
56 years old, congratulations.

470
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
You did it!

471
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Okay, okay, okay.

472
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
You did it!

473
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Thank you very much!

474
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Thank you very much!

475
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Are you happy?

476
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,400
You said thank you very much.

477
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
You gave me a wonderful present.

478
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
It was good.

479
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
