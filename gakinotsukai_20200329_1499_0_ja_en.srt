1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Tonight's guest is...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm going to put a hand cell in the power supply

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Sanchiro Komiya's 24 hour long interview, the end

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The past that has been bullied since he was young

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The person who bullied you may be watching this on TV, please say something to the camera

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm already higher than him.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm the one who's lost.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The high school era that started with club activities.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Everyone uses the brand.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's become a school discussion.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
For example, elementary school students.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They're wearing school clothes at school.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Since they were in third grade,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
a boy passed by.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When he took off his jacket, he laughed.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
At the end, he chased after him with a trunk switch.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
He said, kya kya kya, and went home.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Two days later, he went to school with his mother.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He said, this brother of mine, what's going on with you?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Everyone knew about that rumor.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If you sleep on the bed, you'll become M.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What do you think?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Scary, scary, scary!

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Scary, scary, scary, scary!

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Tonight, we will reveal the true face of Komiya!

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's 8.18pm.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There, for dinner, we will go to a restaurant in Komiya.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What's the name of the restaurant you're going to?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's Mara.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Mara.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Mara?

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Is it a restaurant you go to often?

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's a joint restaurant in Yamagata.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A joint restaurant in Yamagata?

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I go there about 3 times a week.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
About a week?

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What is that?

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's a drug for the heart.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It won't heal.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Drink some chocolate.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do you use social media?

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why not?

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Because I'm afraid of comments.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So you don't search for your ego?

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I go searching.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But sometimes, I do.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I get depressed.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What kind of words do you hate?

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
When I was on TV, my wife screamed.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I put a claim in the song.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And...

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I was in high school.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't know if it was a girl or not.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yesterday, at school,

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I was told that I looked like Sanshiro Komiya.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I was told that I looked like Sanshiro Komiya.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And that's how I ended up here.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And then, at the izakaya at Koenji,

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He has arrived at Mara.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Cheers!

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Why are you gulping?

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm not gulping.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's better not to gulp.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
While enjoying the food and continuing the interview,

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A very close junior who is very familiar with Komiya has arrived

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm a little excited

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I've been alone for a long time

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I would like to ask the junior actors about Komiya

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I like to see the girls around me being like,

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wow, this person is so pretty.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's why you're in the picture.

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I went to Komiyama's love hotel.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I bought a drink with my wife.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I was asked to do some errands.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I said, Komiyama-san, and I opened the bottle.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When I said, Komiyama-san, he said, thank you.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He showed me a little bit of his girl's boobs and said,

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I said thank you and showed her breasts a little bit.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She said, go home.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The younger one is exposed to the sexual harassment.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
A very cheerful Komiya.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What is Komiya to you?

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He is a senior who taught me how to be a comedian.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If a prank comes, I will be the one who gets the prank.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What did you learn?

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You have to talk a lot.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't say that.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Even if the staff says it was a prank,

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have to be a good boy.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So I have to be gentle.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We still have 12 hours left.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's hard to do.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What will you do if you do that?

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's scary.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I knew it.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's a prank.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm scared.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't make a scary face.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He always says he wants to sell it with everyone.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm scared.

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
13 hours after the interview.

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm scared.

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The interview resumed at the hotel bar.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You've had a lot to drink.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's so good.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Slowly.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's okay to drink slowly.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You should drink slowly.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't want to drink.

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't want to drink.

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't want to drink.

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Are you okay?

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm drinking alcohol.

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's ask about the love of women.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you.

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
First, what type of woman do you like?

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Type?

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm a bit of a Yankee, but at night, I like a girl who is like M.

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you want to show your S?

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm a Tokoyakuza.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Tokoyakuza?

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Tokoyakuza.

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's the S on the bed.

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Tokoyakuza.

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What kind of relationships do you have with women?

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We have dating and such.

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We have sex at a bar.

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Do you have a dating app?

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't have a dating app anymore.

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't have any.

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Have you met her recently?

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I met her at Star Beach.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But I don't have any experience with her.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Have you met her often?

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes, I have.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How many people did you meet?

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I met her, but she wasn't very pretty.

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
She looked like Suzuki Yami.

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And then I met a person who was a bachelor.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're a man of face, right?

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
When I heard about you, I thought you were like a Madonna.

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That was when I was young.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's why I'm like that.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Where is your company?

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's in Okinawa, right?

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Like this?

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm like this. I'm really like this.

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm like this in a bar.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Where is your company?

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
My company is Ile.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm Ile.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm scared. I'm scared.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Scary, scary, scary.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Scary, scary, scary.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What is the best date plan you have?

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
When I'm drinking, I get scolded.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I was told to accept it, but in the end, the girl on the other side of the street became a M and I was on the bed.

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You can't say that.

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But I was on a date. I drank at a bar.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I see.

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll ask you again, but what is the best date plan for Komewarashi?

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
At night, he'll do something like a monkey dance.

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And then, he'll hold me by my neck and pull me.

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Women are pretty strong, but they'll be M's on the bed.

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Hmm...

172
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
How is it?

173
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
What?

174
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
That's the worst!

175
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
That's the worst!

176
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
That's the worst!

177
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
There's a girl I like.

178
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
What do you mean by you like her?

179
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
There are many things.

180
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
I like her.

181
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
You like her?

182
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Well...

183
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
It's a language barrier.

184
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
After that, Komiya's drinking pace has been accelerated.

185
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Because he's getting drunk, Komiya has ordered something.

186
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Can I have a cigarette?

187
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I'll do it if I get drunk.

188
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
I'm always getting it from my juniors.

189
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I'll give you a cigarette.

190
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Thank you.

191
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:52,500
He gave me a cigarette that he prepared in a hurry, and the interview was about the looks of the senior comedian.

192
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Well, Mr. Tunnel is cool, but Mr. Uchan, Mr. Downtown, and Mr. Uchan, even if they're not that cool, they're popular.

193
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
You made me understand.

194
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Isn't it cool? The people I just talked to.

195
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Who?

196
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Mr. Tunnel, Mr. Tunnel, Mr. Uchan, Mr. Downtown.

197
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I think Tunnel is cool. He's very cool and tall.

198
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Dantan-san, Uchan-nanchan-san, aren't they cool?

199
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
If I say Uchan-nanchan-san, Uchan is cool.

200
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Other than that, he's not cool.

201
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
But he's not cool.

202
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
He's not cool at all.

203
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
He's not cool.

204
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
You're not a man?

205
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
You're a man?

206
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I'm not a man.

207
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
You're not a man?

208
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
What do you think is cool about him?

209
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
He has a mole on his nose.

210
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
I just noticed that.

211
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
What about you, Kanda?

212
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Isn't he cool?

213
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
He's not that tall.

214
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
You're right.

215
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
I'm small, right?

216
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I'm just tall and cool.

217
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Is that all?

218
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Tall and cool is equal to cool, right?

219
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
I'm going to die.

220
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
I'm going to die now.

221
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
14 hours have passed since the beginning of the interview.

222
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
It's been 14 hours.

223
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
He's going to go back to his room and rest soon.

224
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
The interview will resume.

225
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Next time.

226
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Excuse me.

227
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
You changed?

228
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
From me.

229
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
You changed?

230
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Yes, I changed.

231
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
I think women are better.

232
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
That's right.

233
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
In terms of mood and mood.

234
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Well, I'm a soft person.

235
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Are you happier when women come to you?

236
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Yes, they say that.

237
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Yes.

238
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Then, let's continue.

239
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,500
What kind of person do you want to see in the entertainment world?

240
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
I want to see a person who is still drinking.

241
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Where do you want to end your job?

242
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,500
I want to go to the Tokyo Yoka.

243
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Who is the senior you respect?

244
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
I think it's Rega.

245
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
What kind of story do you tell?

246
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I tell her that I borrowed her glasses and she didn't wear them.

247
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Oh, really?

248
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
You're going to go with your senior's invitation?

249
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Yes, I'm going.

250
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,500
How many times do you want to continue being a fan?

251
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
60 years old.

252
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
60 years old?

253
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Why are you 60 years old?

254
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
I want to be with you.

255
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
You can't get it at 60.

256
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I'm 65.

257
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
He's starting to get tired of the endless questions.

258
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
I don't know the answer.

259
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Then...

260
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Can't we take a break?

261
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Do we have to do this for 9 hours?

262
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
We took a lot of questions.

263
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Are you sure you are doing this seriously?

264
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Yes, we are.

265
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
I thought we would do it well.

266
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
We can do it.

267
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Because the amount of questions is too much.

268
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
What is this tone?

269
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Why does it have to be like this?

270
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
What is that?

271
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Is it done by an incompetent staff?

272
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,500
It's a long story.

273
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
It's a long story.

274
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Then I'll continue.

275
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Did you hear?

276
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Listen to me.

277
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
I don't know the answer.

278
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Let's talk.

279
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
If you don't have a nod,

280
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
There are many types of people.

281
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
What is it?

282
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Scary.

283
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
I'll shoot it with my eyes.

284
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
It's stuck.

285
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
It's stuck.

286
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
It's angry.

287
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
It's angry.

288
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Is it about the grave after death?

289
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Let's just die.

290
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Let's just die.

291
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
15 hours have passed since the interview started.

292
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:14,500
He doesn't let his tiredness go, but he refreshes himself with a test.

293
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Komiyama-san, while you are getting a massage, please continue to tell us your story.

294
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,500
What is the most memorable thing about the formation of Sanshiro?

295
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Please tell us more about it.

296
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,500
I want to be friends with her.

297
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,500
What is your relationship with your partner, Aida?

298
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,500
We are friends now, but we will always be friends.

299
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:58,500
After 20 minutes, Komiya is completely silent.

300
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Komiya-san, please open your eyes.

301
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I'm not going to open my eyes.

302
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
He's a manga-taro.

303
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
A manga-taro.

304
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
He's scared even though he's getting a massage.

305
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
He's really scared.

306
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
I'm the best.

307
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
You're the best.

308
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
16 hours have passed since the interview started.

309
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Wow, amazing.

310
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
16?

311
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
3 minutes left.

312
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
8 hours left until the interview.

313
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
8 hours?

314
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,500
How do you feel about looking back so far?

315
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
8 hours?

316
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
You've been answering the interview so far.

317
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Wait a minute.

318
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Your phone...

319
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
How is it?

320
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Please show me your phone.

321
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I can't even understand the time. It's hard.

322
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,500
He can't accept the remaining time.

323
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
He's making a fuss.

324
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
8 hours left.

325
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Wait a minute.

326
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,040
I'm waiting.

327
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,920
What?

328
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Why don't you sit down and continue with your interview?

329
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,300
No, no, OK, OK.

330
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,040
Let me just show her my phone.

331
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,560
We only introduce you to her through interviews and this is all there is to say.

332
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,060
By Ingredience, yes.

333
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,560
We only introduce you to her through interviews and this is all there is to say.

334
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,940
By Cond dólares?

335
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,440
Yes, this is all there is to say.

336
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,100
By Cond PTSIUS.

337
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,060
camp?

338
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,980
Withhhhhhh woke-up

339
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,580
Don't put your Unfortunately to the test!

340
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,440
You have a right to find out, first of all.

341
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,760
So I have your Cats Simon?

342
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,060
Not at all.

343
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,060
Then why did you come out?

344
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,060
You were told to come out, right?

345
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,060
You don't have any power, right?

346
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
No, I don't have any power.

347
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,060
So how much longer do you have?

348
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
I'm telling you to look at your phone.

349
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,060
Why did you go somewhere?

350
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Anyway, let's continue.

351
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,060
It's already exhausted.

352
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,060
How to get through?

353
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,060
What is the most important thing in your life?

354
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,060
My core.

355
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,060
My core.

356
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,060
Compared to Hamada-san.

357
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
You're saying that you're a good son.

358
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,060
I think my core is my core.

359
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,060
What do you think about the fact that you're becoming a YouTuber?

360
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,060
I feel lonely when I watch TV.

361
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,060
But I think it's okay.

362
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,060
I think it's fun.

363
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,060
Do you have any memorable love songs?

364
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,060
Hello Again

365
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,060
Hello Again

366
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,060
What kind of memories do you have of that song?

367
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:57,060
It's a song about a girl I liked and a girl I loved singing along with me

368
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,060
I was cheating on her

369
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,060
I was in trouble

370
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,060
Why?

371
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:10,060
I was at home, and there was a girl, and I didn't have a cell phone, so I said,

372
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,060
Can I use my cell phone?

373
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:18,060
I said, sure, and I looked at the screen, and I saw my name on the screen.

374
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,060
It was GEO's Higashi Nakane.

375
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I thought, what is this?

376
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,060
And then I walked away.

377
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,060
I don't want to be in the same situation as you.

378
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,060
The interview continues.

379
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,060
Komiya answers seriously.

380
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
There are only 2 hours left.

381
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,060
While the staff is still in a daze,

382
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,060
Finally, this man.

383
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,060
Mr. Komiya.

384
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,060
Mr. Komiya.

385
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
I'm so tired.

386
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,060
I'm so tired.

387
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
I'm so tired.

388
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,060
One more minute until the 24-hour time limit.

389
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,060
He drinks a nutritious drink to get rid of his drowsiness.

390
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,060
And it's 9 a.m.

391
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
There's only one hour left.

392
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
There's only one hour left.

393
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,060
There's only one hour left.

394
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Let's do our best with Dustspout.

395
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,060
If you could grant 3 wishes of the Lamp of the Magic, what would you wish for?

396
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,060
Hmm...

397
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,060
I wish for a blood transfusion,

398
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,060
a cure for my tooth condition,

399
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,060
and a cure for my hay fever.

400
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,060
When do you think Rock died?

401
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,060
Hmm...

402
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,060
Probably when Sid Vicious died.

403
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,060
Do you like Sex Pistols?

404
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:05,060
Yes, I like Sex Pistols and Japanese Rock.

405
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,060
Gagaga Special, and Ginnan Boys.

406
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,060
So you have a rocker side?

407
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:17,060
Yes, I think I'm a rocker in a sense.

408
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:24,060
I think my lifestyle is similar to rock.

409
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,060
What would you name yourself if you were to become a pro-wrestler?

410
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:35,060
I'd name myself Masuku the Komiya.

411
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,060
Looking back on this 24 hour interview, what would you name yourself?

412
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,060
What would I name myself?

413
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:51,060
I've talked about a lot of things, but I'm not lying.

414
00:20:51,060 --> 00:21:01,060
I was tired, but I think I was just playing around.

415
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,060
I'm sorry.

416
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:10,060
Up to this point, he has answered 2837 questions.

417
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,060
And finally, the time has come.

418
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,060
This will be the last question.

419
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,060
What is your life like after 24 hours?

420
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,060
I don't think I gave up.

421
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,060
I don't think I gave up.

422
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,060
But I think it was rock.

423
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,060
I don't know what I'm saying.

424
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,060
I think it's time.

425
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Sorry, you have 24 hours.

426
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
How do you feel now?

427
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
I'm happy.

428
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,060
I really did it for real.

429
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
I'm sorry.

430
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,060
Well, that's how it is.

431
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,060
We've seen everything.

432
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,060
I thought it was 8 hours, but he slept that long.

433
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
It was really scary.

434
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,060
I thought it was about 5 hours.

435
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:28,060
The interviewer said that the male person didn't fit the story.

436
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,060
I didn't know that.

437
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,060
I didn't know that.

438
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,060
It was too early.

439
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:36,060
Maybe he said it because he wanted to make people feel annoyed.

440
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,060
Well...

441
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
Yama-chan, you don't know.

442
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,060
If you do it for 21 hours, you'll get angry.

443
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,060
I'm serious.

444
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,060
Everyone is serious.

445
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
I'm serious too.

446
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,060
But I think Shimo is more amazing.

447
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
I see.

448
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
He's called Tokoyakuza.

449
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,060
I've never heard of it.

450
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,060
Is that a word?

451
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,060
It's not a verb.

452
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,060
Of course it's not a verb.

453
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,060
I don't know.

454
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,060
If you search, you can find it.

455
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:06,060
Usually, he is a high school student, but he is on the bed, and he is in front of the toilet, and he is in the toilet.

456
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,060
In the toilet?

457
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
Stop saying that.

458
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,060
In the toilet, it's OK.

459
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,060
It's OK, but I don't care.

460
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,060
I don't care.

461
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,060
And he is very particular about his position.

462
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,060
I don't like that part.

463
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:29,140
You just made it come out medic, so I wonder if that person has qualifications or not, and then you said you don't have qualifications, so you're looking crazy

464
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,980
They're next to you

465
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,700
They're in front.

466
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,060
So what's that person doing in the room, he's looking COVID

467
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,640
So you don't have qualifications

468
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,760
I don't even have that right to say that

469
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,900
I think that someone doesn't have qualifications, they would often

470
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,600
see that, if they have qualifications

471
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,420
If you have qualifications, then..

472
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,400
I know

473
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,400
You can't get a good shot without a G.

474
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Then what do you think people with G are doing?

475
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
People without G are coming out.

476
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
People with G are...

477
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
G G, shut up!

478
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Shut up!

479
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
That's not true.

480
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
People without G are coming out.
