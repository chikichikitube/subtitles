1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's win with 100 points difference in the first episode of Ragi no Tsukaya!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Mr. Madoh, it's a good weather.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's a good weather.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm playing the game after watching this title.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What do you mean?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Recently, there are many restrictions.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Everyone is stressed out.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm going to blow up here and win.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We can win 100-0.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Mr. Hamada.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We are the student team.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We played baseball here.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But we can't win 100 points.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Even 20 points is not a big deal.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We have to play home base more than 100 times.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We have to play more than 10 times per person.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But it's not baseball.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's softball.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's like throwing it from the bottom

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Bang bang!

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The average score we got was about 48

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
About 48

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In the end, after we got all the scores,

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
we said that the weather was the only good thing

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's a battle

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's really boring

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's hard

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's win the game with 100 points difference

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This time, they will beat the opponent until they get 100 points difference

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a pleasant game

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The important opponent is

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You are calling only the ones who can't move

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There are many who can't move

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This way, this way.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Even more, even more.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Even more?

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,500
Yes.

40
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Now, let's have the opponents appear.

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,000
Please.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you for waiting.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
100 Tensha Borogatsu Softball.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The players of the opposing team have entered.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Number 72, Takashi Sasano.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Takashi Sasano.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Takashi Sasano.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Takashi Sasano.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Wow.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Takashi Sasano.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Really?

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What are you talking about?

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You don't have any baseball experience, do you?

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's the same as Nariho.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But it's a light baseball.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can't do this kind of reckless planning.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're saying it's a bad idea.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm not going to take it out.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm not going to take it out.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm not going to take it out.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm a fan of thinking about other things.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Even if it's a variety show.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But it's not just Sasahara-san, right?

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Even if Sasahara-san was the only one who was in the game, what would the other players think?

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's the problem

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's go to the next player

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Number 45, Fifi

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It doesn't suit the uniform!

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's very uncomfortable

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Have you ever played softball?

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Baseball?

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Egypt doesn't play that at all.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
They don't play baseball.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But I think I can do it.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Really?

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You have to get the ball.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Africa has a high physical ability.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The wind is strong.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The wind of the desert!

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's go to the next game!

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Stepangu, No.11, DJ Kou

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What?

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hey hey hey hey hey hey!

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The king of the New York City

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What about Kou?

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hey hey hey hey hey hey!

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll make you laugh!

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Kou, you have power, right?

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I have power, I'm fine

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Kou, you don't do anything, right? You don't play baseball or other sports, right?

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, I don't play baseball, but I played rugby

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Really?

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But it's different.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's different.

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Next player, please.

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Number 72, Mr. Maric.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Mr. Maric.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Maric is here.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He's here.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The uniform is already dirty.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What happened?

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He's here.

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The uniform is already dirty.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What happened?

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You are not an experienced player, right?

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I touched softball for the first time in 60 years

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I see

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is good, I understand

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Please

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Next player, please

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Number 66, Mizusawa Aki

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mizusawa Aki

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Really?

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He is fine

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He is fine

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Please don't get hurt

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Please listen to the injury

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Are you doing any exercise?

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm a hip hopper, so I can do this.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can do this.

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I understand.

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Please take care of me.

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Next player, please.

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No.53, Taka Toriki.

125
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How did you do that?

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It looks so heavy

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's heavy

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How much do you weigh?

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
120kg

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I can't run

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You are a batter

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Have you played softball?

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, since I was in elementary school

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't know about the ball

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You have to use your body

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Seba-kun, 73kg, Okamoto Nobuto

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okamoto Nobuto

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's a very simple line.

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's simple.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's simple.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's simple.

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How did you learn that?

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The shop is closed now.

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm just doing what I do.

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You don't have to do that.

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Excuse me, but how about your experience with the softball?

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I played it a little 40 years ago.

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Everyone is like that.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
No.60, Daniel Karr.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Daniel Karr.

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This is definitely not.

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Definitely not.

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Ah, the skater.

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The skater.

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Daniel-san.

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What's wrong?

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I did it a lot when I was a kid.

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Your body is so big.

159
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You can do a good batting.

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It looks like you can hit.

161
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I feel like I'm a ticket collector.

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The last one is this person.

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Number 54, Sakamoto-chan.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He was sleeping until the end.

165
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm Sakamoto-chan. Nice to meet you.

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Can you do it?

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Can you do it?

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I've gained 88kg.

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm a yellow-eyed man

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,540
I'm a

171
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,540
Can you do it?

172
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:35,380
I've done it in the school days

173
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,380
It's been 45 years

174
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,420
You can get 100 points with this

175
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,420
I think I can do it

176
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,420
Really?

177
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,420
I can do it

178
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,420
If you roll it, it will stop

179
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,420
No, no, no

180
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,420
What kind of...

181
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,420
Three-way

182
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,420
Are you serious?

183
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Of course

184
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,420
Are you hungry?

185
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,420
Are you hungry?

186
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,420
You have a great sense of direction

187
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,420
The game starts 3 hours ago

188
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
The first day of the trip

189
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,420
Good morning

190
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,420
The guest team 9, including Sasano, arrived at the resort early to warm up

191
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,420
We'll do our best

192
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,420
It's cold

193
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,420
I'm sorry to wake you up this early

194
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,420
I don't know what's going to happen

195
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,420
It's fun to do 100 push-ups

196
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,420
It's not easy

197
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,420
No matter how hard it is

198
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,420
Even though it's sunny, it's still a cold season

199
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,420
So they warm up carefully

200
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,420
This is hard

201
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,420
Isn't it amazing?

202
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,420
After warming up with jogging, they stretch

203
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,420
5,6,7,8

204
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,420
Stretch the back of the thighs

205
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,420
How was it? Did you relax?

206
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
No, but I did stretch

207
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,420
It's dangerous if you don't stretch

208
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,420
It's about 10 seconds.

209
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,420
As the tension in his muscles gradually loosens with the dash,

210
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,420
Let's go for the handstand.

211
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,420
he practices knocking to get used to the softball.

212
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,420
However, he is a beginner.

213
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,420
The former idol Mizusawa Aki.

214
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,420
I got it!

215
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,420
I got it!

216
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,420
Fifi from Egypt

217
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,420
Daniel Kaur who is good at Yamagata dialect

218
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,420
He is good at tunneling

219
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:26,420
20 years ago, he was the top student in the university entrance exam.

220
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,420
He caught it with his knee.

221
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,420
Are you able to do it, Okamoto-san?

222
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,420
No, I'm not able to do it at all.

223
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,420
You're able to move the most, right?

224
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,420
Yes.

225
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,420
Just now, I was so tired that my legs were shaking.

226
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,420
I'm so tired

227
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,420
Of course, the team is warming up before the match

228
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,420
It was warm

229
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,420
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

230
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,420
Make some noise!

231
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,420
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

232
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,420
Let's do it again

233
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
I was surprised

234
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:29,420
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

235
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
Stretch your back.

236
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,420
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

237
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,420
Let's do 200.

238
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,420
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

239
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,420
Stretch your front.

240
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,420
Keep your back straight.

241
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,420
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

242
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,420
The director is shaking.

243
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,420
His legs are so slanted.

244
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
Ready, go!

245
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,420
Don't throw it like that

246
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,420
That was dangerous

247
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,420
You're a long-distance runner

248
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,420
You're a long-distance runner

249
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,420
Why are you running like that?

250
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,420
The ball is huge

251
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,420
Your butt hurts

252
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,420
I want to hit you like this

253
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,420
Are you ready?

254
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,420
The ball is big

255
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,420
Don't say that

256
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,420
It's been a while since I've seen this kind of ball

257
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,420
I'm ready

258
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,420
I'll say it like this

259
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,420
This is serious

260
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,420
This is scary

261
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,420
After warming up

262
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,420
The order meeting to win the casting

263
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,420
First, from Da Jun

264
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,420
The first shot was a bit too much for me.

265
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,420
Running home run.

266
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
I'll go home.

267
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,420
I'll go home.

268
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,420
Running home run.

269
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,420
It's a waste, but I'll go home.

270
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,420
That's right.

271
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,420
What about Tanaka?

272
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,420
Do you want to go?

273
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,420
I played baseball.

274
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,420
Then you'll play here.

275
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
Yes.

276
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,420
I'm going to be the 4th.

277
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,420
You're not going to be the 4th.

278
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,420
I'm going to be the home run.

279
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,420
Yama-chan, are you going to be the 3rd?

280
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
No, Hamada-san.

281
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,420
Let's go with the cleanup.

282
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,420
Let's go with the cleanup.

283
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,420
Hamada-san, Matsuyama.

284
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Okada.

285
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,420
Okada.

286
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
Are you going to be the Inamoto?

287
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
Or Fujiwara?

288
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,420
Either is fine.

289
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
You guys are experienced.

290
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,420
I was a soccer player.

291
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
Who are you?

292
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,420
Yoshinobu-san and Komu-san.

293
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,420
I don't need that.

294
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,420
Yoshinobu-san is over there.

295
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,420
Yoshinobu-san will be the last one.

296
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
I'll be killed instantly.

297
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,420
Let's go.

298
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,420
Do you want to be a pitcher?

299
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
No, I'm not good at playing with my shoulders.

300
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,420
I'm not good at playing with my shoulders.

301
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,420
This one was bad too.

302
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,420
Short.

303
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,420
It's important to get the first one.

304
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
You have to get it.

305
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,420
Can you do it?

306
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,420
Tanaka can do it.

307
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,420
You can do it.

308
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,420
Yes, I can.

309
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
What about the second one?

310
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,420
There are many catchers.

311
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
There are many catchers.

312
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
There are many catchers.

313
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,420
Fujiwara...

314
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,420
Can you do it?

315
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,420
I think it's better to be a little bigger.

316
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
I don't have any experience, but I'll do it.

317
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
Are you okay?

318
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,420
Are you sure you are OK with this?

319
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,420
It's not funny at all at home.

320
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Then I can't do it.

321
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,420
If it's funny, I can't do it either.

322
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,420
You need a third.

323
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,420
I'll do it then.

324
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,420
I'll go.

325
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,420
What about the second?

326
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,420
You go.

327
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,420
The pitcher will start.

328
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,420
Then Yama will start.

329
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,420
Then Masumoto will go.

330
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,420
It's your turn.

331
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
You can't do it.

332
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,420
There is a possibility that they won't come back to us

333
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,420
That's right

334
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,420
They will take 100 points

335
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,420
They will attack the first floor

336
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,420
The first floor is 100 points

337
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,420
Yes, yes, yes

338
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,420
They don't need to protect

339
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,420
Sasano-san is doing his best

340
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,420
White board

341
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,420
It's like a school without a classroom during the war

342
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,420
It's like a school without a classroom during the war

343
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:42,420
From Sadaima, the team that uses the children against the Fingpio All Stars is starting the game.

344
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,420
We will introduce the defense of the Fingpio All Stars.

345
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420

363
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,040
The bag's Audrey Schultz is Shirley S dites

364
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,980
Number 3

365
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Ah!

366
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
100 points!

367
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,040
100 points!

368
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,820
There is no need to shape it

369
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,340
Not yet!

370
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,620
This person still square!

371
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
This person will fly, the bag

372
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,820
Don't throw!

373
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
It's a little bit too much.

374
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
Mr. Kasano is full of motivation.

375
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
The timing is a little bit off.

376
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
It's a ball. It's not a ball.

377
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
It's not a ball at all.

378
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Let's just shoot it.

379
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
It's a ball.

380
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
If you do it sideways, you can't shoot.

381
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Here we go.

382
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
Nice!

383
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820

384
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
Fighting!

385
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,820
But you...

386
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
It's like this

387
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,820
I thought you were more slow

388
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
100 points!

389
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
2 points!

390
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820

391
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
7-0

393
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
You're doing great!

394
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
Go, go, go!

395
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
Go, go, go!

396
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
Goal, goal, goal!

397
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
That was close.

398
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Good, good.

399
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
That was good.

400
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Go, go, go!

401
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
I'll pull it.

402
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,820
That was dangerous!

403
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
Dangerous!

404
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
Dangerous!

405
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Dangerous!

406
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,820
3 points, 3 points, 3 points

407
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,820
Okay, goal!

408
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
Okay, goal!

409
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
2 points

410
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
If you pick up the ball, you'll think...

411
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Throw it!

412
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
It's the worst

413
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
You can't do that!

414
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
You can't shoot like that!

415
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
Out!

416
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,820
