1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I want to know more about Inagaki Gorou

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Quiz, Inagaki Gorou's 100 things

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
National star, Inagaki Gorou

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
With Satoru Shindo and Kishinagi Tsuyoshi, he has created new characters and has been very active in dramas and variety shows

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Big news!

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Big news!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Last year, they had to show off their music and read the big news

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Tonight, we will reveal the true face of the mysterious national star

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
First question

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What is it?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What is Goro's hobby?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I have no idea.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I have no choice but to guess.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I have no choice but to guess.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The answer is open.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ah, I see.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So I'm the only one who's doing outdoor sports?

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't think so.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't have the image of tennis.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Is there anyone who drinks wine?

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If you collect wine, it's boo.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's right.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If there's wine on it, it's the right answer.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There are people who put it on the wine server.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Isn't it good to drink wine, including that?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
No, it's a bit...

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,800
I'll give you a bonus.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Really?

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
No, no, it's fine.

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Now, the correct answer.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
It's cute.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
It's not bare skin.

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
What is Gorou's hobby?

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Oh, it's Gorou.

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Hobby.

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,800
I have many hobbies.

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Really?

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,800
But, as I thought, I haven't been able to do it recently.

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Golf.

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
No image.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
The only thing that is different from golf is the outdoor.

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
I have no idea.

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
It was outdoor.

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Can't you take some of the forbidden area?

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
That's not good.

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Golf and tennis are completely different.

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Outdoor is the only thing that is different from this.

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Golf and tennis are a little different.

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Really?

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Golf is different from this question.

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Golf...

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
What is his special skill?

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
I don't know

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
It's not golf

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Open the answer

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Oh, mouth-to-mouth

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Something

58
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
This is amazing

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Goro-chan is blowing like this

60
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
He's been blowing for a long time except for recording

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Now, the correct answer is

62
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Goro's specialty is

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,800
He sees through the true nature of people at first sight

64
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Don't you want to hear more details?

65
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
What do you mean?

66
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I want to hear a little

67
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:45,800
When I first met her, I knew she was a good person and that she would suit me.

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Excuse me, I met her for the first time.

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,800
How did you feel when you first met her?

70
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Well, Ho-Sein is...

71
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,800
He doesn't really have much contact with me.

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
But he's very...

73
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
He's very confident.

74
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
He has a glass heart.

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,800
I think that's what he's like.

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I'm sorry, I've never been interested in him.

77
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I'm really sorry.

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,800
I was thinking about it

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
I was in a lot of trouble

80
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Do you think that much?

81
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
What is Gorou's charm point?

82
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Let's go to guess

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
I will definitely guess

84
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
If I say it very simply

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
That's right

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
I don't know

87
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Well, whatever

88
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Answer open

89
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Is it Matsumoto?

90
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Matsumoto-san, it's Urunda.

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Yes, I added a little bit.

92
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Yes.

93
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
So here, the difference between Endo and Urunda appears.

94
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
This is the eyes.

95
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
It's more clear for me.

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,800
If it's Urunda and eyes, it's my point.

97
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
It's not Endo anymore.

98
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
If it's Urunda, it's not Endo anymore.

99
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
That's right.

100
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
If it's eyes, it's Endo's point.

101
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
No, I'll add a little more.

102
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
What kind of eyes?

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I'll add more.

104
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
If you get the word, you lose.

105
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
If you get the word, you lose.

106
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
If you get the word, you lose.

107
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Now, the correct answer.

108
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
He always has a straight face.

109
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,800
The gap between his straight face and his smile?

110
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
His eyes are quite narrow.

111
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
I don't like his smile.

112
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
This gap?

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
AL llam it the eyes

114
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,520
They call it that

115
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,720
can't really search for it

116
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,380
you can kinda panic

117
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,740
What rendering of the movie does he fiancied?

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,920
Let's go

119
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
I think this is how they look at it

120
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,460
Apply direction

121
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,460
This is a lucky question.

122
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460
I'll take this.

123
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,460
Is this a lucky question?

124
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,460
Goro-chan has this image.

125
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,460
This is amazing.

126
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,460
The answer is...

127
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,460
This is really...

128
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,460
I have an image.

129
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
Everyone knows this.

130
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,460
It's famous.

131
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,460
Yes, it is.

132
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,460
I can't wait for this.

133
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,460
Yes.

134
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
Now, the correct answer.

135
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,460
What is Goro's favorite alcohol?

136
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,460
Well...

137
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,460
Wine.

138
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,460
Yes!

139
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,460
Okay!

140
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,460
Okay, okay, okay.

141
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,460
This is also a feeling that you knew without saying anything.

142
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,460
It's like, what are you listening to?

143
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,460
That's right.

144
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,460
Beer?

145
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Is there anyone who removes it?

146
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,460
If you wear beer there...

147
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,460
It's a full-blown feeling of going to the bird.

148
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,460
It's not a bird.

149
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,460
Remove it with beer?

150
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,460
Please don't do that. I didn't go to get it.

151
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,460
Alright, I've caught up with you.

152
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,460
What was Gorou's childhood dream?

153
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,460
Eh?

154
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,460
Wah, what is it?

155
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,460
Please!

156
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,460
The answer is open!

157
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,460
Matsumoto-san, you are an idol?

158
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,460
I think I have decided.

159
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,460
Let's announce the correct answer.

160
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,460
Keiji-san.

161
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,460
He is not an idol.

162
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,460
He is not an idol.

163
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,460
Keiji-san?

164
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,460
Why did you want to be Keiji?

165
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,460
I wanted to be Clint Eastwood.

166
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,460
Dirty Harry.

167
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,460
It's difficult.

168
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,460
I'm a good person to Yamanaki-san.

169
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,460
No, no, no.

170
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,460
A little more.

171
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,460
Beer for baseball is like the body of the Summers.

172
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,460
Are you an old man?

173
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,460
I'm like a representative of the old man.

174
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,460
What is the most important thing for Goroh?

175
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,460
What is the answer?

176
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,460
It's difficult

177
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,460
It's difficult, isn't it?

178
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
The answer is open

179
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,460
I was able to say this because I liked it

180
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,460
But people who like golf might not like it

181
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,460
Well, you're right, you took care of it

182
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,460
You said it

183
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,460
And Hosei-san can't even laugh

184
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:04,460
If you don't become a comedian, you can't find the word, Kyo.

185
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,460
I found the word, Kyo, but I didn't find it.

186
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,460
You don't say it.

187
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,460
Now, the correct answer.

188
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,460
This is a personal space around me.

189
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,460
I thought it was Tanaka for a moment.

190
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,460
I thought it was Tanaka.

191
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,460
It's a staff around me.

192
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,460
It's like a feeling towards your friends.

193
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,460
It's difficult.

194
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,460
It's a distance.

195
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,460
If Goroh were to go out with a member of the group, who would it be?

196
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,460
This is something that Hamada-san, who is not here right now, would say.

197
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
He's alive.

198
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,460
He's really energetic.

199
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,460
Hamada-san is not a suspect.

200
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,460
He's just a suspect.

201
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,460
Ah, but...

202
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,460
Let's see...

203
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,460
You said yourself that you like golf.

204
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,460
Yes.

205
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,460
You said yourself that you like golf.

206
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,460
I think you know that I like golf.

207
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,460
Really? How do you know?

208
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,460
I've told you that I like golf.

209
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,460
I don't have any.

210
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,460
I've never thought about you.

211
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,460
I remember that.

212
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,460
I think so too.

213
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,460
I've never thought about it in my life.

214
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,460
Now, the correct answer.

215
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,460
Who is the member who goes to drink with the members?

216
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
Endo?

217
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
Really?

218
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Thank you.

219
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
Why?

220
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460
I feel good. Thank you.

221
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,460
Thank you very much.

222
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,460
Why?

223
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,460
I think it's because of golf.

224
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Honestly, everyone wasn't that different.

225
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,460
It's like, who cares?

226
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,460
But Endo-san is the only one who can play golf.

227
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,460
That's true.

228
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,460
I thought he would have it.

229
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,460
I thought Matsumoto-san would be in pain.

230
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,460
I'm worried about that

231
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,460
I see

232
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,460
It was surprising that he put it on everything

233
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,460
What kind of underwear does Gorou wear?

234
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,460
What kind of underwear?

235
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,460
What's a betta?

236
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,460
Answer open

237
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,460
It's like this, right?

238
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,460
But the three of you are boxers, right?

239
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,460
Yes, that's right.

240
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,460
I got that.

241
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,460
Kage-chan?

242
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
No, no.

243
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,460
This is no good.

244
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
It's not like that.

245
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,460
I thought so.

246
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,460
You've wrapped too much in it.

247
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,460
Now, the correct answer is...

248
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,460
Boxer brief.

249
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,460
Alright!

250
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
Thank you.

251
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,460
Okay, okay.

252
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,460
What are you talking about?

253
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,460
Please join us soon.

254
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,460
We've been doing this for a long time.

255
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,460
Why?

256
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,460
What is the most expensive gift that Goroh has ever received?

257
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,460
He must have received many things.

258
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,460
Ah, that one...

259
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,460
Wow, what is it?

260
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,460
That one is not here.

261
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,460
Open the answer!

262
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,460
That one is not here.

263
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,460
But it's like this.

264
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,460
That's right.

265
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,460
Vintage wine.

266
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,460
How much is it?

267
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,460
About 3 million yen.

268
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,460
I'll be in the trial for that.

269
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,460
That's tough.

270
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,460
Cars...

271
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,460
How much is a car?

272
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,460
That's a lot of money.

273
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,460
No, no, no.

274
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,460
That's how it is with wine.

275
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,460
If you become an accident, you'll still be in trouble.

276
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,460
You won't give me an accident.

277
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,460
I don't need an accident.

278
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,460
That's 20 million yen.

279
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,460
That's a lot of money.

280
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,460
That's a lot of money.

281
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,460
That's a lot of money for a golf club.

282
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,460
Gold Club is 1 million yen.

283
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,460
Full set is 1 million yen.

284
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,460
The winner is...

285
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,460
This is...

286
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,460
1 million yen.

287
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,460
1 million yen.

288
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
Now, the correct answer.

289
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,460
I think I know this.

290
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,460
When I was in my teens...

291
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,460
Rolex watch?

292
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,460
Yes!

293
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,460
It's about 500,000 yen.

294
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,460
Probably.

295
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
I can't agree with that.

296
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,460
I was selling it.

297
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,460
It was half a million yen.

298
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,460
No, no, no.

299
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
I think it's worth it.

300
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,460
The most stressful moment is...

301
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,460
...a crowd.

302
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,460
The correct answer is at the end.

303
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,460
That's right.

304
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,460
Taking a picture of a flower.

305
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,460
The unexpected answers are repeated.

306
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
I see a video of that.

307
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,460
That is...

308
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Ikezawa.

309
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,460
Goro-chan doesn't even know that.

310
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,460
After talking,

311
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,460
after saying this and that,

312
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,460
he says,

313
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,460
do you understand?

314
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,460
That's difficult.

315
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
It's not difficult.

316
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,460
What is the name of the lullaby?

317
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,460
I don't expect anything from people.

318
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,460
That was a great answer.

319
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,460
I don't expect anything from people.

320
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,460
Endo has been leading the 3-question-correct answer.

321
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,460
Will he be able to get the correct answer back?

322
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:07,460
Who do you think is the most useless member of the 5th generation?

323
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
This is a service question.

324
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
This is...

325
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
Wait a minute.

326
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,460
But...

327
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,460
That's right.

328
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,460
That's right.

329
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
That's it.

330
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,460
That person is not that person.

331
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,460
No, I guess you got it.

332
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,460
I didn't feel that much hatred for Tanaka.

333
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,460
I know it's not Endo.

334
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,460
I know it's not Endo.

335
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Well, that's right.

336
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
But I'm not interested in it either.

337
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,460
But you're not interested in it, so it's not a failure.

338
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,460
I'm not interested in it. I don't think it's a failure.

339
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:51,460
I think, Hamada is not a failure, but a disorder in his life.

340
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,460
Ah, I see.

341
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,460
That's what I mean.

342
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,460
He doesn't change his underwear.

343
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,460
That's what I think.

344
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,460
I have all the answers, but I can't put them all.

345
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,460
Now, the correct answer.

346
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,460
Stop it, Goro-chan

347
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,460
It's Hosei-san

348
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,460
What?

349
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,460
Eh? Goro-chan?

350
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460
Even when he's sweating

351
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
What? You were going to say the reason

352
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,460
You said the reason yourself

353
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,460
I have the image of him sweating on TV

354
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
Goro-chan's way of looking at things has changed

355
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
That's right

356
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:38,460
How many seconds can Goro do 10 push-ups?

357
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,460
I think he can do 10

358
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,460
How many are you able to do?

359
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,460
I think I can do a few

360
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,460
I think this is enough

361
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,460
This will hit, right?

362
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,460
It's a matter of who can do it

363
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,460
So fast

364
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,960
So you do it with the intention of doing it quickly, right?

365
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Yes, yes, yes.

366
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
You have to hit it completely.

367
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Yes.

368
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,460
Then, the announcement of the correct answer.

369
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,960
You have a lot of eye power.

370
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Please prepare for the announcement.

371
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,460
Are you ready?

372
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,460
Yes.

373
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,960
I'll sing 10 times, right?

374
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Yes.

375
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Is it okay like this?

376
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,460
Yes.

377
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,460
Is it okay?

378
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,960
Yes.

379
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,460
Ready, start!

380
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:35,460
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

381
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,460
Correct!

382
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
Seriously?

383
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,460
Even though it's a failure

384
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
It's not a failure

385
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,460
It's not a failure at all

386
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:58,460
What is Goro's favorite song from SMAP?

387
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,460
There are so many songs

388
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,460
This is a chance question

389
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,460
It's close to the previous one

390
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,460
The answer is

391
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,460
The answer is...

392
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,460
That's right.

393
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,460
That's right, but...

394
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,460
I think Lion Heart is also there.

395
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,460
I think it's really there.

396
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,460
Dynamite.

397
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,460
Even if it's a dynamite...

398
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,460
Stop it!

399
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,460
Now, the correct answer.

400
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,460
Well, this is too difficult.

401
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Of course, there's only one flower in the world.

402
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,460
And then, there's orange.

403
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,460
There are many songs that I like, but the most is called Summer Day Yuka.

404
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
No, Goroh, that's not true.

405
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
No, it's not true.

406
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,460
We don't say that.

407
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,460
Summer Day Yuka.

408
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,460
Goroh, that's...

409
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,460
Summer Day Yuka.

410
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,460
No, we don't know that.

411
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,460
That's...

412
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,460
The result is...

413
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,460
What is Gorou's weakness?

414
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,460
The answer is...

415
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,460
Amazing!

416
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Amazing!

417
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,460
I've never seen anything like this before.

418
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,460
If you get this right, it's probably the first time in the past.

419
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,460
That's right.

420
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,460
Now, the correct answer.

421
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,460
Let's go with this.

422
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,460
The weak point is...

423
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,460
I think it's dance.

424
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,460
I think it's dance.

425
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,460
But he was dancing

426
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
Why is it like this?

427
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,460
What is Goro's favorite alcohol snack?

428
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,460
Normally it's that

429
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,460
I see

430
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,460
It's a bit like this

431
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,460
What is it?

432
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
I'll show you one

433
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,460
It's done.

434
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
It's done.

435
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,460
It's done.

436
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Although the cheese is not so good, it's a cheese tart.

437
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,460
It's limited edition.

438
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
It's limited edition.

439
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,460
I don't think it's good to say cheese is bad.

440
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,460
I guess it's better to take a step further and go to cheese tart.

441
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,460
The liver patty is amazing.

442
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,460
It's amazing, he made it with a lever putty.

443
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
It's amazing.

444
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,460
I don't think anyone who makes lever putty would say that.

445
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
First place is...

446
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Now, it's time for the correct answer.

447
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,460
Well, it changes a lot, but recently...

448
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,460
Oil Sardines.

449
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,460
It changes a lot.

450
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,460
It changes a lot.

451
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
It changes a lot.

452
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,460
Let's listen to the one before.

453
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,460
The one before.

454
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,460
I think it's raw ham.

455
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,460
There's a good raw ham shop in the neighborhood.

456
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,460
That was close.

457
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,460
That was close.

458
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
It changed.

459
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
It was close.

460
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,460
It was close.

461
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,460
Raw ham is frustrating.

462
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,460
Who is the person that Goroh respects?

463
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,460
This is hard.

464
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,460
Wait a minute, I haven't seen it yet.

465
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,460
Well, I'm going to run away a little more.

466
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,460
Oh, I have a hint.

467
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,460
You have?

468
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
Is that so?

469
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
Answer open!

470
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,460
It's Quint Eastwood.

471
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
I told you.

472
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,460
Dirty Harry.

473
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,460
You like movies, right?

474
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,460
Yes.

475
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,460
The director is also a movie director.

476
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,460
Yes, he said that.

477
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,460
So I thought about it a lot.

478
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,460
It's completely this.

479
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,460
Now, the correct answer.

480
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,460
Do you know this?

481
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
What?

482
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,460
You know it, right?

483
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,460
Everyone said it on TV.

484
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Hiro-kun, who is a non-local.

485
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
Ah!

486
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
Have you heard of it?

487
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
Yes, yes, yes.

488
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,460
I respect you.

489
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
Who is it?

490
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,460
I have an uncle who lives with me.

491
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,460
What?

492
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,460
Yes, yes.

493
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,460
Do you still live with him?

494
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,460
I've decreased the number of times, but I come here twice a week.

495
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,460
You've decreased the number of times?

496
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
With your uncle?

497
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,460
I'm sorry, but what do you respect about him?

498
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,460
I'm sure there are many things.

499
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,460
He's a great scholar and he has a lot of knowledge.

500
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:14,460
He taught me golf, wine and many other things.

501
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,460
He's like a father, a best friend and sometimes a lover.

502
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,460
He's saying complicated things.

503
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,460
He said complicated things at the end.

504
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,460
He threw it in.

505
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
Don't come closer.

506
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,460
Inagaki's answer is a complete mess!

507
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,460
No, no, no.

508
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,460
The members are shocked by Inagaki's answer.

509
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,460
If you're going to be fair, where are you?

510
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,460
That's where you're going to be serious.

511
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Who will win?

512
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,460
That person, right?

513
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,460
I was really happy. It seems like he was interested in me.

514
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,460
It seems that he has taken a picture of us.

515
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
That is our true power.

516
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,460
The previous broadcast was broadcast exclusively on Hulu.
