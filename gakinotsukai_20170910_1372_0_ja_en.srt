1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,240
The

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,240
Thank you!

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,240
I've been through a lot of things like crook, but I've never been accepted.

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,240
You've never been accepted?

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,240
I'm 54 years old, but I've never been accepted.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,240
I've never been accepted.

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
But...

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,240
I've been accepted a little.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Well, today is your birthday.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,240
Thank you very much!

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,280
Happy Birthday

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,900
Happy Birthday to you

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,280
Happy Birthday to you

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,480
Happy Birthday...

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,800
Sorry?

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,940
He is out...

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,420
I sang too much

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,780
You spirits must have erased it

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,180
He erased that

20
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,200
You are so naughty

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,460
You should have erased that

22
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,660
Yes

23
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,660
Sorry, I'm a mess.

24
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,660
And it's already...

25
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,660
It's melting.

26
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,660
It's not 5.

27
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,660
It's not that much.

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,660
It's both OK.

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,660
It's not 5 or anything.

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,660
It's not enough?

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,660
I'm really curious about this.

32
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,660
That's true.

33
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,660
There's more.

34
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,660
There's 4.

35
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,660
There's no 4.

36
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,660
Just 5!

37
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,660
I don't know anymore

38
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,660
You can do it!

39
00:01:49,660 --> 00:02:00,660
Happy birthday to you!

40
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,660
Thank you!

41
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,660
Thank you!

42
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,660
Thank you!

43
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,660
Cheers!

44
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,660
Congratulations!

45
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,660
Thank you!

46
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,660
It was good.

47
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,660
They are so popular among the members.

48
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,660
Really.

49
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,660
They are popular 30 times.

50
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,660
This program has been on air for 29 years.

51
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,660
He's 55 years old, and he's 30 years old.

52
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
30 years old is amazing.

53
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,660
It's amazing.

54
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,660
That program is...

55
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,660
Because the members haven't changed.

56
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,660
There are many stories about going home in the water.

57
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,660
But...

58
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,660
There's no such story.

59
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,660
The company will tell you.

60
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,660
Yoshimoto will tell you.

61
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,660
The members will tell you.

62
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
They won't change the members soon.

63
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,660
I thought Yama would stop when he went to Osaka.

64
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,660
I think so.

65
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,660
Will you stop?

66
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,660
I will.

67
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,660
Wait, wait, wait.

68
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,660
I didn't mean to come here on purpose.

69
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,660
Well, you take the Shinkansen every time.

70
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,660
It's not a good way to communicate.

71
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,660
The Shinkansen's president also said that.

72
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,660
JR JR.

73
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,660
JR is the one who bought it.

74
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,660
He said, you shouldn't put this on.

75
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,660
Where do you live?

76
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,660
Where are you going?

77
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,660
You're in Tokyo, right?

78
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,660
The president also said, there's no point in going.

79
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,660
There's no point?

80
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,860
Thanks.

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,700
Love Trumpet!

82
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,420
Wait for it...

83
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,260
This mast be mischievous.

84
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,180
vocalist

85
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,180
He is J.Dinahç‚« flips.

86
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,580
that's so strange

87
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,980
Are you J.Dinah?

88
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,940
I am J.Dinah.

89
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:58,940
21 years have passed since I became a kid

90
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:07,940
Every time we meet, you are always kind

91
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:15,940
It's hard to make a smile, but it's wonderful to make a smile

92
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:24,940
I always learned those two things close to me

93
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:32,940
Matsumoto-san, Matsumoto-san, thank you always

94
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:41,940
When I don't know why I can't explain it well

95
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:50,940
Matsumoto-san, Matsumoto-san, thank you always

96
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:59,940
At times like that, you always change my smile

97
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:09,940
Thank you for being born

98
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,940
It's simple and the most...

99
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,940
It's a bit difficult to sing it.

100
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,940
It's not easy to sing it.

101
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,940
That's right.

102
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,940
Today we had a station show.

103
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,940
What do you think?

104
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,940
Everyone is celebrating my birthday.

105
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,940
Yes.

106
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,940
They are saying that they are happy.

107
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Singing is good.

108
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,940
It makes you do things you can't usually do.

109
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,940
That's true.

110
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,940
What about the lyrics?

111
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Did you write it?

112
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,940
Tanaka is not a professional singer, so he has a great singing ability.

113
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
That's true.

114
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,940
But he is a good singer.

115
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,940
He is doing his best in the atmosphere of the song.

116
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,940
I felt that he was doing his best in the atmosphere.

117
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,940
I don't care about the evaluation of the song.

118
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,940
The fact that the content came in is a good thing.

119
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,940
I said that the content came in.

120
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,940
What?

121
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,940
Let's be friends.

122
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,940
It's your birthday!

123
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,940
It's your birthday!

124
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,940
It's fine if you're happy for a little bit.

125
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,940
That's right. That's enough.

126
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,940
That's enough.

127
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,940
There's no way I wouldn't be happy.

128
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,940
That's good.

129
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,940
I'm happy for that.

130
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,940
It's good.

131
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,940
It's worth it.

132
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,940
Tanaka thought about this.

133
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Of course.

134
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,940
How many years have you been a kid?

135
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,940
We've been a kid for 4 years.

136
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,940
You've been a kid for 4 years?

137
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,940
I was 25 years old.

138
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,940
That's fast.

139
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,940
But in other words, there is no time when I was only out for 4 years.

140
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,940
I'm really grateful.

141
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
Since the last season.

142
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,940
I was doing it.

143
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,940
I started doing it when I was a bomber.

144
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
I quit the bomber in the middle.

145
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,940
I was only a bomber.

146
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,940
I introduced you to Matsumoto-san.

147
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Tanakao.

148
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,940
He came to pick me up in Tokyo.

149
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,940
When I first finished it.

150
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:30,940
When I arrived in Tokyo on the last Shinkansen, the taxi stop was so crowded.

151
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,940
I see.

152
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,940
I couldn't get in.

153
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,940
I said, sorry, but could you please stand in line?

154
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,940
I was sitting in the back seat.

155
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,940
I was lonely, but Tanaka was there.

156
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,940
Oh, really?

157
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,940
I was so serious.

158
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,940
I was so serious.

159
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,300
Yamaguchi and I were in the back, and Tanaka was next to the driver.

160
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,920
I didn't say a word until we arrived.

161
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,380
You were nervous.

162
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,380
You're still nervous.

163
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,380
Nice to meet you.

164
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,380
I could tell from behind that you were a bit down.

165
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,380
I was down and looked like a clown.

166
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,380
You didn't move at all.

167
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,380
You didn't move at all.

168
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,380
If you think it's funny, then it's not a problem.

169
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,380
I was nervous.

170
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,380
After that, I'll do it again.

171
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,380
Ah, this is what you wanted.

172
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,380
That's right.

173
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,380
Do you remember?

174
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,380
For the first time.

175
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,380
That's right.

176
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,220
It's these bands, you know?

177
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:31,740
With a bashful moment outside a first-time In- attendant's

178
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,660
A woman has been picked up

179
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,200
On the first-ever society reineletide

180
00:08:50,200 --> 00:09:03,200
I was the one who wanted to take you with me

181
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:16,200
I was the one who was greedy and had no money

182
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,200
He said,

183
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,200
I'm going to borrow your card

184
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,200
He said,

185
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm going to borrow your card

186
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,200
He gave me light

187
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:58,200
The one who gave me the passport of a comedian I met was you, Mr. Matsumoto.

188
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I will run this path desperately from now on

189
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,200
I am grateful

190
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Wonderful!

191
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
You sang it!

192
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I sang it

193
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
It was good

194
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
It was good

195
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,200
It was really good.

196
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
What?

197
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
I thought, maybe there was such an episode.

198
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
There was a video called Dan.

199
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Yes, Nakameguro. It's gone now.

200
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
It's gone.

201
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
I've been here for a long time.

202
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I was riding a Jaguar when I was riding a Mazumoto.

203
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
I didn't have any money, so I borrowed it.

204
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
What video?

205
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,200
A little bit of a scab.

206
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Both of you?

207
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
You didn't rent a single movie?

208
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
We didn't rent a single movie, we rented all the movie tickets.

209
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
How many movies did you rent?

210
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
How many movies did you rent?

211
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
We rented about 7 movies.

212
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
In Matsumoto's car,

213
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Matsumoto divided the movies into two parts.

214
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
This is the end, this is the end.

215
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
This is the end.

216
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
I really remembered that.

217
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
I thought it was nostalgic.

218
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
It's not like DVDs now.

219
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
You can't tell by looking at this.

220
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I have to keep it.

221
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Sometimes I make mistakes.

222
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
That's a good thing.

223
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,200
After I finish, I get a massage.

224
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
What kind of massage?

225
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
I feel good.

226
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Shoulder or neck?

227
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
No, I feel like a sukebe.

228
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
I don't know what sukebe is.

229
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
I don't know.

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
The name of the shop is called the magic hand.

231
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
I don't know.

232
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I don't know either.

233
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
I wonder what kind of magic it is.

234
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
I see.

235
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,200
A very small woman brought a mysterious bag.

236
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
I tried to look at it, but I couldn't see it.

237
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
The light was dim.

238
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I don't remember much from then on.

239
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
I've been doing a lot of things.

240
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
I call him Eli.

241
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
I've heard of him.

242
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I've heard of him.

243
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I'm not a benefactor, but I'm saying that you should never see it.

244
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
What's inside?

245
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
What are you doing?

246
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm a girl.

247
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Your imagination?

248
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Your imagination is a girl?

249
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
I'm a girl.

250
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
At that time, I was a four-legged bike.

251
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I was in this shape, and I was doing a lot of things.

252
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I don't think I'm a girl.

253
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I'm not a woman.

254
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Oh, really?

255
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm not sure if I can say this in this costume.

256
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
You're a girl.

257
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I'm a girl.

258
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
I'm going to record it today.

259
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
It's going to be a long day.

260
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,200
I'm going to write a Hamashou.

261
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Well,

262
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
I like it.

263
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,200
It's a little different from Hamashou.

264
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I like it.

265
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Matsumoto-san, I'll keep on wishing for you, Matsumoto-san

266
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm stoic about comedy, I can't do it, I say it right away, it's really funny

267
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,200
I really admire that kind of thing, the most interesting is the most important

268
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
The most extreme of the wicked ideas

269
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,200
The front line of the world of laughter

270
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
There are no people who don't laugh

271
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,200
There are no people who don't admire

272
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
H.I.T.O.S.H.I

273
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,200
People are your heart

274
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Light shines on the dark world

275
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Thank you Matsumoto-san for laughing with me

276
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I will keep on asking you, Matsumoto-san, please

277
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Happy Birthday!

278
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
It was a surprising song.

279
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
There was a bit of rap in it.

280
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
It's a young song.

281
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
It's the youngest song.

282
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
It's a new song.

283
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
It's different from the others.

284
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
It's different.

285
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
We're not good at it.

286
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I wanted to convey my feelings,

287
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
and the lyrics of the rap came out immediately.

288
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
It came out.

289
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
I think it's because of my sister.

290
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,200
I've been a kid for 18 years, but I still think of her as my sister.

291
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
No.

292
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I can't remember anything else but Nori Yoshio and Matsuno-san.

293
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
You mean your sister?

294
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
No, I mean Inomoto.

295
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Oh, I see.

296
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
It's complicated.

297
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I thought it was just me.

298
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Fujiwara is cool, too.

299
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
He's like a Hanyu star.

300
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
He's a three-shot.

301
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Yoshimoto is like Chang Gung Sok.

302
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,200
It's close to the Korean star, but it's not the Chang-Gun style.

303
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Oh, that's right.

304
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Do you remember?

305
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,200
After the recording

306
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,200
You treated me to dinner

307
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,200
You always said

308
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,200
That you would go home

309
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,200
After shopping at the store near your house

310
00:16:49,200 --> 00:17:01,200
You mutter, I get off, and disappear into the shop

311
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Good work, I bow my head and go home

312
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Since then, the moon has been flowing, and you have taught me

313
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,200
At that time, I didn't always have anything to buy

314
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:48,200
I sent it to you so you wouldn't notice

315
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,200
It was like that, but it was getting worse and worse.

316
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
What?

317
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,200
It was like a impersonation.

318
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Was it?

319
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
No, no, no.

320
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Really, this is being said strictly.

321
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
What?

322
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Who are you talking to?

323
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
It's a little Hamashou-ish.

324
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Well, I'm really sorry about this, but it's similar to Jigoe.

325
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Do you remember the content now?

326
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,200
I think everyone has that.

327
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I think Hamagawa-san has that too.

328
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
He's a junior.

329
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
He's surprisingly considerate of his seniors.

330
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,200
He tells them to go home and pays for the taxi.

331
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
That's a problem too.

332
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,200
If you suddenly get a few thousand yen from your senior.

333
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,200
But it's better to send them close.

334
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,200
I don't have much to do, but I go there sometimes.

335
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
I see.

336
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
I don't really...

337
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Well, I think everyone does that.

338
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
No, no, no.

339
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
But I was grateful.

340
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
That's right.

341
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
At that time, we went together about 4 or 5 times a week.

342
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Oh, yeah.

343
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
That's almost all.

344
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,200
I didn't have anyone, to be honest.

345
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Actually, you're the first in Tokyo.

346
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
That's right.

347
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
That's right.

348
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,200
And then six months later, Downtown came to see me.

349
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Matsumoto was really all alone.

350
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I was really all alone.

351
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
I was really all alone.

352
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
We were together every day.

353
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,200
There was also that end of the show, right?

354
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Going to the store and stuff.

355
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,200
In the video store on the hillside,

356
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,200
I borrowed Matsumoto's card.

357
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
I borrowed 6 of them.

358
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,200
I forgot to return them.

359
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
I didn't get married at that time.

360
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,200
I was a man who couldn't clean up.

361
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
I was in a mess at home.

362
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Did you retire?

363
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I don't know because I'm lost.

364
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,200
I was really pissed off.

365
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I was thought I retired.

366
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
I went to borrow it, but I couldn't lend it.

367
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,200
I haven't been returned yet.

368
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
I see.

369
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,200
And then, for about an hour, he was wearing a very funny, very funny, very funny outfit.

370
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Very funny, very funny, very funny.

371
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,200
I thought, if I hadn't returned the video, I wouldn't be so angry.

372
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
But I'm the one who's at fault.

373
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
That's not true!

374
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
I can't return it.

375
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,200
From that time, when I got angry, Yamaaki started drawing Doraemon.

376
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
He wanted me to help him.

377
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
It's like the Doraemon from the Dragon Ball.

378
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
If it was the Doraemon, wouldn't it save me?

379
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
I don't know. I don't have any intention.

380
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Did you write it without getting angry?

381
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
No, I wrote it.

382
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
You wrote it without getting angry?

383
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
I'm a little mad.

384
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
You're really angry?

385
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Well, I'm asking you.

386
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
What are you doing?

387
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
You won't get angry if you see it.

388
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
I can't get angry.

389
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,200
I'm a little of a giant.

390
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
This is not good

391
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,200
After this, the person we never expected will come to celebrate

392
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Hello

393
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Welcome

394
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
The legend is here

395
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I feel a little nervous to be here longer than Tommy

396
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,200
A talk show without a host

397
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
We have to do the show together

398
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
How is it?

399
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
On the 24th, 11pm

400
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
There are many things

401
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
I see.

402
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,200
I played with girls a lot.

403
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
We played together.

404
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,200
We got along and we broke up.

405
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
We broke up and we met again.

406
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I met a girl for the first time.

407
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Matsumoto asked her,

408
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
He asked me,

409
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Do you want to drink something?

410
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
He called me, Jean.

411
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Jean?

412
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
What does that mean?

413
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
What kind of Jean?

414
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
He is a man of one year.

415
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
He is a man of one year.

416
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
He asked me,

417
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Do you want to drink anything?

418
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
I think it was the first time.

419
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
It was the first time.

420
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
That's good.

421
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,200
So, I think it was that.

422
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,200
When she became one with him,

423
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,200
I think she overcame him.

424
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
It's a good thing that you're a member of the committee.

425
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
You're saying it from a distance.

426
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
What are you saying?

427
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
It's dangerous.

428
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
This is a committee.

429
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,200
It's a time when it's sharp.

430
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
I thought it was a little bit,

431
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
but it's not smiling at all.

432
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,200
I thought, he's a person who accepts.

433
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
I didn't know that.

434
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
It was so amazing.

435
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
I have a lot of memories.

436
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
We've been friends for a long time.

437
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
That's true.

438
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Please come in.

439
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Welcome.

440
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Oh, hello.

441
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Welcome.

442
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Happy birthday, Mr. Hashimoto.

443
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Thank you very much, Momiji.

444
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Momiji too.

445
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Thank you very much, Momiji.

446
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Wow, it's so beautiful!

447
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Thank you very much!

448
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Next week...

449
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Matsumoto's Birthday Party

450
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,200
That person who we never expected to see

451
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,200
And his partner Hamada too
