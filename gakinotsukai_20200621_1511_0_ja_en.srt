1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What is Gorou's specialty?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
He can see through the true nature of people when he first meets them

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He reveals the true nature of mysterious Inagaki

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Quiz! Inagaki Gorou's 100 words

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What is the drink that Gorou likes?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Wine

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Sometimes, if you think that he showed his true self

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I thought it was a bit of a twist.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It was a bit of a twist.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I think it's Dan.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Unexpected answer.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I think he was dancing.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If I had to choose, it would be Yuka during the summer.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Endo.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Really?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I didn't have that much of a difference.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's like nobody cares.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hosei.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I have the image of sweating on TV.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He spits poison on the members.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm Hiroko, a non-local.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've never heard of him.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He's a mysterious man, Inagaki Kuro.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sometimes he's like a father, sometimes he's like a lover.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What is his truth?

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
After 48 questions, the correct answer is...

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
...Tanaka Endo is the leader

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Will Hosei Matsumoto be the winner?

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you were asked to sing a cry, what would you sing?

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is a service problem

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Crying with a cry

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There are many things

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There are many things to think about

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Answer open

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I thought it would be a little off

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Do you want to adventure?

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wolves are quite adventurous

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Really?

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Then the correct answer is

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Please let us hear your cry

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Pig

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Pig...

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It wasn't even in the head

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What is the first thing you check when you see a woman?

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I see

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I want to know

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Where should I check?

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Answer Open!

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I see.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I feel like Hosei is going in a different direction.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hosei himself likes butt.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sometimes he seems to jump on it.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He said it.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He is continuing his life of desire.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now, the correct answer is...

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The aura that that person has

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's getting difficult

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's getting difficult

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's getting difficult

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What happens when Goro gets drunk?

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hmm...

62
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
I don't drink wine.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I wonder if it's wrong.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I wonder if it's wrong.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, either you're spoiled or you cry.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Ah, it's a little bit of a perverted feeling.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What about Endo?

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The basic rule is the same.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I can't drink alcohol.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's the same as usual.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now, the correct answer.

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
It's the same.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Damn.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I see.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It is.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not correct.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It is correct.

78
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,000
It's basically the same.

79
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,000
It's the correct answer.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm so frustrated.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What TV show does Goroh watch without fail?

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is difficult too.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's difficult.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is difficult.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I think so.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The Darwin is here.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, Goro-chan seems to be saying it.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The dawn of Gaia is also...

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, I understand.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I understand.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Asadora!

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
For a long time.

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I will definitely watch it if I like it.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I know. I thought I would watch the whole show.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Surprisingly.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The correct answer is...

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
E-Tele's...

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
La La La Classic.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I thought I would not get it right, so I will give him a bad hand.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't watch Miya-Neya, so please listen to it.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Do you watch Miya-Neya?

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Ah... I don't watch it.

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You don't watch it.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I said it clearly.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't watch it.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You don't watch news wide shows.

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Really?

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What is the most memorable word that Gorou said to the person who saw him laughing?

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ah...

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You did it.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It feels good to be able to guess this one.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Answer Open

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is difficult.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yamaguchi-san, I know. I thought it was similar to this.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It was a small hint.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Now, the correct answer.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Everyone said, you did well.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I see

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That was close

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, it was the correct answer

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's right

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's true

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:02,520
Who do you think is the most

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
displeased with Goro?

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I see

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Answer open

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't have one.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was thinking of Tanaka.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But, well, it's a bit like hatred towards Yamazaki.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If it was me, I would hate Goro-chan.

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, it's not strange if it's me.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't have one.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think he hates you in general.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He might hate me in general.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Does he hate me?

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's normal.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Now, the correct answer is...

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Eh...Housei-san.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why?

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hey!

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why?

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Why?

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why?

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why?

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let's ask him the reason.

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Eh?

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's not Tanaka.

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No, this is the truth.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't understand.

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's ask him.

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Ask him.

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What's the reason?

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I told you before.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I knew him at the first meeting.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I can't believe it.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You saw him at first sight?

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I can't believe it.

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Really?

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There are people who don't think so

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If this question comes up, we can get it

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We can get this

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
When was Goro's first love?

164
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's a sequence

165
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You can guess a little

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Answer open

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
5669

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's right

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
A boy

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's a kindergarten

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's a very simple question, but...

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Endo-san, you're a bit late.

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I thought of the teacher of the teacher.

174
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I thought of that.

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Endo-san, how old were you?

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I was born early.

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're already old.

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Now, the correct answer.

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
10 years old.

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Wow!

181
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That was close.

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I didn't think...

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I didn't think it was Endo.

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I didn't think it was Endo.

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's been about 5 years since elementary school.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So, he's the real one, right?

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes, he's my classmate.

188
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Please ask him, the first love.

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What kind of person is your first love?

190
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He's my classmate.

191
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He's serious.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It was surprisingly close.

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It was close.

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why did you cry at the end of the 5th floor?

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The last one?

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's the last one, right?

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's right.

198
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The answer is...

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Hosei-san.

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's when Hiro-san left.

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You love Hiro-san, right?

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes, I do.

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's definitely around here.

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Mr. Enzo, you watch TV and you are an animal.

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
As a human being, I am an animal.

207
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I can be an animal.

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Mr. Tanaka is like a world-class woman in the world.

209
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Cry?

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
World-class woman.

211
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're sad, right?

212
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes, yes, yes.

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's right.

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's not right.

215
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The correct answer is...

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a question that humans can't answer.

217
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I cried when I saw Violet Evergarden.

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's like it's completely taken off.

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The answer is...

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Inoue Yosui-san, there's no umbrella.

221
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I see.

222
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No, no, I didn't think wrongly

223
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't think anyone would like it

224
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
An incorrect answer

225
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's an honest answer, but

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hiro-kun is also there

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
After 79 questions, Endo is the one with the most correct answers

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Can he escape like this?

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The manager is 2 hours late. What will happen to Goroh?

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Answer open

231
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes, that's right. I understand.

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Somehow, the flow so far, Endo-san

233
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't get angry easily.

234
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You don't get angry easily?

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Tanaka-san?

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I say easily.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't get angry easily.

238
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yamazaki and I are almost the same.

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes, we are the same.

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Now, the correct answer.

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The manager is 2 hours late.

242
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
How will he get angry?

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Please look at this camera.

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's okay.

245
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's okay. Don't get too close.

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're taking care of your own territory.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's right that he's not angry.

248
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right.

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What was the line that Goro said in a quarrel?

250
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What is that?

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I regret saying it.

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Answer open!

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Kasu?

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Really?

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Torn?

256
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Kasu?

257
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Kasu?

258
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't look down on me.

259
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Don't look down on me.

260
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't look down on me.

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I regret saying that.

262
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now, the correct answer is...

263
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is from when I was a kid, but when I was in elementary school, I said,

264
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Your mom is a Debeso.

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What is that?

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You don't have to regret it.

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There is a possibility that it was a Debeso.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If Gorou were to be a new member of the group, who would it be?

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The answer is...

270
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's quite surprising

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No, I don't think so.

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm not that old.

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It doesn't matter.

274
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think that I'm aware of the fact that you are a member of the Ho-Sei.

275
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm going to be a member of the Ho-Sei for a long time.

276
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Good or bad.

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Now, the correct answer.

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Matsumoto-san.

279
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What is the reason?

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I think I have a lot of power in the entertainment world.

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's right.

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's true, but...

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No, no, no, I'm not happy.

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm not happy.

285
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I didn't imagine that.

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
How does Goroh use his head to make a fool of himself?

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
A fool of himself?

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Otama, right?

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Otama, right?

290
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Answer open!

291
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Will it be the same?

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's probably a quick answer

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That's right

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Otama?

295
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Otama-kun?

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Let's see the answer

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Otama-kin? What is Otama-kin?

298
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Otama-kin

299
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't know

300
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Now, the correct answer

301
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Please use Otama to make a fool of yourself

302
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Please use it at your own timing

303
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
This kind of Otama?

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This is really...

305
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Already?

306
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yes

307
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's go

308
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's go simply

309
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Simply

310
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Please use your head to make a fool of yourself

311
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This kind of head?

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This is definitely...

313
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Already?

314
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes, already

315
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Let's go

316
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Let's go

317
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Simply

318
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The principle of being a fool

319
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
No, no, no

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
No, no, no

321
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's terrible.

322
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Otama Kin was close.

323
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He was the closest.

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Really.

325
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If you could use magic only once, what kind of magic would you use?

326
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This one.

327
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This might work.

328
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Tanaka is always slow.

329
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Tanaka is using a lot of time.

330
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's why it's incorrect.

331
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's world peace, right?

332
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
World peace?

333
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I think that's what it is.

334
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll use it.

335
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Endo-san...

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You'll become a real detective and really arrest him.

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Stop it.

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You're suddenly getting tough.

339
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Tanaka-san...

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
My favorite place is the teleportation.

341
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You can just teleport.

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,020
You can't put a

343
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,020
That's why it's long

344
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Then the correct answer is

345
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:24,000
In the land of Japan

346
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:28,760
French wine romaine conty

347
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,760
Make a field like the soil of the field

348
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:35,160
Make a wine field

349
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I can do it

350
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
You're right

351
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Let's get started

352
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,160
What name would Goroh use if he became a pro wrestler?

353
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,160
There's no way I can get this right

354
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
Just give me a close answer

355
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Answer open

356
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Inazuma's Ina is Thunder Goroh.

357
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Inazuma's Ina is Inagaki's Ina.

358
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Endo's Ina is Dynamite Goroh.

359
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
I like Dynamite.

360
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,160
I put it in the song.

361
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,160
I wanted to tease you, but I thought I had to.

362
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
That's why you wrote it.

363
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
You're going to Goroh, right?

364
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm going to Inagaki.

365
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
It's Inagaki.

366
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
So it's called Dirty Inagaki.

367
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Dirty Harry is also on it.

368
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Ah, I see.

369
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Dirty Harry's Dirty Harry.

370
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
So it's Dirty Inagaki Harry.

371
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
It was good, but...

372
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
I'll never say it.

373
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Now, the correct answer.

374
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Jet Inagaki.

375
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Ah, it's Inagaki.

376
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
It was Inagaki.

377
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Inagaki is amazing here.

378
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
It's amazing.

379
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
You'll definitely get Gorou.

380
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Jet Inagaki.

381
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
You're being pulled by Jet Namikoshi.

382
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
Question 96.

383
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,160
If Gorou was to be molded, where would it be?

384
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
I'm not sure if I can mold it.

385
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,160
I don't know how much it's been banned

386
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
This is marine

387
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Ah, it's not enough

388
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,160
I don't really understand, but it's to put a mole

389
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Like this, to make it look like a double-eyelid

390
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
What is this, Endo-san?

391
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
To change the tongue

392
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,160
I'll change it to a tongue that can make all of them delicious wine.

393
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
What?

394
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
What's with the mold?

395
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
I was wondering how far the mold would go.

396
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
It's not mold.

397
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
It's a human experiment.

398
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Now, the correct answer.

399
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
There is none.

400
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Why is that?

401
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Because if you mold it now, it will be revealed.

402
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Everyone knows my face.

403
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
I see.

404
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,020
You're suddenly serious

405
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,340
Just wait for it

406
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,280
Don't know who is number 1 and who is the least

407
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:45,300
Will next question is for 99

408
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Maybe it was.

409
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Let's do this then.

410
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
The answer is open.

411
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
Ah, I see.

412
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
It's Tanaka's.

413
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
I thought it was easy.

414
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
I thought it was easy.

415
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300
I thought it was Matsumoto-san.

416
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Now, the correct answer.

417
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
Matsumoto-san?

418
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
What?

419
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,300
I have a lot of energy, so I feel comfortable.

420
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
It's like a hidden camera.

421
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
That's a hidden camera.

422
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Hidden camera type.

423
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Hidden camera type.

424
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Well, it's muscle.

425
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Hidden camera is closed.

426
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Question 100.

427
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
I'll take it at least.

428
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,300
What would Boro do if the world ended tomorrow?

429
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Well, which one should I choose?

430
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,300
While drinking wine, we'll end the show.

431
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,300
Right, we'll drink wine and have a good time.

432
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
Hiro and only two of them.

433
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,300
But I want you to be more strict with them.

434
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
I'm not strict with them.

435
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
I'm waiting for them.

436
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Anyway, only two of them, and they didn't do anything.

437
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
I even called them my dad.

438
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,300
When you drink wine with Hiro, you want to fight.

439
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Yes.

440
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Now, the correct answer.

441
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
After all,

442
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:33,300
I wonder if he is meditating quietly.

443
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
I can't drink. I can't drink wine.

444
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,300
I said, after all.

445
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
After all? What is it?

446
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
After all, it's not wine.

447
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:52,300
The quiz, the 100th person of Goro Inagaki, will announce the winner with the most correct answers.

448
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Who is it?

449
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Who is it? It's a bit...

450
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,300
Well...

451
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
It's that person, right?

452
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,300
The winner is...

453
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Shouzo Endo!

454
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
Thank you very much!

455
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
You were watching, right?

456
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,300
Well, I skipped the first half, so...

457
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Yes.

458
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
Golf related stuff too.

459
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
Golf related stuff, yes.

460
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Oh, there's one?

461
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
I didn't know that.

462
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,300
Yes.

463
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
Thank you for your hard work.

464
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Thank you for your hard work.

465
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Thank you very much.

466
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
Thank you very much.

467
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
I was very happy.

468
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
It seems that you are interested in me.

469
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
But you are not interested in us at all.

470
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,300
It's true.

471
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
You are hurt.

472
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
What will you do?

473
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
You are sweating again.

474
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
That's not true.

475
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
That's the image.

476
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,300
It's hard.

477
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:57,300
I thought I wanted to be alone. I wanted to change my life.

478
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
I didn't want to do anything.

479
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:09,300
I thought you liked me because you were interested in me.

480
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,300
I was a little distant.

481
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
Who won the championship?

482
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,300
I'm Endo.

483
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,300
I have a present for you.

484
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Thank you.

485
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,300
This is the restaurant I'm directing.

486
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
It's called Bistro Joe.

487
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,300
It's a new restaurant.

488
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,300
We can have a toast with wine.

489
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,300
Really?

490
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
I'm happy.

491
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,300
I have wine here.

492
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Yes, it's from Burgundy.

493
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Thank you very much. I'm so happy.

494
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Yes, please come to our show.

495
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Thank you very much.

496
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Thank you very much.

497
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
Thank you for your hard work!
