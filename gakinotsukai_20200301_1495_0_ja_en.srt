1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next time, let's sing the runner together!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Mr. Takano, this is the second time.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, no, no, this is not the second time.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Takasu has already done it many times.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Takasu is a broadcast writer.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In junior high school, he was the fourth member of an uninteresting group.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I did my best in that place.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's the point.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Last time, it was Nagabushi-san's Tombo.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It was probably faster than I thought.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I think it was fast.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's why I thought it would be okay.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It ended beautifully.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This time, it's the Bakufu Slump!

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's a challenge of 7 people.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's a great song.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's not just us five.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Please!

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Please come in!

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Please come in!

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is a bit creepy.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
10 people.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If there are this many people, I want a cute paparazzi.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
A cute paparazzi.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
10 runners divided into 10 parts.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If 10 people sing at their own timing and sing without overlapping, the challenge is successful!

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,940
I was thinking of a tree and it was right in front of me.

28
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,940
That's right.

29
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,940
I thought it was a tree that was over a year old.

30
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,940
I saw the previous video, and it was almost a miracle.

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,940
That's right.

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,940
That's right.

33
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,940
But the wheel is the most popular now.

34
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,940
The most popular.

35
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,940
I forgot about the stop star.

36
00:01:44,940 --> 00:02:13,440
Raindance

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,380
Karmic

38
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,560
There are many different cards themselves.

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,960
��

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,440
Why doesn't everyone go?

41
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
In opposite.

42
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,700
Everyone has a high Primary.

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,520
But it feels like it's already started.

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,560
Oh, well that...

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,580
Oh? It's my fault.

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,700
Even so, this will go on with you from now on

47
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,940
There's no way such a thing!

48
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,400
Okay, let's go!

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
It's gonna be like this.

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
It's close.

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Who is Shoji?

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
You're really annoying.

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Stop it!

54
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I can say what Shoji thinks.

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
But if I have to say one thing,

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
he's not accepting it at all.

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm doing this to make him accept it.

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm not doing it for fun.

59
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
It's fine if you like it.

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
But it's slippery.

61
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
I can't do anything if it's slippery.

62
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
But you're always there.

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
But other band members just play along.

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Look like vice president got angry fromBREN brand.

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,400
It's coward for SHITOKI to cover the Lниз.

66
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Only our team is disbanded.

67
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Camera is currently working to get back SHITOKI.

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
It was pretty good.

69
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,400
I felt that you were doing the best.

70
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
It's good, right?

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
It's good.

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,400
But if you decide that this is Shoji's turn, it's the same as deciding.

73
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
That's right.

74
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,400
It's also disgusting that Shoji will quit.

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,400
I want him to quit.

76
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
It's definitely not good to let him do it.

77
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
The challenge has just begun.

78
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,400
We hope for a miracle of the first encounter and try anyway!

79
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,400
The rain stopped 6 days ago, you turned away a little

80
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Who is going to do this?

81
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Zero!

82
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I thought you were this bad at singing.

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
I'm really bad at singing.

84
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,400
The song that made him laugh.

85
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:55,400
In the local room where the rain stopped, you looked a little.

86
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Why?

87
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Why?

88
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Why?

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
That's...

90
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
I think he's thinking of eating money.

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
That's right.

92
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
In the beginning, the development of the search continues.

93
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
This is dangerous.

94
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Dangerous.

95
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Dangerous.

96
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Dangerous.

97
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Dangerous.

98
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Can't you do this?

99
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,600
At the time of the

100
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
From the beginning?

101
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Yes, until the third or fourth person, I was doing pretty well.

102
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
When I was a kid, I was a little more friendly.

103
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Really?

104
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Why are you so angry?

105
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,600
When I was a kid, I wanted to be angry.

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Who is angry?

107
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
My wife is screwing me around.

108
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Hey, move away from the back!

109
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
No one will do it.

110
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Who will do it?

111
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Who will do it?

112
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Who will do it?

113
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
They are trying to be more active.

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
This time...

115
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,600
A song that avoids rain

116
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
If you sing it, it will be Tanaka's song

117
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
It will be, it will be

118
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
You two didn't say it

119
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
We didn't say it

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Do you guys decide how many times you will sing before you sing?

121
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
We decide

122
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
It's done by the atmosphere

123
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
You don't decide? How many times you will sing

124
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,600
It's decided by me

125
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
It's decided by me

126
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
We read each other's moods

127
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
It's fine

128
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Let's record it.

129
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Let's record it.

130
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Let's record it.

131
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Let's go!

132
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Haranishi's plan to decide the timing to sing.

133
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
What will it be?

134
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:12,600
In the rain-free local room, you look a little down.

135
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,480
vitesse

136
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:38,360
and

137
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,340
That was G Place You find focus, second

138
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,320
At the ל OCCA ROOM, deviated from the rain

139
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,300
You felt a bit lost

140
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,360
But you said you would not return

141
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Out of my sight

142
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Ah, I should have gone this far.

144
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
I should have gone to the third place.

145
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,320
The third place was the most important.

146
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Tanaka always wears something.

147
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Tanaka always gets in the way.

148
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
I know that he doesn't wear anything.

149
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
I know that he doesn't wear anything.

150
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
But please don't get in the way.

151
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Even with Haranishi's strategy, the light is still not visible.

152
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,320
The challenge of the hand-picking state continues.

153
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,420
Happiness

154
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:36,560
NO lead there ObeGo

155
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,560
In the room where you avoided the rain

156
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,560
You looked a little down

157
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,560
You said you wouldn't come back

158
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Next

159
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,560
It's a change of weather

160
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,560
It's a change of weather

161
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,560
I think we should go

162
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,560
If you don't want to go, you should go.

163
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,560
That's a good word.

164
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Let's go!

165
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,560
I want to go.

166
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,560
You should have gone.

167
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Well, to be more specific, everyone is going to the same place now.

168
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,560
That's the downtown feeling. Only the downtown people can understand the equation.

169
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,560
The first wall that is not a sign of going beyond the first one.

170
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
Let's go!

171
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Tempo, tempo!

172
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Let's go!

173
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
It's not tempo though.

174
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Let's go!

175
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Let's go!

176
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
It's hell.

177
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Let's go!

178
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm going to avoid the rain

179
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Let's go!

180
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
I'm going to avoid the rain

181
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
You can't avoid the rain at all

182
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Let's gather!

183
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
What's going on?

184
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Compared to the last time, you're much worse

185
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Who's fault is this?

186
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
I don't know.

187
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
It's not moving at all.

188
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
You didn't sell the 4th one.

189
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Who's fault is this?

190
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Who's fault is this?

191
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
It's not something to judge who's fault is this.

192
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Even now, Tanaka...

193
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Me?

194
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
Me?

195
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
It's not going to be like that.

196
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
It's not going to be like that.

197
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Wait a minute. This is bad.

198
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Last time, we changed the location.

199
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
I want to change my mood

200
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Let's change it

201
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
It's good

202
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
It doesn't matter where

203
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
It doesn't matter where

204
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Changing the position and changing the mood

205
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,340
Is this meant to be the final result?

206
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,720
We ate it up!

207
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,200
It was such a mess!

208
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,340
Wait, it was going to be Fried Chickencede 2 does that to me!!

209
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,200
It's No. 2's turn!

210
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,680
So adorable!!!!

211
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,300
YOKO, you can do it!!!

212
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
What happened?

213
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,300
No.2 is the gross one

214
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
I heard the old man's voice

215
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
He had a loud voice

216
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Even after changing the location, the Koumyou is still not visible

217
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,300
In the locker room where the rain stopped

218
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,300
You look a little down

219
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,300
You said you wouldn't come back

220
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
It's a big deal here!

221
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,300
The challenge is the 50th time.

222
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
The first entry.

223
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
You're the only one who's been caught.

224
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
You're the only one who's been caught.

225
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Really?

226
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,300
It's over?

227
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Well, I was being spoiled.

228
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
That's true.

229
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,300
I was being spoiled.

230
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,300
Let's take a break.

231
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
This is impossible.

232
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,300
We can't go to the second half.

233
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Thank you.

234
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,300
It ends with two.

235
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
It's max 2.

236
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
Why did we go before?

237
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
On the contrary.

238
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,300
It was a real miracle.

239
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
It was an hour and a half ago.

240
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:30,300
To be honest, there was a little eye contact before.

241
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
To be honest.

242
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
It's not a decision.

243
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,300
This time I'm wearing glasses, so it's a decision.

244
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,300
You can't see it.

245
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
It's a death certificate.

246
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
But you have to be careful.

247
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
You can't see the nature.

248
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,300
Let's go!

249
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:53,300
Challenge enters the 67th day

250
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,300
I can't say anything to you who is honest

251
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
Wow!

252
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,300
It's surprising that he can sing this well!

253
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,300
It's true!

254
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
It's coming slowly

255
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,300
It's a good time now

256
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
It's okay

257
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
I'm going little by little

258
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:40,300
Even so, he can't escape from the beginning of the song

259
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Let's go!

260
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,300
You are a little depressed

261
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Ahhhh!

262
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
I see...

263
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,300
The challenge has finally exceeded 100 times.

264
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,300
The only way to save himself is to stay in the gym.

265
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
I'll do it.

266
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,300
I'll do it.

267
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,300
I'll do it.

268
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,300
I'll do it.

269
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Let's go!

270
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Downtown has become more and more positive.

271
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:17,300
You're a little bit of a local boy who avoided the rain

272
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:24,300
You said you wouldn't come back

273
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,300
You held the wind in your eyes

274
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:35,300
What can I say to you, who is so sad but so sincere?

275
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,300
Ahhhh! That's great!

276
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Who? Who? Who?

277
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
Ahhhh!

278
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,300
No, I can't say I'm sincere now!

279
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,300
I'm not sincere now!

280
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,300
You've decided! You've decided on the Hararishi rule!

281
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,300
No, it's already over!

282
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
That's the end of that era!

283
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
That's the end of that era!

284
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Say something!

285
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
That's the end of the second generation.

286
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Endo and others too.

287
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Endo and others too.

288
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
I kind of understand, right?

289
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
I'm being quiet, right?

290
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
I want you to feel it somehow.

291
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
I'm being quiet.

292
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,300
The power to read the atmosphere as a desired comedian.

293
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:30,300
That is one of the important factors for success in the challenge

294
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,300
I don't know what to say to you

295
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,300
That was close

296
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
I told you, Seiji

297
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,300
I told you that you're not Del Mac

298
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
I said, I'll stretch myself

299
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,300
I'll stretch myself as long as I do it

300
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,300
I'm going to be a quiet hero

301
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
From the start, 1 hour 20 minutes

302
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,300
Finally, a faint light...

303
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,300
I wish I had done that

304
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Good, good

305
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:02,300
The season of the young boy without a shadow is passing

306
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,300
The wind is blowing

307
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
That was close

308
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,300
I was so close

309
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
I was saying it

310
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,300
That was close

311
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,300
That was good

312
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,300
You're good

313
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,300
That was a good stage

314
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Today was a good stage!

315
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
It was a good stage!

316
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,300
After 112 times, they finally made it to the 6th person!

317
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,300
But, the only good thing was this one time.

318
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,300
After that, another infinite loop at the beginning of the song.

319
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:45,300
The challenge is far away, and it hasn't even reached the chorus yet.

320
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:52,300
An hour and a half has passed since the start, and the challenge has exceeded 140 times.

321
00:18:52,300 --> 00:19:00,300
In the locker room where the rain stopped, you looked a little down.

322
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,300
You looked a little down

323
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:10,300
And said you wouldn't come back

324
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,300
The wind in your eyes

325
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,300
It was so sad and so sincere

326
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:26,300
What should I say to you?

327
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:35,300
The season of the limitless boy is passing by

328
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
The wind is always...

329
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Who is it?

330
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
Seiji?

331
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
Seiji?

332
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
Seiji

333
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
It's Seiji

334
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
It's Seiji

335
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Seiji is so annoying

336
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
He is so annoying

337
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,300
I thought it was my turn.

338
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
I thought so too.

339
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,300
1 hour and 50 minutes have passed since the challenge started.

340
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,300
Let's go.

341
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,300
Let's go.

342
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:15,960
Bye!

343
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,200
Yeah...Lets play with us a song saying goodby

344
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,780
In the locker room after the rain

345
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,740
You do own a slight look

346
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,980
Saying you wont come back

347
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,980
The wind in your eyes

348
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,980
It's so sad and sincere

349
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,980
What should I say to you?

350
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,980
The secret of the shadow

351
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,980
Who said that?

352
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,980
I was surprised that both ends moved

353
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Here you go!

354
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,980
The 160th time, that moment suddenly came

355
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,980
In the locker room that avoided the rain

356
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,980
You looked a little down

357
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:32,980
You said you wouldn't come back

358
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:40,980
The wind in your eyes is so sad and sincere

359
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,980
What should I say to you?

360
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:55,980
The season of a boy without a shadow is passing

361
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,980
The wind is always blowing strongly

362
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,980
We are running, running

363
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,980
As we are, sweating

364
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,980
If we reach someday

365
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,980
I will be able to shoot you

366
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,980
Even if now

367
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:26,580
Even if the sun is small and weak

368
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,380
We have no words

369
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,280
The heat of the day is terrible

370
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,080
We run, we run

371
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,880
As the sweat flows

372
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,680
If we get there someday

373
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,680
I can shoot you

374
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:56,680
Even if the sun is small and weak now

375
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,680
We are without words

376
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,280
Yellow堆りの夕立

377
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,780
Well!

378
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,220
Ka-Ka-T 메뉴

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,360

380
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,240
The festival host...

381
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,800
No. expecting

382
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,140

383
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,020
Wow!

384
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,100
That's the first time

385
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,100
It was wonderful. It was a wonderful challenge.

386
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:39,100
The most strange thing was that while Seiji was singing, his singing got better.

387
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
That's how it is.

388
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
My singing is amazing.

389
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
I think Hamada's singing is better.

390
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Which one is better?

391
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
I was scared of Dan-san's singing.

392
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
As expected.

393
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,100
I'm not done yet.

394
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
Hamada is still here.

395
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
He's like, which way?

396
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Thank you for your hard work!
