1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,440
Ya know, I heard Endo's having trouble
- Really?

00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,850
Gaki no Tsukai's dressing room

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,590
That's not true, I've never been so happy at home as I'm now

4
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,760
Downtown

5
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,760

00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,760
Matsumoto Hitoshi

7
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,420
It's too early for that

8
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,590
Cocorico

9
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,590
Endo Shozo

10
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,100
How can you say that in front of Tanaka, huh?

11
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,100
It's fine, it's fine

12
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,170
Cocorico

13
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,170
He's right  - I'm fine with it

14
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,170
Tanaka Naoki

15
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,800
Have you seen the poster for ZIP!?

16
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,840
"Your morning laughs", it says

17
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,070
Inside the balloon behind him  - The speech balloon, right?

18
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,180
Makin' my debut on ZIP!
Your morning laughs
every thursday!

19
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,180
Poster for ZIP!

20
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,180
Stop it! Please stop  - Are you ok?

21
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,480
Maybe you should wear more colored shirts
- Right, he's always so bright and stuff

22
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,580
What's your deal?
- Excuse me

23
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,420
Huh? What now?  - Can I...?

24
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,150
Komurasaki Kozo

25
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,150
Producer

26
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,890
Hosei told me he wants to do a rehearsal and asked me to call you there

27
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,890
Ah...

28
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,360
I hate him so much!!

29
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,360
I hate him so much!!

30
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,340
After all these years of friendship?  - I've hated him for years

31
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,240
Do you hate him?  - Yes, no doubt about it

32
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,730
Is that so?

33
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,870
Why, you like him?

34
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,240
Well, it's our senpai...  - Well...

35
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,240
Do you?

36
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,720
It's their senior, after all
- That's right

37
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,720
Do you like him?

38
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,540
Me?

39
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,370
I feel nothing

40
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,980
I see

41
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,310
What I mean is that you know him better
- It's different, it's cause they don't hang out much together

42
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,680
And you, Komu? You like him?

43
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,680
Yeah, it's been decades

44
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Me too, I don't think much of him...

45
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,120
It's settled then, this is pointless
- He's right

46
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,620
You should like him to be here
- Whatever, for now just come with me

47
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,620
That's natural

48
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,100
Come with me, please
- Let's talk about this issue

49
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,120
Ehh? Really?
- But I hate him...

50
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,720
Sorry
- Even Komu...

51
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,140
He doesn't like him either
- I thought he did

52
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,900
He should have said that at least
- Yeah, I'm kind of shocked about it

53
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:33,110

Gaki no Tsukai

56
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,410
ya Arahende!

57
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,810
What's behind this?
- Please, get in

58
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,230
Here

59
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,920
He looks pissed
- Oh my

60
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,520
Oh boy oh boy

61
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,950
Look at his pissed off face

62
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,950
Is he angry or something?

63
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,950
God, you're right

64
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,300
This looks shady

65
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,300
Really

66
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,300
'Morning

67
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,960
Morning...
- 'Morning

68
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,300
Good morning

69
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,790
What a soft voice!

70
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,700
What's wrong?

71
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,700
It's not a matter of what's wrong or not  - Yes?

72
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,100
It's been 5 years, you know!

73
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,840
As you know, "genius producer" is what I've been called

74
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,240
I'm talking about music

75
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,240
Music?  - Yes, music

76
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,860
Oh, is that so...
- Well, it's true that now and then he worked on it

77
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,580
One way or another
- Yeah, that's true

78
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:16,390
Countless masterpieces
were given birth to by him!

79
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:16,390
Tsukitei Hosei: our talented self-taught genius producer who composed several masterpieces!

And after 5 years, today he's blessing us with a new song!

92
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,450
CDs aren't sold as much anymore in this era, Yama-chan

93
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,450
So you've noticed it, huh? Good point

94
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,490
You're aiming at making a CD out of this?

95
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,490
Of course

96
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,650
This a graph covering the last 10 years

97
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,320
Of CnD sales...

98
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,320
Did he stutter?

99
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,690
Cindy Lauper?

100
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,490
Did you say "Cindy"?

101
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,690
Cindy Lauper...?

102
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,490
You mean Cindy Lauper's CDs?

103
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,600
I meant to say "C-D"

104
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,900
"CD", ok?

105
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,900
Sure, got it

106
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,870
As you can see it's been sinking down on the last 10 years

107
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,870
Well, that's true

108
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,870
A lot, really

109
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,470
Why do you think they don't sell?

110
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,810
It's 'cuz no one's makin' good songs anymore!!

111
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,810
Eh? But that's not true...  - You think so?

112
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,750
- One you can enjoy with your family

113
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,750
My idea of a good song

114
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,750
A song which anyone can enjoy, they're no more!!

115
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,050
Alright then, let's do this!!

116
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,050
- Come on

117
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,590
I surely didn't expect that

118
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,130
Please, hate on me!!

119
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,440
Don't treat me well, how can we joke about this?!

120
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,520
But I told you I want to do it!

121
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,520
That's not it-- joke around some more!

122
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,780
Shove more jokes on my face, guys
- Yeah but... yes

123
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,080
A change of pace is nice too sometimes, right?

124
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,080
Whatever man, let's set that aside

125
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,600
What I want to say is...

126
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Yes?

127
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,770
It was such a nice answer, right?

128
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,770
It was

129
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,420
We're five, ok?
- Yes

130
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,780
There are 5 member on Gaki no Tsukai
- Yeah, 5 Gaki members

131
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,080
What's another team made of 5 incredible comedians you know?

132
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,080
Is there anyone else?  - Yes, who?

133
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,150
5 people...?
- Mhh...

134
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,660
It's the Drifters, you silly!!

135
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,660
Ohh, right, right  - Right?

136
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,730
And I think that we're all

137
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,500
We're the same as them, really

138
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,130
It's a coincidence

139
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,600
Are we?

140
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,000
We are, yes, that too

141
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,000
Even as characters?

142
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,080
You think so? We and them...
- I think we do

143
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,700
Matsumoto is Shimura, no doubt

144
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,610
Shimura Ken

145
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,300
Then we have Tanaka, he's Nakamoto

146
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,130
Nakamoto Kouji? I see

147
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:59,220
Nakamoto Kouji

148
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,020
Yes, Nakamoto Kouji

149
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,420
Yeah, like a slim version of him

150
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,080
I thought I was gonna be him

151
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,080
Yeah, me too

152
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,780
Endo is Kato, his face even looks like his

153
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,650
Katou Cha

154
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,650
Wait a sec, hey
- Yes?

155
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,520
Are ya sayin' I'm Buu?

156
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,620
Takagi Buu

157
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,420
It doesn't really fit him

158
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,420
Well, I'm Ikariya, so...

159
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,420
Ikariya Choukai

160
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,280
I thought you were picking the leader, so...
- Of course

161
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,260
But why should I be Buu?
- But

162
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,560
That's how it went, it's one for each one
- What's wrong with that?

163
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,980
Buu doesn't do shit!

164
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,640
That's not true
- No way

165
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,840
He's cool, he did a lot of stuff
- That's not true, he did "Almighty Thunder"

166
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,310
You shouldn't say that

167
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,320
He's right

168
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,320
That's true

169
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,660
He's good at ukulele too

170
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,380
He's doing it on purpose!

171
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,400
He's a great ukulele player

172
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,400
Oh, right, I remember that

173
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,480
I knew you were picking the leader!

174
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,750
Of course I'm Ikariya, that's out of the question

175
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,290
Now that we're good with each character...

176
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:42,160
Don't you think we should consider not doing "No Laughing" at the end of the year?

177
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,160
I agree

178
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,960
Right?

179
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,160
That---

180
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,530
I really think so

181
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,530
If you don't deny that too, I'm...

182
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,530
- I don't know what to say

183
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,900
But it's true, I'm saying I agree

184
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,900
What should I--- I mean, now

185
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,000
We have to make our way to NHK

186
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,800
Ah, you mean Kohaku?

187
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,940
KOHAKU: NHK's New Year's Even singing contest

188
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,870
Kohaku? We should take part in it, that's the best plan!!

189
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,870
Ahh! Nice!

190
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,080
If we can manage to sell the CD, that is  - True

191
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,940
That's the best reason to do it, isn't it?

192
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,980
It is

193
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,980
It's what we should aim for

194
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,500
Yeah--
- We don't want to be backstage, right?

195
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,890
That's right, that's why we gotta do something about it

196
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,360
It figures...

197
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,890
Sure, sure

198
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,890
What's going on here?

199
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,960
Now, let's try to get a clearer picture

200
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,490
Listen to a song by The Drifters, to get the idea

201
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,490
- It's like this

202
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,690
There are a whole bunch of them

203
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,460
I don't think young people know much about them

204
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,520
I think I know them

205
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,460
I know some of them

206
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,640
I think you know this one

207
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,370
Drift's Zundoko-bushi

208
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,370
Here it goes

209
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,680
Zun zun zun zun zun zun zun zun ♪

210
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,680
Yes, I know this one

211
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,680
It's famous

212
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,810
In the forest shadow on the way home from school...

213
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,810
This is Katou Cha  - Yep, it's Katou

214
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,550
She ran after me and gave me a smooch

215
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,860
It's Katou

216
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,020
It was a precocious girl wearing an uniform

217
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,010
I've never really listened to it that well

218
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,590
How could I ever forget her sweet kiss?

219
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,760
You hear them go "SORE!", right?
We're doing it all together, of course

220
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,340
Well, it's just one chorus

221
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,010
Did you get the picture, more or less?

222
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,910
Yeah but, it's confined to its own era...

223
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,980
Is this ok?

224
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,910
No way

225
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,850
Did you make a song based off this song's vibe?

226
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,850
Actually yes, I did!

227
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,380
I also wrote the lyrics
- Oh, nice

228
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,740
Haven't they-- worked on them together?

229
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,550
And here they are
- Whoa, that's something!

230
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,320
Alright, Tanaka! Read the title on top for everyone

231
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,320
Oh, ok

232
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:27,960
"Heisei Era Pa-Pi-Pu-Pe-Po Folk Song", by "The GakistarZ"

233
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,220
That's right!

234
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,860
Is that our band name?

235
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,840
Yes, "The GakistarZ"

236
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,160
The GakistarZ...

237
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
Are you for real?

238
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,320
I'm not kidding

239
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,040
Listen, ok?
- Yeah

240
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,460
As you can see, it's all split up

241
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,510
Yes, it's made of few parts
- Not only that

242
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,480
Is the first one a sushi chef's line?

243
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,740
Oh, he's right  - That's right

244
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:48,050
Gettin' all my clients with the rotation sushi
Aimin' for the mature-sushi boom
I've matured my dishes, and even my rice
And yet you got food poisoning? (pa-pa)
And a tear rolled down my cheek (pa-pa)
The hell?! You only got wasabi in your eye!

245
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:48,050
m 0 0 l -30 0 l -30 15 l 30 15 l 30 0 l 0 0

246
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,940
"Catchin' clients with rotating sushi, aimin' for a the freshness boom"

247
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,050
"Improved my rice & dishes, but you still got food poisoning!"

248
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,050
Pa-pa!

249
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,450
- We're all doing this "pa-pa" together

250
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,660
Are you kidding me...

251
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:58,230
And then "and a tear rolled down my cheek, pa-pa!"

252
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,230
He's explaining too much stuff

253
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,600
"A tear rolled down" comes in every part

254
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,470
A tear rolled down my cheek (pa-pa)

255
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,470
On this part, make it sound sorrowful

256
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,070
And then "The hell?!"

257
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,640
"You only got wasabi in your eye!" - like this

258
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,640
The hell?! You only got wasabi in your eye!

259
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,810
Do we have to shout here?
- Yes, "The hell?!"

260
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,010
This is embarrassing
- "You only got wasabi in your eye!"

261
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,810
"You imbecil!!" - like this

262
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,450
I don't see that anywhere

263
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,450
Me neither

264
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,420
"You imbecil!!" is something I came up with, but same tone

265
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,690
Pa-pa!

266
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,860
- We have to shout "pa-pa" together

267
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,820
What's the deal with this "pa-pa!!" thing?

268
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,820
I've been wondering the same

269
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,390
You've been repeating it but it's not clear
- What's the meaning of this?

270
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,390
It's important to have it

271
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,800
Oh, but it's pi-pi later on

272
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,320
Oh, you're right  - It's pi-pi

273
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,360
The next line is about a school kid

274
00:08:33,800 --> 00:09:01,590
Elementary
schooler

275
00:08:33,800 --> 00:09:01,590
Kids my age are always criticized
I got more lessons to attend,
it's such a burden
Stress at school is so horrible
And now my tummy aches (pi-pi)
And a tear rolled down my cheek
(pi-pi)

Mom! I got a 100 on math's test!
- That's what Miyo-chan said!

pi-pi

276
00:08:33,800 --> 00:09:01,590
m 0 0 l -30 0 l -30 15 l 30 15 l 30 0 l 0 0

277
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,840
"The test gives me stress, my tummy aches"

278
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,610
And then it goes "pi-pi", it's connected
- Ok, got it

279
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,340
And again, "a tear rolled down", "pi-pi"

280
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,200
And then "Mom! I got a 100 on math's test!"

281
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,080
"That's what Miyo-chan said...!"

282
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,790
Do we have to say it like that?

283
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,820
This is no fun at all!

284
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,820
May I ask something?

285
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,590
Do we really have to say it like that?

286
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,390
Alright, moving on...

287
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,360
He ignored you

288
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,360
Now

289
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,500
In this part we have a buddhist monk

290
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,500
A monk, ok

291
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,300
This one's a bit tricky

292
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:31,550
Buddhist monk

293
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:31,550
The number of old people is
increasing, but funerals are not
And I'm getting older by the day
My sight is getting worse,
can't even read sutras
And I have a congestion (pe-pe)
And a tear rolled down my cheek
(pe-pe)

This is the real... grandparanoia!!

pe-pe

294
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:31,550
m 0 0 l -30 0 l -30 15 l 30 15 l 30 0 l 0 0

295
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,960
"Old people are increasing,
but funerals are not", it's quick

296
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,580
Too many words

297
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,460
"And I'm getting older myself,
can't see well, can't ever read sutras"

298
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,090
Is this a song?

299
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,280
Yeah, where's the music?

300
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,150
Hey, should you really be singing?

301
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,150
"I have a congestion and..."

302
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,150
You're not supposed to--

303
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,180
Are you sure?

304
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,610
There's no music

305
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,610
No music you say...

306
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,980
Yeah, yeah, whatever

307
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,620
No way, man
- Can't we just read it?

308
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,800
Pay attention to this part
- I think we kind of get it

309
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,820
It goes like this in here, and then "pe-pe"

310
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,820
"Congestion?"

311
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,100
Again, "A tear roled down, pe-pe"

312
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:52,640
Buddhist monk

313
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:52,640
The number of old people is
increasing, but funerals are not
And I'm getting older by the day
My sight is getting worse,
can't even read sutras
And I have a congestion (pe-pe)
And a tear rolled down my cheek
(pe-pe)

This is the real... grandparanoia!!

pe-pe

314
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:52,640
m 0 0 l -30 0 l -30 15 l 30 15 l 30 0 l 0 0

315
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,130
"This is... the real... grandparanoia?!"

316
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,340
You're laughing so much!

317
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,670
What's the meaning of "the real"?!

318
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,980
Is this the real deal?
- That's right, the grandparanoia

319
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,640
'Cause he's like a grandpa now

320
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,710
And this is the final hook

321
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,260
"But we'll live,
and the Sun will rise again"

322
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:03,890
But we'll live, and the
sun will rise again
No matter how many tears
ovverflow
Let's keep on smilin' and walkin'
pa-pa
Let's keep on smilin' and walkin'
pa-pa

323
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:03,890
Final hook

324
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:03,890
m 0 0 l -30 0 l -30 15 l 30 15 l 30 0 l 0 0

325
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,120
"No matter how many tears ovverflow"

326
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,550
Ovver...?
- "Ovverflow"?

327
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,890
"Let's keep on smilin' and walkin', pa-pa"
- "...and walkin', pa-pa"...

328
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,860
This is frightening

329
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,860
Yeah, I agree...

330
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,910
Alright then...

331
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,830
How are we...

332
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,830
I shouldn't have come today

333
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,590
How are we splitting this up? I mean, the parts

334
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,140
He's right

335
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,960
I've kept you waiting enough, your parts:

336
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,970
Sushi chef: Hamada

337
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,660
First we have the sushi chef

338
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,980
And that's Hamada, we're counting on you

339
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,340
Sushi chef: Hamada

340
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,340
Nice

341
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,700
Matsumoto will be the monk

342
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,700
Whaaat?

343
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,070
Buddhist monk: Matsumoto

344
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,540
Yes, so make sure to focus on that "grandparanoia"

345
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,590
No way...

346
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,040
It's gonna crack everyone up

347
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,440
That part?

348
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,980
The "grandparanoia" thing?
- If no one's gonna laugh at that...

349
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,450
If no one's gonna laugh at that, it means it's your fault

350
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,820
Buddhist monk

351
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,820

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,820
Taxi driver

360
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,580
Hosei will be the elementary schooler,
Endo the taxi driver, and Tanaka the housewife.

361
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,330
Alright, let's listen to the music first, come on!

362
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,080
Listen now, here comes the orchestra

363
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,500
Sounds like a parade
- True

364
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,070
It's a fanfare
- Yes

365
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,560
And now what?

366
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,680
I'm confused
- Which genre is this...?

367
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,550
The intro is pretty long
- Yeah...

368
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,750
Gettin' all my clients with the rotation sushi

369
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,820
Huh?

370
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,570
Ah, it started

371
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,520
Aimin' for the mature-sushi boom

372
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,360
I've matured my dishes, and even my rice

373
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,460
And yet you got food poisoning?! (pa-pa)

374
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,460
Pa-pa! Alll together

375
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,770
Ah, this part

376
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,170
And a tear rolled down my cheek (pa-pa)

377
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,340
"The Hell?! You only got wasabi in your eye"

378
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,340
LINE

379
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,400
Pa-pa!

380
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,040
Was there a pa-pa in here?

381
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,380
Pa-pa

382
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,380
Yes  - Ah, here it is

383
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,460
Yeah it's--

384
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,350
It's not immediate

385
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,240
That's right

386
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,350
If I say that too early...  - That's not ok

387
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,020
Song practice: full immersion

388
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,790
The 5 members immediately start to practice

389
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:49,590
But we'll live, and the Sun will rise again ♪

390
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:57,270
No matter how many tears overflow
let's keep on smilin' and walkin' pa-pa ♪

391
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,740
Let's keep on smilin' and walkin' pa-pa ♪

392
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,210
Alright, I'm done with this!

393
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,210
- This sucks

394
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,480
Wait, we can't --

395
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,480
This is enough

396
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,740
Good job guys

397
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,360
No need for that

398
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,020
Call me a cab, would you?

399
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,020
A taxi, please!  - Can we go now?

400
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,120
I'm done here
- Please, I beg you

401
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,490
What the hell is this?

402
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,490
Come on

403
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,420
What is this?!

404
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,560
It's hard to sing and even harder to listen to!!

405
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,370
That's 'cause you have to feel it

406
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,340
You think so?
- It takes some time, you'll get it

407
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,880
Shocking! Hamada's secret wig!!

408
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,540
This is seriously scary  - This isn't ok

409
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,310
Buddhist monk

410
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,310
Elementary kid

411
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,310

Taxi driver

419
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,310
Housei's original song is aiming to take over Kohaku!!

420
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,310
With Hosei's song, they'll aim to take part in Kohaku

421
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:49,320
MV filming prep:

422
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:49,320
various costumes ready to be used

423
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,180
Now, they'll choose the outfit for the music video's filming

424
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,900
Hamada!

425
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,900
What?

426
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,020
Here

427
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,120
These aren't wigs for a sushi chef

428
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,160
Sushi Chef Clothes

429
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,160
Yeah, they usually have shorter hair

430
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,160
Right

431
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,500
Well, there are many types in there

432
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,500
But they're all long!
- No way

433
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,960
Stop complaining, come on

434
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,040
Think about the housewife and the taxi driver inside your head

435
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,040
Too many hairs, it's filthy

436
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,500
Counting on you guys

437
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,710
I'm done here

438
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,880
Alright then, Matsumoto come out please!

439
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:21,720
Buddhist Monk

440
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:21,720
Matsumoto's part

441
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,920
You've done it

442
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,720
I've done what?

443
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,720
You caught its essence

444
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,240
What are you talking about?
- Feels like you're the real deal

445
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,220
No way

446
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,960
It's perfect on you!

447
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,460
It's really good, I swear

448
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,990
You look like a monk of high virtue

449
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,990
You think so?

450
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,460
What about the wig? Do we really need it?

451
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,300
Can you take that wig off for a second?

452
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,030
Ah

453
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,440
Not bad even without it

454
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
It's not bad, but...

455
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,440
Doesn't this...

456
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,180
Seem a little bit like Townwork to you?

457
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,180
Nah, that's not true  - You think?

458
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,980
Next up is Endo's Taxi Driver

459
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,320
Endo's part

460
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,320
Taxi Driver

461
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,190
Housewife

462
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,190
Tanaka's part

463
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Tanaka shows up dressed as an housewife

464
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
And last but not least...

465
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,720
Hamada!! Please come out!!

466
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Hamada's part

467
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Sushi Chef

468
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,660
I told you...

469
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,600
Is there any sushi chef like this?

470
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,520
That's one of a kind
- He's got a point

471
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,400
Going like "Welcome!" or such
- Not really

472
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,070
I'm tired of looking at that wig, but it's still hilarious

473
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,060
Right

474
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,010
We still laugh at it every New Year  - Really, it's a classic

475
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,580
But I don't think it's really a good choice...

476
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,080
What?

477
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,580
Is it not?  - To be blunt

478
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,650
Sorry but, huh...

479
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,250
But... look, they're all too long

480
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,590
I'm a sushi chef you know

481
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,590
He's right  - Not very clean

482
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,490
Bring me that

483
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,490
This is too much

484
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,640
This one

485
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,430
Try this one  - Ah, Kenji Sawada style...

486
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,230
That classic wig is so natural on Hamada now

487
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,230
You think so?

488
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,520
Well, that's--

489
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,440
I've never seen a sushi chef like this

490
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,790
We've got to see it so many times

491
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,790
That's true

492
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,580
Holy cow

493
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,580
I swear...

494
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,050
Every wig looks incredible on him

495
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,520
That's right, it makes me jealous  - That's a talent

496
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,880
This doesn't feel right

497
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,390
I personally like it  - Maybe if you go to the countryside...

498
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,390
It feels dirty!!

499
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,020
Maybe that's how they look

500
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,920
On the countryside? Like this?!

501
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,920
I bet there are

502
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,760
Making sushi like this?

503
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,760
It's not impossible, you know

504
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,390
This can't be good, come on

505
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,830
I don't think it's the best choice, though...

506
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,360
I mean

507
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,170
Bring me a crew-cut wig, please!!

508
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,000
Try this one on, first

509
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,000
One more

510
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,440
Different wigs, same shit

511
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,440
Make sure to wear it

512
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,670
The staff gathered them all for you...

513
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,240
What the fuck is this?!

514
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,960
Definitely not this one

515
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,950
Terrifying

516
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,720
However you put it, this feels strange

517
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,720
It is, actually

518
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,150
So filthy...

519
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,560
Yeah, feels dirty  - Maybe, with the hat...

520
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,160
Try to put the hat on

521
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,890
Doesn't feel clean at all  - Maybe it's gonna make things better

522
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,390
I don't think it's gonna change anything

523
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,360
Isn't it good?

524
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,230
How about a small ponytail on the back?

525
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,230
Ah! Nice idea

526
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,370
It's gonna change a lot like this
- Like that, yes

527
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,440
Why not give me a short-haired wig to begin with?!

528
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,220
This isn't bad, let's keep it

529
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,410
What's the point of having them long?!

530
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,940
You mean like this?

531
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,940
Yes, like that

532
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,900
It's not bad  - It's the best we can get, I think

533
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:04,780
It's finally time to film the music video!!

534
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,780
Give me a break...  - Let's go with that

535
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,420
Alright, guys
- Yes?

536
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,950
We're doing a choreography

537
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,090
First off, take a look at this set

538
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,480
Yes

539
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,060
I spent 20 million yen on this!

540
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,060
Really?!  - Yes

541
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,060
20 million?
- That's right, 20 million

542
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,160
I can think of many other ways to spend that amount

543
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,160
Yeah...  - Unbelievable

544
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,700
Alright, follow me

545
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,670
Watch your step

546
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,900
I'm wearing a kimono and everything...

547
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,140
Right, that's no easy task

548
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,800
Ok

549
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,070
I've already decided the order

550
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,560
Ok

551
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,340
Tanaka is on the left side

552
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,340
Sure

553
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,910
It's Tanaka...
- Ok

554
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,560
Then, it's Endo...

555
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,560
I see, it's the colors...

556
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,650
Oh, right
- It's our colors

557
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,050
And I'm here, in the middle

558
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,060
Why do you have to take the best spot, huh?

559
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,100
The center  - He's the leader, so...

560
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,490
That's right, he's the boss

561
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,490
But he's the least popular one here

562
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,180
So, we'll draw back here

563
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,180
We have to be here first
- He completely ignored you

564
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,180
Huh? What? Why?

565
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,480
For the entrance?

566
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,480
That's right

567
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,970
Please start the music so we can practice

568
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,100
Here goes

569
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,480
Look, we got a huge audience in front of us

570
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,050

576

577

578
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
We'll stop here, on the 4th step

579
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,380
That's right
- You didn't tell us

580
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,940
Ok, now let's move down

581
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,940
He never said that before

582
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,440
There are a lot of people in front of us

583
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,740
People...?

584
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,740
Even over there, you see them?

585
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,340
Are they?
- Alright!

586
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,680

587
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,740

588
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,740
What are we doing?

589
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,650
I have no clue

590
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,230
I don't know what we're doing

591
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,090
Which part of this is a song?!

592
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,090
I have no idea  - Yeah, the music already started...

593
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,230
And I have no idea why he keeps on
talking about the audience

594
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,230
I have no idea!

595
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,230
Housei shows the choreography to the others

596

Hosei displays his choreography so the others can follow it

597
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,770
This is completely absurd

598
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,770

What was that?

711
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,190
This is the stupidest
thing in so long

712
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,060
It was so good!

713
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,400
Was it?
- It was really good

714
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,300
Are you sure?
- Yeah, aside from the song

715
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,470
You put a great effort in it, well done

716
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,970
Are we, like, uploading this on Youtube?

717
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,340
We'll have a nationwide release for it

718
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,510
Nationwide?
- Yes

719
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,960
Only Japan..? Not the whole world?
- Well, can't blame him

720
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,180
On Youtube just for us?
- Japan only?

721
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,720
Why Japan-only if it's on Youtube?
- Not worldwide?

722
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,360
No, nationwide
- Nationwide? Japan only?

723
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,650
The world will never see it

724
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,520
Oh my

725
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,660
The entire world could see it on Youtube...
- Now that I've seen it I don't know anymore

726
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:09,700
