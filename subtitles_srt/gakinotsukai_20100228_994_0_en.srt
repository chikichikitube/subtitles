Special thanks to GAKIDAVE for typesetting this episode!!

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,860
Gaki no Tsukai's famous series: Shichi-Henge

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,320
In this series we get to see how a true comedian behaves

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,700
In a harsh situation in which they can't fail!

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,420
And today's contestant is...

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,550
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,700
Bananaman Himura's Shichi-Henge!!

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
Finally Bananaman

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,650
We all talked several times about wanting Bananaman to do Shichi-henge

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,100
But we were all thinking Shitara would do it

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,400
But in the end Himura was like "I'll do it"

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
Seriously?!

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,800
It feels like we left a half-opened door

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,500
Let's call him here

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,200
Please

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,500
I mean, Shitara is the mind behind Bananaman's skits, right?

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,800
Yeah that's true, it's me

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,700
So, why did you accept this?

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,550
Don't say it like that man, it really hurts

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,600
It's ok to get injured, but please avoid spurting blood at us, ok?

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,800
Yeah that's the plan

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,600
So, these are our past records

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,500
That's how it is

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,300
Where do you think you'll fit in?

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,300
Just asking, you know

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,100
I see there are few people from Tokyo in here

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,100
That's true

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,100
And I can see Arita is no. 10, so at least above him

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,100
Yes, yes...

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,100
I'd be happy to overcome him

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,100
So 10 or above

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,080
Yeah

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,100
You don't know what he'll be doing?

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,200
I saw him with our manager lots of times during our meetings

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,300
And they were... shockingly silent

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,600
We didn't have a clue about what to think

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,600
I had no idea what I should do for this

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,880
Or better, there were lots of things I thought I should do

39
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,300
But in the end, I didn't want to do those

40
00:01:50,450 --> 00:02:02,050

So, what should we do today?

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,200
Yeah, what?

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,400
This one struck me, "Endo's self-brought plan"

50
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,800
"Re-propose to Chiaki"...

51
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
I didn't bring that

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,160
I never thought about a second marriage

53
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm happy now

54
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,700
What do you mean? That's 'cause you're young

55
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,200
Yeah I guess right now we're both fine by ourselves

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
It's all calm and peaceful now, huh?

57
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,200
Shitara do you usually watch our show? What do you think?

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,500
I must say, every time Heipo shows up I can't help but laugh

59
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,700
Is that so?

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,700
Not me, I get so mad even when I have to take the elevator with him

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,600
But I thought that this "family" got along pretty good...

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,000
We can't get Heipo doing stuff right now 'cause he's busy

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Also we don't have plans he could fit in right now

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,500
I wonder what can we do about it

65
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,650
What can we do?

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,750
That's also true...

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,640
Is there something...?

68
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,550
Hello?

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, I'm about to tune it

70
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, it's ok

71
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,400
Put 'em in

72
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,840
Why was he so fixated on that song?

73
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,100
It became his body blow

74
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,160
That couldn't fail

75
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,800
It was pretty unfair

76
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,560
The song he chose

77
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,660
It was unfair, wasn't it?

78
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,000
That's the only one he can play

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,520
And I did know that, so I was like "no way I'll laugh at it"

80
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,520
But it seems like I laugh easier than I thought

81
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,080
I was like "oh crap, am I the only one laughing? That's embarrassing"

82
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,000
Are you still working on "Yamazaki's Opera"?

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,600
I'd love to do that, but how should we...?

84
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,440
If we're talking about Yamazaki...

85
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,280
You remember that 100-people cutting episode?

86
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,440
We're close to Gaki's 1000th episode by now

87
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,450
I see... Oh! I got it

88
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,440
How about 1000-people cutting...?

89
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,280
Let's do it!

90
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,160
But I couldn't even cut 100 of them!

91
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,840
My back was destroyed after that!

92
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,240
There's no way I could do the 1000-people cut

93
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,000
Come on it's fine, you're not that Yama-chan anymore

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
No way, I'm even older

95
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,000
Sorry for taking your time, it's a pleasure to meet you

96
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
It's fine, my pleasure

97
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,000
We'd like to begin the interview right now if possible

98
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,000
Sure, please

99
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:30,600
We're currently having a special report section about Downtown on our magazine

100
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:36,000
And we wanted to ask you few things to you mr. Himura, being so close to them

101
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,760
Oh I see, ok I'm in

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,560
First off, what's the relationship

103
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,950
Between you and Downtown?

104
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,480
Well, it's not much more than a work-related thing

105
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:51,040
I mean, you saw them on tv, right? They make everyone laugh

106
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,300
I can say they're the most influential comedians

107
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,000
I see, here's our next question

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,550
What do you think makes Downtown so funny?

109
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,300
I see... I think it's their Kansai-dialect

110
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,600
They both use it, and I think that's what makes them so funny

111
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,400
They both use it

112
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,600
Is there something else...?

113
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,350
Yeah, for example Matsumoto's boke (funny man) act is really hilarious

114
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,750
I do the same job as him and yet I always think like "how could he come up with that?"

115
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,600
It makes me think

116
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,240
But to say it more clearly I think...

117
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,600
It's the Kansai-dialect

118
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,800
I think the Kansai-dialect is hilarious

119
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,700
Anything else?

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,500
Well, even Hamada is incredible

121
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,800
The way he takes control of everything is unmatched

122
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,240
His tsukkomi act is always on point

123
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,800
And he's always speaking in Kansai-dialect, right?

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,200
I mean, his tsukkomi

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,750
And Kansai-dialect is hilarious

126
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,900
Is there anything else?

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,500
Yeah even their DVDs, I mean...

128
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,200
You can hear a lot of Kansai-dialect in those

129
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,900
Kansai-dialect is hella funny

130
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,670
I was thinking about it but...

131
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,800
Maybe if they didn't use Kansai-dialect...

132
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,100
They would probably suck

133
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,400
After all it's in Kansai-dialect... and it's so hilarious

134
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,400
I see, thank you so much for your help

135
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,800
Thanks to you

136
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,200
Excuse us

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
Come on

138
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,800
So irritating

139
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,160
That was straight up criticism towards us

140
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,400
It totally was

141
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,000
I laughed while also feeling a bit frightened

142
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,090
So, 1000-people cut?

143
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,360
Let's do that, it was so funny

144
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:54,200
Ok it was fun, but I couldn't do 100 people, how can I do 1000 of them?

145
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,200
That's cause you surrendered halfway

146
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,600
But a lot of people... would beat me up...

147
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,040
What's with this childish explanation?!

148
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,560
Is that hearsay?!

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,280
Forget about it and let's go cut 1000 people, come on

150
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,200
1000 people is too much...

151
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,090
The hell is he doin'?

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,300
Like this

153
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,000
He's staring so much

154
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,590
That was exhausting
- At least open that thing properly

155
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,080
Yeah, at least that

156
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,400
So stupid

157
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,720
That's not what he was aiming for!

158
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,640
He was supposed to open that, right?

159
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,200
Yeah, it's not even hard

160
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,320
But he kept on messing it up

161
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,450
I have no idea if he did it on purpose or not

162
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,420
He also forgot about rolling the lipstick out of its cointainer!

163
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,420
It wasn't even twisted

164
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,900
He just moved the cylinder around!

165
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,750
Don't you think Heipo knows this type of shops?

166
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,750
On whiteboard: "Popular guy Heipo teaches us popular stores for women!"

167
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,300
Where do you usually seduce a woman?

168
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,300
Skewer meat places or such

169
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
People from Osaka loves em

170
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,020
They also say you have to go there at least twice, so

171
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,400
It's popular between people of Osaka

172
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,730
So I thought like, maybe some girl from Osaka...

173
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,560
Would like to go there with me, don't you think...?

174
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,560
Who cares?

175
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,160
I wanted him to say "eh?" to be honest...

176
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,560
He usually says that

177
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,000
Step inside, please

178
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,650
I shall now proceed

179
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,200
To cleanse you from evil spirits

180
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,840
Do it, please

181
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:16,200
note: just some random mantra-like yelling action, no meaning whatsoever

182
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,520
Persimmon seed

183
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,600
I feel relieved

184
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,300
Thank you very much

185
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,600
He spat em out one by one so nicely

186
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,100
I wasn't expecting persimmon seeds

187
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,800
He put so many persimmon seeds in his mouth

188
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,160
Plus, without any soy sauce

189
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,440
I thought those were his teeth

190
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,160
Is he really popular in cabaret clubs?

191
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,200
note: on whiteboard - "Discussion 'till morning! Why is Yoshinobu popular in cabaret clubs?"

192
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,900
Yeah I said it lots of times before, it's true

193
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,600
Really?

194
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,300
Producer

195
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,300
Yoshinobu Nakamura

196
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,960
I'm not popular at all by the way

197
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,640
That goes without sayin'

198
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,800
Come on, don't say that

199
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,200
Eh?!

200
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,210
He said it

201
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,520
Don't say "eh?!"!!

202
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,250
You said it too quickly

203
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,700
He really is

204
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,920
Is that so?

205
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,180
He's popular between who? I mean, age range...?

206
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,700
He actually dated girls

207
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,960
From cabaret clubs for a pretty long time

208
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,040
He dated a girl from there

209
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,840
Didn't he had a wife...?

210
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,360
Is it really ok to say that...?

211
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,100
He had a wife right? A daughter too

212
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,760
I know that for sure, man

213
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,640
Well, the fact he's popular is true, though

214
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,400
Oh shit, you're right!

215
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,900
Of course man, you should have known that

216
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't know, man

217
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,900
Hey bro, can ya lend me some money?

218
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,900
- Stand up, dude

219
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,200
But I don't have any

220
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,640
Of course you do

221
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,450
I don't

222
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,000
No way you don't, lemme see

223
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I don't, really

224
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
I bet you do

225
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,200
I don't!

226
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,850
Some coins at least?

227
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,200
I don't...

228
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,300
Then jump

229
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,500
I can hear em, jump some more

230
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,300
More!

231
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,950
More!!

232
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,800
What the hell!

233
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
What the hell!

234
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
I don't have any

235
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,160
You do!

236
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,000
One more time

237
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,400
But I don't have any

238
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,200
More! More! More, you punk!

239
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,720
Come with us

240
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,200
Come on, man...

241
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,200
I didn't know he could tap-dance that well

242
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,320
He practiced a lot

243
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Gimme a break

244
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,200
They're piling up good, ain't they?

245
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
He actually can tap-dance

246
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
I had no idea

247
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,840
I knew it so I noticed his shoes as soon as he got in

248
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,750
I thought "ok, he's gonna tap" and I thought I could bear it, but...

249
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,900
But I didn't know how he was going to start it!

250
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,090
So friggin' irritating...

251
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,680
They usually sing as they dance, too

252
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,880
This kind of... became some high-quality stuff!!

253
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,200
Making you laugh with tap-dancing... amazing

254
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,920
- That's impressive, yeah

255
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,620
Maybe I should learn tap-dancing too

256
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,500
There's also this thing with Tanaka here

257
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,080
It's been a while

258
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,850
Oh, here you are

259
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,200
You know

260
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,100
I have something to say

261
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,400
You're doing my impression right? It's not good lately

262
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,200
You're not like Himura at all

263
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,500
Like Himura?

264
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,500
...

265
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,500
Like Hiruma, yes

266
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,900
I mean, I'm doing so good but...

267
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,900
It's kind of irritating

268
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,040
Can you be a lil bit more Himura?

269
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
I'll do it, you follow me, ok?

270
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,400
I'm doin' it~ later~

271
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:20,800
Try it

272
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,500
I'm doin--

273
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,320
That's not it, completely different

274
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,500
Let's try it together

275
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,500
One, two...

276
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,250
I'm doin' it~ later~

277
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,250
I'm doin' it~ later~

278
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,400
That's completely different!

279
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,800
Completely wrong

280
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,800
Yes, I'm sorry

281
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,760
It's not good

282
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,350
You're not Himura at all, what's with that pronunciation?

283
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,650
Everybody: SAFE

284
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,700
He looked like him

285
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,750
Yeah, he does

286
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,760
So much

287
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,760
He said "Hiruma" the first time...

288
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,800
You're in this one, Tanaka: "Infidelity audition for serious comedian Tanaka"

289
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,700
Yes

290
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,600
What's that?

291
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,480
'Cause Tanaka is not the type to have affairs

292
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,720
Unlike Yoshinobu

293
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,700
He hasn't much lust

294
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,900
Are you actually [several dirty jokes]?

295
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,040
That's scary!

296
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,890
If I'd see that I'd be like

297
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,240
"Man, that's not like Yoshinobu!"

298
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,320
Of course it's not like that

299
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,800
Sorry for all of this, we're done for today

300
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,120
We're not gonna mention it again

301
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,750
You should blame Heipo for this

302
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,000
Heipo started it all

303
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,120
Yeah we just followed that

304
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,700
Today's hard, we can't decide anything...

305
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,650
I can see it

306
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
They're exposed

307
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,400
No way, no way

308
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,320
Watch out!

309
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,920
Wait

310
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,960
That's not how it works

311
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,960
I can totally see them

312
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,560
Are you breeding them?!

313
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,960
It hurt me!

314
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
They're rustling all over the place

315
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,600
How many of them do you have?!

316
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,360
Geez...

317
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,800
Watch out!

318
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,800
It's getting scary

319
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,400
What the hell, man...

320
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,480
What are you doing?

321
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,320
Et voilà!

322
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,120
"Et voilà" my ass!

323
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,840
Just go away

324
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,840
That's what took him so long

325
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,320
This friggin' guy

326
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,800
Should we take this dove too?

327
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,920
As soon as he entered I already saw one popping out

328
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,250
That's what made me laugh

329
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:19,960
Geez

330
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,360
That poor dove flappin' around in his pocket

331
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000

We're done

333
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,260
How much?

334
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,200
46

335
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,700
Huh?

336
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
It's 46

337
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,300
You mean 46'000￥?
- Yes

340
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,360
Fifth place

341
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,880
That's really good!

342
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,640
I did it!

343
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,720
I made it

You're above Haranishi

346
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,400
Really?

347
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,900
Yeah, you're over him
- Impressive

348
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,850
Thanks a lot

349
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,850

It's pooping to its heart's content

353
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,280

It's making sounds

356
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,120
Is that their sound?

357
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,760
Is that how they sound like?

358
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,860
Yeah, it was them

359
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,260
It sounded like a laughter

360
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,680
I had no idea they did that
