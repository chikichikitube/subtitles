Thanks for watching!

2
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,020
So yesterday
a spin-off went live, right?

3
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,420
Well, it was shot, actually

4
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,930
So what's the difference

5
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,460
between streaming shows
and broadcast shows?

6
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,730
Well... I felt a difference in intensity

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,510
"Joshimental" consists of...

8
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,280
Mostly non-comedians.
Female non-comedians

9
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,480
And well, it was pretty intense

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,510
Or so I think, really.

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,590
And well... "Documental" is...

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,920
A group of comedians

13
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,490
So it gets more and more intense

14
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,100
And it get funnier as well.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,570
You don't have a title, though

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,930
I have... well, a few in my own turf

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What title?

18
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,910
You know... that...

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,110
A shoe flicking thing...

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,710
I guess we're fine then.

21
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,410
You drink first

22
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,220
There's no way...

23
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,290
That's pretty serious!

24
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,130
-Yellow!
-I'm sorry!

25
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,930
Yellow, yellow!

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Damn!

27
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,930
-Watch out!
-This is serious!

28
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,210
Watch out!

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,280
Let's go then

30
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,180
It's only been 15 minutes!

31
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,250
For real!

32
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,550
I'm curious about this

33
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
You're doing that?!

34
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,450
Let's do this!

35
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:06,750
Let's go! Let's go!

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,280
Let's do it!

37
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,090
Alright, drink up!

38
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,590
Drink it.

39
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,720
Alright, so this is the proof!

40
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,090
-He put something in there...
-You put something in?

41
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,900
Huh?

42
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,230
-No, no, no!
-No one's drinking that!

43
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,500
No way, no way!

44
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,570
No one's drinking that

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,340
-It's great.
-You liar!

46
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,340
-Looking at your own face...

47
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,510
-What's this?
-Looking at your own face...

48
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:31,970
-What's this?

49
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,080
It's great

50
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,080
There's no way it is!
You even put something in!

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,950
I think that's enough, though.

52
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,020
Give it a rest.

53
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
No, no!

54
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,350
It's fine, it's fine!

55
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,290
What's he doing?

56
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,390
What are you doing?!

57
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,760
I'm filling it up

58
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,990
Since I made it for everyone.

59
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,060
Something's floating!

60
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,690
There's something in there!

61
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,360
Are you out of control already?!

62
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,430
There it is!

63
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,330
He's totally out of control

64
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,630
Get it, get it!

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Go!

66
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,570
This is insane.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,240
I'm doing it

68
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,780
What's with that color?

69
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,140
-Justice.
-Justice!!

70
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,150
-There it is!
-That's gross!

71
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,250
Just stop it!

72
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,090
-It came out.
-Gross!

73
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,490
-Stop this...
-Stop it, man!

74
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,560
This is just wrong!

75
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,790
Is this justice?

76
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,660
-This is awful.
-What are you doing?

77
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,990
Just someone...
There's so much left!

78
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,460
-No way, man.
-No way!

79
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,730
What about a nomination?!
Can we nominate someone?!

80
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,300
Out of control!

81
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,370
Don't do it!

82
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,070
That's completely insane!

83
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,400
He's totally insane!

84
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,010
Don't do it!

85
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,310
So a nominee?

86
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,440
Out of control!

87
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,510
Junior-san

88
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,910
There it is!

89
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,450
You do it.

90
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,650
You should do it

91
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,520
-How honest...
-The smiling samurai

92
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,020
-For real...
-You're the smiling samurai

93
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,250
He's really mad now!

94
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,560
Huh? Junior's...

95
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,460
-The smiling samurai
-He's mad now!

96
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,330
You just said you were looking
for nominees, but chose on your own

97
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,460
That's a shame!

98
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,730
Good job

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,670
There's also a Guitar Samurai,
right?

100
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
With the mask, yeah.

101
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,540
-So what is this?
-Bear bile

102
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,340
Why do you drink bear bile?

103
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,410
Bear bile?

104
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,250
It's great for your body

105
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,910
But he looks pretty sick

106
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,010
Junior-san
are you alright?

107
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,720
It's great for you, though!

108
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,520
No way...
Please don't go overboard.

109
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,060
Who are you anyway?

110
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,560
Me?

111
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,260
Yeah

112
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,790
I'm Mimiko

113
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,160
Who the hell is Mimiko?

114
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,360
I have a trick.
I wanted to show it to you.

115
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,800
I'm talking to Mimiko!

116
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,100
Go on, Mimio-san!

117
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
Are you that mad at
Mimiko and Mimio?

118
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,770
He's not that mad, though

119
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,770
Excuse me, guys.

120
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,540
We're looking at Mimiko!

121
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
Sorry

122
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,450
Excuse me

123
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,950
...So what about Mimiko-san?

124
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,280
Mimiko is...

125
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,250
Where did you come from, Mimiko?

126
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,560
Mimiko is...

127
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,190
From a world that you know well

128
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,930
Huh?

129
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,490
-A world we know...?
-Where's that?

130
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,860
Second block, Douguyasuji,
Setagaya Ward

131
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,230
-Douguyasuji?
-That's in Osaka!

132
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,040
That's all for Mimiko

133
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
Huh?

134
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,540
-So it's my turn.
-Go, Mimio

135
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,480
So now I'm Mimio?!

136
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,880
Like I'm your ally or something?!

137
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,710
Mimiko interrupted saying
she had a trick

138
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,420
But that was nothing
so now it's Mimio's turn

139
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,890
So you're the tsukkomi
from Shimofuri Myoujou

140
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,450
who dumped Mimio onto me?

141
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,190
You're Mimikoâ€”
Mimio-san, right?

142
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,630
You're Mimio-san, right?

143
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,800
My nose...!

144
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,440
Do you know the kanji for Mimio?!

145
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,410
Raise your hand if you think
it's "ear" and "man"!

146
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,090
There... there... there!

147
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,290
You're correct!

148
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,790
-Alright.
-That was correct?

149
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,390
Crazy Man, huh?

150
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,360
-So now a trick?
-It's not "ear-man", though...

151
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,330
So I have
great balance, right?

152
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,870
This is really, uh...

153
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,370
So I want to show you
a performance that I've tried before

154
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,570
Ah... I think I've heard of this

155
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,740
-Right...
-A special skill...

156
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,610
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-It's just a regular...

157
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,710
-thing he does.
-Where are you...

158
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,510
-Where are you putting that mic?
-Are you alright?

159
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,710
Is that part of your performance?

160
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,950
It's not.

161
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,120
It's not, right?

162
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,250
-That's insane.
-That's pretty crazy!

163
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,220
-No way!
-So this is my setup.

164
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,660
That's an interesting setup

165
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,930
Chicken setup (Editor's Note: 1)

166
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,830
No, it's "chicken tandoori"

167
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,830
Not chicken setup

168
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,100
I'm really sorry

169
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,730
Are you doing it?

170
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,500
Who said that?

171
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,140
I don't know
how you got your yellow

172
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,370
You don't just do this
out of nowhere

173
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,070
Huh?
What was that?

174
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm safe, I'm safe.

175
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,310
No way! No way!

176
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,080
That was just

177
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,180
-I should get that!
-Wait a second!

178
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,320
You smiled on your own!

179
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,890
I got one for the same thing!

180
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,560
-No way!
-You self destructed

181
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,760
You smiled for sure!

182
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,230
-Matsumoto-san!
-He saw it!

183
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,990
I haven't done anything!

184
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,360
-Well...
-Lots of self destructs today

185
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,430
Does anyone know?

186
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,630
Huh?
It wasn't me?

187
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,230
It was Seiya, right?

188
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,630
It was Seiya?

189
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,900
The reason I'm here is...

190
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,970
Soshina

191
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,070
What?!

192
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,270
For real?!

193
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,780
If you're saying it, I'll check

194
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,850
It was me?!

195
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,680
Soshina was smiling all along

196
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,790
From the beginning!

197
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,150
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

198
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,920
Let's look at Soshina

199
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,160
All this time he was just

200
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,290
With a general smile

201
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
Are you doing it?

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,270
Who said that?

203
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,530
I don't know
how you got your yellow

204
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,430
He's smiling!

205
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,090
-You're right!
-You don't just do this out of nowhere

206
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,370
Not yet!

207
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,310
He smiled, he smiled!

208
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,940
That's what I thought

209
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,810
But Seiya definitely smiled!

210
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,450
Maybe it's both Shimofuris

211
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,450
We're getting a double card?
I didn't do anything

212
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,550
Are you doing it?

213
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,150
Who said that?

214
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,820
I don't know
how you got your yellow

215
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,490
He's grinning

216
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
You don't just do this
out of nowhere

217
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,660
I'm safe, I'm safe!

218
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,830
He's safe!

219
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,760
No fucking way!

220
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,830
He smiled!

221
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,300
He was smiling!

222
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,830
-For real?!
-He smiled

223
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,040
It can't be helped then

224
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,510
-For real?
-That's quick!

225
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,440
That's quick!

226
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,540
Let's go with one for each of Shimofuri!

227
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,610
You two!

228
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,050
That's quick!

229
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,450
This is bad!

230
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,680
That's pretty bad!

231
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,580
We're not even 30 minutes in!

232
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
It's all too sudden

233
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,120
-This is rough
-Since your partner's here

234
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,590
That's one disadvantage

235
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,260
That's right.

236
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,060
Watch your expressions, Soshina

237
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,390
Tighten them

238
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,960
Okay! Good luck!

239
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,770
Whoa, that's scary!

240
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,230
Too scary!

241
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
This is insane

242
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,600
Let's laugh

243
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,480
Double card

244
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,880
Since we're here,
why don't we...?

245
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,520
Yakko-san,
let's not go there

246
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,650
Why don't we face our fears?

247
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,190
I even put the mic on my left nipple

248
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,560
It's an inverted nipple

249
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,660
-"Clang!"
-Hey, you!

250
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,960
Wanna fight?!

251
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,300
Stop it, please!
Please!

252
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,570
What's going on?

253
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,630
What happened?

254
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,900
For real, don't do that.
Don't do that.

255
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,370
-That's not funny at all.
-Thank you

256
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,970
You didn't change much.

257
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,770
Nothing changed!

258
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,480
Of course I did!

259
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
Maybe we can
fight as a combo now!

260
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,310
Put it on

261
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,480
Put it on, come on

262
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,920
-It's really not funny.
-You don't change at all!

263
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,150
For real,
there's no difference.

264
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,720
We can fight
as doubles now!

265
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,860
Who are you?

266
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,730
I can't see anything
so I have to open it

267
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,530
I was watching!

268
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
Soshina was smiling now, right?

269
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,430
Junior-san!

270
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,130
You too!

271
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
For real

272
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,670
Soshina's in trouble

273
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,070
Soshina was smiling normally!

274
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,140
Wait a second

275
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,910
That's no good!

276
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,580
Let's start over

277
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,380
I'm-I'm sorry

278
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,710
-Yakko-san
-20 million, you know

279
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,080
I was just saying...

280
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,920
We haven't done anything yet!

281
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,190
Why don't we do what Oniyakko-san said?

282
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,420
You wanna do that?

283
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,950
What was that?

284
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,490
We're just facing our fears.

285
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,190
I think it's fine
doing it in front of others

286
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,900
-What's that?
-Sea squirts. (EN: 2)

287
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,660
Sea squirts?

288
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,700
I feel like
you'd like them anyways.

289
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,840
That's right.
I get that a lot.

290
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,040
But I can't eat them at all.

291
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
I see...

292
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,140
I feel like you're doing it right

293
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,650
You hate them?

294
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,790
They're squirming?

295
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,520
You hate them?

296
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,490
That's crazy

297
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,220
I can feel...

298
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,430
The worst of the ocean...

299
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,560
All in here...

300
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,000
But I wanted to get over it

301
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,410
Are you using daifuku
to help swallow them? (EN: 3)

302
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,740
I love bean daifuku

303
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,710
That's an awful combination

304
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,880
It must taste awful now

305
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,280
Now you'll hate daifuku too

306
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,580
Are you alright?

307
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,550
You'll remember this
next time you eat daifuku

308
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,250
-Switch it
-Do you want me to switch it?

309
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,450
They're long...

310
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,520
You don't have to
call them long right now

311
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,360
I want to get over this
right now

312
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,560
That's what I'm doing

313
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,630
You're right

314
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,300
Right, Kubota?

315
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,870
That's...
It sounds kinda hot

316
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,740
Kubota has been giving me
these dirty looks

317
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,710
Is that soft?

318
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
It's so soft

319
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,510
So soft

320
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,820
I told Yakko-san that
I loved her a long time ago

321
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,150
Ah, really?

322
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,820
But eating these is just...

323
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,290
-Kinda erotic.
-Eating that?! No way

324
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,120
Don't do it now.

325
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,660
You can eat just the tip

326
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,730
I just want to feel
this part right here

327
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,400
Can you throw this
at my face?

328
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,300
With strength and all?

329
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,770
Yeah, do it.

330
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah, I just...

331
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,670
Can I do it from up close?

332
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,870
I want to feel it.
I'm covering my eyes.

333
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,240
-Right.
-Please go on.

334
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,080
It hit his hand.

335
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,640
His left hand.

336
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,980
Can you do it
one more time?

337
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,250
I can feel Yakko-san's smell!
The smell of her mouth

338
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,530
That stinks!

339
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,930
You're being rude
to Yakko-san right now!

340
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's just the daifuku

341
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,570
Isn't it just...
your own smell?

342
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,470
So today!

343
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,610
-I'm going!
-Yakko-san...

344
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,110
Try pinching it

345
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,480
That's right. That works.

346
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,980
I'm gonna do it!

347
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,010
Is someone making something?

348
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,350
Who's making this?

349
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,450
Me

350
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,790
You're making curry?

351
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,460
That's me.

352
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,860
That 18 spices curry is pretty spicy

353
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,160
That's right, yeah

354
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,730
I've never tried it before

355
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,660
Huh?

356
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,900
Comedians usually...

357
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,610
Put that through... right...

358
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,340
For the first time ever

359
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,010
That face is disturbing!

360
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,540
Really?

361
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,750
Are they alright?

362
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,910
Alright, choose

363
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,260
That's so uncomfortable to watch

364
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,790
Ah, they're the same?!

365
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,320
They're the same

366
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,690
-They're not.
-What's this?

367
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,160
They're twins.

368
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,070
-Twins?
-Like when you buy four of these...

369
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,930
You buy them in pairs?

370
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,470
Well, I'm guessing
that there are four different types

371
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,640
Like one type each...

372
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,240
For four people...

373
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,350
Four people...

374
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,350
That gather...

375
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,380
What the hell are you saying?!

376
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,720
He can't speak.

377
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,220
Alright...

378
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,960
Then twins and triplets

379
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,190
What the hell are you saying?

380
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,560
I think I got
the twins and triplets thing

381
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,530
I think he's saying
that siblings can be annoying

382
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,530
You know? I feel like
I would've found these funny as a kid

383
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,070
Well, yeah, right.

384
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,040
Did you see it?

385
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,170
Alright, today!

386
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,770
I thought about several games

387
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,380
So we can face off intensely!

388
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,780
-And I'd like to play them.
-Let's do it!

389
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,780
I have four games.

390
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,420
One is "Intense!! Pop Corn Talk!!"

391
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,790
"Hyper Galaxy
Nipple Clothespin"

392
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,760
"Smelling Dad's Farts, the Game"

393
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,630
"The Ice Duel of Exploding Gags"

394
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,560
These are the four games.
So which one do you wanna try?

395
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,900
What do you mean?
We're all playing?

396
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,100
They're for any group of people

397
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,070
I recommend this one, personally

398
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,810
So we're playing that one?

399
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,340
Alright, let's do it.

400
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,580
I'll get it ready then

401
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,180
Does it take too long?

402
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,980
Well... about five minutes?

403
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,350
That's pretty long

404
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,190
Well, I guess two or three minutes...

405
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,820
So can I show something meanwhile?

406
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,890
Yeah

407
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,360
So a lot of girls
stay at my place

408
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,490
Right

409
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,530
And they leave their stuff
all the time.

410
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,770
Like as a way to
mark their territory?

411
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,470
To let other women know?

412
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,940
Stuff like this

413
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,970
That's pretty interesting

414
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,140
Like make-up and stuff

415
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,110
Pretty normal

416
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,880
So they asked me

417
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,180
To give them back

418
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,520
There's some panties in there

419
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,250
Really?

420
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,660
They're XL size...

421
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,660
I don't know the brand

422
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,190
It says "Treasure Hunter"

423
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,830
I see...

424
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,330
"Treasure Hunter"

425
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,000
"Treasure Hunter", huh?

426
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,070
They're ripped

427
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,970
So they're for pirates?

428
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,470
Where does it say that?

429
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,640
Where's it written?

430
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,070
"Treasure Hunter"?

431
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,840
It's not there.

432
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,580
Huh?

433
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,280
It's not written?

434
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,950
It's not written, man

435
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,580
That's not good

436
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,750
Stop that, Junior-san

437
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,890
That's pretty cold

438
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,120
I'm just saying that...

439
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,420
You know what that means?

440
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,560
It means he's ready
to wrestle, you know?

441
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,690
As a comedian?

442
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,860
No way!

443
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,090
It's not written, though

444
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,690
Even if it isn't, that's just...

445
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,200
It's a little funny, but

446
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,630
Now I'm really pissed off

447
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,000
And he's so neat

448
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,970
They're soaked

449
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,870
Huh?

450
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,110
They're soaked?
Yeah

451
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,680
I washed them.

452
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,310
Gross

453
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,050
-Huh?
-Did you dry them?

454
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,450
No, I just...
hung them up

455
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,220
It doesn't say "Treasure Hunter"
anywhere

456
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,250
"Treasure Hunter"!

457
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,020
You know?

458
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,990
You're just lying, Kubota-san

459
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,820
I wouldn't lie
about something like that

460
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,330
You know how some driers

461
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,700
have "pure life" written on them?

462
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,130
Pure life sounds pretty fun!

463
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,570
I can't do anything with this

464
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,230
Yeah, I get that feeling right now

465
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,200
He's so grossed out

466
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,770
I feel bad for him...

467
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,310
He's so delicate.
He's really delicate.

468
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,280
That's just...

469
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,650
It's soaking wet

470
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,350
All of it?

471
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,380
This side's dry,
and then it's wet here...

472
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,750
That's nasty!

473
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,260
I'll return them, then.

474
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,560
It doesn't say
"Treasure Hunter" though

475
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,630
It does

476
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,030
It doesn't

477
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,900
Huh?
What about the Pop Corn Talk?

478
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,930
We're ready to go!!
Let's do this!!

479
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,670
You're so annoying, man

480
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,670
Shut up!
It's a challenge!

481
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,300
What what what?

482
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,570
A challenge?

483
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,170
Let's do this
with intensity!

484
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,380
What's what?

485
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,880
Intense!! Pop Corn Talk!!

486
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,380
You get in a teabagging position

487
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,920
Your ass goes down like this

488
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,050
I see

489
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,990
And you heat it up

490
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,920
In the meantime with someone else...

491
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,660
You start a live talk broadcast

492
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,730
Right right

493
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,830
And once pop corn starts popping

494
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,460
The instant it hits your ass

495
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,200
Even if you're talking...
if it touches you

496
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,370
You have to shout
the name of a fruit

497
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,040
That's so complicated

498
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,340
Why something like that?

499
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,610
It's hard to remember

500
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,110
You're bad at this

501
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,140
That sucks!

502
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,610
So you start with
a conversation!

503
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,750
Someone gives you a topic
and you talk

504
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,720
But the pop corn
will start popping

505
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,650
and it'll touch your ass

506
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,050
Once it does...

507
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,830
What are you even saying?

508
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,960
Seemed like you
almost laughed explaining

509
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,030
What was the last step?

510
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,130
If it touches you...
You shout the name of a fruit

511
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,200
-Once it touches you?
-Once it does, yeah

512
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,940
A fruit?

513
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,370
A fruit or vegetable.

514
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,070
What's with that?

515
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,770
Whichever's fine

516
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,910
Fruits and vegetables?

517
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,410
So- So one by one...

518
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,510
What's he trying to say?

519
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,710
You can't complain
or say it's hot?

520
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,520
Yeah, we wanna
avoid that

521
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,950
Instead, shout the name
of a fruit

522
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,190
or a vegetable.

523
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,790
So you don't lose
if you complain?

524
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,060
Well it's a conversation

525
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,490
So how does it end?

526
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,830
Once you're out...
of pop corn.

527
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,260
There's a lot there!

528
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,630
What's he talking about?

529
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
I see.

530
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,300
I wanna give it a try

531
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,740
Who's gonna do it?

532
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,540
Goto-san.

533
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,670
He's gonna teabag?

534
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Well, I don't mind
but Abareru can do it if he wants to

535
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,280
-If someone wants to do it
-Just go ahead

536
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,020
Well, I have the t-back, you see

537
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,920
You have a t-back?

538
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,290
What's with the string?

539
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,620
Why do you have that?

540
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,050
I'm curious about the string

541
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Do you always wear that?

542
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,990
I do

543
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,930
Is that tied to your dick?

544
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,960
-Tied?
-Tied

545
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,270
A dick tie?

546
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,600
So I'm going to do a check

547
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,770
We're counting on you!

548
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,240
Well he's the oldest after all

549
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,670
Something fell!

550
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,580
So it wasn't tied to it?

551
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,350
Didn't Abareru-kun just smile?

552
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,580
It wasn't tied

553
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,150
You look like Mikawa Kenichi (EN: 4)

554
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,750
Kuwata?

555
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,090
Well he just took it off

556
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,720
What are we even doing?

557
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,090
That's just a coincidence

558
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,890
-Wasn't Goto-san doing this?
-It's just a coincidence

559
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,660
What about this?

560
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,830
Well, I guess we'll go
with Goto-san!

561
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:40,900
He can do it!

562
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,460
Then we'll decide with this

563
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,170
With the ones Abareru brought

564
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,330
That's good!

565
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,740
Alright get one first

566
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,740
Yakko-san is a woman, so...

567
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,810
Right, yeah.

568
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,070
Then I'll go with this

569
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,440
And I... me too?

570
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,610
Right

571
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,810
What did I get...? Ah, right

572
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,110
If you get the X,
you do it

573
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,750
One, two...

574
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,190
Goto-san got it!

575
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,920
No way!

576
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,420
That's incredible!

577
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,120
Pop Corn Brother

578
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,300
So Goto-san will do it?

579
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,530
So what now?

580
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,370
Can they even
do it in the first place?

581
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,910
I don't even get the rules

582
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,040
Alright, we're all set.

583
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,880
His legs are short!

584
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,480
Short legs man!

585
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,750
That's funny

586
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,150
It looks good

587
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,350
Isn't your dick
too tight in there?

588
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,590
I just have it
higher than most people

589
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,090
Like the junction?

590
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,360
The junction is too high!

591
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,530
Really?
Do you have three dicks?

592
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Junction?

593
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,730
-Are you alright?
-It's a cerberus cock

594
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,940
I haven't seen someone
with three cocks

595
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,110
This is pretty hot, huh?!

596
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,040
No, no,
we definitely need it like that

597
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,010
This is scary, man!

598
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,450
I'm scared!

599
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,510
Is this okay?

600
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,020
We're doing it right away?

601
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,050
Well, it'll last
for about a minute

602
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
So get in position

603
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,020
That quickly?

604
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,130
Alright then, let's go.
Intense!! Pop Corn Talk!!

605
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,460
What's the topic?

606
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,200
The topic!
Junior-san, please!

607
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,730
Alright then, "Yesterday"!

608
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
-"Yesterday"?
-Yeah

609
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,200
Yesterday I did this or that...

610
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,270
Yesterday?

611
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,340
Right, right

612
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,070
-So yesterday.
-What did we do?

613
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,670
Yesterday there was
the thing with Lumine!

614
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,480
-Ah, Lumine!
-Right

615
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,810
That's amazing.
Even though Yoshimoto is quite old

616
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,010
He's still going on stage

617
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,650
We did three performances...

618
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,620
Well, and because of covid

619
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,720
there were plenty of empty seats

620
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,160
Because even if you sit
next to each other

621
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,160
you had to leave two empty seats before

622
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,090
And then we changed it to like...

623
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,330
Um...

624
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,700
So you're getting more people?

625
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,430
Sitting next to each other

626
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,670
And haven't the laughs
died down a bit?

627
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,200
No, no. When we had to
leave gaps between seats

628
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,270
Yeah?

629
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,280
Uh... well, everyone was kinda...

630
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,110
Scared, you know?
It felt like that.

631
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,780
-But now...
-So it got difficult to perform?

632
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,980
Now I think it works better

633
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,290
You know, when the audience
is all stiff...

634
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,050
Here it comes!

635
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,720
Here it comes! Get ready!

636
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,990
So you did it yesterday?

637
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,630
Goto-san! Talk!
We have to talk!

638
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,430
Almost there

639
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,700
The pop corn is starting
to change

640
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,930
We're almost there

641
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,170
Mandarin!

642
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,600
Mandarin

643
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,670
Pineapple

644
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,370
Takuwan, daikon seeds

645
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,110
Aren't those the same?

646
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,340
Mine are still the same

647
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,480
There we go. Vegetables!

648
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,150
-The third one was takuwan?
-Vegetables?!

649
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,980
It has to be off

650
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,520
Watermelon!

651
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,820
Talk!

652
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,420
Watermelon

653
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,790
Abareru's in trouble

654
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,450
Pumpkin! Kaiware!

655
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,420
Kaiware for a second time...

656
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,590
Please sit down, Goto-san

657
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,790
Enoki!

658
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,600
Kabocha

659
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,400
You're too high!

660
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,470
Talk!

661
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,530
Tomato!

662
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,540
-Broccoli!
-Tomato!

663
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,740
Tomato slice!

664
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,740
Broccoli sprout!

665
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,940
What's going on?

666
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,740
They're not popping

667
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,410
-We have to talk!
-Cucumber!

668
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,110
What was with Lumine?
Ah! Kabocha!

669
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,620
-Kabocha!
-Peach!

670
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,850
-Peach!
-Ouch!

671
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,050
Carrot!

672
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,250
More, more...
Carrot!

673
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,260
That burns!

674
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Smells great though

675
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,430
Melon!

676
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,430
Whoa whoa!

677
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,660
We're getting the other side

678
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,770
Ouch ouch!

679
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,300
-Kabocha!
-My balls are on fire!

680
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,230
Kabocha carrot!

681
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,670
My balls are done for!

682
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,140
Goto-san, good luck!

683
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,810
My balls are dying!

684
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,510
My balls are splitting, for real!

685
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,940
That's all

686
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,510
My balls are splitting!

687
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,610
That was long!

688
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,420
It's over when
your balls burst!

689
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,650
Looks great

690
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,050
Hey, my balls... burst.

691
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,190
They burst?

692
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,790
Abareru's face...

693
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,790
Busting?

694
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,220
Bursting!

695
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,290
-His balls busted?
-His balls burst

696
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,990
That's a weird size

697
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,500
Kinda looks...
like hemorrhoids.

698
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,600
Like a prolapse?

699
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,030
Looks like a prolapse

700
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,440
Well, this is just...

701
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,810
Why don't you come with me
for the following year?

702
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,680
Why are you doing
Master Nikaku? (EN: 5)

703
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,780
It's from an entire year...

704
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,380
I couldn't do this
until my first year.

705
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,920
Just cover that up, please.

706
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,580
Kubota, what does that say?

707
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,990
It says "Treasure Hunter"
on the back

708
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,730
That again?

709
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,590
Stop touching it

710
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,030
That's not very good!

711
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,870
I think he reformed!
He was very gentle.

712
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,230
Of course not.

713
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,140
Why are you blushing?

714
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,340
The conversation
was pretty good!

715
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,910
So you gathered more people?

716
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,550
They were really talking

717
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,050
So can you guys
look at my act?

718
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,120
Act?

719
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,580
I made this thing

720
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,690
What's that?

721
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,950
It produces sound

722
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,690
Whoa!

723
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,790
So I put this on...

724
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,530
And I'll sneeze

725
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,030
And make sure
it doesn't produce a sound.

726
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,700
Because it'll do so right away

727
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,260
It really seems like it

728
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,670
With his breath

729
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,210
That's impressive

730
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,310
He's inventing...rather
developing stuff!

731
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,540
What does it say
on Osada's shirt, Kubota?

732
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,680
-"Treasure Hunter"
-Of course not

733
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,120
It's "Forrest Gump"

734
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,750
It says "Forrest Gump"

735
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,050
What's with that T-shirt?

736
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,720
A Forrest Gump T-shirt?

737
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,190
What does it say on the back?

738
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,760
That's huge

739
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,930
It says "Treasure Hunter"

740
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
That's Forrest Gump!

741
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,330
Stop that already

742
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,670
So you won't make a sound
even if you sneeze?

743
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,380
With a paper strip

744
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,390
That's loud!

745
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,230
So loud...

746
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,000
What's that?

747
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,640
What's that?

748
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,340
They held it

749
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,140
What's that?

750
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,810
Well, I made this so...
Who wants to try?

751
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,510
-Wanna give it a try?
-With a new one?

752
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,810
-You have more?
-I do

753
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,050
No way!

754
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,720
He made some for everyone

755
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,050
That's just...

756
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,150
Let's clean this up?

757
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,920
Do we have like a broom?

758
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,760
It's about holding it, right?

759
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,330
We could put that on
and play the popcorn game.

760
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,360
Ah, that's right!

761
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,700
In that case...

762
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,770
Ikeda and Goto-san should do it

763
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,440
I'm fine.

764
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,570
I've had enough.
It burns!

765
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,640
Then I could choose
someone else

766
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,740
So you do it, Ikeda

767
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,450
That's a new one?

768
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,210
It's a new one, so it's fine

769
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,650
Alright, I'll do it

770
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,320
How many do we have?

771
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,390
Three more

772
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,020
Wanna try?

773
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,430
Really?

774
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,800
-With this one?
-That's mine

775
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,770
I wanna try it

776
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,300
You wanna do it?

777
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,500
-Really?
-Junior-san

778
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,970
-You have one?
-I do

779
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,240
That's crazy

780
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,370
No way

781
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,340
That's huge

782
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,710
That one's insane

783
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,350
With that one?

784
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,680
It's fine

785
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,920
That's amazing.
It's totally different

786
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,420
You went all in

787
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,520
That's amazing

788
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,320
That's so damned cool!

789
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,920
So this is the normal one

790
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,720
That's normal

791
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,190
This one's better

792
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,860
Junior-san gets the
ultra mouthphone

793
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,170
How does it sound?

794
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
It's crazy

795
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,340
Huh?

796
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,590
That's what I expected, yeah

797
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,790
No way!

798
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,890
It's so gentle

799
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,230
-Is that right?
-Yeah it is

800
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,100
That's wrong

801
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,930
That's not the sound

802
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,470
It's so gentle

803
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,280
It's so puny!

804
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,350
Puny!

805
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,020
You can't even see him

806
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,490
Isn't he laughing?

807
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,290
He's smiling?

808
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,810
Well, I guess he was cutting it close

809
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,080
Huh? Another show?

810
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,320
I can hear music

811
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,120
When you slip up with your story! (EN: 6)

812
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,890
The best people have gathered together!

813
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,390
That's Suberanai's opening!

814
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:43,860
We have gathered the specialists today!

815
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,870
Huh?

816
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,710
Who's that?
Who are you?

817
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:57,580
It's time to talk!

818
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,980
Chihara Junior

819
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,720
Thank you
for talking to me!

820
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,720
Right here
out of the narration!

821
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,590
You're always talking!

822
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,660
A talking-specialist!

823
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,800
Junior Chihara!

824
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,200
That's wrong, Wakamoto-san

825
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,640
Hey, the narrator isn'tâ€”

826
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,810
When you slip up when talking!

827
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,950
This guy sure
can handle a non-slip!

828
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,610
This guy?

829
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:40,950
He can handle the sweetest talk
and the toughest smack!

830
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:47,090
Osada from Chocolate Planet!
The talking candy factory!

831
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,560
That's wrong, Wakamoto-san

832
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,830
But someone here...

833
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,940
With people this talented...

834
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,940
You're not talking at all!

835
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,140
You shouldn't talk
when it isn't time

836
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,350
The man that doesn't talk
when it's not time

837
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,950
He can only talk as a presenter.
He won't talk when it's time to.

838
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,320
He won't talk
when he should talk!

839
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,090
And even if you stare at him
he won't talk!

840
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,700
He won't talk
when he has to talk!

841
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,430
Talkâ€” He won't talk!

842
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,010
Talk, he won't talk!
Terumoto Goto!

843
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,240
Talk, he won't talk!

844
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,180
Talk, he won't talk!

845
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,120
He won't talk at all

846
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,160
It's not time to talk!
Not talk time!

847
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,860
When Goto is on TV

848
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,660
He won't talk at all!

849
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,330
He doesn't talk!

850
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,340
He won't talk!

851
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,080
Who was it?

852
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,880
-Who was it?
-Who?

853
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
Who was it?

854
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,310
-Abareru?
-I think it was Abareru-kun

855
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,880
It was Abareru!

856
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,920
Me?!
It wasn't me!

857
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,250
-I didn't smile
-Neither did I

858
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,390
Well, that was complicated!

859
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,860
Let's take a look!

860
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,930
Yeah, yeah

861
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,730
It was Abareru-kun

862
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,400
Alright!

863
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,100
I'm glad I kept going!

864
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,500
When Goto is on TV

865
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,280
He won't talk at all!

866
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,880
He doesn't talk!

867
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,910
That's a little close!

868
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,580
It's so close!

869
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,390
I'm glad I kept going!

870
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,890
I think it's a little tough!

871
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,360
But I have to remove all feelings

872
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,830
Alright!
I'm glad I persisted!

873
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,530
You went on and on!

874
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,900
This is Seiya's point

875
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,900
Thank you very much!
I'm glad I pushed on

876
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,130
A yellow for Abareru-kun!

877
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,800
-Damn it!
-Another yellow!

878
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,200
Okay, I did lower my guard!

879
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,170
Now raise it back up

880
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,370
20 million on the line!

881
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,080
20 million, right!

882
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,510
Already one hour in

883
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,010
Stop it with your persistence!

884
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
You're so annoying!

885
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,480
Well you just won't smile!

886
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,280
It's just like with
Mister Sakata back then! (In S7)

887
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,890
He also attacked me

888
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,390
That was close!
But I can laugh!

889
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,590
Well, well.
Being persistent is valid

890
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,430
They just wouldn't laugh!

891
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,490
It's not against the rules

892
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,630
It can't be helped

893
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,830
Sorry!

894
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,330
I have to clean up

895
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,470
A broom!

896
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,110
We don't have any brooms!

897
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,440
I'll do that right away

898
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,710
I like how intense Seiya is!

899
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,480
I feel like he targeted me

900
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,380
Always

901
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,420
-Huh?
-What's that?

902
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,550
That again?

903
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,620
Huh?

904
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,760
You can hear it, right?

905
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,160
On a trip

906
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,270
From Michinoku!

907
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,430
The mic's off

908
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,870
A trip from Michinoku

909
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,840
From your own...

910
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,810
Your own Michinoku!

911
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,940
She borrowed the glasses

912
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,310
She asked to borrow them.

913
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,650
A travel from Michinoku!

914
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,750
Michinoku!
Your own travel from Michinoku!

915
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,420
What's going on?

916
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,120
Your own Michinoku

917
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,220
A trip from Michinoku!

918
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,890
Michinoku from trip!

919
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,860
-What's going on?
-I don't get it

920
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,930
What's that?

921
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,640
I wasn't expecting that face

922
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,320
She asked to borrow them

923
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,950
I wish I didn't

924
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,590
It's like the whole "besharu" gag

925
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,690
-So you covered it...
-That sort of thing

926
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,820
You know, I was waiting for that

927
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,760
Instead of the trip from Michinoku

928
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,990
I was waiting for it

929
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,660
Like the talk, talking

930
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,130
Time to talk...
Something like that

931
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,560
Huh?

932
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,970
Huh?

933
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,630
What's that?

934
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
A crocodile?

935
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,670
What? A crocodile?

936
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,070
There it is!

937
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,140
It's real!

938
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,680
What's that?

939
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,840
-Crocodile meat?
-You can buy that?

940
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,480
Your act is... too redneck

941
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,290
Stop eating
inedible crap!

942
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,520
His gags have all been
about crap like that

943
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,190
Right?

944
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,800
How does it taste?

945
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,300
How is it?

946
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,270
How is it in terms of a performer? (EN: 7)

947
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,370
Performer?

948
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,740
Tagawa Yousuke

949
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,810
I don't get it

950
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,980
And how do you feel inside?

951
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,950
Like Takahashi Hideki-san

952
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,820
That's pretty fancy

953
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,750
Fancy, right?

954
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,090
And the aftertaste?

955
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,160
Takeshi-san.

956
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,490
That's pretty huge...

957
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,760
You shouldn't use
Takeshi-san's name in vain

958
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,060
We had a broom!

959
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,770
We have all kinds
of stuff in here!

960
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,710
Ah! Master!

961
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,710
-Good morning!
-Master?

962
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,610
Huh?

963
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,810
Who's that?

964
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,050
Who is that?!

965
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,520
Master Kiyoshi... (EN: 8)

966
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,820
Good job

967
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
His face is huge

968
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,820
Did he have a body like that?!

969
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,420
Those are great pecs!
A perfect triangle!

970
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,390
An isosceles triangle

971
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,690
This early in the morning

972
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,600
Master Kiyoshi, what are youâ€”

973
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,270
This is kinda fun

974
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,930
"I'm feeling sick"

975
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,500
So you can't speak?

976
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,570
I see, I see.
He's writing

977
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,670
What happened?
Are you alright?

978
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,480
It's like FRISK

979
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,020
What's that, Master Kiyoshi?

980
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,660
Thank you!

981
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,890
That's a lot!

982
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Thank you!

983
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,630
He's like a young senior

984
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,100
Master Kiyoshi...

985
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
That's a lot of FRISK,
Master Kiyoshi

986
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,700
Huh?

987
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:36,970
Ah!

988
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,070
Give me some more

989
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,470
Junior-san's in trouble

990
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,010
Give me some FRISK

991
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,990
Master

992
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,890
They're great

993
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,500
He laughed, he laughed!

994
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,670
Goto's in trouble too!

995
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,240
Thank you very much, master!

996
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,150
I think he was laughing!

997
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,820
"But I can rap"

998
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,650
You can rap, Master?

999
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,150
I didn't know that!

1000
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,820
I'm sure he has a sore throat

1001
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,120
Rap?

1002
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,630
You can do it?

1003
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,730
Here we go!

1004
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,100
Are you alright?

1005
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,310
On the back... Seiya-san

1006
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,510
Here we go, Master

1007
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,310
I think he's feeling sick, though

1008
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,880
Is your mic alright?

1009
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,580
Here we go, Master

1010
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,280
Here we go!

1011
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,520
What happened?

1012
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,620
That's amazing

1013
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,160
That's amazing

1014
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,330
Huh?!

1015
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,560
That's a lot of BB pellets

1016
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,700
That's a lot of them

1017
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,400
So he felt sick

1018
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,300
I'm sorry for hogging the FRISK!

1019
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,900
FRISK?

1020
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,540
They survived?

1021
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,710
You ate too many FRISK

1022
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,180
They were all stuck
in my throat!

1023
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,610
That's a lot!

1024
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,980
I've been eating them
since Kiyoshi's time

1025
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,280
That's a lot of them

1026
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,950
Well, you're Kiyoshi-kun, right?

1027
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,490
Sorry! This guy's just

1028
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,060
obsessed with FRISK!

1029
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,520
Master Sakata (EN: 9)

1030
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,560
He puked a lot of FRISK
on his first appearance!

1031
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,930
And not a single soul laughed!

1032
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,760
You were living together...

1033
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,070
We get along

1034
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,670
Kiyoshi! You can't pull crap like this!

1035
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,800
So can he rap?

1036
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,640
What happened?

1037
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,380
For a long time,
you've been pulling crap

1038
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,510
Time and time again

1039
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,710
How is it?
Are you alright?

1040
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,820
This is it.

1041
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
This was an everyday thing
in Gion (in Kyoto)

1042
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,820
All the time.
Right, Kiyoshi-kun?

1043
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,690
But you're Kiyoshi-kun.

1044
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,090
Why can't you remember that?

1045
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,960
You're Master Sakata, right?

1046
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,860
You're not a real Think Tank!

1047
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:16,930
I'm sorry.

1048
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,970
But you sure get along

1049
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,540
Something happened!

1050
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,010
Watch out watch out!

1051
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,740
Careful, careful!

1052
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,910
Careful, careful, careful!!

1053
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,340
It's all inflated!

1054
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,580
Come on!

1055
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
Wait!

1056
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,980
Don't kill yourself!

1057
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,750
What happened, Master Kiyoshi?!

1058
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,290
You're no good!

1059
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,490
He's terrible

1060
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,160
You can't heat the curry
in the bag, and then tear it!

1061
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,330
And drop it like that!

1062
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,760
It's an awful impression

1063
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,900
Hey, Kiyoshi!

1064
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,700
You're one to talk tonight

1065
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,370
Leaving your personality aside!

1066
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,710
You're nothing more
than an infant, baby!

1067
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,180
You say I'm an idiot,
but you're worse!

1068
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,550
Yeah! Shikuwasa happy wasa!

1069
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,050
Thank you!
Where did your daddy go?!

1070
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,150
Your company went bankrupt!

1071
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,520
I'll call Yasushi, so wait right here!

1072
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,260
Yasushi's coming so let's wait!

1073
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,790
What a weird combo

1074
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,590
So Master Yasushi's coming?

1075
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,560
So he said

1076
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,630
Thank you! Action!

1077
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,370
Sneezing!

1078
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,930
It's the spices!

1079
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,540
Let's burn it up!
Let's go home!

1080
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,370
Burn the house down!

1081
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,440
It really smells!

1082
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,210
That curry is crazy!

1083
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,350
You've never seen
hip hop like this!

1084
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,810
Smoking hip hop!

1085
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,980
I'll go on
even surrounded by smoke!

1086
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,990
Only concerned
by the present!

1087
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,520
Yasushi...

1088
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,660
That's a strong smell!

1089
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,990
I'm dying!

1090
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,030
At my age,
I'm gonna die!

1091
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,960
I'm dying!

1092
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,240
How am I going to explain
that I died like this? To my family...

1093
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,700
Family!

1094
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,770
You don't have a family!

1095
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:09,980
I don't have a family
But you guys are family!

1096
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,080
Yasushi-kun!

1097
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,320
That's... Yasushi?

1098
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,420
Kiyoshi-san

1099
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,160
Yasushi!
You turned all pink!

1100
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,860
What's going on?

1101
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,000
This is the real
G-Dragon!

1102
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,400
I'm Yasushi

1103
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,500
No, I don't remember
Master Yasushi looking like that

1104
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,470
What's that performance?

1105
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,610
Yasuâ€”

1106
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,050
What's that?

1107
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,890
Wait, Yasushi-kun!

1108
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,720
That's not Yasushi-kun

1109
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,490
Master!
That's just a monster

1110
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,760
Your opening act
is really weak!

1111
00:44:58,830 --> 00:44:59,860
Leave!

1112
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,960
Osada...

1113
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,030
Huh?

1114
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,100
Who are you?

1115
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,430
Something came up

1116
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,070
Anpanman? (EN: 10)

1117
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,400
Anpanman...

1118
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,470
It's real Anpanman.

1119
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,900
But the needles...

1120
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,010
Are you hungry?

1121
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:15,910
That's creepy

1122
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,580
I am!

1123
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,080
Whoa!

1124
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,150
He took all of it

1125
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,420
That's hard to eat

1126
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,660
Thank you

1127
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,670
Currypanman
died right here!

1128
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:45,470
He just screwed up
with the curry...

1129
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,870
He destroyed
the spicy curry...

1130
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,140
Currypanman

1131
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,840
No one died, though

1132
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,080
This is amazing

1133
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,350
Huh?

1134
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,780
Don't cry!

1135
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,850
It smells like
Currypanman!

1136
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:00,420
Curry?

1137
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,160
It smells like
Currypanman!

1138
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,320
It's just curry

1139
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,920
Stop stop, that's creepy!

1140
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,830
Watch out walking with that!

1141
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,700
He was a great man!

1142
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,470
-Currypanman?
-Currypanman!

1143
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,970
He's not dead!

1144
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,370
He was a little tense.

1145
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,040
I see

1146
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,540
No... I know.

1147
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,180
-He's not dead.
-He is.

1148
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,340
-He's not dead!
-He is!

1149
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,610
-Currypanman is dead.
-We're just eating curry!

1150
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,310
Go and take a look!

1151
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,550
Take a closer look!

1152
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,360
It's curry rice!

1153
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,130
Watch out

1154
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:41,930
There he is!

1155
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,700
That's just curry

1156
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,030
Well, you can judge it

1157
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,200
It's curry

1158
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,070
His brain has...

1159
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,540
His cerebrum has...

1160
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,510
You sure like eating that, huh?

1161
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:55,940
What isn't that amazing?

1162
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,040
It's so spicy...

1163
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,810
You'd eat it
for a penalty game

1164
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,980
Yeah, 18 spice curry

1165
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,820
I think having burnt it is... you know

1166
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,120
This is just too much

1167
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,720
It's serious

1168
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,960
The whereabouts of
the Skull Stone areâ€” (EN: 11)

1169
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:17,300
Inside Papaya Suzuki's afro!

1170
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,570
Where?

1171
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,800
What's that?

1172
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:23,500
What happened?
Are you okay?

1173
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,270
It's an experiment?

1174
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,470
It sure failed

1175
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,870
It was a success

1176
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,280
It was a huge failure!

1177
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,580
You're all charred

1178
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,480
You changed your haircut?

1179
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,350
You're not growing any more

1180
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,350
The experiment failed

1181
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,250
Yakko-san's face

1182
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,450
That's long!

1183
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,890
It wasn't that long

1184
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,260
That was the...

1185
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,090
main objective, right?

1186
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,330
Making her hair
way longer

1187
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,700
Like growing it

1188
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
That's pretty useful, huh?

1189
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,730
Growing your hair suddenly

1190
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,870
Seems like it's kinda risky though!

1191
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,970
Leave it to Doronjo's assessment (EN: 12)

1192
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,070
Why have you been

1193
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,710
Talking about me
while touching my ass?

1194
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:07,810
Taking that cold attitude again?!

1195
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:10,780
Don't touch my nipples either

1196
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,350
Leave it to Doronjo'sâ€”
Why?!

1197
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,990
Don't touch my ass, man!

1198
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,760
I'm not Doronjo!

1199
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,630
You're not Doronjo?

1200
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,090
Well I think
she's much more Doronjo!

1201
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,930
You're right.

1202
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,370
I'm meant to be Momoi Kaori (EN: 13)

1203
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:27,500
Kaori

1204
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,270
Ah, you're Momoi-san?

1205
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,900
That's right.
I came here from LA

1206
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,140
Why were you there?

1207
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,580
I got married in LA

1208
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,580
That's creepy!

1209
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,050
Really?

1210
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,420
Really? You did?

1211
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,820
They showed it at an Okinawa theater.
You didn't know?!

1212
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,190
Where was that?

1213
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,530
Sorry, I just didn't know

1214
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,090
That's right

1215
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,660
So you broke up... and came here?

1216
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,330
We didn't break up!

1217
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,600
Huh?

1218
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,600
I'm just back home

1219
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:03,700
So you live there

1220
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:04,770
And your husband...

1221
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,810
-Is living there as well?
-That's right

1222
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,840
So why was the screening
with Yoshimoto?

1223
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:13,550
Well, you see, the film...
was meant to be screened with Toho

1224
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:16,720
You know Okumura-san, right?

1225
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,690
-Okuyama-san?
-Okuyama-san!

1226
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,820
He pushed for several releases
with the film production

1227
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:25,490
He used to work in film, right?
He cut us off all of a sudden.

1228
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:27,730
At a live talk.

1229
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,730
It was unexpected!

1230
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,000
I don't know what's real anymore

1231
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,370
That's illegal!

1232
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,230
I don't really mind

1233
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,540
I was telling Okumura-san

1234
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,340
-It's Okuyama-san.
-I was telling Okuyama-san

1235
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,110
That shooting a
wedding film was hard

1236
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,680
I told him, so it's fine, really

1237
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,080
But still, the timing was...

1238
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,180
Probably a bit awkward, you know?

1239
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,520
You're right.
You'd think there'd be a place for that.

1240
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,690
-Because Okumura-san was saying
-She's really talkative

1241
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,790
that it would be a huge scoop
for the reporters as well

1242
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,890
that's what Okumura-san said

1243
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
It's Okuyama-san

1244
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,830
Maybe it was Okuyama-san.

1245
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,540
He was great for us
but at the same time, you know...

1246
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,040
In the end we decided
to host a screening later

1247
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,040
So he said that on stage
and then went backstage

1248
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,710
You didn't fight because of that?

1249
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,880
Well, yeah, you know...

1250
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,650
Right... since it was like that...

1251
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,350
I had to make sure
we were at an appropriate personal level

1252
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,220
That makes sense

1253
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,660
And he didn't come back

1254
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:35,090
Well not that it matters
since it was a talk show

1255
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,670
And then he said that
me getting married was a bother

1256
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,500
But I didn't say I was

1257
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,870
You want me to read
some Karuta I brought here? (EN: 14)

1258
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,370
You have Karuta right here?

1259
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,080
I have a special
Momoi Karuta right here

1260
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,380
I wanna see!

1261
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,850
So you say it
you say the first character

1262
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,120
Well... "Mo"

1263
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,950
"Mo", right?

1264
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,660
Momoi's Mo is...

1265
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,860
Uh... Momoi's "mo"

1266
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:14,400
"Make it black
like lies or like truth"

1267
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:15,770
It was "mo", though

1268
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,900
That's "ma"

1269
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:18,240
"mo"

1270
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,770
Just a little while ago

1271
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,010
It's a little strange

1272
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,980
It's so strange

1273
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,880
Well, I only have hiragana here

1274
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,310
So you don't have everything?

1275
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,820
I don't, yeah.

1276
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,480
-Do you have "Ta"?
-"Ta", right?

1277
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:31,980
A Karuta game should have it

1278
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,690
Right?

1279
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:33,890
Anything goes, really

1280
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,190
Doesn't this work?

1281
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,760
"Tasked with life"

1282
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,230
That's "ta", right?

1283
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,700
It's kinda... concrete.

1284
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,870
That's a collection
of Momoi's phrases.

1285
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,040
What abour "Re"?

1286
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,470
"Re", right?

1287
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,810
"Re", huh?

1288
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,310
"Take the soup,
throw out the shrimp!"

1289
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:01,650
No, "re".

1290
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,880
That's "ta"

1291
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,950
"Take theâ€” Take the soup"

1292
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,190
"Re", "re", "re"!

1293
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,290
Do "re"

1294
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,160
This is pretty difficult

1295
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,260
I might not be understanding

1296
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,630
She's totally smiling, though

1297
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:16,860
"Mo", right?

1298
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,430
She's smiling

1299
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,000
I think this might be...

1300
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,700
That's too much

1301
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,200
"Dreams are like lies"

1302
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,770
Do "mo", please!

1303
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,640
She said she doesn't have "mo"

1304
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,210
It's Momoi's "mo", after all

1305
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,010
-Huh?
-It's Momoi's "mo"

1306
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,550
So that's why you don't have it?

1307
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,780
What about "re"?

1308
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,250
"Re", right?

1309
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,550
I love this one

1310
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,620
"Take the soup,
throw out the shrimp!"

1311
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,530
He totally laughed!

1312
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,730
He laughed out loud!

1313
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,300
That's a red!

1314
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,600
A direct red!

1315
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,930
You're out, man!

1316
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,870
Wait a second!
Change that!

1317
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:59,710
What's with the shrimp?!

1318
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,610
You laughed
on your own!

1319
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,980
It's because of the shrimp soup!

1320
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:06,850
Well this is just...

1321
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,450
I think we all know who it was

1322
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:12,290
This might be a red!

1323
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,790
It's my first one!

1324
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:17,660
I think we have to take a look

1325
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:19,960
Do you have "re"?

1326
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,490
"Re", right?

1327
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,000
I love this one

1328
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,830
"Take the soup
,throw out the shrimp!"

1329
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,370
He laughed out loud!

1330
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:30,470
You're out!

1331
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,370
It's my first one!

1332
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,210
You laughed!

1333
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,410
-No, no, no!
-You did

1334
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,310
No, no, no, no!

1335
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,450
Momoi-san sure does talk, huh?

1336
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,850
Momoi-san does talk a lot

1337
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,580
She sure does!

1338
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,850
She just wouldn't stop

1339
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,220
Well, well

1340
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:52,020
Well, precisely because
she was leading you

1341
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:53,860
-I'll keep it low...
-I'm sorry!

1342
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:54,930
And so

1343
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,230
-Yellow
-I'm sorry

1344
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,900
No second chances

1345
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,500
-Understood
-You almost got a red

1346
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,730
But it's yellow

1347
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,370
I'll die!

1348
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:11,240
Eat the bread!

1349
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:14,510
Whoa!
