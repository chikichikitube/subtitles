by many comedians, the truth about him...

I have a lot but I wonder...

6
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:18,600
Q: What does
Matsumoto have a complex about?

7
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,390

You're kidding!

11

The man described as a genius' mind is something else...

12
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,600
Surely your chin...

13
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,770

14
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,540

19
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,810
Got to be peach.

20
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,180
Loads of questions which even the guys who
have worked with him for so long couldn't answer...

21
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,180
A: Peach

22
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,980

comes to its conclusion tonight.

28

Matsumoto respect the most?

31
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:54,900
A: Ino Tadataka

32
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,690
Right, right.

33
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,690
The guy who made the first map...?

34
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,900
I can't understand people who don't respect him...

35
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,900
No, that kind of reply won't do...

36
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,910
Who will get punished?

37
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:01,910
The person who gets the least correct
answers gets punished, who will it be!?

38
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,210
Umm...

39
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,440

49
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,400
I think it's changed since the old days...

50
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,400
I guess so...

51
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,040
Ages ago...

52
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,240
we had a conversation about this.

53
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,240

00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,650
When we spoke

60
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,150
he didn't like anything unnatural.

61
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,190
Right.

62
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,060
He likes normal.

63
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,190
Really?

64
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,090
I'm pretty sure he said that once before.

65
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,360
This will be a tough question to answer here...

66
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,360
Time for the answer.

67
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,400
He could say anything.

68
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,800
Matsumoto is in a different room to the other 4 and cannot hear them

69
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,070
What kind of costume are you excited by?

70
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,170
He definitely prefers normal girls.

71
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,340
Umm...

72
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,510
Like a nurse thing but like...

73
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,320
a caregiver nurse.

74
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,190
That's what I prefer, I mean,
what the hell man...?

75
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,150
He's laughing all by himself...

76

78
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,860
Apparently that doesn't count.

79
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,860
Nurse doesn't count?

80
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,190
You were close.

81
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,190
Maybe it's the pants...?

82
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,960
Ah, that figures.

83
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,900
Probably the trousers.

84
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,340

91
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,950

98
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,400
I think so too, I think Nakai is too like proper.

99
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,400
Maybe...

100
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,400

108
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,350
Why did you choose Inagaki Goro?

109
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,990
Putting it honestly, by process of elimination,

110
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,520
like not this guy and not this guy...

111
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,890
I guess he would be the most likely.

112

Did they get it right?

113
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,430
He asked...?

114
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,430
I shouldn't have asked...

132
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,130
It depends on what era he decides on.

133
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,000

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,190
You should do it.

143
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,260
Do it for real, go for it.

144
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,360

Oh man, that's hard.

What kind of question is this? How do we answer it?

186
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,120
it's kind of embarrassing to say something
nice about your partner after all

187
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,060
This...

188
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,520

Matsumoto, what do you like about Hamada?

I wonder if it's something else.

201

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,200
It has to be you, huh.

362
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,200
Yeah, it has to be.

363
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,200
Time for the answer.

364
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,900
Who I don't want to be...?

365
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
Tanaka.

366
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:54,120
-------------------------

367
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:54,120
A: Tanaka Naoki

368
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,010
Me!?

369
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,850
Eh, Tanaka huh?

370
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,750
What's with that?

371
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,320
It was... me...?

372
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,820
Let's ask why.

373
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,190
Why did you choose Tanaka?

374
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,060
Somehow...

375
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,700
his everyday life just looks boring.

376
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,330
his everyday life just looks boring.

377
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,940
That's the reason...?

378
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,940
What's that about?

379
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,840
Everyday looks boring.

380
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,840
What the hell?

381
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,840
What kind of image does he have of him...?

382
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,840
I'm a bit shocked though...

383
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,210
What would Matsumoto want put inside his coffin?

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,820

What kind of question is that...?

388
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,520
There were no questions like that before.

389
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,030

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,900
Oh yeah.

396
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,440
I don't know.

Well... I've said it in my interviews and stuff

401
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,380
Oh really?

402
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,880

404
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,220
Alright!

405
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,220
Right!!

406
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,650
I see.

407
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:10,460

408
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,030
Yup.

Thank you very much!

412
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,500
I got it totally wrong...

413
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,200
Shoes...

414
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,400
Family photo, no way shoes...

415
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,500
Shoes is an awful answer.

416
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,970
Out of 100, how would Matsumoto rate himself as a man?

417
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,040
Out of 100, how would Matsumoto rate himself as a man?

I wonder...

423
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,080
Like depends on how he feels today

424
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,080
Right?

425
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,150
Could be anything.

426
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,150
Like today...

427
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,390
Like in this situation, what will he say?

428
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,890
I think...

429
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,890

I don't think he can say 100 himself...

434
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, so he'll lower it a bit.

435
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,340
Right?

436
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,340

Can I answer honestly?

442
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,850
100.

443
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,720

He actually gave himself 100..

448
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,130
Yeah...

449
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,630

I mean, from the start I've been saying

505

507
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,400

That's a huge point right there.

516
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,810
But you all knew too, right?

517
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,840
I get it, I get it..

518
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,840
When you tell me, yeah.

519
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,840
Right?

520
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,480
Ask why.

521
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,480

522
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,750
Because... from the second one

523
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,320
they're just doing it for the money.

524
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,720

525
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,890

526
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,160

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,310
For real?

532
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,310
He just hit his head...

533
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:20,140

Hamada Kokorozashi Endo: Kokorozashi

538

children does Matsumoto want to have?

542
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,120

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:39,660
A: Sakai
Masaaki

548
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,860
Amazing!!

549
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,860
The battle between the 4 heats up!

550
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,660
Alright!!

551
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,700
Oh man.

552
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
What did Matsumoto say to propose to his wife?

553
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,740
What did Matsumoto say to propose to his wife?

554
00:18:45,740 --> 00:19:36,390
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

555
00:18:45,740 --> 00:19:36,390
Q99: What did Matsumoto say to propose to his wife?

556
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,400
Ho-san, haven't you heard this one?

557
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,400
I have no idea about that...

558
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,880
I'm sure he should know.

559
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,880
Yeah.

560
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,340
I haven't a clue.

561
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,650
I wonder...

562
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,990
Reveal answers.

563
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,860
I thought just straight up.

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:36,390
------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

565
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:36,390
Housei: Didn't    Hamada: Didn't
Endo: Let's be together    Tanaka: Let's get married

566
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,860
Yeah like, "Let's get married."

567
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,860
I think so.

568
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,200
I honestly think even if he did,
would he honestly answer...?

569
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,900
I guess...

570
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,900
That's how I am thinking.

571
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,540
And you know?

572
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,900
He's never told me.

573
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,970
Ah, Ho-san hasn't heard anything.

574
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,970
Eh?

575
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,910
And Hamada-san?

576
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,910
No, I haven't.
Hamada-san, have you heard?

577
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,540
No, I haven't, and would he
really be able to say it here?

578
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,540
I see.

579
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,610
Even if he did, would he be able to say it?

580
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,610
Yeah, would he say it?

581
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,020
Oh I see, that's how you're thinking.

582
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,020
I get it.

584
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,460
What did you say to propose to your wife?

585
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,830
Umm, I...

586
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,540
I didn't, we just happened.

587
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,970
There wasn't...?

588
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,970
Umm...

589
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,540
When she fell pregnant,

590
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,280
we were like, "OK, well then we, you know..."

591
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,250
What an idiot...

592
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:14,960
-------------------------------------------------

593
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:14,960
A: Okay, well then we, you know...

594
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,480
What the hell is this...?

595
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,320
What the hell?

596
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,720
Surely you should...

597
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,720
Yeah.

598
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,790
Well, I guess we had to be more precise.

599
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,790
I guess.

600
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:20,800
After this

601
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:20,800
Who will receive the punishment?

602
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,830
Is that what it's about?

603
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,800
That's tough.

604
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Question 100.

605
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,540
When does Matsumoto feel contented?

606
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,310
When does Matsumoto feel contented?

Q100: When does Matsumoto feel contented?

609
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,780
Oh come on...

610
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,480
This is hard...

611
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,890
I got it.

612
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,220
It's got to be one or the other.

613
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,390
I see.

Endo: Going to sleep    Tanaka: When he's working

618
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,530
Oh, I'm not sure.

619
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,470
Either kid or creation...

620
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,470
I get you.

621
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,640
Come on!

622
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,000
Time for the answer.

623
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,240
I am, umm..

624
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,380
when I sleep,

625
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,320
I listen to Shiyaku-san's Rakugo...

626
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,960
I think maybe when there,
listening to it whilst lying on my futon...

627
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:31,300
-------------------------------------------------------------

628
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:31,300
A: Listening to Rakugo, lying on his futon about to sleep

629
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,360
It's when he's listening to Rakugo.

630
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,360
Not precise enough.

631
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,100
It's like Yama-chan's from before.

632
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,730
Yeah.

633
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,370
If you got this right, Yama-chan would be like, "HEY!"

634
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,300
I would have been so angry...

635
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:39,310
Finally, the results, who will get punished!?

636
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,070
Time for the results!

637
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,310
Who knows the least about Matsumoto?

638
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,510
Right, the person who had the least

639
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,180
correct answers about Matsumoto.

640
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,180
Oh damn, please...

641
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,180
Oh man...

642
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,180
Wait a second...

643
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,850
In last place was...

644
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,850
Please...

645
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:54,690

646
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,590
Yamasaki Housei!

647
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,260
NO WAY!

-------------------------------

649
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,870
Last place

650
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,870
Yamasaki Housei

651
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,330
Man, you scared me.

652
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,370
You're kidding!

653
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,630
I caught up at the end.

654
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,700
Eh, hold on now!

655
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,700
Yeah, the "new girl" one really...

656
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,210
And then the next question...

657
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,210
Yeah.

658
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,210
You can't be serious!

659
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,710
Wait a minute!...

660
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,780
After this

661
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,780
Very severe punishment!!

662
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,580
It is.

663
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,580
This is amazing

664
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,780
Eh, no way...

665
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,650
He's going to be so angry...

666
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,650
Shall we then?

667
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,550
The time...

668
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,050
Right..

669
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,050
Yama-chan...

670
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,220
Housei-san, come to the front.

671
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,220
Right, we just finished...

672
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,120
Yamasaki-san, please come forward.

673
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,690
AND?

674
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,160
And...?

675
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,160
WHO IS IT!?

676
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,630
This guy right here...

677
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,630
Right here...

678
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,300
Seriously...?

679
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,930
Like out of all of us...

680
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,500
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!

681
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,000
He was all like, "Oh yeah, I know the answer for this!"

682
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,470
Then wrote it, and got it wrong time after time...

683
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,070
I heard Endo did quite well...

684
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,140
Oh, thank you very much!

685
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,140
And Hamada, in the first half...

686
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,680
Yes, I was a bit...

687
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,650
You were in danger but then caught up in the second half.

688
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,380
Yes, the second half was much better.

689
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:53,320
And Tanaka, your life is just so boring...

690
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,920
He was quite hurt about that...

691
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,120
Even though you were hurt by what I said.

692
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,950
Yes, please don't say that kind of thing about me...

693
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,120
Please... I will get depressed...

694
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,360
Tanaka always gets his feelings hurt in 100 questions...

695
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,760
That's true.

696
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,760
Yes, every time.

697
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,930
Did anyone get the question right about the adult film genre?

698
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,900
Umm... Yes, I did.

699
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,670
He knew straight away.

700
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,670
I've said that so many times.

701
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,080
As soon as an adult entertainer
seems professional, I'm done with them

702
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,280
You really have told us that so many times...

703
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,750
Hamada-san saw right through you.

704
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,750
He did.

705
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,820
Amateurs are truly the pros.

706
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,290
That's what I believe.

707
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,620
But who gives a shit about that!?

708
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,020
YOU!

709
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,190
Yes...

710
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,090
You're going to get punished.

711
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,530
This will be bad.

712
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,960
Punishment!

713
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,960
What are you going to do?

714
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,500
100 Shouts of Matsumoto!

715
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,630
You will go to loads of different places

716
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,770
100 Shouts of Matsumoto!!

717
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,040
and scream "Matsumoto-san!"

718
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,570
Right.

719
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,470
But it might not be all bad...

720
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,740
You might go to that place
you're not a member of anymore...

721
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,750
I'm going to shout there...?

722
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,250
As soon as you get there.

723
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,220
100 Shouts of Matsumoto!!

724
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,220
Punishment:

725
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,220
Punishment: Commence!

726
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,220
Next week... the punishment commences!

727
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,190
But Tanaka is the one who will be upset...

728
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,690
I'm going to go home and...
