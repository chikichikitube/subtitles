1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,620
All of you probably often go on remote shoots.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,590
In "stroll-around-town" variety, TV talents go to restaurants ...

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,860
... where they have to get filming permission. - Right!

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,330
They'll go "Is it ok if we shoot here?". - "Are you ok with cameras?".

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,770
And if they get permission, they'll go "OK~!". - All the time!

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,270
All the time, right?

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,910
This time I have a theory that's related to this.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,440
It's this one!

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,080
"If, in a stroll-around-town type variety where you have to go ask for filming permission, ..."

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,490
"... your co-host went inside and didn't return no matter how long you wait, ..."

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,660
"... you'll ultimately assume the worst!"

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,060
That's about as meaningless a theory as they come!

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,970
"If, in a stroll-around-town type variety where you have to go ask for filming permission, ..."

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,770
"... your co-host went inside and didn't return no matter how long you wait, ..."

15
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,580
"... you'll ultimately assume the worst!"

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,920
The comedy duo Kaeru-tei makes up the target (left) & instigator (right) of our investigation this time.

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,620
Until this point, they've participated in a stroll-around-town type shoot for around an hour.

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,490
They're shooting diligently!

19
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,960
The nuts taste great!

20
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,960
Uwah, a Chinese restaurant! - Chinese!

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,800
They're delicious, these hole-in-the-wall shops.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,300
This looks great!

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,410
Our setting will be this Chinese restaurant.

24
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,370
Do your best!

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,740
I pray for your success!

26
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,980
She's hyped herself up!

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,150
They're this far away from the place?

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,450
How'll it go? Ah, are they even open? Seems they are!

29
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,090
Pretty far away!

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,090
She's inside! - Pardon me!

31
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,230
It's her first time asking for shooting permission.

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,760
I wonder if she'll be fine.

33
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,870
Nakano is worried for his partner, since she's not experienced with this type of shoot.

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,570
Naturally.

35
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,640
5 minutes pass since Iwakura entered the restaurant.

36
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,980
That's long! - 5 minutes is long for this.

37
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,010
Does it normally take this long?

38
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,150
It's taking longer than expected.

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,590
Another 10 minutes pass.

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,220
Scary.

41
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,930
This has gone beyond "she has trouble since it's her first time". - Right.

42
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,500
You'd get worried!

43
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,500
What should we do?

44
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,030
I want him to go save her!

45
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,030
It's taken quite long.

46
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,240
By this time I'm getting a bit worried.

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,370
Maybe I'll go have a glimpse? - Yeah.

48
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,170
That's right!

49
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,210
Maybe I can even see them from the outside.

50
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,240
She could've simply set up an "I've already eaten before you" kind of joke.

51
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,240
He moves to get a grasp of the situation inside.

52
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,120
When he opens the door to the restaurant ...

53
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,390
Eh, that's scary! - Terrifying!

54
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,390
... he will find the scene of a scuffle.

55
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,620
There are even bloodstains on the floor.

56
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,360
Creating suspense?

57
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,100
Moreover, Iwakura's possessions are all over the palce.

58
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,530
The staff at this show is messed up!

59
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,630
How will Nakano react?

60
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,630
That's terrifying! - I hate this!

61
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,600
This is awful!

62
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,240
Terrifying!

63
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,050
Eh?

64
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,580
Excuse me!

65
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,580
Ah, the owner's there!

66
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,080
Ah, excuse me!

67
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,120
Welcome.

68
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,250
But that's all the more scary.

69
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,220
I'm with a TV show for TBS.

70
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,620
We're walking around, filming in this area ...

71
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,360
... in the hopes of visiting some restaurants that look promising.

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,500
I believe that my partner came to visit you moments ago ...

73
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,340
Scary ...

74
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,970
Eh?

75
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,410
You don't know? Well ...

76
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,870
SCARY!

77
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,870
Didn't someone come here earlier?

78
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,440
No.

79
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,910
Eh, he's so scary!

80
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,680
Eh, but someone did come in here earlier.

81
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,820
No.

82
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,890
I'd be fearing for my life if I was him!

83
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,650
Ah ... is that so?

84
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,090
The ominous owner feigns ignorance ...

85
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,100
... and for an instant he backs away.

86
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,770
His face is saying "Damn, I screwed up".

87
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,270
But ...

88
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,670
But one person did come in here earlier.

89
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,170
Not that I know.

90
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,110
I've been watching the entire time, and she didn't come out.

91
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,410
I see.

92
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,610
No ... !

93
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,910
Somehow, Nakano hangs on.

94
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,250
Is there a 2nd floor? - Yes.

95
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,290
Is there customer seating in the 2nd floor? - Mhm.

96
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,720
Why does he talk like that?!

97
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,260
Ah, I see.

98
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,890
Could you perhaps show me the inside of the restaurant?

99
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,760
Amazing! He's trying to look for her!

100
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,760
On camera.

101
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,900
No ...

102
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,270
Would that be too much trouble?

103
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,870
Yes. - Ah ...

104
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,740
Did no one come here earlier? Really?

105
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,370
No one came.

106
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,540
Scary! - To be repeatedly told "No one came here" ...

107
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,780
But now ...

108
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,450
A voice!

109
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,450
Wh- ... what's that sound?

110
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,420
What? - What's that sound?

111
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,860
What are you doing?
- What kind of shoot is this?!

112
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,860
What sound? - This one.

113
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,130
What? What are you on about? - Could you just let me check?

114
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,330
What are you doing?!
- You gotta do something!

115
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,330
Check? Check what? - The back.

116
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,960
I can hear an unusual voice from back there.

117
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,830
What's your problem. - Sorry.

118
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,330
Is he going to go back there?

119
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,570
Don't bullshit me.

120
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,500
This is so scary ...

121
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,370
What the hell is wrong with you? - Please excuse me!

122
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,240
This is my store. - I know!

123
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,040
What the hell? - Ex- ... excuse me!

124
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,510
Amazing!!

125
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,480
What the hell is wrong with you?!

126
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,520
This is the worst.

127
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,390
What a reaction!!

128
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,360
Take that off!

129
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,170
What was that about just now? - It was like from a movie!

130
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,070
It'll probably come off even if you just open your mouth!

131
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,300
That was so scary!

132
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,570
That guy was terrifying!

133
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,570
You're a brave one!

134
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,880
Good work. - Don't just "Good work" me, that guy was terrifying!

135
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,850
He was so damn scary!

136
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,550
Now he looks kind.

137
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,850
At first I thought maybe she was preparing some kind of joke.

138
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,960
Just as you said!

139
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,730
But the wait kept getting longer and she wouldn't come out ...

140
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,300
... so I figured she must've been trapped somehow.

141
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,140
And then I went inside to find this scary guy waiting!

142
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,900
Well said!

143
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,340
Moving on to the next instigator & target pair.

144
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,140
This is quite the pair! - Are they gonna be alright?!

145
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,280
Hollywood Zakoshisyoh & Chance Oshiro.

146
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,510
Will Oshiro be ok?

147
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,050
Is Oshiro going to be alright here?!

148
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,300
Both of them have little experience with stroll-around-town variety ...

149
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,470
... but at this point they've already been filming for around an hour.

150
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,470
An exaggeration of Doi Takako!

151
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,310
It's not Doi Takako, I told you it was Renaissance!

152
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,710
And then ...

153
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,480
I'm heading in! Like this, right?

154
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,380
The shoot looks like a lot of fun though!

155
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,650
Shisyoh went inside.

156
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,620
Oshiro's going to be hopeless. - Yeah, Chance is not normal.

157
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,520
Excuse me~!

158
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,260
I wonder if he can get permission.

159
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,820
Ah, but this is fun!

160
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,590
When panicking he's capable of anything!

161
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,500
Chance is fully enjoying this variety shoot.

162
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,230
10 minutes pass without Shisyoh returning.

163
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,230
What is he doing?

164
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,100
Did Shisyoh get caught up in something? - Right ...

165
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,540
Maybe we should contact him.

166
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,810
Can you go check on him? - I'll go have a look.

167
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,680
Shisyoh's taking a long time.

168
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,180
This time ...

169
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,020
... the staff that's part of this shoot will also disappear one by one.

170
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,790
Scary!

171
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:55,360
We'll investigate how Chance will react once he's the only one left.

172
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,830
What's going on in there? - It's odd.

173
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,630
They're taking quite long, is it ok if we also go take a look? - Sure!

174
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,700
Please wait here a moment. - Will do!

175
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,410
And so the director & cameraman also head inside, completing our preparations.

176
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,570
All of them?!

177
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,280
5 minutes pass since he's been made to wait all by himself.

178
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,520
What will he do?

179
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,850
They're taking long! Maybe I should go?

180
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,260
Maybe they had their lights punched out by a dodgy employee.

181
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,960
Eh? Maybe that Chinese restaurant ...

182
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,160
"punched their lights out"?

183
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,300
... is a front for organized crime?

184
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,000
Do Chinese restaurants like that even exist?!

185
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,000
But there's no way the very first restaurant ...

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,570
... in a shopping district in Gotokuji would be a shady place.

187
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,410
Well said!

188
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,480
As no one returns from the restaurant ...

189
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,720
... he theorizes that this hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant is involved in organized crime.

190
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,120
I've never heard anyone say that! - Now he's eavesdropping.

191
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,460
He listens closely to get a feel for the situation inside.

192
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,560
What should I do ...

193
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,760
He won't go in?

194
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,100
Ah this is scary, what should I do ...

195
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,730
No choice but to go inside!

196
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,770
He can't bring himself to open the door.

197
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,210
And so, Chance, unable to muster the courage to go inside, ...

198
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,210
Seriously?

199
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,910
... buys tea from a convenience store ...

200
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,910
Eh, why? - Why would he ... ?

201
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,520
... and bread from a nearby bakery.

202
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,820
Scary, scary, scary!

203
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,820
He opens the door just a little to get a glimpse of the inside.

204
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,120
What's he doing?!

205
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,030
This is scary ... super scary!

206
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,560
I told you Chance is not normal!

207
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,030
You're the scary one here!

208
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:48,340
He walks up and down in front of the store to get his thoughts in order.

209
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,740
Finally ...

210
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,380
Alright, I'll go.

211
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,380
I'm prepared for the worst.

212
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,480
You've gotta go!
- Yeah, something clearly happened in there.

213
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,530
Everything in disorder.

214
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,730
This is so scary ...

215
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,410
This time the owner of the restaurant won't even show himself.

216
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,740
Ah, there was definitely a scuffle here ...

217
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,610
There was definitely- UWAAH!

218
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,550
That sure is scary.

219
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,320
Shisyoh ...

220
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,390
And then ...

221
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,390
Move the chair at least!

222
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,470
Shisyoh?

223
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,470
Ah, he's going!

224
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,240
Shisyoh?

225
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,540
Shisyoh!! What happened?!

226
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,110
Surely you can tell what happened.

227
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,740
Eh?! Who did this?!

228
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,850
He still can't tell?

229
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,050
Are you ... are you alright?!

230
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,550
Was it ... an employee here?

231
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:14,960
Thank goodness! I was so scared, I was sure you'd gotten involved with someone shady!

232
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,920
I mean surely you can figure it out by now!

233
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,660
Who did this to you? The owner?

234
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,130
He thinks this is organized crime after all.

235
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,330
Where did he go?

236
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,700
Aaaah, no way! WAIT!

237
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,370
I GOT IT! I GOT IT, ALRIGHT?! JUST WAIT!

238
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,040
JUST WAIT! WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT!

239
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,480
WAIT A SECOND! JUST WAIT!

240
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,640
He's taking out money!

241
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,850
IT'S ALL OK, JUST WAIT!

242
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,610
Money?!

243
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,680
I GOT IT! JUST WAIT!

244
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,390
He laid out money!

245
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,650
7000 yen! I counted 7!

246
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,390
Why 7000 yen?!

247
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,020
What are you doing?

248
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,030
That's just a bit over 1000 yen per person!

249
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,030
I'M SO SORRY! We were just filming!

250
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,860
But I'm ... I'm really sorry! I am!

251
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,530
Were they rude to you?

252
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,330
I'm sorry! NO WAIT! PLEASE JUST WAIT!

253
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,040
Please wait! I have someone I love!

254
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,810
A girl I want to confess to! Please wait!!

255
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,380
I've never even been to an amusement park!

256
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,780
I'm begging you, wait, please!

257
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,150
At this point we reveal everything.

258
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,380
He wants to go to an amusement park! - What should he wait for, seriously?!

259
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,820
But he wants to go to an amusement park!
- With the girl he loves!

260
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,220
I simply thought I had no choice but to go inside!

261
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,060
You say that, but you couldn't bring yourself to do it for the longest time! - It was scary!

262
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,060
I thought I was going to get stabbed!

263
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,400
I thought this was it for me. My life would end here.

264
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,930
I thought "So this is how it ends".

265
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,440
"At last they put me on TV more and then I get killed"

266
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,040
That's just my life, I guess.

267
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,510
By the way, the girl Chance wanted to confess to is the 3 o'clock heroine, Yumecchi.
