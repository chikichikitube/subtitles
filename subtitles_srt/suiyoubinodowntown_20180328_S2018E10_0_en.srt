WDT Project

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,470
When we sit here together like this,it means it has started again

5
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,150
It seems the period for it has come around again

6
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,150
Yeah,yeah

7
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,150
It seems to be of no advantage to us when we end up mixing with that person

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,830
Apparently he came just for this

9
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,830
Is that the case?

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,170
Whether he comes via shinkansen or planes, I'm not really sure

11
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,080
Just pay your own way here

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,860
If they paid their own way here, it would be acceptable

13
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,240
In fact, just don't come

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Yeah, don't even come

15
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,970
Hey you guys...

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,000
What, what, what

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,350
That was a very slow revolution this time around

18
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,320
Who decided to make it turn anyways?

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,360
We don't know, probably someone from above

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,400
Whatever Hamada-san says, the programme will make arrangements for it so...

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,880
EH?! Was that how it goes?

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,600
We were waiting for it to turn

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,080
That is indeed the case

24
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,370
Well, this spring

25
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,950
Wednesday's Downtown

26
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,730
4th year running

27
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,010
Congratulations

28
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,500
This episode, certain theories from past episodes

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,400
is what I have brought forth today

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,620
Here it is:

31
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,620
Theory: Wednesday's Downtown quite often starts with a theory and ends with quite an unrelated turnabout

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,040
I see

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,390
Ah, that seems plausible

34
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,950
Yeah, yeah

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,680
It does happen

36
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,170
Like you run into something more interesting along the way

37
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,170
Yes, well said

38
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,600
But as this show's main MCs

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,620
In the end, the orange resulting conclusion turns up doesn't it?

40
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,880
Taking a gander from just that

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,610
The beginning theory

42
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,400
If it was the two of you, you be able to tell which initial theory it was

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,380
Not so sure about that....

44
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,750
I would like to take a small objection about this..

45
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,750
What is it?

46
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,490
You said Programme's MC but in actuality, I'm not really casted as one

47
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,390
I see, but Hamada-san is actually an MC though

48
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,060
Hamada-san should definitely know since he is the MC

49
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,700
But the main attention is normally over there where the panelists are

50
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,030
All I really do is scream "'kay 'kay"

51
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,960
Your job can't possibly be just to say "'kay 'kay"

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,910
"'kay 'kay, Take it away" is what I usually do

53
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,900
Now, let's begin the theory guessing quiz

54
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,940
Both of you together

55
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,120
How well do you really remember?

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,850
How much of it do you remember?

57
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,980
Let's go with this initial theory resolution

58
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,020
I present to you

59
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,320
Conclusion: Kuro-chan is a liar

60
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,130
So what was the beginning theory to end like this?

61
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,870
Eh? The beginning theory was way different?

62
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,490
Yes, the beginning and the way it concludes is different

63
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,600
But this is from when we first found out that Kuro-chan is a liar

64
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,170
Wasn't it that?

65
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,670
Pigeons...

66
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,840
The one when we release the pigeons or something like that

67
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,170
And Kuro-chan has to make it all the way back

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
Yes, yes, yes, during that time

69
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,410
Well, no, that's not correct

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,960
The one where shit was stuck on him

71
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,960
Wrong

72
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,270
Not even close

73
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,830
Eh? Wait, really? This is too hard

74
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,830
If it continues like this, this is...

75
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,730
It was a surprise prank

76
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,080
It was one of those Dokkiri-style theories Hamada-san loves

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,590
During the viewing, Hamada-san was cackling away

78
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,200
It might be?

79
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,770
One of those 'XXX is the scariest' theories

80
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,630
'XXX is the scariest after all', which one?

81
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,630
Most scary...

82
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,900
In the house

83
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,520
Theory: 'Returning to your home where there is a stranger waiting' is the most scariest theory

84
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,490
Ahhh, It's not that one

85
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,720
Can I bring up something?

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,020
I have no recollection of it

87
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,710
Hamada is absolutely no good

88
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,970
He is not saying anything

89
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,330
He doesn't even remember which possibilities to even guess

90
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,330
When you guys were recollecting,nothing came up for me

91
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,650
'What are you guys talking about?' was what I thought

92
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,800
Kuro-chan is a liar

93
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,990
The beginning theory was:

94
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,330
Theory: 'When you awake and there's someone beside you' is the most scary theory

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,450
Whether the situation of 'When you awake and there's someone beside you' is really the scariest

96
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,020
In several comedians' homes, we planted a strange old man and waited for them to wake

97
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,540
It was the most terrifying

98
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,090
The last to be targeted was Kuro-chan

99
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,200
This guy again

100
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,530
He's here

101
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,530
This is gonna be good

102
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,140
While he is away , we have begun planting the hidden cameras

103
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,280
They should be very well acquainted with this room already

104
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,450
I am walkshing back to my home

105
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,280
"Walkshing back"

106
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,170
As always, Kuro-chan announces his activities on Twitter

107
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,060
"Walkshing back"

108
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,090
In accordance to his actions, we are on standby

109
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,730
His alibi/whereabouts is SO out there

110
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,120
From Shinjuku to my home is a bit far, I am going to do my best-shinyoo

111
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,950
What the heck is he talking about?

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,520
From Shinjuku to Shinagawa, if one were to walk, it would take around 2 hours

113
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,980
That's quite far

114
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,210
It is time. The staff await outside for Kuro-chan.

115
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,860
After waiting around for 30 minutes,

116
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,800
That's a taxi?!

117
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,130
What's up with that?

118
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,350
A taxi has stopped in front of Kuro-chan's home

119
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,130
Is this for real?

120
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,390
Just in case, the staff hide

121
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,800
As it turns out, the one who stepped out of the taxi is

122
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,180
Kuro-chan

123
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,600
Wa, scary

124
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,830
Ah, so he lied

125
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,990
A mystery remains as to why he needed to claim that he walked back home

126
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,370
What was that lie even for?

127
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,870
We were close to running into him at his home

128
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,950
The same goes for exposing his lie right now

129
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,780
After he reached home, the tweet that he composed was

130
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,260
He's actually writing one

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,570
Soon, I will be reaching home.
My head is filled with the melody of Sarai.

132
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,850
Whose sake is he even lying for?

133
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,310
Scary

134
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,590
A Tweet formed by pretense and malice intent

135
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,020
Our cameras have full footage of the entire on-goings

136
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,560
What a thing they have managed to capture

137
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,860
This is awful

138
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,750
And its now 1 am

139
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,860
In a certain sort of way, he's amazing

140
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,200
They shot a completely different thing

141
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,940
For some reason, he is going through his mail in full nude

142
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,860
No way!?!

143
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,510
Scary

144
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,000
Disgusting

145
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,840
The next day he has work starting early in the morning yet...

146
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,860
He seems to have no intention of sleeping

147
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,430
In that case, just go outside and walk

148
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,860
And next,

149
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,750
Chinsuko

150
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,570
Chinsuko!

151
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,970
He's eating chinsuko

152
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,440
unexpectedly

153
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,440
You going to eat?!?!

154
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,310
Chinsuko Squat

155
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,730
Whether he intents to lose or gain weight, its hard to tell

156
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,420
Chinsuko Squat

157
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,600
Next, he raises his iron dumbbell up and..

158
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,800
A selfie?

159
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,800
He's going to take a picture

160
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,720
Since I can't sleep, I am doing muscle training-shin

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
What was that about?

162
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,320
But, the iron dumbbell is soon

163
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,330
placed back into its initial position once the picture has been taken

164
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,410
Just stop this already

165
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,410
Just stop this trainwreck already

166
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,550
At this point, he has finally made his last lying tweet of the day and heads towards slumber

167
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,120
The main act is from here onwards, wasn't it?

168
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,930
He goes to sleep with the lights and TV still on

169
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,680
From herein out

170
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,930
With that being the case

171
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,040
Ehhh.. he leaves his things like that before sleeping?

172
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,450
We were indeed distracted, finally we return to observe our theory

173
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,180
He did leave it in that messy state

174
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,220
In the end

175
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,270
Scary, scary, this is going to be frightening

176
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,800
He's waking up

177
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,320
Ah this is terrifying

178
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,400
They finally met eye to eye

179
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,660
Eh? Eh? Eh? What's this?

180
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,330
Eh?

181
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,080
That burping got to me

182
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,480
Something weird came out of his mouth, how distasteful

183
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,760
How was it?

184
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,860
About what?

185
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,160
How was it?

186
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,160
About what exactly?

187
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,560
Eh? Wait a minute...

188
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,530
Ehh What is this precisely about?

189
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,020
We have already grown accustomed to his reaction due to seeing it like 100 times

190
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,910
We decided to ask about the other thing which really interested us

191
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,320
That was indeed tough

192
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,450
We looked up your Twitter account and was piqued by

193
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,910
You mentioned that you walked back home to your home from Shinjuku Station?

194
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,160
Look at those eyes

195
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,610
Yes

196
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,300
You brought up the fact that you were going back home!

197
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,400
Don't bring it up

198
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,200
You didn't actually walk back, did you?

199
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,170
Ah, give me a moment, my piss is coming out

200
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,360
What did you mean you pissed yourself?

201
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,710
You didn't walk back home, did you?

202
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,340
Eh? What do you mean? I totally walked back

203
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,680
You returned via taxi, didn't you?

204
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,840
That's a bad face he's making right now

205
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,720
That's definitely a villain's face

206
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,720
Indeed

207
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,820
Just give me a second, erm...

208
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,320
Such things happen too

209
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,150
We were watching

210
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,820
eh.

211
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,030
It's not a lie but...

212
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,860
Your lies are too conspicious

213
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,860
You're mistaking me

214
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,960
It was a play,play wasn't the word I am looking for,how did I explain myself clearly?

215
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,570
Do you at least acknowledge the fact that you did not walk back home?

216
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,400
What do you mean by acknowledging the fact?

217
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,970
I'm not lying

218
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,940
Ah I understand now, it's okay

219
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,570
We have footage of you leaving the taxi anyway

220
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,780
So as it turns out, Kuro-chan is a liar

221
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,320
By some mishap, we happen to chance upon Kuro-chan making up multiple lies on Twitter

222
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,460
The following series which features Kuro-chan

223
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,790
This was the origin and inspiration of it all

224
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,200
Let's go into the next question with enthusiasm

225
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,790
Next, is this

226
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,100
It turned out to be a wig

227
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,510
Eh, what's up with the ending

228
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,530
This might be quite difficult

229
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,770
Wasn't this about the old guy being interviewed and the ..?

230
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,240
It's not concerning an old guy

231
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,750
The opener to this ending was:

232
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:34,750
Theory: Impossible to find a forehead that is narrower than Hirukawa's in the world

233
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:41,090
What we were looking for was a forehead shorter than 2.5 length to the eyebrows

234
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,400
Does someone really exist which has a shorter forehead length?

235
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,600
In the process of searching for someone...

236
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,940
We found someone in Osaka

237
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,010
Are you shopping?

238
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,440
I'm returning from work

239
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,440
Ah, returning from work?

240
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,380
Near the end of May....

241
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,800
Everywhere you look, hippopotamus teeth

242
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,690
A small-forehead woman has appeared, but is more than we hoped for

243
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,370
That is really something

244
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,510
That's one in a million

245
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,200
Which feature do people notice?

246
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,310
For real

247
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,140
What would you say your most distinguishing feature is?

248
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,140
I wonder...

249
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,240
I don't want to seem like a lame old person, so I try to stay hip

250
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,980
She seems to think we were asking about her outfit

251
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,980
We're looking for the narrowest forehead in Japan

252
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,920
If that's the case, I'll slide this back a little

253
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,770
It's moving?

254
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,770
It's sliding!

255
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,390
This is it

256
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,660
Well, that's...

257
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,590
Huh?

258
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,540
Oh no

259
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,390
Is it a wig?

260
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,600
It's a wig. This is my real forehead, though.

261
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,940
That's still halfway down though

262
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,170
It was a wig

263
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,480
What is this?

264
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,810
Continuing on

265
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,010
Chiba is getting some on the side

266
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,680
The theory that gave birth to this somewhat different result

267
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,810
That is

268
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,320
Theory: "If you spilled tea at a Yazawa fan's house, they would never dry it with a Yazawa towel"

269
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,960
On this crazy Yazawa fan's way home

270
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,290
We tried our experiment of intentionally spilling tea

271
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,630
And finally we interviewed him

272
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,900
My phone number is also Yazawa

273
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,700
If you take the last 4 numbers

274
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,540
"8-3-0" can be read as "ya-za-wa"

275
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,080
He's fixated on 830

276
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,340
But "8-7-4" is a more accurate number for the 50 year old fan*

277
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:49,020
*"8-7-4" can be read to sound like "has no teeth"

278
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,150
Hey!

279
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,860
So true

280
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,310
A Yazawa fan for 38 years

281
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,880
That's just

282
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,270
What are you even saying?

283
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,020
A toothless man with loads of merchandise

284
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,570
That's awful

285
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,340
He doesn't have any friends, does he?

286
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,120
When we asked to take a look

287
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,540
That's so lame

288
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,130
I actually have another place

289
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,690
Oh?

290
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,460
I'll show you the way

291
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,300
It's just for your merchandise?

292
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
He's having a laugh

293
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,300
It's just for merch

294
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Wow, amazing

295
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,700
I rent it just for that

296
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,400
Don't you have other expenses?

297
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,170
That's why I rent the room secretly

298
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,710
Is it okay for your wife to know this?

299
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,710
It's fine

300
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,810
So, we went to the room secret even to his wife

301
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
Ah, it's like that

302
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,550
This is my other place

303
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,520
Amazing

304
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,720
Could we see inside?

305
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,320
Already you can get a feeling

306
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,710
No way

307
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,120
Right as you enter, even

308
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,190
I made this actually.
You made this?
Yes

309
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,190
He made it

310
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,650
That's cute

311
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,260
But before the Yazawa love can flow

312
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,050
So cute

313
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,470
Hey Chiba-san

314
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,400
Are you messing around?

315
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,640
No that's not it, this is

316
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,510
Well... I just kinda stuck some stuff and...

317
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,780
What was that?

318
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,960
No no no no no

319
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm not messing around, nope nope nope

320
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,760
You looked guilty as hell saying that just now

321
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,850
What?

322
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,250
The confusion on his face is obvious

323
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,390
The marks of a woman are even more obvious

324
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,320
On top of that

325
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,760
You've got Snoopy

326
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,760
Well, you see that's

327
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,230
It's cute. An awfully feminine design don't you think?

328
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,430
It could have been a present

329
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,030
That's bad news

330
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,520
While we're on the topic

331
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,630
Seriously?

332
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,760
That curtain earlier

333
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,060
Oh yeah

334
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,470
Can't possibly be homemade

335
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,070
Wow, this is incredible!

336
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,670
This is seriously cool

337
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,810
This is my pride

338
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,710
So, how much is the rent for this place?

339
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,850
About 70,000 yen

340
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,050
That's not cheap

341
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,450
Is someone splitting the rent?

342
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,620
Why would you ask that?

343
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,990
And things like this were slipped in with the merch

344
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,090
Chiba-san, is this your handwriting?

345
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,330
Ah. Yes this is my writing, of course.

346
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,570
An itinerary for a live show at Budokan is written on the white board

347
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,170
This is too muc- huh?

348
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,940
But this handwriting is crazy suspicious

349
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,910
That's weird

350
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,680
For some reason, even Christmas plans are included

351
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,710
You really did right this, then?

352
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,250
What were you feeling when you drew this?

353
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,690
"Let's go to Budokan~♥"

354
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,450
I'll write it now

355
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,720
What a weird stroke order

356
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,290
Why is he writing like that?

357
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,160
A super weird stroke order

358
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,290
What is this?

359
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,900
That's amazing

360
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,020
It's like he's painting

361
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,580
What now?

362
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,400
Where's the other half?

363
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,140
Ah, that's wrong

364
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,900
No good

365
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:26,010
Chiba is getting some on the side

366
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,000
That totally didn't match the theory

367
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,000
That was exhausting

368
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
It really was exhausting, I mean...

369
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,850
Moving on, let's try to answer the question

370
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,850
Wasn't that enough?

371
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,350
Our next theory

372
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,420
He couldn't beat a demon without a pheasant

373
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Oh, I think I know this one

374
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,680
You know this one?

375
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,920
Wait really?

376
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,040
Could Momotaro really rely

377
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,730
Go on

378
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,280
On the dog, monkey, and pheasant to actually help?

379
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,920
Well, you're a little mixed up

380
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,110
Should I try saying that again?

381
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,110
Yes, one more time

382
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,850
Once more- Hamada, you haven't said a damn thing

383
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,530
What's that about?

384
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,880
I don't know a single one of these things

385
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,880
You're always here, though

386
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,390
You can't tame dogs, monkeys, or pheasants with dumplings

387
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,520
First is the dog

388
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,660
Here

389
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,520
Do you want it?

390
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,520
He's taking it

391
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:25,100
Dogs are omnivorous, so it makes sense

392
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,800
He ate it

393
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,100
He's hungry

394
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,210
He cautiously accepts the dumpling

395
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,740
Where's he going?

396
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:34,250
But because it's hot, he takes it to the shade to eat

397
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,880
Then, he somehow recruits a monkey

398
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,370
Do you want a dumpling?

399
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,060
The pheasant won't be won over

400
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,530
Momotaro, with just his dog and monkey, set out for the Island of Demons

401
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,010
I've come to defend the peace!

402
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,110
Come on out, demons!

403
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,550
And then

404
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,880
Oh it's Kukki!

405
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,890
What happened?

406
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,720
What's going on?

407
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,590
Kuu-chan?

408
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,530
Scram

409
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,540
Get out of here

410
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,400
Hold on

411
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,210
The monkey ran away

412
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,270
They just left him there

413
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,680
People with freaking Shonan license plates

414
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,150
Ain't going to impress no one in Yokohama

415
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,820
He couldn't beat a demon without a pheasant

416
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,820
What kind of ending is that?

417
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,460
Actually I was pretty close to the actual theory

418
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,460
You were pretty close

419
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,130
Isn't this guy the worst?

420
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,100
Hamada, at least pay attention. Just focus.

421
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,200
What is going on with you?

422
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,930
Well if you're sitting here thinking of things to say every time, you'll remember

423
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,840
No no no no

424
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,840
I'm always left over there, you know

425
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,620
All I ever do is say "Welcome!!"

426
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,750
Well, Hamada

427
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,720
You sound so proud to be completely neglecting your job

428
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,780
What do you think you get paid for?

429
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,270
Don't just repeat yourself

430
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,820
I wasn't

431
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,360
Please teach me to negotiate a job

432
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,500
Noooooo way

433
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,100
That's a sweet deal

434
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,990
Please pay attention, Hamada, just once

435
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,230
Switching the entrance and exit theory, continued

436
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,640
Theory: "The youngest and oldest are evenly matched"

437
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:49,480
This theory tests what happens when you pit the youngest and oldest athletes against each other in various events

438
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,550
First up is Judo

439
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,050
Representing the oldest

440
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,160
Tadayuki Morimoto, 84 year old ranked 8-dan

441
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,540
Wow

442
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,710
That's impressive

443
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,130
Representing the youngest

444
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,570
Yeah, but

445
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,800
A 5 year old studying Judo in Kumakogen, Toki Sasaki

446
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,140
As expected, this is the ultimate age difference

447
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,640
Really?

448
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,510
The match is beginning

449
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,980
Ah it's starting

450
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,810
He doesn't like this at all

451
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,810
He doesn't look happy

452
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,950
Does your tummy hurt?

453
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,050
Does his tummy hurt?

454
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,050
He doesn't feel good

455
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,770
What's this? Young Toki is holding his stomach and leaving the ring!

456
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,520
Maybe he needs to pee?

457
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,540
What? Is something wrong?

458
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,820
What happened?

459
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,330
Before the match can start, Toki leaves to go to his family

460
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,480
Why?

461
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,740
Why?

462
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,800
He suddenly begins to cry

463
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,270
You're kidding

464
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,110
Fighting an old man he doesn't know is scary

465
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,110
Oh, he's a stranger

466
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,140
It's because he's a stranger

467
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,990
That's so sad, though

468
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,520
At this point, Morimoto approaches the staff

469
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,410
He's going to talk to him

470
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,570
He's describing it so dramatically

471
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,450
Look, he's a 5 year old kid

472
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,290
You shouldn't be making fun of his judo

473
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,260
He's pissed

474
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,390
You're doing all of this to show on a variety show

475
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,560
I see what you're going for

476
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,710
Oh he's super pissed

477
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,330
But this really goes against the spirit of judo

478
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,320
Fair enough

479
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,530
He hasn't had any time to learn

480
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,070
But I've been doing this for 64 years

481
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,770
Yes

482
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,970
Making a kid fight me after just 6 months is impossible

483
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,620
Right

484
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,080
He got crazy angry with us

485
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,080
Obviously

486
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,010
So this match ends with forfeit

487
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,950
Oh I see

488
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,010
Are you done?

489
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,920
A few days later, we brought him back with a different opponent

490
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,690
Wait, he's doing it now?

491
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,320
He came back

492
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,710
This time, the opponent is just old enough to compete nationally

493
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,670
Interesting

494
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,190
Way different

495
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,990
This is something

496
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,130
Kanagawa 5th grader Koshiro Sanada

497
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,200
Oh no

498
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,420
This...

499
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,070
He's much better qualified

500
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:52,470
Morimoto shouldn't have any issues taking him on

501
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,470
He should be fine

502
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,040
Sorry for calling you here a second time

503
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,040
It's fine

504
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,710
Well, he came didn't he?

505
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,270
I didn't think you would, though

506
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,140
He was really mad, though

507
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,270
I won't give up

508
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,510
That's all I'll say about it

509
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,580
Really?

510
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,980
You aren't giving up?

511
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,580
Really

512
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,980
I won't give up

513
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,720
He'll have to retire

514
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,820
Which basically means I'll lose

515
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,820
I see

516
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,120
At last the match starts

517
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,790
I don't like this, regardless of what happens

518
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,490
Actually, Sanada-kun is a powerful figure getting 2nd place in the national tournament at age 11

519
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,670
On the other hand, Morimoto at 84 years old

520
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,100
won his gold medal 8 times at the World Masters

521
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,740
Who will win is totally unpredictable

522
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:34,040
Well, this kid seems pretty strong

523
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,140
Start!

524
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,580
The match starts

525
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,080
First, Sanada circles in from the right

526
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,080
There it is

527
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,820
There is a physical size difference,

528
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,220
but Sanada-kun is not shy of strength, even for adults

529
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,460
Wow, this is really like a normal match

530
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,590
Good, good

531
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,500
Sanada, who has brought down 100 kg opponents at Nationals,

532
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,470
That's pretty amazing then

533
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,100
That's it

534
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,640
versus the 84-year old Masters gold medalist Morimoto!

535
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,600
Amazing

536
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,170
Release!

537
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,010
Gramps, don't give up!

538
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,010
Keep it up, grandpa!

539
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,680
Morimoto who said he will not be thrown

540
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,310
Gramps is getting tired

541
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,020
This match may turn around at any second

542
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,180
This is really about stamina

543
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,180
This is an interesting matchup

544
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,120
He's staggering

545
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,190
If he gets thrown..

546
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,960
In terms of stamina, at 84 years old, Morimoto is at a considerable disadvantage

547
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,560
Thought so

548
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,660
Doesn't have much strength

549
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,930
Right, if it takes a long time

550
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,090
He can't do it

551
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,700
And afterwards, as the two fighters grapple

552
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,000
the match shows some movement

553
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,180
Morimoto falls! will he get pinned?

554
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,480
And Sanada does the reverse scarf hold!

555
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,210
Sanada, who was taken down

556
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,180
Pins down his opponent!

557
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,150
Morimoto is pinned!

558
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,650
I give up

559
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,990
Suddenly the oldest, Morimoto, has given up!

560
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,700
With this, Sanada, the youngest, has won the match by ippon with a reverse scarf hold!

561
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,560
Wonderful!

562
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,300
That was a great match

563
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,300
That was really something

564
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,840
For me, it's not really about winning

565
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,040
Oh really?

566
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,110
If the kid can make progress from here on out

567
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,310
there's value in being present and competing

568
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,880
it doesn't matter whether I win or lose

569
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:21,190
So, the result was "doesn't matter whether I win or lose"

570
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:28,530
And, there was one more judo plan with a different beginning and end

571
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,530
Theory: "Giant Shirota and Shinichi Shinohara are almost identical so they'll have a par match"

572
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,700
This match stems from just finding

573
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,710
their specialties based on similar appearances

574
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,280
A memorable moment in our first mixed-rule showdown

575
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,280
Competitive Eating Judo

576
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,950
The rules are

577
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:01,560
1 minute and 30 seconds each of competitive eating and judo, 3 rounds each, for a total of 6 rounds

578
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,960
The one with the most full points is the winner

579
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,230
By the way, in judo ippon is 1 full point

580
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,840
And in competitive eating, one makizushi roll will count as one full point

581
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:19,510
In this match we can get an idea of their strength in their specialties

582
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,850
At the end of round 2 there was only a gap of 1 point making it a tight game

583
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:31,120
And the last round begins with the competitive eating block, the opener to the judo

584
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,760
Uh-oh, this is not the time you want to eat

585
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,220
They really don't want to eat

586
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,260
Oh no, they're really thirsty too

587
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,100
Will Shirota pull away again?

588
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,100
Will Shinohara be able to eat?

589
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,330
They've become unable to eat huh?

590
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,740
Shirota really needs to make up the points

591
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,370
Start!

592
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,240
Eat, eat!

593
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,710
The referee prompts them once again

594
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,710
Shirota's not having anything

595
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,210
Barley tea in one hand, unable to move!

596
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,010
You'll lose!

597
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,110
If you don't eat you'll lose!

598
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,110
No, no, no!

599
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,450
Shirota, are you all right?

600
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,520
Just...

601
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,020
I'm kind of out of breath

602
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,260
Finally both fighters have reached for the makizushi!

603
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,360
It would be bad if he doesn't have at least one

604
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,230
Since there's no way Shirota can get a point in judo

605
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,170
Shirota crams down a makizushi!

606
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,970
He gets one makizushi down!

607
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,070
He needs to make it up here

608
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,440
Uh oh, it seems like he's having difficulty swallowing!

609
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,840
It'd be funny if he got a point in judo

610
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,110
He needs a 5 point difference

611
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,350
We've never seen Shirota like this!

612
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,010
This is intense!

613
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,880
You won't have time!

614
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,350
On the other hand Shinohara!

615
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,520
Can't eat either!

616
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,960
In this one-and-a-half minute round, each of them

617
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,430
have a normal meal of 2 and 1 makizushi respectively

618
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,960
It's a normal meal!

619
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,430
This is not good

620
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,430
and the final eating round ends

621
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,430
Just two!

622
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,500
Their point difference is two. Can Shirota make a clean break?

623
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,310
Shinohara's stamina has run out

624
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,910
This is the last duel!

625
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,210
Shirota, go get him!!

626
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,840
Shinohara didn't do anything but he got a full point!

627
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,810
A very important point!

628
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,280
The rest is abysmal. Shirota has 1 min 20 sec

629
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,480
This is interesting!

630
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,620
Another point!

631
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,790
one minute left!

632
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:14,260
With no other choice, Shirota has to win this point!

633
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,020
run away!

634
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,060
You can do it!!

635
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,890
Come on!!

636
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,300
He drags around!

637
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,260
He won!

638
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,130
Shinohara wins this showdown!

639
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,640
Start!

640
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:32,510
Therefore, "One can't eat right after exercising"

641
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,350
I can do one more!

642
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,350
There's more!?

643
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,980
We're gonna keep going

644
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,980
This is plenty enough

645
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,080
This one!

646
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,650
Please do your job

647
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,890
"It turned into an uncharacteristically wholesome plan"

648
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,960
What is this one?

649
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,060
This one's pretty hard

650
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,990
Not ringing any bells?

651
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,160
Here I go!

652
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,160
This program

653
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,030
doesn't ever get wholesome

654
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,030
It does, here and there

655
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,170
Here is the answer.

656
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,270
Theory: "Professionals impersonating teachers will have students die of laughter!"

657
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,110
Oh, this one!

658
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,040
This was a good plan

659
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,040
Yes, it was

660
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:12,380
This theory turned unintentionally heartful:

661
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,950
The setting was:

662
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,390
Fuji Gakuen Middle School in Yamanashi prefecture.

663
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:25,530
And these are the pros in charge of the teachers impressions!

664
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,760
That lineup is surely something!

665
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:34,810
The pros visited the school in order to gather information about the teachers

666
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:41,140
First, when inquiring some of the school alumni:

667
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,980
Oh I see

668
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,980
There's this teacher, called Oomori sensei

669
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,180
What's his subject?

670
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,880
Science

671
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,620
When he gets mad, he gets like super agitated

672
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,860
An goes like this

673
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,360
All they way up, suddenly?

674
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,360
That's right. His intonation too.

675
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:00,060
Next, the pros will watch the lessons live

676
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,400
So you understand that "other" is singular, right?

677
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,170
She raises her tone at the end like "NE"

678
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,040
She talks quickly, and then "NE"

679
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,570
As if she were following a rhythm

680
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,310
Oh, like this

681
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,880
Wow, look at the chalk

682
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,780
This can be funny

683
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
This might be possible, right?

684
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,080
Yeah

685
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,520
Also...

686
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,150
Come in

687
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,050
So, the teachers came too

688
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,560
Hello!

689
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,330
The pros will meet the teachers firsthand

690
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,230
Oota sensei, you seem like a very serious teacher

691
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,470
Do you ever laugh out loud?

692
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,940
Well, not really...

693
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,570
What's the funniest thing you last at recently?

694
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:54,920
Well, after gathering gathering info about the teachers, we head back to TBS

695
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:02,160
They are joined by the two that were unavailable, and discuss

696
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,130
What should we do?

697
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,330
Shall we decide who is going to wear a disguise?

698
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,840
Let's see first... who can get the main roles

699
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,840
Right

700
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,140
That looks so hard

701
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:21,550
Depending on the looks, voice tone and such, each pro was assigned a teacher

702
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:28,750
Kannatsuki will impersonate the eccentric Yamaguchi sensei, ex- member of a "poop seminar"

703
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:34,690
Also, "bad diction" Oomori sensei, will be impersonated by Hori

704
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:41,200
Mikan will impersonate Ebara sensei, who can't stop saying "Who can try?"

705
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,840
The serious but also good at dancing Oota sensei will be impersonated by Ehara

706
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:55,110
And Mirakuru will be in charge of Nakayama sensei, who hisses after finishing her sentences

707
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:05,490
"Denture" Kanekatsu sensei and "Bald gag" Okuwaki sensei will also appear during the show

708
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,490
Looks like a medley

709
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,960
How did it turn out?

710
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,070
The clueless students are gathered in the multi-purpose hall

711
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,600
And then...

712
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,010
These days you've all been slacking off!

713
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,940
That is why you're all here

714
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,010
There's a teacher that has something to say to all of you

715
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,780
Us teachers have been holding back!

716
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:38,460
The students, after being fooled to believe they were being scolded, will meet the impersonators!

717
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,990
Every teacher is each

718
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,690
going to have a few words

719
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,630
with all of you here

720
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,170
Hello

721
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,780
After the unexpected appearance, they still don't know what happened

722
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,040
It was like: "what's going on?"

723
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,380
Wait, this guy looks a lot like me!

724
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,380
Who are you?

725
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,380
No, who are YOU?

726
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,280
I'm Yamaguchi!

727
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,280
I AM Yamaguchi

728
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,450
No, I'M YAMAGUCHI

729
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,050
I'm Yamaguchi

730
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:13,120
If you really are Yamaguchi, tell me. You were in a seminar back in college, right?

731
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,260
Which seminar?

732
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,360
Turd seminar

733
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,360
A turd seminar!

734
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,500
They're laughing a lot!

735
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,800
The real Yamaguchi has eaten bugs right? Which insect did you eat?

736
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,370
A stink bug

737
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,370
A stink bug!!

738
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,810
After realizing what's going on... they burst out laughing

739
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,440
They find it hilarious

740
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,310
And then...

741
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,610
There are many other teachers that are also angry!

742
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,910
Oomori sensei!

743
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,920
The resemblance is amazing

744
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,590
They achieved an amazing resemblance

745
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,760
One, two, three

746
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,130
Why the pinky, sensei?

747
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:58,100
So, I want you to remember the important things needed for a flower to blossom

748
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,900
There's one, two and three of them

749
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,140
Hey, sensei, that's weird... It's pretty strange

750
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,580
Stamen and pistil... Please remember that...

751
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,550
Remember that!!!

752
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,680
Remember that, I mean it!

753
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,690
You can remember it!

754
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,650
They find it hilarious!

755
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,620
Sensei

756
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,850
You all...

757
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,520
Your diction is terrible, so we have no idea what you're saying

758
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,360
My dihsshion?

759
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,190
We have no idea what you say when you get mad

760
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:28,430
Isn't there a teacher with a better diction in this school?

761
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,970
WOW, WOW

762
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,410
They're going "WOW"

763
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,210
Hi everyone

764
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,880
They really look alike

765
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,980
So the other day we left it at page twentyfiiiiiiive

766
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,350
We will continuuuuue...

767
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,290
Like a one line joke

768
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,520
They're laughing like hell!

769
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,590
They really are

770
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,730
When comparing "the other"

771
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,860
They're laughing their heads off

772
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,170
When comparing "the other" to..

773
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,070
... "the othersssh"

774
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,240
And then...

775
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,040
He appeared

776
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,150
They started laughing right after the entrance

777
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,620
What about the real person?

778
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,130
In spite of the circumstances, he remains expressionless

779
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,860
What the hell!

780
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,630
He's never laughed in his life

781
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,700
They're the same!

782
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,640
What's with your right hand, sensei?

783
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:47,680
Your right hand!

784
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,350
And your mouth? That's a duck face

785
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,520
The contrast is hilarious

786
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,250
I'll dance now

787
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,060
Apparently he dances for the school festival

788
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,390
And the last one to make entrance is...

789
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,140
They're really similar

790
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,100
Indeed

791
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,510
Today I'd like to talk about my favourite team: Nippon Ham

792
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,510
Ssss...

793
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,650
Dot, dot...

794
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,490
That's a lot of dots!! Too many of them!

795
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:33,690
Dot dot dotdotdotdot...

796
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,060
Ssssss

797
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,740
No one's saying it right...

798
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,470
Should we have Okuwaki sensei say it?

799
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,950
It's Baldiewaki!

800
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:00,780
And finally they will go for Kanekatsu sensei's motto: "Nice, nice!"

801
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,190
What do you think about the whole show?

802
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,690
It was... "nice, nice"!

803
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,760
"Nice, nice!"

804
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,630
I'm better at nicenicing!!

805
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,730
It's obvious I'm better!

806
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,700
I AM BETTER

807
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,360
I'm "nice,nice"!

808
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,700
Someone should decide who's the "nice, nicest"

809
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,870
Hey you, come here

810
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,610
Sensei, how was our impersonations?

811
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,750
"Nice, nice"!!

812
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,690
Thank you so much

813
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:42,060
And like that, the impersonation show achieves a huge success!

814
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,630
Were you surprised at the beginning?

815
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:47,100
You might've thought "What's going on?" or something

816
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,220
But then...

817
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,270
He's crying!

818
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,580
Why are you crying?

819
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,540
They're dying from laughter

820
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,320
They're literally dying from laughter

821
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,550
I don't know...

822
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,320
Is it because you're happy?

823
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,890
Why??

824
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,660
I don't really know

825
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,630
Is it that you are overflowed with joy?

826
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,000
I think he's just overflowed with joy

827
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,280
Don't you feel like really we accomplished?

828
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,280
Yes, I really do

829
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,010
First time feeling like this

830
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,850
The best in 10 years

831
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,750
I think we did really well

832
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,690
Students

833
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,850
Teachers

834
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,020
And also

835
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,160
The impersonators

836
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,860
Everyone was filled with joy and laughter

837
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,930
It surely was a great day

838
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,540
In a few words: it was an unexpectedly a heart-warming show

839
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,020
Next up,

840
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,530
"There are some weirdos in this world"

841
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,410
Which theory was the entry for this verification result?

842
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,900
People that get "Japanese style toilets" installed in a new construction is seriously next to 0.

843
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:07,130
So we did a survey amongs contractors that do toilet installation around the country.

844
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:12,550
We discovered a newly built home with a Japanese style toilet in Nara Prefecture.

845
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,550
It's in Kansai!

846
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,280
This surely looks like a home that fancies the "Japanese style"

847
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,920
Yeah pretty much

848
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,320
No way!

849
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:25,230
Could they really have installed a Japanese style toilet?

850
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,580
Definitely new!

851
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,580
This is dangerous

852
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,220
Beautiful

853
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,220
Newly built too

854
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,080
This is dangerous

855
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,250
We're with TBS Television.

856
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,250
Please come in.

857
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,180
"Please come in"

858
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,860
The husband didn't want to show their face on TV

859
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,860
Didn't want to?

860
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,520
We're immediately shown to the toilet in question.

861
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:41,910
TN: The sticker on his face says "Japanese Style".

862
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,010
I can't believe it.

863
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,720
It's on the second floor.

864
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,330
This is not good

865
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,900
On the second floor?

866
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,900
Yes.

867
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,100
This is a nice house.

868
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,700
Wow it's really Western-style!

869
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,300
In here.

870
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,020
No way! It's a Western-style door!

871
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,720
Tamura, ya fool!

872
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,720
NO WAY!

873
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,460
WOW!

874
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,740
WHY!?

875
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,580
They had one...

876
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,890
It's sparkling!

877
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,230
A super pretty Japanese style toilet.

878
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,730
It's really pretty too!

879
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,730
It is!

880
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,570
I can't believe it

881
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,480
It's beautiful

882
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,480
Still brand new!

883
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:07,100
However, why do they have one in the first place?

884
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,880
It's special

885
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,100
Right?

886
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,280
Yeah, the reason.

887
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,190
It's for a very surprising reason

888
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,190
They even have a freaking outlet in the back!

889
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,220
So why did you get a Japanese style toilet installed?

890
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,560
The hell does it say "Japanese style" on his face.

891
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,160
So, I have a son that's gonna be in high school

892
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,170
and he really insisted on getting one installed

893
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Why!?

894
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,780
My son yeah.

895
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,250
Like a manic.

896
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,740
Until the point of, if we don't get one I'm out of here.

897
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,620
What a strange guy.

898
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:34,200
Somehow, the "tradition" was strongly demanded by their high school son.

899
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,690
Why?

900
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,600
Why?

901
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,090
Really?

902
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,420
This is a real plot twist

903
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,600
Yuu?

904
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,020
Come down for a bit

905
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,140
So the son's face is good to show huh!?

906
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,220
Hunk

907
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:49,710
Their son. Yuuki, 15 years old.

908
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,920
He's handsome.

909
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,710
Yep

910
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,690
Why does it have to be Japanese style?

911
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,300
Well uh, there's always been one in the house since I was born

912
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,260
and I got so used to it that I can't use a western one.

913
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,450
You gotta try it!

914
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,490
You had one in the previous house?

915
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,490
That's right.

916
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,090
Doesn't it cause a lot of trouble?

917
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:09,500
Yeah, there aren't any if I go outside

918
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,330
Right

919
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,400
If I got to like department stores

920
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,270
So in times like that, it's kind of bothersome

921
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,860
So what do you do?

922
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,310
I just hold it in... earnestly

923
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,600
That can't be real.

924
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,380
When was the last time you went on a western style toilet?

925
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,250
I wonder. I just can't remember any time

926
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:32,450
We are used to the fact that, if a western one isn't available we go to the traditional one

927
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,450
Right

928
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:37,760
But for Yuuki, it's a firm rejection.

929
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,540
It's opposite

930
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,980
What's bad about them?

931
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,800
Does the family use it?

932
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,270
No one but myself no.

933
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,650
So it's only for you?

934
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,650
That's right.

935
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,820
They have another one!

936
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:49,040
It's only my room

937
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,370
It's downstairs

938
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,340
Have you ever used a washlet?*

939
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:57,010
*TN: An electronic toilet seat with bidet functions.

940
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,260
No I haven't.

941
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,250
You gotta try it!

942
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,010
Should we have you try it?

943
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,030
Alright, only one time.

944
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,700
And so, he enters the family toilet for the very first time.

945
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,740
His first wash toilet experience in life.

946
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,330
No, he's got to have done this before!

947
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,850
He has!

948
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,700
Sure enough

949
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,840
AGH!*

950
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:31,080
*TN: On wash toilets like these there's a bidet function that sprays water from a retracting arm inside the toilet.

951
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,840
That's just harsh

952
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,730
Stop pulling my leg!

953
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,280
OOGH!

954
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,610
Ouch ouch ouch!

955
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,960
Cause it's his first time!

956
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,560
He said "ouch".

957
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,080
How is it?

958
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,360
Unpleasant

959
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,450
Be careful with the pressure

960
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:40,180
In conclusion, "There are some weirdos in this world"

961
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,450
Gotta lower the pressure

962
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,410
Next up,

963
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,630
"The average grip strength of men in their 50s is 46kg."

964
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,970
Which theory was the entry for this verification result?

965
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,290
"The average grip strength of men in their 50s is 46kg."

966
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:12,990
Which theory was the entry for this verification result?

967
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,440
Theory: Hiroshi Itsuki has a strong grip

968
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,440
What kind of theory is this?!

969
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,340
This is just messing around

970
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,290
Enka singer Itsuki Hiroshi, gripping his fists for 45 years

971
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:27,840
Could his grip be stronger than the average male of the same age?

972
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,500
This is not what it's about

973
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,260
Yeah

974
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,360
But when we requested the person apperance

975
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,360
Right, they asked him

976
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,480
they naturally refused

977
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,170
Hello

978
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,890
A Hiroshi Itsuki look-alike

979
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,090
That's so unrelated

980
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,720
How long have you been impersonating Hiroshi Itsuki?

981
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,490
He does it well though

982
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,230
31 years this year.

983
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,460
Wow!

984
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,560
That's long for sure

985
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,180
He's been holding his fist for 31 years.

986
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:03,240
Does Itsuki Hiroshi's grip strength exceed 39.7 kg that of an ordinary male in their 60s?

987
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,770
Does he have to karaoke?

988
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:13,860
♫ Yokohama Twilight

989
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,320
♫ In a small room in a hotel

990
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,200
♫ The lingering scent of the kiss

991
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,940
♫ was the smoke of cigarettes

992
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,940
♫ Blues

993
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,420
Not yet

994
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,770
♫ Whistle

995
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,420
No

996
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
He's reaching the top now

997
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:43,220
♫ A woman's tears

998
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,640
It's coming!

999
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,220
This is it!

1000
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,810
♫ That person went and gone

1001
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,970
Oh he did it?

1002
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:54,020
♫ That person went and gone

1003
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,570
He shouldn't be holding it up like that

1004
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,570
right

1005
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:59,400
♫ I'm not coming home anymore

1006
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,700
He's really into it

1007
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,300
What about his grip strength?

1008
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,650
They made us listen quite a lot of that

1009
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:12,660
It was 41kg

1010
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,660
Right?

1011
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,630
It's over 39.7kg

1012
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:23,720
He slightly exceeded the average grip strength of an ordinary male in their 60s

1013
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,090
As expected, Itsuki-san.

1014
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,300
Your grip strength is stronger than average

1015
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,390
Oh really?

1016
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,390
Yes.

1017
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:35,330
The average grip strength of someone in their 60s is 39.7kg

1018
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,400
I just turned 56 years old...

1019
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,020
Say what?

1020
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:46,380
By the way, the average grip strength of men in their 50s is 46kg.

1021
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,380
What the hell?

1022
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,240
Onto the next one, the last.

1023
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,530
This one!

1024
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,380
"The result left a bad aftertaste"

1025
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,890
THAT'S ALL OF THEM!

1026
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,890
THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME!

1027
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,390
It's on all of them, all the time

1028
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:00,060
Come on, not all of them

1029
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,680
Not all of them are like this

1030
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,940
Today too!

1031
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,910
Now too

1032
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,910
No way

1033
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,940
You've got a bad aftertaste now?

1034
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,450
This is the one:

1035
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:15,910
A crime scene psychic can tell what happened just by entering a room

1036
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,110
This was uh, miles away

1037
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,460
Right right

1038
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,930
And at the end, the psychic

1039
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,290
was like "The spirits are angry"

1040
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,320
"I don't know anything, but I know that"

1041
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:35,730
I got all 3 items flawlessly wrong

1042
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:38,330
I just couldn't catch them at all

1043
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:41,160
And because of how variety shows are planned out

1044
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,900
I had times were I thought "I wonder how this will go".

1045
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,140
Which is why I'm sensing that the deceased are angry

1046
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,980
And with that, the result left a bad aftertaste

1047
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,980
What the hell!?

1048
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:24,970
Check out our Facebook and Website for more Wednesday Downtown! This video was subbed by a community run project called the Wednesday Downtown project. Thanks for watching!

Downtown golf showdown!

1053

As well as a mixed rule competition as appeared in Kochikame

1054
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,740
Is it possible to hide nudity with plastic wrap?

1055
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,340
Two whole hours of Kochikame verifications!
