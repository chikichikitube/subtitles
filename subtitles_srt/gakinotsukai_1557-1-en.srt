00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
First time on Gaki No Tsukai Arahende:

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,480
Einstein Inada Shichi Henge!!

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,090
Ina-chan is finally here.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,690
I don't know why he hasn't done this already.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,660
I heard something shocking happened before we started recording.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,850
Well, your partner there did something to Ina-chan.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,910
Well, your partner there did something to Ina-chan.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,910
What did he do?

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,640
Kicked the shit out of him!

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,010
That's because Ina-chan did something bad, right?

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,010
Yeah, that's right.

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,040
No, he was just standing there.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,620
1 minute before recording.

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:49,310
An entertainer's skills tested in a Shichi Henge.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,310
Nervousness seeps out of Inada before the show starts.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,470
Hamada lingers near Inada.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,240
Owww!!

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,610
You were giving off an evil vibe.

19
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,510
Please forgive my partner!

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,510
It's a sickness.

21
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,510
Oh its a sickness.

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,260
Well, let's welcome our guests for today, Einstein!

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,690
Einstein

24
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,690
Inada Naoki

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,690
Kawai Yuzuru

26
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,330
So, how are you feeling about doing this?

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,200
I was a little nervous, I couldn't even sleep last night.

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,100
I was a little nervous, I couldn't even sleep last night.

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,170
Everyone gets a little nervous.

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,410
Now I am finding it enjoyable.

31
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,370
Now I am finding it enjoyable.

32
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,310
I've overcome it.

33
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,140
Due to the violence earlier.

34
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,580
Kicked in the ass when I wasn't even doing anything.

35
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,420
Kicked in the ass when I wasn't even doing anything.

36
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,250
That mystery will be never be solved.

37
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,360
You're the 55th person to try, where are you aiming for?

38
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,500
Obviously I want to aim for 1st place!

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,940
Yuzuru, how do you think he will do now that he's finally here?

40
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,310
He's been nervous about this for a while.

41
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:13,280
I have no idea what that color is on his face today.

42
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,280
I have no idea what that color is on his face today.

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,280
It looks like the back of a peach.

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,800
There are many projects. What should we do?

58
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,430
Who is this?

59
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,600

60
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,560
He's my student.

61
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,910
T/N: Housei is now is a mentor/teacher/master in Rakugo.

62
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,560
Really!?

63
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,410
I've taken a student under my wing.

64
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,410
Wow, really!?

65
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,710
Ina-chan, don't go yet.

66
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,090
Didn't expect this to happen.

67
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,860
It's fine, just go.

68
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,290
That was some time to leave.

69
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,060
Shichi Henge Start

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,060
Now you're a master.

71
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,500
Yes.

72
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,080
T/N: Inada is doing one of his famous gags.

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,180
He's so annoying.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,700
Don't do that.

75
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,720
He's laughing so much.

76
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,060
Using his face as a specialty.

77
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,830
That was just accidental.

78
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,800

The money collected from this episode will be donated to the Nippon Television Kobato Cultural Agency.

80
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,770
I thought he was going to pull it off easily wearing that mask.

81
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,110
He was putting it on then it snapped.

82
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,110
The snap hit his chin, he went "Eh―"

83
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,950
Well you have an apprentice so let's make this Moriman battle happen, 2vs2.

84
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,800
Actually, I'm really good at impersonations

85
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,800
and I have a repertoire full of them.

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
I want to demonstrate it.

87
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,440
I have so many of them,
I am not sure which ones I should do.

88
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,940
I made an Impersonation Roulette.

89
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,720
When I say "Pi pi pi...", you can stop my roll anytime.

90
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:45,360
I'll think of an impersonation on the spot

91
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,360
and demonstrate my repertoire.

92
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,660
Let's do this together. Hamada, please say stop anytime.

93
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,900
Stop!

94
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,900
Wait, Hamada...

95
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,210
You told me to say stop,
it was too fast for you wasn't it.

96
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,980
Please go to sleep.

97
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,590
Housei, please stay stop at your liking.

98
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,220
Stop!

99
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,880
It's Ashida Mana!

100
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,230
T/N: Inada impersonates a famous
young tarento's voice, Ashida Mana.

101
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,230
It's...Ashida Mana.

102
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,970
I still have more. Endo, please say stop.

103
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,310
Stop.

104
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,310
It's Ashida Mana.

105
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:44,680
I am...Ashida.

106
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,360
Is everyone...Ashida?

107
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,070
Matsumoto, your turn. Ashida is coming up a lot.

108
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,540
I have others as well. Please try to roll for others.

109
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,380
Stop

110
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,920
Do you go by Totoro?

111
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,920

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,160
Do you...go by Totoro?

113
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,590
What's your name?

114
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,990
It's Hamada.

115
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,760
You go by Totoro, right?

116
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,880
I still have more. Last one, Fujiwara, if you will.

117
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,350
Stop!

118
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,120
You go by Totoro, right?

119
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,570
YOU GO BY TOTORO, RIGHT?

120
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:16,640
I'm not doing well. I still have more though.

121
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,090
Everyone's roll is so bad.

122
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,360
I laughed at Hamada earlier.

123
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,660
Why were you acting like a comedy duo?

124
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,530
Don't think you can do that.

125
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,870
Feels like you're conspiring together.

126
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,540
This should be fine, I don't have to pay, right?

127
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm a Busu-Meter.

128
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,390
I'm a Busu-Meter.

129
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,450
I can measure a human's hideousness.

130
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,660
I can measure a human's hideousness.

131
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,130
When someone says "Busu" to me,

132
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,160
When someone says "Busu" to me,

133
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,200
I say "Busu" back to them

134
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,200
proportionally to how ugly they are.

135
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,470
Matsumoto, please say "Busu" to me.

136
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,370
Busu.

137
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,370
Busu!

138
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,120
Housei, please say "Busu."

139
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,020
Busu.

140
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,520
Busu!!

141
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,760
Endo, please say "Busu."

142
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,760
Busu.

143
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,290
Busu.

144
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,400
Hamada, please say "Busu."

145
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,900
Busu.

146
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,400
BUSU!

147
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
BUSU! BUSU!

148
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,650
BUSU! BUSU! BUSU!

149
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,420
It's broken!

150
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,190
B U S U !

151
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,650
Damn, I know it already.

152
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,560
This guy's so annoying.

153
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,690
B U S U !

154
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,830
He's making a real scary face.

155
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,300
He's scowling so hard,

156
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,340
BUSU!

157
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,340
He's still saying it.

158
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,410
B U S U !

159
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,910
I know already, damn.

160
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,680
He hurt our feelings too.

161
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,620
With roughly the same extent of measure.

162
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Because its proportional.

163
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,990
He's racking it up

164
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,960
NEXT: A comedian of Downtown's generation arrives?

165
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,280
My ex has been bugging me to get back with her.

166
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,080
My ex has been bugging me to get back with her.

167
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,120
I'm in a pickle.

168
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,620
What should I do?

169
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,400
It's her again.

170
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,130

172

Hello!

174
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,880
You at work right now?

175
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,620
That's dirty.

176
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,020
What's up?

177
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,760
My husband ain't cutting it for me in bed.

178
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,560
It's on speaker.

179
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,900
He's a good person, right?

180
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,900
Yeah, he is.

181
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,000
Every time I meet Ina-chan on other shows

182
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,570
Every time I meet Ina-chan on other shows

183
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,110
I would remember the times we went out together.

184
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,850
That's in the past, isn't it?

185
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,550
I know that too, but every time we meet

186
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,250
I end up remembering all the fun and interesting things we did together.

187
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,450
Would you tell me honestly

188
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,260
why you broke up with me?

189
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,060
What happened to us?

190
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,860
Just talk it over Line privately.

191
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,030
I didn't really hear it from you

192
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,440
so I can't really get over it.

193
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,370
That's some heavy Osaka dialect

194
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,940
You're really cornering me though

195
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,310
I used to.

196
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,820
But now I won't do it anymore.

197
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
It's not just that.

198
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,090
You still haven't paid back money that I lent you.

199
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,060
I'll return it.

200
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,390
I will pay it back, unlike Downtown.

201
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,460
You can hear pages shuffling.

202
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,330
Yeah, you can hear it.

203
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,970
Please tell us how many pages are left.

204
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,710
I didn't get to say this but...

205
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,750
...I don't like that you're Downtown's classmate.

206
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,150
Why though?

207
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,750
I don't even know their Line info even if I'm their classmate.

208
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,590
But they've seen you nude before.

209
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,320
That's because Downtown are peeping toms.

210
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,160
That's because Downtown are peeping toms.

211
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,200
Peeping from the mailbox.

212
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,960
It's a famous story of theirs.

213
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Watching me as I came out of the bath...

214
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,140
Saying that its like a stag beetle

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,140
stuck on my nether region.

216
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,740
There's no stag beetle down there!

217
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,250
Its a butterfly,

218
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,250
you've seen it before, Ina-chan?

219
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,890
That was all because Ma-chan likes me.

220
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:06,160
Forgive me, but it's over between us.

221
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,890
Sorry, I am going to hang up now.

222
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,430
Newspaper?

223
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,340
The size of a newspaper?

224
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,040
It's large and it sounded like it was raining for a bit.

225
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,670
It's large and it sounded like it was raining for a bit.

226
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,740
That's some intense tearing sound.

227
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,850
That's a crazy amount!

228
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,320
He might go all the way.

229
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,890
NEXT: Rapid penalities with a face gag

230
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,560
He's getting me every time.

231
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,540
Will I make it?

232
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,280
Shit, there's no time.

233
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,330
Will I make it in time?

234
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:31,000
I made it!! Yaaay!

235
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,540
I thought I definitely wasn't going to make it.

236
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,450
I've made it before too now that I think about it.

237
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,700
What exactly did he make it in time for?

238
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,640
He was saying he won't make it in time.

239
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,440
He said he's made it before.

240
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,750
Why would he say he won't make it if he's made it in before?

241
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,190
Bicycle Chinman

242
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:29,990
A story about Chinman's dream.

243
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,610
I'm Bicycle Chinman.

244
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,010
My dream is for lots of people to ride me.

245
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,280
But no one wants to ride me.

246
00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:01,890
Chinman's dream is for someone
to sit and ride the bicycle.

247
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,600
Matsumoto, come get on.

248
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,840
Come giddy up and get on.

249
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,470
No one else will.

250
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,980
Then, excuse me...

251
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,980
Go ahead.

252
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,830
He's a freaking idiot!!

253
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,470
Hot! Hot! Hot!

254
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,840
Thank you.

255
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,820
Hamada, too.

256
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,820
That's the same thing.

257
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,350
Come giddy up.

258
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,330
He's sweating a lot.

259
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,330
Yeah he is.

260
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,240
This is quite the shift in gears.

261
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,450
He's gonna die!

262
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,320
Thank you, everyone!

263
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,160
Now you say that.

264
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,100
That hurt...

265
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,570
Chinman brought this onto himself.

266
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,540
Oh yeah, next is last one.

267
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,890
NEXT: Body stretching do-or-die transformation

268
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,890
That's quite a lot in there.

269
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,600
Sensei, let's do a small face remedy, please.

270
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Alright, lay down here.

271
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,240
Excuse me.

272
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,620
Please, if you will.

273
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,620
Alright, let's begin.

274
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:49,990
Safety is taken into consideration by an expert. Actual treatment is different.

275
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,690
Don't make that face.

276
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,600
You just can't do that!

277
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,640
Your legs are straight up in the air!

278
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,340
It's impossible with that chin!

279
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,950
I feel like my face is becoming smaller.

280
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,920
Alright, I'll finish up now.

281
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,720
How is she going to finish this?
That's more than enough

282
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,650
You told her to do this, have her stop it!

283
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,330
All done.

284
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,330
Thank you.

285
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,730
No way, she punched that chin.

286
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,140
That's freakin' too much!

287
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,310
It's smaller!

288
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,310
No way it is, idiot!

289
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:15,480
Your chin is swelling up!

290
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,500
What the hell is with this guy?!

291
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,360
Ah, I'm glad.

292
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,630
That's considerable, isn't it?

293
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,800
I went out in all of them.

294
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,410
He probably got 2nd or 3rd.

295
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,740
57,000 Yen

296
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,150
He got 2nd??

297
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,390
That's 3rd place!

298
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,230
After Koumoto and Naomi.

299
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,230
T/N: Koumoto (Episode #753) and Naomi (Episode #1359)

300
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,970
You're here now.

301
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,240
Really, 3rd place?!

302
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,450
3rd Place

303
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,450
57,000 Yen

304
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,450
Earned Amount

305
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:28,690
I would like you all to meet someone

306
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,690
who helped me today.

307
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,690
It's that person, isn't it?

308
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,000
Ina-chan, I'm here!  <3

309
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,040
HighHeel
Ringo

310
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,000
I came from the 9am bullet train!

311
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,210
We heard all the pages shuffling!!

312
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,880
I wasn't reading at all!

313
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,890
Next week: 100 Yen Items Costume Clip Show.
Previous scenes can be viewed!
