00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:07,520
The second annual Gaki no Tsukai Ya Arahende chiki chiki nostalgic retro Famicon gaming!!

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,800
Right, second annual

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,020
Yup

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,650
It's the second time, isn't it. The theme has changed a bit this time

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Exactly. This is the results from the last one.

8
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,060

00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,060
Hamada Masatoshi

10
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,060
Matsumoto Hitoshi

11
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,860
Ah, is that it?

12
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,550
Seriously, you guys were completely crushed

13
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,500
I know, Matsumoto-san won by so much

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,240
Tsukitei Hosei

15
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,320
You were in last place, weren't you?

16
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,800
You were just so bad, in Donkey Kong

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,900
you got 0 points. You really are an old geezer

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Hamada is the only one with 0 points

19
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Tanaka has one that is "No record"

There was something wrong with the game

24
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,750
I couldn't get it to work. Yea, that was it

25
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,990
Even though it's a show, you still occasionally mess up

26
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,790
Even though it's a show, you still occasionally mess up

27
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,100
No no, please don't say that

28
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,600
This place has 572 games in total

30
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,400
Awesome

31
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,700

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Firstly, everyone will go over the nostalgic NES games that have been prepared by Sakesan

38
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,580
The games from last time are here as well.

39
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,580
Yup, yup

40
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,420
This (Mappy), I haven't even heard of it

41
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,490
How dare you show up today without even knowing Mappy

42
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,270
No, I really don't know what this is

43
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,250
Me neither

44
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,960
Action game: Mappy, the police mouse,
recovers stolen goods while evading enemies

45
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,960
1984 - Mappy

46
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,960
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,960

48
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,550
Surely you know what Mappy is

49
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,790
It's very popular

50
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Nope, I don't know Mappy

51
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,660
You've actually been arrested before so how do you

52
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,660
not know about Mappy

53
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,630
I have never  been arrested

54
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,670
I have never been arrested

55
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,130
Hamada-san never usually looks directly at the camera...

56
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,940
Hamada-san never usually looks directly at the camera...

57
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,060
Yeah because I have to make it clear...

58
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,100
Looking directly at the camera

59
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,140
Hmm, I don't know any of them, what should I do...

60
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,140
Ah, Doctor Mario

61
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,140
Doctor Mario

62
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,600
I was really hooked on this

63
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,650
1990 - Doctor Mario

64
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,650
Using capsules, Mario eradicates

65
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,650
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

66
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,650
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

67
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,650
the viruses in the bottle

68
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,810
I've heard of it before

69
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,810
I could play this forever.

70
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,320
Doctor Mario throws capsules at you and they start falling faster and faster.

71
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,680
It would suddenly get really fast, making it extremely difficult

72
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,100
And when you lost, Doctor Mario would just do this

73
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,720
and I'm like 'It's because you're going too bloody fast!'

74
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
You really remember this well, don't you

75
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,520
This one is also recommended

76
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,890
Ice Climber, hmm... I've definitely heard of it before but never actually played it

77
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,910
1985 - Ice Climber

78
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,910
Action game: Ascend to the summit
by breaking blocks using a hammer

79
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,910

00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,910

81
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,890
It's fun

82
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,470
Could you explain it roughly

83
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,880
Explaining it through rap would be better

84
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,280

88
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,650
About that

89
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,450
I really want to draw a line under that

90
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,430
How about here? Any one of these you guys know?

91
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,790
As expected, only the recommended ones. For example this, Wagan Land

92
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,060
No idea

93
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,060
Nope

94
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,560
What kind of game is it then?

95
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,370
Um, well, it's like this

96
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,900
Please explain it through rap

97
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,340
Yo yo

98
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,300
I wanted to try doing it without hesitating but,

99
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,570
in the end, I still did

100
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,300
in the end, I still did

101
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,320
Yeah, me too

102
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,500
I wanted to make it really good too but then I knew it was impossible...

103
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,080
You looked like you were about to cry

104
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,880
I thought steam was going to come out of my head

119

Which will he choose?

120
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,750
He brought one from the 'recommended area'

121
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,020
Yup, it's from the recommended

122
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,980
Ah, it's Pac-man

123
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,980
Here it is

124
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,650
Pac-man

125
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,220
That game sold so much

126
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,750
Pac-man

127
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,750
Released in 1984

128
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:37,170
The player controls Pac-man in a maze to eat up all the dots while evading the enemies

129
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,730
I'm really really good at this!

130
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,570
Seriously?

131
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,770
There's a pattern to it

132
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
I was into Pac-man a long time ago

133
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,540
Since Yama-chan has so much confidence, he should be last. Let's go down the line.

134
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:59,380

m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

138
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,910
Actually, I've never played this before

139
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,910
I played it a long time ago

140
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,740
This brings me back

141
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,720
Okay, okay...

142
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,720
So nostalgic

143
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,250
What a nostalgic sensation

144
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,540
Isn't there an order to eating the dots?

145
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,540
The order is...

146
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:21,140
Pac-man

147
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:21,140
Tanaka

148
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:21,140
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

149
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:21,140
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

150
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,650
There, you've left one behind

151
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,650
This isn't good

152
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,650
You're in trouble

153
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,970
Tanaka, you're in trouble

154
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,620
Oh, I see

155
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
Tanaka, you're seriously in trouble

156
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,170
Oh, that's good

157
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,920
In the end

158
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,520
You've got to eat them quickly or you're in trouble

159
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,540
Woah, woah, oh, okay okay, finally

160
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,540
Quickly, quickly

161
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:38,820
Pac-man

162
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:38,820
Tanaka

163
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:38,820
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

164
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:38,820
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

165
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,870
He's going to wait in that corner, see he's waiting.

166
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,320
But that was the last power-up

167
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,050
Yeah you're right

168
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,570
So now he has no way to counter them

169
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,020
All you can do is run away

170
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,160
All you can do is run around

171
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Let's get past at least 1 level

172
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:56,610
Pac-man

173
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:56,610
Tanaka

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:56,610
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

176
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,160
They're getting close

177
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,150
You're in trouble

178
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,100
You're in trouble now

179
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,920
Here they come, here they come

180
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,800
They're really coming now

181
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,800
This is bad, this is bad!

182
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,800
He did it!

183
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,040
Awesome

184
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,240
Tanaka level 1 clear

185
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:12,020
Pac-man

186
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:12,020
Tanaka

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:12,020

189
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,600
Tanaka somehow cleared the first level, however...

190
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,390
You're in trouble

191
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,390
What was that?

192
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,500
Such a lame ending...

193
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,250
Yea, but still, I honestly didn't even think I could clear the first level

194
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,760
Tanaka 4480 points

00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,360
Yea, a whole level

197
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
I'm still plenty satisfied

198
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:32,340
Endo

199
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:32,340

202
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,760
Next up is Endo, who during his childhood was only playing baseball, hardly playing video games

203
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,240
Yes!

204
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,820
What the hell are you doing there?!

205
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,050
He went for seconds*

206
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,820
*Translators note: Okawari means second dish. Going back for more of the same dish.

207
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,680
Stop going for seconds

208
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:54,070
Endo

209
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:54,070
Pac-man

212
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,950
What are you trying to do?

213
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,280
This is bad

214
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,280
You'd better get there quickly

215
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,570
It's alright now

216
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,920
You're good now

217
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,990
What are you trying to do?

218
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,990
Why are you going that way?

219
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,000
Whaddahell!

220
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
"Whaddahell"

221
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Because I haven't playe~

222
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
He finished with "Whaddahell"

223
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
Haven't played since childhood

224
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,270

226
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,760
He's the Kansai version

227
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,760
of the jeans detective!

228
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,440
That's the Kansai version of Nanja koryaa

229
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:10,050
Hamada's turn

230
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,120
I'll beat his score

231
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,080
Hamada, are you good at this?

232
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
Why would you say that?

233
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,680
You've definitely played this many times before, haven't you

234
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,640
I think Hamada,

235
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:32,900
Hamada

236
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:32,900
Pac-man

239
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,570
When this came out, he was in dorms

240
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,620
Yes, I was

241
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,570
Because he lived in a dorm,

242
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,670
Other games seemed crappy, maybe not "crappy" but,

243
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,770
Pac-man was popular at the time

244
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,160
Yea, yea

245
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,280
It's so hard to move

246
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Because at that time, Pac-man was the only game that actually played well

247
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,280
That's bad

248
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,740
Good job on losing

249
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,740
610 points with one life left

250
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,980
The staff are laughing so much

251
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,680
Who was the one laughing hysterically?

252
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,010
Man that pisses me off

253
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:49,390
Hamada

254
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:49,390

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,640
That's good

258
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,650
Really?

259
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,650
Yea, sure

260
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,360
Nice, just go back again, huh?

261
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:56,430

Are you a gangster?

264
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,040
Why are you going towards them?

265
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,430
Gangster?

266
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,430
Matsumoto's Pac-man Trial!!

267
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,430
Next, previous champion, geezer gamer, Matsumoto

268
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,320
Because this isn't exactly what we call a joystick,

269
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:17,420
Matsumoto

270
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:17,420
Pac-man

271
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:17,420
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

272
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:17,420
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

273
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,320
It makes it harder

274
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,440
In the cafe, it used to be a joystick controller

275
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,420
You're so fast

276
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,560
This part's particularly difficult

277
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
It seems like you get faster when you power up

278
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,820
Exactly. This definitely

279
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,120
Doesn't feel like we're playing in a cafe because of this

280
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,120
Yea, it doesn't

281
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:32,030
Matsumoto

282
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:32,030
Pac-man

285
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,800
Even though operating on an unfamiliar controller, he is still able to do well

286
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,240
All you can do is run now

287
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,040
The dots are scattered all around

288
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Woah almost almost!

289
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,440
What are you

290
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,830
What were you doing running about the same spot?

291
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,630
What were you doing walking about the same spot?

292
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,400
Nice one

293
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:41,840
Matsumoto

294
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:41,840

297
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,770
You should turn around

298
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,900
Oh this is bad, you're so dead now

299
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
You were backed up into the corner, there's no way to escape

300
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,480
You're right, it's more difficult than expected

301
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
The controller movement, right?

302
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,920
Matsumoto

303
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,920

306
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,560
You should be able to make it through now

307
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,600
Isn't that dangerous over there?

308
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,000
He turned and ran towards them

309
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,420
Gangster!

310
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,420
You're a gangster

311
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,420
You must be

312
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,600
I've only ever played using the joystick...

Hosei's Pac-man Trial!!

316
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:09,000
Lastly, Hosei, who is super confident in Pac-man. Will he be able to beat Tanaka's high score?

317
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:19,580
Hosei

318
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:19,580

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,250
You're doing fine

322
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,160
You actually wanted to go the other way, didn't you?

323
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,400
Yeah but you can do it like this as well

324
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,870
What pattern?

325
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,700
You've got to be kidding me

326
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,400
Hold on a second

327
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,360
Looks like an orange peel in the end

333
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,480
It'll be fine

334
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,720
Aren't you in serious trouble here?

335
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
Why didn't you go up just then?

336
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,600
Here's how it works, you gather them together and then... wait, what?

337
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,960
This bloody controller

00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,080
We all used the same one

341
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,440
Everyone used the same controller

342
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,440
Yup, exactly

343
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,080
That's so annoying

344
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,900
That was unexpected

00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:48,740

358
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,900
Yes, it's me

359
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,900
Yea, it's Tanaka, 4000 something

360
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,000
Quite the boy genius, aren't you?

361
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,020
I only cleared one level

362
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,200
It was only level one

Released in 1983

365
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:59,820
The game that Endo has chosen is the highly popular and first of the Mario series, Mario Brothers

366
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,470
Action Game: Enemies emerge from the pipes, bump them from underneath

367
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,970
Knocking them out, then kicking them away

368
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm going to start then

369
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,100
Endo's Turn

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:29,850

374
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,100
You shouldn't have used that power-up this early

375
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,100
You used it

376
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,570
The turtles fall over

377
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,420
Yea, they fall over

378
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,000
Yea, that's right. Only once though

379
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,450
He's gone over there now

380
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,720
He got back up

381
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,620
What do I do?

382
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,580
You're just messing around with them!

383
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,350
He bumped him twice

384
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,400
You have to kick them away when they are down

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,450
It became purple

391
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,970
Go, kick'em

392
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,420
Now's your chance

393
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,770
That's the way

394
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,560

395
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,850
What's this?

396
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
What are you doing?

397
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,520
Mario went like this

398
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,500
What happened there?

Don't get hit by the fire

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,400
Okay

405
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,770
It's here. That's good

406
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,520
Why'd you bump him again?

407
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,750
Didn't we tell you to not get hit by fire

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,050
Next up is Hamada, a beginner gamer. How well will he perform this time?

416
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,400
Wandering around the bottom won't do anything

417
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,050
Old man, what are you doing?

418
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,050
That's bad

419
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,850
That's so close

420
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,250
Hamada, why are you only sticking to the bottom level?

421
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,750
Almost

422
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,230
This is so scary, Hamada-san

423
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,820
You can't stay on the bottom

424
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,050
So close, so close

425
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,250
You really are a gangster

No no, that's not it

429
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,250
I thought there was enough space to jump over

Hosei's Mario Brothers Trial!!

434
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,350

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,770
I remember playing this in cafes before

440
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,250
I don't quite remember this one

441
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,320
Only since Super Mario was the game about traversing the level

442
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,150
Yea, Super Mario was a side-scroll adventure game

443
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,070
Donkey Kong stayed exactly the same

444
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
True

445
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,720
Adventure? You know that one, don't you?

446
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,700
That's the one I know

447
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,350
Eh, what?

448
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,170
The level is over?

449
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,650
As expected from the Mario obsessed boasting Hosei,

450
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,330
Clearing levels without effort

451
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm going to be playing this for ages you know?

452
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,250
That's fine

453
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,800
They're jumping now

454
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:36,140
Hosei

458
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,800
From here on, it gets more difficult

459
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,970
You have to bump them when they land

460
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,500
Only one hit, right?

461
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,500
Yea

462
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,270
Looking at this,

463
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,920
How could you guys lose to just turtles?

464
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:48,120

468
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,150
He's so good at this

469
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,500
Really really good

470
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,990
He's not talking anymore either...

471
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,490
How dull!

472
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:15,010

00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,850
The devoted Hosei finally reaches the tenth level

477
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,050
It's already level 10, and he's been playing for almost 20 minutes

478
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,550
We could have just left and let him get on with it

479
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,000
Well done

480
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,970
There's no way I can beat him

481
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,880
Hosei 65840 points

482
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,880

65840

484
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,900
That's impressive

485
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,890
Lastly is Matsumoto. How will he fare?

486
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,890
Matsumoto's Mario Brothers Trial!!

487
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,090
Honestly speaking, I've never played this before!

488
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,760
Honestly speaking, I've never played this before!

489
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,750
This one?

490
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:42,640
Mario Brothers

491
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:42,640
Matsumoto

494
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,570
You've not played this before?

495
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,550
Nope, not once

496
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,100
Get a move on

497
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
We told you don't bump them twice!

498
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Uh-oh, you're in trouble

499
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,100
Are you for real?

500
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,450
I've never played it before, it's like an unknown world to me

501
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:56,290
Mario Brothers

502
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:56,290

505
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:56,150
Without knowing how to play at all, Matsumoto was unfortunately beaten on level one

506
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,290

528
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,500
Hosei completely triumphs Mario Brothers

529
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,400
What did Hamada choose?

530
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,300
Shoving Sumo

531
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:12,340
Released in 1987

532
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:12,340
Shoving Sumo

533
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,300
I don't know this one

534
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,420
What is he talking about?

535
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,340
I don't think there's a scoring system

536
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,020
Wait, what did you say?

537
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,020
There's no scoring

538
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,300
No score?

539
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,040
This is the first time in his life that Sakekan

540
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,980
This is the first time in his life that Sakekan

541
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,980
looks so uneasy

542
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,550
But, seriously?

543
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,550
Let's give it a try then

544
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:46,000
Hamada

545
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:46,000
Shoving Sumo

546
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:46,000
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

547
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:46,000
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

548
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,500
Shoving sumo, you say

549
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,490
January Stage, day one

550
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,750
Which one am I?

551
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,620
Probably the white one

552
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,700
The one on the left

553
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,420
Yup, Tochiyama

554
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,170
That's it, Tochi

555
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,100
Use the d-pad or AB buttons to shove

556
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,250
Of course Tochiyama will be good at shoving

557
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,250
Or grab their loincloth

558
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,320
He's up near the edge

559
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,410
I won

560
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,410
Tochiyama won

561
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,700
You've won but I don't feel like you did much

562
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,140
How are we going to score this...

563
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,620
Just as Sakekan mentioned, this game does not have a scoring system

564
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,220
It's only about winning and leveling up over and over

565
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,400
The game doesn't end until attaining the yokozuna rank

566
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,750
You chose a bloody long one

567
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,960
The creators too must be in front of their TV

568
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,800
The creators too must be in front of their TV

569
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,800
feeling completely ashamed

570
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,800
Begging you to stop

571
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,170
Released in 1984

572
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,170
Xevious

573
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,550
The retro game chosen by Hosei is Xevious

574
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,400
Shooting game: Use missiles to defeat enemies that

575
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,350
appear in the air and on land

576
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,520
First up is the greenhorn Hamada

577
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,520
Hamada's Xevious Trial!!

578
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,120
I remember playing this

579
00:14:33,520 --> 00:15:04,020
Hamada

580
00:14:33,520 --> 00:15:04,020
Xevious

581
00:14:33,520 --> 00:15:04,020
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

00:14:33,520 --> 00:15:04,020
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

583
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,100
Yea, this was very hard

584
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,100
My god, this game

585
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,900
I remember this, but haven't played it before

586
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,750
You're playing this for the first time too, right?

587
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,570
How about you, Hamada? Have you played this before?

588
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Nope, never

589
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,850
Is this your first time playing this?

590
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,850
Yea, it is

591
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,850
But, you're quite good

592
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,670
Go further down a little

593
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,650
How do I go down?

594
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,950
Yup yup

595
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,770
That's right

596
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,220
If you stay at the center, you'll get hit easily

597
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,420
You should use the rest of the screen

598
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,770
The whole screen?

599
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,870
You sometimes have to go forward

600
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,850
You almost died

601
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,980
Tsk

602
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:10,150
This isn't Space Invaders, don't just stay at the bottom

603
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:22,200
Hamada

604
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:22,200
Xevious

605
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:22,200

00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:22,200
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

607
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,550
What do you mean?

608
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,520
Go up and down

609
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,520
Then you can dodge the bullets

610
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,600
Now you're only moving horizontally

611
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,770
That's dangerous, so dangerous

612
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,100
Stop just going left and right

613
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,120
You're too simple, doing only what you're told

614
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,250
You're always like that, just like that time

615
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,110
Hamada 4330 points

621
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,700
After that, Hosei and Tanaka both had a go at a high score

622
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,380
Matsumoto's Xevious Trial!!

623
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,380
Will Matsumoto be able to show off his Old Man Gaming skills?

624
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,420
The movement isn't as expected

625
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,420
Yea, it isn't

626
00:15:45,420 --> 00:16:11,520
Matsumoto

627
00:15:45,420 --> 00:16:11,520
Xevious

630
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,750
Good one

631
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,720
He's doing well

632
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,620
Good score

633
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,770
You've missed one of them

634
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,650
In the middle again

635
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,750
Can you get the next ones?

636
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,670
You've left one behind again

637
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,100
He's being hasty now

638
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,650
Watch out

639
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,500
Damn it!

640
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,070
I'm definitely not losing this one

641
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:42,380
Matsumoto

642
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:42,380
Xevious

645
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,000
When we all bought it at first, we struggled to do well at it.

646
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,870
I bet it was really fun though

647
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,500
There are also bonus ones, like ones hiding at the bottom apparently.

648
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,600
It looks empty, but if you shoot downwards, bases will appear

649
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,200
Sorry Tanaka, even though you went out of your way and told me to be careful

I was only trying to advise you

658
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,900
Lastly is Endo. How well will he fare?

659
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,850
Pretend you're protecting Shikoku

660
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,550
Shikoku is in big trouble

661
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,400
Because Shikoku is in danger, you have to protect it

662
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,370
It's all up to you, Endo

663
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,610
How did Shikoku get neglected

664
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,610
until such a situation

665
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:31,560
Endo

666

669
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,500
You should move horizontally

670
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,000
You have to focus on dodging the bullets

671
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,250
Anywhere you go is still dangerous

672
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,800
Your hometown is coming up soon

673
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,850
Nice nice

674
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,950
So bloody many are coming!

675
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,950
Woah, there's a lot coming, go go go

676
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,950
Avoid them, go go go

677
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,020
What the hell are these?!

678
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,860
You can't kill them

679
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,860
No way

680
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,650
You only can dodge them

681
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,950
They're not dying, you should already know that

682
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:46,180
Endo

686
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,870
You're too far down

687
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,300
But it's too dangerous to go further ahead

688
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,740
Look and avoid the bullets, don't only look at a particular spot

689
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,740
Dodge the bullets sideways

690
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,750
Nooo!

691
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,500
Your sideways dodging was good

692
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,920
You can definitely get past this

693
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,720
Even though we've almost reached your hometown

694
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,020

Wait, what?

701
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,350
There's no way I can reach the boss

702
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,400
Don't think that way, keep going~ It's here again

703
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,050
If you can kill that, you'll probably reach the boss

704
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,450
What the hell?!

705
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,750
What should I do?!

706
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,200

Released in 1989

Wagan Land

736
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,400
Action game: Wagan fires sound from its mouth to stun enemies in order to pass

737
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,430
First up is the Wagan Land loving Matsumoto

738
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,430
Matsumoto's Wagan Land Trial!!

739
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,550

741
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:58,920

Wa wa

745
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,450
Wagan goes "wa~", right?

746
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,400
With this "wa~",

747
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,020
Use it to stun

748
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,680
You've killed.. It's still alive

749
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,680
It's not dead

750
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,120
When hit, enemies get stunned for a while

751
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:58,920
What?

752
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,370
Wagan got killed

753
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,400
Hang on a second

754
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,400
I don't remember it being like this

759
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,550
Even though he had so much confidence, he has completely forgotten how to play the game

760
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,820
Sadly, Matsumoto has been defeated

After these three had their attempt, Tanaka managed to beat the first level and attain the high score

771
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,050
Hosei's Wagan Land Trial!!

772
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,050

778
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,670
You've probably gotten used to it by now

779
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,320
Hosei-san, is this your first time playing this as well?

780
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,200
Yea, it is

781
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,390

786
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,070
Although it's his first time at the game, Hosei immediately understands the basics

787
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,770
Getting the invincibility power-up, he easily completes the first level

788
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,900
I'll teach you something about the game

789
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,220
Good job

790
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,900
What is this?

791
00:19:54,270 --> 00:20:11,460

795
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,320
With great vigor, he gets another invincibility power-up and reaches the boss

796
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,750
It's the boss!

797
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
What's going on? I can't move at all

798
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,560
That was just a cut scene

799
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,560
What the hell... Shiritori??

800
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,870

806
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,250
Hourglass (Sunadokei) ends with "i"

807
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,650
"i", umm...what?

808
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,420
Ah, ink

809
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,120
Sol?

810
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,520
Such a word?

811
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,200
You've won

812
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,800

Guys

841
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,600
Shall we try a game that none of us have played before?

842
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,180
Shall we try a game that none of us have played before?

843
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,170
Something that no one knows how to play

844
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,870
Something that no one has actually played before

845
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,070
Not even once

846
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:14,220
A new game for everyone, a racing game, Mach Rider

847
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:14,220
Mach Rider

848
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:14,220
Released in 1985

849
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,990
Hosei's Turn

850
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,400
First up will be Hosei

851
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:25,060
Hosei

852

855
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,100
How does this work?

856
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,200
It's a racing game, you accelerate...

857
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,050
A missile is comi~ it got me

858
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,020
You got scattered

859
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,650
Sorry for not saying earlier but, you can shoot bullets at the enemies

860
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:40,010
Hosei

864
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,620
What? There are enemies?

865
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,250
What? Why did I die?

866
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,850
There's a mirror for you to see

867
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,900
Really

868
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,350

874
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,300
The enemy will be reflected in there, avoid them

875
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,400
Watch out for the puddles

876
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,050
Do they come from the front?

877
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,520
They approach from behind

878
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,520
There there, he's coming

879
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,500
This one isn't easy

880
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:02,770
Hosei

881
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:02,770

884
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,770
I couldn't see it at all

885
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,800
"The End"

886
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
How much? 40 points?

887
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,410
Hosei 40 points

888
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,410

889
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,050
That's so bad

890
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,220
What if, whoever is last place gets flicked in the forehead by the others?

891
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,200
Wait, wait

892
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,040
We need some punishment for the loser

893
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,580
Special Rule

894
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,580
The last player will get flicked in the forehead as punishment

895
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,580
m 0 0 l 0 14.875 l 18 14.875 l 18 0

896
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,920
That's a good idea

897
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,870
Hosei, you got 40 right?

898
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,580
Wait, what? Don't just suddenly make something up

899
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,720
After this

900
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,720
Matsumoto's turn to play Mach Rider

901
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,020
Gaki no Tsukai news!

902
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,120

903
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,410
Matsumoto's Turn Mach Rider Challenge!!

904
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,410
Will Matsumoto be able to do well in the difficult retro game, Mach Rider?

905
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,050
If only they didn't come from behind

906
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,710
Mach Rider

907
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,710

910
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,420
Annoying isn't it

911
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,720
He's here

912
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,650
What the hell

913
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,650
There are 4 numbers which represent gear

914
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,760

920
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,050
How do you change gears?

921
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,500
Using the up and down buttons

922
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,750
I see

923
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,700
Look out for th~

924
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,100
He'll definitely hit you from the back

925
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,900
Mach Rider

926
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,900

929
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,900
You don't die when you bump him from behind

930
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,770
What happened?

931
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,770
Wha?

932
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,750
How much did I get?

933
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,100
Why did it end?

Although the remaining three others were struggling to play, in the end they all beat Hosei's 40 points

946
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,820
HOSEI PUNISHMENT!

947
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,150
Some people are awesome at doing this

948
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:54,710
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

949
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,150
I used to be good at it

950
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,870
He hurt himself...

951
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,300
It happens

952
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,300
It does.

953
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,950
If you're good at it, you're good

954
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,250
Sorry

955
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,250
As expected

956
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,800
Oy you!

957
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,800
What happened?

958
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,150
He used his knuckle!
