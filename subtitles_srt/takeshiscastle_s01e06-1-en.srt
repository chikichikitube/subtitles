1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,170
THIS PROGRAM WAS PRODUCED
UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MEDICAL EXPERTS,

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,870
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HEALTH
AND SAFETY OF THE STAFF AND CONTESTANTS.

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,730
The army continues its charge
into four paths.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,970
After the battles at the third stronghold,
only three warriors remain.

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,570
3 WARRIORS REMAIN

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,570
Will they be able to turn things around?

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,200
THE THIRD FORTRESS
ENNOSUKE CASTLE

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,200
-Fun times. Right, my lord?
-Yes.

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,400
-Next, we have the Dragon God's Pond.
-Yes!

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,770
OSAMU SHITARA - YUKI HIMURA

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,400
-Here it comes!
-I can't wait.

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,300
ENNOSUKE ICHIKAWA

13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,730
DRAGON GOD'S POND
USE THE STONES TO GET ACROSS THE POND

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,330
Let's see how it goes, shall we?
Start over there and come this way.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,630
Be careful. Yes, like that.

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,900
-You move so lightly.
-Very good.

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,570
It's too easy for you.

18
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,770
-As long as the stones don't sink.
-I know.

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,100
-Right.
-You're good.

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,330
Otherwise, it'll be like that.

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,800
I know you'll hit your face.
That's what happens in Takeshi's Castle.

22
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,930
-That's funny though.
-I know.

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,300
I slept so well.

24
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,200
Taking a nap is a good thing.

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,900
What?

26
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,570
GENERAL TANI

27
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,470
It's him again.

28
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,500
I finally became the captain...

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,670
What?

30
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,500
What?

31
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,670
Hey, everyone, have you seen General Tani?

32
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,130
No.

33
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,770
-He was here earlier.
-Really?

34
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,600
Did he leave to command another game?
Well, whatever.

35
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,530
THE CAPTAIN
SUBARU KIMURA

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,400
The next game is the Dragon God's Pond.

37
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,600
This is Takeshi's Castle's
most famous game.

38
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,700
Here it comes.

39
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,500
Can you make it?

40
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,430
All that water will make it slippery.

41
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,870
Charge!

42
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,770
This is the Dragon God's Pond,
and I, Nasu, will be reporting.

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,430
How many challengers
will be able to finish the game?

44
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,830
I think there's something there.

45
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,570
-Something's lurking in this pond.
-Who is that? What?

46
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,500
That butterfly stroke...
It must be Kasuga.

47
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,130
Yes, it's him.

48
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,070
Here comes the merman.

49
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,900
Hey!

50
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,700
MERMAN
TOSHIAKI AUDREY KASUGA

51
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,770
DRAGON GOD'S POND
DIFFICULTY RATING: 100%

52
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,430
EDITOR FOR LIGHTNING MAGAZINE
ADO SHIRASAWA (44)

53
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,100
GET TO THE GOAL BY JUMPING STONES
IF YOU FALL, YOU FAIL

54
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,270
He's doing great.

55
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,270
-He hit his face.
-Oh, dear...

56
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,130
-He hit his face.
-Oh, dear...

57
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:09,970
EDITOR FOR LIGHTNING MAGAZINE
MASAHIRO SASAKI (47)

58
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,870
Let's go!

59
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,730
Your senses change a bit
when you start jumping.

60
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,130
-He couldn't stay on.
-It's a shame.

61
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,770
They tend to jump to the right
because the distance is shorter.

62
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,500
Choosing the right path
is important in this pond.

63
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,000
The key is how to jump over the areas
where the stones are too spread out.

64
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,670
Good luck!

65
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,630
I'll try my best!

66
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
She's fast!

67
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,070
She jumped into the water.

68
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,600
-She jumped into the water.
-Should've done it slowly.

69
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,030
Koga took off at a brisk pace.
She jumped to an area without stones.

70
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,630
She fell vigorously.

71
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,770
TAKAHIRO OGAWA (51)

72
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,600
The next challenger is Ogawa. He's been
writing articles on leather jackets

73
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,070
for men's American culture magazines
for 20 years.

74
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,370
I write about leather jackets and boots.
Here I am.

75
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,570
-Are you gonna be okay in those?
-Sure.

76
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,500
Is he okay? He's wearing engineer boots.

77
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,370
He has been writing articles
on leather jackets and boots.

78
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,770
He's wearing his favorite leather jacket
and boots, worth 260,000 yen.

79
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,870
TAKAHIRO OGAWA (51)

80
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,400
-Let's go!
-Good luck!

81
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,970
-Hey!
-That stone!

82
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,430
-Did it move?
-No.

83
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,300
-He jumped to the farthest one.
-He did.

84
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,470
Everyone does that.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,270
Ogawa chose a path that bypasses
the stone-free zone.

86
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,970
It looks like it was difficult
to move in those boots

87
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,800
and he fell into the pond,
along with items worth 260,000 yen.

88
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,330
Oh, my God. I'm drenched.

89
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,270
-Look.
-Oh no.

90
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,700
-It's a nice picture.
-Yeah.

91
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,670
-The next challenger is...
-Who is he?

92
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,930
I'll get to the end.
Just watch me, Takeshi.

93
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,170
It's Tetsuro Degawa... No.
This is an impersonator, Taa Shimizu.

94
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,130
I'll get to the end.

95
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
IMPERSONATOR
TAA SHIMIZU (37)

96
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,170
-He sounds like him.
-You got this!

97
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,700
-That's good.
-Go slowly.

98
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,330
-That's great!
-It's dangerous.

99
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,230
-It's dangerous!
-Okay!

100
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,370
-Be careful.
-Okay!

101
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,130
-Always that stone!
-Yeah, that one.

102
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,830
I did it.

103
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,200
RULE
MERMAN MAY ATTACK USING THE WATER GUN

104
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,870
-Is Kasuga staying there?
-Yeah.

105
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,330
-All the time?
-Yes.

106
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,530
-He's been using his water gun.
-He's great.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,270
-Kasuga, are you stupid?
-That was me, Degawa. I'm sorry.

108
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,770
All right! Let's go!

109
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,100
GOLDEN BOMBER
YUTAKA KYAN (37)

110
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,130
-I hope Kyan makes it.
-Good!

111
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,500
-Be careful.
-Is that stone safe?

112
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,730
That stone! You never know.

113
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,800
He sank slowly.

114
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,000
What a shame.

115
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,030
He sank slower than anyone before.

116
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,100
-Yeah. Not faster than anyone.
-No.

117
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,570
-It felt like being on the elevator.
-Yes.

118
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,230
ADDITIONAL RULE

119
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,900
Here comes another additional rule.

120
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,570
That rule is, obviously...

121
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,070
It's him!

122
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:26,970
TOGI MAKABE

123
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,670
I'll go after anyone who's slow.

124
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,830
It's Makabe!

125
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,530
Takeshi's army will go after you as usual.

126
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,730
Next, two black belt holders
from Yoinjyuku karate school.

127
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,570
They're amazing.
They must have great motor skills.

128
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,200
This is a good chance.

129
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,770
Let's go!

130
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,170
KARATE BLACK BELT
MAIKO ARAI (36)

131
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,270
Makabe is around.

132
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,200
-Is he trying to scare her?
-He's coming.

133
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,770
Is he also jumping across?

134
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,430
He fell into the water.

135
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,470
-His body is...
-Oh dear!

136
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,930
Makabe got in the way.

137
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,200
-I'm out.
-It's scary.

138
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,330
-Let's go!
-You can do it!

139
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,870
KARATE BLACK BELT
RIRIKO KOHINATA (24)

140
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,230
You're doing good!

141
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,930
-She's fast.
-Yeah, she's fast.

142
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,000
You can do it!

143
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,630
Makabe!

144
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,770
You're so good!

145
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,930
He's too slow to catch her.

146
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,370
Two at the same time.

147
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,170
What's the point of him being there?

148
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,300
-You nearly made it.
-I'm so disappointed.

149
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,430
It's funny that you both fell
at the same time.

150
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,330
Really? I couldn't tell though.

151
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,730
I knew he was chasing me,
but I kept my own pace.

152
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,470
-Were you worried he'd catch you?
-Not at all.

153
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,330
-I ignored him.
-Ignored?

154
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,500
-She didn't even notice him.
-Damn you!

155
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,100
-Oh no.
-You're actually scared, right?

156
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,730
No. I am a black belt.

157
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,200
I see.

158
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,800
He's actually being kind.

159
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,830
The next challenger is...

160
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,130
the runner-up
in the Andorra Ultra Trail Race,

161
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,700
which is considered
the toughest race in the world.

162
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,600
Really?

163
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,870
Kenichi Yamamoto,
a leading trail runner in Japan.

164
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,870
A trail runner.

165
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,030
This is similar to using
trail running techniques.

166
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,000
I think trail running is similar
to the Dragon God's Pond.

167
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,830
That's what I came here to find out.

168
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,870
-His intro is long, so he'll succeed.
-Probably.

169
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,870
KENICHI YAMAMOTO (42)

170
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,770
Let's go!

171
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,730
You need the speed. That's right.

172
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,770
-Right! Good!
-He's stable.

173
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,400
What happened? Did he slip?

174
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,230
-No.
-He sank.

175
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,730
-I failed.
-I'm sorry.

176
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,930
-I was terrible.
-It was so close. Well done.

177
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,770
Not even a leading professional athlete
could conquer it.

178
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,430
Is there anyone capable
of conquering the pond today?

179
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,400
There's someone who is passionate
about clearing this game.

180
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,470
REVENGE

181
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,400
I'm here to try again.

182
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,400
MAJOR OIL COMPANY EMPLOYEE
HIROAKI SHINGA (62)

183
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,300
Seriously?

184
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,600
-After 35 years.
-He was in the show back then.

185
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,270
I'm Shinga, from Chiba prefecture.

186
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,800
He was 26 years old.

187
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,070
-General Tani looks so young!
-Amazing!

188
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,830
I work for a lubricating oil company.

189
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,830
Hiroaki Shinga participated
in Takeshi's Castle 35 years ago.

190
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,100
He went to the final!

191
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,170
HE LOST AT THE KARTS BATTLE
35 YEARS AGO

192
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,830
He reached the final battle,
but unfortunately he lost.

193
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,470
These are my daughters,
and this is my son-in-law.

194
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,070
He came here for a second chance,
with his family this time.

195
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,030
-Good luck, Shinga family!
-All right!

196
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,970
The eldest daughter, Megumi,
who almost qualified in high school tennis

197
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,430
for the national tournament,
takes up the challenge.

198
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,670
MEGUMI ISA (36)

199
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,900
I can do it!

200
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,030
Hey, the eldest daughter!

201
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,970
-Did she hit it?
-She hit her face.

202
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,200
The eldest daughter, her face...

203
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,730
Next, Midori, the second daughter,
who participates to celebrate

204
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,800
her mother's 60th birthday,
because she wanted to impress her.

205
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,830
MIDORI SHINGA (32)

206
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,730
Let's go!

207
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,970
Second daughter, good luck!

208
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,900
That area... Oh no!

209
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,470
-Why do they jump there?
-Is it just the momentum?

210
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,370
-It's scary.
-Wow. Amazing.

211
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,930
At the same place...

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,170
They jumped to the same place.
They're sisters.

213
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,730
They're awesome.

214
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,370
While Megumi fell
into the stone-free area,

215
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,130
Midori also dove boldly.

216
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,830
They are in perfect synch, Shinga family.

217
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,170
Shall I go now?

218
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,200
Dad.

219
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,270
-Here he comes.
-He's a legend. He's back after 35 years.

220
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,030
Good luck, Dad!

221
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,670
What a nice family!

222
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,730
HIROAKI SHINGA (62)

223
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,470
I'll make it!

224
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,700
Good luck!

225
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,600
-Dad!
-He's the best one so far.

226
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,230
-So close.
-He even stepped on a sinking stone.

227
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,930
Maybe you can continue with the momentum.

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,800
-It was close.
-So close.

229
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,970
You almost made it.

230
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,430
I'm out. Damn it.

231
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,470
-He hasn't changed.
-What an amazing guy.

232
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,630
He overcame the first sinking stone
with determination.

233
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,730
But he eventually fell.

234
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,630
Once again, Shinga has been defeated
by Takeshi's Castle.

235
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,030
-What a shame.
-I'm so disappointed.

236
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,800
-I couldn't get my revenge.
-I know.

237
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,670
-What a shame!
-What a shame!

238
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,730
-Try again.
-It's a pity I couldn't do it.

239
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,070
-Well done.
-Thank you!

240
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,100
No one cleared Dragon God's Pond.

241
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,700
The Fighting Spirit Award was given
to the three members of Boys and Men

242
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,970
who showed boldness in the challenge
and came close to the finish line.

243
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,070
So close.

244
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,500
4 SURVIVORS

245
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,900
Four people who received
the Fighting Spirit Awards

246
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,230
made it through.

247
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,870
Move forward
to bring down Ennosuke Castle!

248
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,370
What an incredible Dragon God's Pond!
My lord, Ennosuke, we have no survivors.

249
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,570
-There's no favoritism.
-That's right.

250
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,800
The guy who participated 35 years ago
came back again.

251
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,670
I'm quite moved.

252
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,170
-He brought his family.
-I know.

253
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,230
-That's right.
-It's the history of Takeshi's Castle.

254
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,830
This show has been on for so long that
eventually someone comes back for revenge.

255
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,170
-You're right.
-"I'll avenge my great-grandpa."

256
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,170
-That'd be great.
-Indeed.

257
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,170
Let's put them all down in the pond.

258
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,730
All right, the next one's Star Bowling.
Do you remember this?

259
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,400
FIFTH STRONGHOLD, STAY STILL IN A COSTUME
WHILE A GIANT BALL IS COMING AT YOU

260
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,700
-Star Bowling? With Ritsuko Nakayama?
-You remember.

261
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,770
Have you got AI Ritsuko?

262
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,230
I think Ritsuko Nakayama is good.

263
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,730
Star Bowling featured Ritsuko Nakayama,

264
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,970
a famous professional bowler back then.

265
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,000
What transformations have taken place
over the past 34 years?

266
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,130
Let's talk to them.

267
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,130
It looks like a lot of work.

268
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,130
SHIGEKI NAKANISHI

269
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,800
-Hi, there.
-Hello.

270
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,030
-We're too busy right now.
-Are you?

271
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,930
-I'm nostalgic!
-It's called Star Bowling.

272
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,730
-I'm 1.63 m tall, but it's hard to keep...
-You'll fall!

273
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,330
...the balance.

274
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,900
-Is it hard?
-Besides, I'm squatting.

275
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,630
Really? So is it bad
if it sways even a little?

276
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,600
-Please don't rock me.
-Are you saying you want me to?

277
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,170
No. Never.

278
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,630
What? He rejected my call?
What is he doing?

279
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,070
Excuse me.

280
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:51,170
Have you seen a guy in a black cape
and a whistle around here?

281
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,130
Over there.

282
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,970
Over there? I'm not sure which way to go.
It's been 34 years since I've been here.

283
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,230
-But he's over there.
-Yes.

284
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,200
I have no choice.

285
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,830
I feel happy to be up here.

286
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,970
GENERAL
HAYATO TANI

287
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,000
Looks like fun.

288
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,230
You have survived, my elite warriors.

289
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,700
-Fantastic.
-He's great.

290
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,830
It's Star Bowling. It's a team game.
You have to help each other.

291
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,870
What a stage!

292
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,770
Did you get it?

293
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,530
Charge!

294
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,100
-Go!
-Keep going!

295

STAR BOWLING
DIFFICULTY RATING: 72%

296
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,430
If you're still standing after a huge
bowling ball is thrown at you, you win.

297
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,830
It must suck to be the number one pin.

298
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,500
If you can stand until the end
and overcome the fear

299
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,000
of the incoming ball,
you have completed the game.

300
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,730
-It's scary, right?
-Yes.

301
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,970
Who's that?

302
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,430
-Wow!
-There she goes!

303
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,170
-Kyoko Hamaguchi!
-Yes!

-It's Star Bowling!
-Oh my, she's here.

307
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,100
Are you ready?

308
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,270
-She'll be out of control again.
-Right.

309
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,100
Good. Mr. Daruma is...

310
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,770
THE BATTLE AT NAOMI CASTLE

311
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,300
At the battle of
Mr. Daruma is Falling Down,

312
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,500
she was out of control,
ignoring all rules. Now she is back!

313
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,400
It could never end peacefully.

314
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,530
That's not fair!

315
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,270
There's someone I want you to meet.

316
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,470
My precious dad.

317
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,170
Animal Hamaguchi came to join us
as a special guest!

318
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,230
-Fantastic.
-Great.

319
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,770
-We love Kyoko.
-Kyoko!

320
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,800
Here comes her dad.

321
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,130
Let's call our fighting spirit 10 times.
Let's go.

322
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,270
Fighting spirit! Fighting spirit!

323
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,970
Fighting spirit! Fighting spirit!

324
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,130
They're great. Awesome.

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,700
All right!

327
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,870
-They're wonderful.
-Nice.

328
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,300
We have these 10 pins for the first round.

329
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,970
The Female College Student Team
has participated in every battle so far.

330
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,730
Beach Tennis Friends, that includes
a coach of the Japanese national team.

331
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
-They can help each other.
-Right.

332
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,370
-Wait and see. We'll have a blast!
-All right! Let's begin!

333
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,730
I feel bad for number one.

334

FIRST THROW
10 PINS LEFT

335
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm gonna push hard. There!
Get the ball rolling.

336
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,570
Keep it rolling!

337
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,100
-It went to the left.
-Keep going!

338
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,370
It went off to the side. That's lucky.

339
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,470
Wow! Only one pin fell.

340
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,370
MINAMI SUDO (22)

341
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,770
SECOND THROW
9 PINS LEFT

342
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,700
-I'm aiming at number one.
-Okay.

343
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,570
-She can throw twice.
-I see.

344
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,630
There it goes!

345
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,730
All right! Come on!

346
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,430
-That's okay.
-It's not going straight.

347
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,570
-The pin at the back fell down by itself.
-It's down!

348
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,130
No way!

349
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,630
How dare you?

350
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,030
Hey, Kotaro!

351
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,170
KOTARO AIZAWA (42)

352
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,230
I'm out.

353
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,370
HIROMI OKAZAKI (44)

354
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,630
I'm counting on you guys!

355
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,830
DAISUKE TSURUOKA (38)

356
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,130
THIRD THROW
6 PINS LEFT

357
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,170
Come on!

358
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,330
She can throw as many times as she likes?
Does she decide?

359
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,000
In Star Bowling, Kyoko Hamaguchi
throws the ball and decides the rules.

360
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,630
THE BATTLE AT NAOMI CASTLE

361
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,270
She was out of control at the battle
of Mr. Daruma is Falling Down.

362
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,270
Hamaguchi can throw the ball
as many times as she feels like.

363
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,770
You are out!

364
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,670
-That's so unfair.
-That's not fair.

365
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,300
It should be two throws, tops.

366
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,700
THIRD THROW
6 PINS LEFT

367
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,300
-Come on!
-That's not fair!

368
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,370
Let's go!

369
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,300
Go and get it!

370
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,900
It's unfair that she can go
as many times as she wants.

371
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,130
That's going at number one.

372
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,800
MIYUKO ISAKA (21)

373
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,470
Two pins fell down!

374
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,130
I'll leave it to you now!

375
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,030
NAOAKI YAMAMOTO (32)

376
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,130
I don't know why the contestants
don't say it's not fair.

377
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,470
Come on!

378
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,570
Number three, did you say "come on"?

379
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,770
I love that attitude.

380
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,870
FOURTH THROW
4 PINS LEFT

381
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,770
I'll go hard on the next one too.

382
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,370
-Let's go!
-Come on!

383
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,500
Show us what you've got!

384
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,900
-All right!
-Come on!

385
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,200
-Let's go!
-Keep it rolling!

386
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,830
What's this? How will this game end?

387
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,200
Keep going!

388
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,770
Honestly, how do you end this?

389
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,870
Keep going!

390
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,430
Number three!

391
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,630
TEAM WORLD RANK BEACH TENNIS PLAYERS
KEITA ISEKI (30)

392
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,330
She got me!

393
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,200
Let those three win now.

394
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,770
-We want those three to win.
-I think that's fair.

395
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,430
Next, number two.

396
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,670
She's still doing it.

397
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,700
Why is that?

398
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,930
There are three pins left.
Will they all fall?

399
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,470
-I just hope one of them stands.
-Yeah.

400
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,800
-I hope so.
-Good luck.

401
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,570
-Airi!
-Stay there!

402
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,470
FIFTH THROW
3 PINS LEFT

403
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,430
-Hit number two, then four and eight.
-Two, four, and eight.

404
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,630
Can she really still throw?

405
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,230
-Brutal is the right word.
-I agree.

406
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,000
Was this game always like this?

407
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,130
-Keep it going!
-Looks good.

408
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,570
Oh dear. It'll hit them.

409
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,100
-Wow! This is amazing.
-Isn't it?

410
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,730
He withstood it! That pin withstood it!

411
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,400
-She'll stop now.
-For sure.

412
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,600
If she does it again, she's a devil.

413
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,830
She's crying, but the rule is so unfair.

414
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,830
What's your name, number eight?

415
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,800
I'm Michan!

416
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,570
Dad, Michan is awesome!

417
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,100
Okay. Fantastic.

418
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,570
You win the battle
against the Hamaguchi family!

419
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,070
At last, it's over.

420
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,070
Finally, it's over. Number eight.

421
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,070
Michan! Michan!

422
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,130
-Congrats!
-Thank you.

423
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,100
MITSUHIRO OGAWA (54)

424
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,100
He's great.

425
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,170
You're so emotional. How was it?

426
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,770
While everyone was losing,

427
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,000
I couldn't lose,
so I kept strong for them.

428
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,330
By the way, those two at the front
were college girls.

429
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,530
In that case, it was a terrible game.

430
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,530
Look at his T-shirt.
It must've been so hot.

431
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,270
He's soaked as if he fell
into the Dragon God's Pond.

432
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,170
Indeed.

433
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,530
These are the 10 pins
for the second round.

434
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,800
Fellow bartenders
led by the muscular Ichikawa.

435
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,430
Fellow motorcycle media members
participating in matching outfits.

436
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,070
FIRST THROW
10 PINS LEFT

437
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,130
Take them down with the first throw.
Show us your power!

438
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,130
-Number one...
-Aim straight at the center.

439
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,070
All right!

440
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,830
Right at the center!

441
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,230
Come on, you fool!

442
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,400
"You fool."

443
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,270
-Go! Keep going!
-Keep going!

444
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,330
-Number one.
-Oh no! It hit them.

445
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,430
-It stays up.
-It did.

446
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,800
Okay.

447
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,330
Why did I fall? I didn't get hit.

448
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,230
KINA SHIMADA (28)

449
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,170
SECOND THROW
8 PINS LEFT

450
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,200
Which number shall we aim at?
Number three?

451
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,330
All right!

452
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,100
-The pins at the front have no chance.
-No.

453
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,300
Keep going!

454
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,300
-Oh no.
-Stay there.

455
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,200
Keep going!

456
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,570
-Number three stayed up.
-It stayed.

457
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,900
-That's amazing.
-It hit on purpose.

458
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,700
I got hit.

459
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,630
TAKAO AOKI (49)

460
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,770
But it was fun.

461
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,300
He said it was fun. That's good.

462
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,700
THIRD THROW
7 PINS LEFT

463
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,100
Number three was great.
He withstood the hit.

464
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,470
Keep going!

465
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,900
Wow.

466
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,100
-Look at that.
-I did it!

467
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,670
-They're trying to support each other.
-I did it!

468
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,400
The ball came straight at me.

469
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,430
AKITOMO AMAI (26)

470
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,870
I had no choice.

471
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,030
He's right.

472
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,230
FOURTH THROW
4 PINS LEFT

473
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,970
-Hit them all.
-Okay.

474
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,400
The fourth throw now?

475
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,770
That's good.

476
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,600
-This is a good one.
-Keep going.

477
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,670
Hit it!

478
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,470
They're all down!

479
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,370
-You did it!
-I did it!

480
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,200
Why did she hit them all?

481
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,370
This game is unfair.

482
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,000
ALL FAILED

483
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,370
You all failed! You all failed!

484
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,470
What a terrible phrase. "You all failed!"

485
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,370
This is the third and final round.

486
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,070
Yutaka Kyan is an important pin.

487
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:39,530
And four members of BMK,
the junior group of Boys and Men,

488
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,000
who performed well at Dragon God's Pond,
are up to the challenge.

489
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,300
Fighting spirit! Fighting spirit!

490
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,600
Well then.
Decades ago, there was a Takeshi's Castle.

491
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,700
A SUDDEN SPEECH BY KYOKO HAMAGUCHI
TAKESHI'S CASTLE AND DREAMS

492
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,470
Some of these people
wanted to participate then, but didn't.

493
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,600
But today, their dream has come true
and here they stand.

494
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,000
Those people are here.

495
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,400
What is she talking about?

496
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,530
I used to watch Takeshi's Castle
and loved it.

497
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,800
But now I'm here with my dad.

498
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,830
-This is the moment your dreams come true.
-It's a dream.

499
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,670
Life is a dream!
Make your dreams come true!

500
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,730
It's nice that Kyoko Hamaguchi
has gotten into this story setting.

501
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,570
Make your dreams come true!

502
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,230
They'll die. It's too hot.

503
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,030
That was a long speech. Let's begin.

504
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,200
YUTAKA KYAN (37)

505
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,670
My legs hurt.

506
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:40,070
The Hamaguchi family speaks passionately,
but the shooting took place in August.

507
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,970
Inside the costume, the challengers
are losing their strength.

508
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,200
They just want to get on with it.

509
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,530
FIRST THROW
10 PINS LEFT

510
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,400
Okay. Let's go. First, it's number one.

511
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,170
-I'll aim at the center.
-So scary!

512
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,100
Okay. Let's go.

513
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,370
Wow. It's scary.

514
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,430
It's gonna hit Kyan.

515
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,900
-Kyan is so light!
-Oh, Kyan!

516
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,870
A clean sweep with a single throw?

517
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,900
-It's gonna hit Kyan.
-Good luck, Kyan!

518
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,700
-Kyan is so light!
-Oh, Kyan!

519
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,770
-A clean sweep with a single throw?
-It hit right at the center.

520
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,670
So many of them fell down.

521
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,130
Kyoko Hamaguchi's best throw so far,
knocking down six pins in one throw.

522
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,870
Sorry, everyone.

523
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,770
YUTAKA KYAN (37)

524
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,370
I couldn't stay up.

525
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,400
As a referee I can say
her throw was a foul!

526
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,730
REFEREE
GANDHARA SUZUKI (50)

527
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,930
SECOND THROW
4 PINS LEFT

528
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,830
Next, number two.

529
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,300
-He's angry.
-This is fun.

530
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,270
Dad, you go next.

531
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,430
-Let's go!
-Bring it on!

532
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,070
They're up for it.

533
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,530
-Keep going.
-Go!

534
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,600
They'll all fall down.

535
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,630
-Number eight and nine!
-I thought all of them were doomed.

536
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,270
Number eight and nine!

537
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,600
-Great.
-You got two, Dad.

538
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,900
Will they let them be?

539
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,070
He's a legend. I'm so disappointed.

540
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,030
RAITO SHIMIZU (29)

541
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,000
Okay.

542
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,930
It's the worst scenario. Eight pins
knocked down after just two throws.

543
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,400
I'll go see them.

544
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,530
Two members from BMK are still standing.

545
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,530
KYOSUKE KOMETANI (25)

546
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,570
KENNOSUKE MATSUOKA (21)

547
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,800
Will the game end here
and will they survive?

548
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,700
That was left to Kyoko,
who has a weakness for handsome men.

549
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,230
Well.

550
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,230
What?

551
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,400
Number eight and nine, you win!

552
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,630
-They cleared the game.
-They're BMK members.

553
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,370
-We did it!
-They did it.

554
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,930
Two members of BMK,

555
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,670
a junior group of Boys and Men,
got through this game!

556
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,870
-They must have a good balance.
-Well done! Well done!

557
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,600
She says "well done,"
but she knocked the others down.

558
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,670
I know.

559
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,030
3 SURVIVORS

560
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,730
Three survivors withstood the relentless
attacks from the Hamaguchi family.

561
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,170
Ennosuke Ichikawa's castle
is almost there!

562
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,170
The game was so unfair.

563
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,730
-Wasn't that fun?
-It was fun.

564
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,570
Some could overcome being hit.

565
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,130
It may not be just luck.

566
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,100
Some tried to hold others.

567
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,570
Everyone tries to help each other.

568
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,770
-Let's call the count.
-Yeah.

569
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,170
-Our lord!
-It was fun.

570
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,570
-The Hamaguchi family is wonderful.
-Yes.

571
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,300
Rentaro Mikuni and Koichi Sato
wouldn't do that.

572
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,700
-No, they wouldn't.
-No.

573
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,800
Here, we have three games for the losers.

574
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,800
The last chance
for those who lost the battle.

575
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,070
I'll try my best!

576
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,800
HOKKAIDO UNIVERSITY STUDENT, GERMANY
FRANZISKA HEUMANN (29)

577
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,300
Here's the first quiz.

578
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,430
Question.

579
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,200
Which country is next to Italy?

580
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,570
That's difficult.

581
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:57,530
A, France. B, Spain.

582
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,900
-I don't know.
-Spain?

583
00:26:58,970 --> 00:26:59,870
Which is correct?

584
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,700
-She's from Europe.
-Yeah.

585
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,930
-It's B.
-Do you think so?

586
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,230
The UK is next to France, right?

587
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,670
She's sliding that way.

588
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,770
It looks fun, but it might hurt your back.

589
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,700
Men can't do that.

590
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,100
Yeah. You hurt your crotch.

591
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,270
Keep going.

592
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,830
-She's going for A.
-She's going for A.

593
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,370
-Isn't France in the north?
-Is that so?

594
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,230
CORRECT ANSWER
A: FRANCE

595
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,900
-It's A.
-I see.

596
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,570
RETURN TO THE FRONT

597
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,400
-It's C.
-It's Tug of War.

598
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,170
-All right.
-He can do it.

603
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,430
He was lucky.

604

609

614
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,830

615
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,970

-Congrats!
-He did it.

617
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,200

For Katsumi Yamada, who dreams
to get the title of Mr. Takeshi's Castle,

635
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,630
this game is his very last chance
to survive.

636
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,730
MR. SASUKE
KATSUMI YAMADA (56)

637
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,770
-I'm counting on you!
-All right!

638
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,200

-Get it!

641
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,970
He did it. It got in.

642
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,670
Yeah!

643
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,700
Katsumi Yamada finally cleared the game
for the first time.

644

00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,270
He's back to the front line again.

646
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,370
I'm so glad.

647
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,770
The army, which had been split into four,
finally came together.

648
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,370
LOSER RESURRECTION

649
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:45,200
Including those who won the loser's games
and got the Fighting Spirit Award.

650
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:50,170
Twenty-four brave challengers
take on the sixth stronghold

651
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,470
to survive the final battle.

652
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,170
24 SURVIVORS

653
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,170
Everyone, you've survived this long.

654
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,270
THE CAPTAIN
SUBARU KIMURA

655
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,970
Do you have any strength left?

656
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,130
-They're pumped up.
-Fantastic!

657
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,070
-That lady in a blue jacket.
-Me?

658
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,470
How do you feel now?

659
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,730
-It's too difficult.
-Okay.

660
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,470
Thanks to my good luck, I got this far.

661
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,770
-Thanks to your good luck. Keep it going.
-Thanks!

662
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,230
-Good.
-I think I used up all my good luck.

663
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,400
She used it all up.

664
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,900
Don't say such a thing. You'll be fine!

665
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,800
I'm sure you'll make it to the end.

666
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,800
Are you up for it?

667
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,030
Can you make it till the end?

668
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,170
Fantastic!

669
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,430
Now you'll play a tough game, Block Block.

670
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,570
All right, let's go.

671
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,100
Looks amazing!

672
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,600
Charge!

673
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,230
Good luck!

674
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,500
Nice! That's good!

675
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:58,930
BLOCK BLOCK
DIFFICULTY RATING: 92%

676
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,130
-Block Block, go and get it!
-Good luck!

677
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:10,530
The spirit of the army that gathered
from the four strongholds is at its peak.

678
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,030
They can use this momentum
to bring down the next stronghold!

679
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,300
It's like a festival.

680
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:19,170
I'm the biggest Takeshi's Castle
geek of all.

681
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,230
It's Murphy!

682
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,230
The first challenger of Block Block

683
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,870
is a frenzied fan of Takeshi's Castle,
Joshua Murphy from America.

684
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,230
-Murphy.
-Good luck.

685
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,530
Murphy!

686
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,430
DIEHARD FAN OF TAKESHI'S CASTLE
JOSHUA MURPHY (31)

687
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,330
-Go, Murphy!
-To the next block.

688
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,270
Why?

689
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,070
Why? How come?

690
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,170
-Is it so hard?
-It was the wrong timing.

691
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,530
He just gave up.

692
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,330
-Why did you come?
-He didn't even try.

693
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,900
He was just sitting there.

694
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,770
-Good luck!
-You're now rooting for them.

695
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,370
You'd rather cheer for them
instead of trying.

696
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,170
Charge!

697
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,530
-They need to watch out for the triangle.
-You're right.

698
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,330
-The rotation of the triangle.
-Right.

699
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,930
They're so excited.

700
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,200
RUBEN BARRENA (34)

701
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,600
I'll do it for my fellow participants.

702
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,670
-Go, Ballena!
-Let's go.

703
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,100
GET TO THE GOAL
BY JUMPING ON ROTATING BLOCKS

704
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,800
Those blocks are huge!

705
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,430
-Get there.
-Quick!

706
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,930
That's it! Next one!

707
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,370
Watch out!

708
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,270
It's so dangerous!

709
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,570
It's so much fun.

710
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,930
The next challenger...

711
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,570
She came to Japan
because of her love of Japanese animation.

712
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:46,570
Erika wants to promote Japanese anime
through her own costumes.

713
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,070
SUPPORT ENGINEER, SPAIN
ERIKA MARTINEZ (30)

714
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,600
I'll try my best!

715
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,930
-Good luck!
-Be careful!

716
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,370
Erika! Erika!

717
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,770
-This is so much fun.
-It's amazing.

718
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,330
You got this!

719
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,330
Erica!

720
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,470
Keep calm.

721
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,330
That's it! Go!

722
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,770
What was that?

723
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
SIGH...

724
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,770
-It's tough. No chance.
-No chance?

725
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,800
She's right.

726
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,300
-Can anyone finish this?
-I know.

727
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,870
Who created this game?

728
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,630
-She's pissed off.
-Yeah.

729
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,000
They're crazy.

730
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,130
She says we're crazy.

731
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,870
Next...

732
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,630
Aren't those the Boys and Men?

733
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,400
Next, three members of Boys and Men

734
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,430
who got the Fighting Spirit Award
at the battle of Dragon God's Pond.

735
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,370
BOYS AND MEN: TAMURA, HONDA, HIRAMATSU

736
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,600
They'll be fine.

737
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,670
-Charge!
-They have a good sense of rhythm.

738
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,230
I'll clear this. Come on, Boys and Men!

739
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,870
Good luck!

740
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,300
BOYS AND MEN
YUKIHISA TAMURA (31)

741
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,530
Tamura!

742
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,100
Keep going!

743
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,100
-He's good.
-Great!

744
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,170
-Great.
-He can do it.

745
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,630
Oh, no! He'll fall.

746
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,570
He overcame the triangle.

747
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,700
-He rushed to the next one.
-He couldn't get on it.

748
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,100
Why?

749
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,930
That was a nice try!

750
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,030
You need to jump when it's like this,

751
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,170
-otherwise you can't get on it.
-Indeed.

752
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,900
Charge!

753
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,970
All right! I got this.

754
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,170
BOYS AND MEN
TAKAFUMI HONDA (29)

755
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,630
Prince! Prince!

756
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,500
Prince!

757
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,730
Go, Prince!

758
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,670
Prince! Prince!

759
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,130
Show them what a real prince is made of.

760
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,270
He's okay.

761
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,300
You're doing great, Prince!

762
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,870
-Prince!
-He's fine. Great.

763
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,830
-He's awesome.
-He's gone that way? No!

764
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,100
So close!

765
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,430
I've got it now.

766
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,370
-I can say whatever I like as an observer.
-Yes.

767
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:57,270
The next challenger from Boys and Men,
Kento Hiramatsu.

768
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,530
BOYS AND MEN
KENTO HIRAMATSU (27)

769
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,100
Keep going!

770
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,300
That was too late. It's difficult.

771
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,600
He couldn't overcome
the blue plus sign either.

772
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,970
All three failed
at exactly the same place.

773
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,230
They're good friends.

774
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,330
The same spot.

775
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,300
-At exactly the same place.
-The three of us at the same place.

776
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,600
The hardest part of Block Block
is clearly the blue cross.

777
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,930
Getting over the blue cross
is the key to clearing this game.

778
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,170
YOUNGER BROTHERS BMK ACCEPT THE CHALLEGE!

779
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,330
These young brothers
come to settle the score.

780
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,600
The next challengers are members of BMK,
a junior group of Boys and Men.

781
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,930
Two Star Bowling winners
who endured the relentless attacks

782
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,570
from the Hamaguchi family,
now take on the challenge.

783
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,000
Get on the updraft!

784
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,900
They're young. They can do it.

785
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,000
Charge!

786
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,970
All right! I'll do my best!

787
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,600
BMK
KYOSUKE KOMETANI (25)

788
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,870
-Komechan!
-Good!

789
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,570
Get to the blue cross first.

790
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,930
You're doing good! You can do it!

791
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,770
-He got there.
-Awesome!

792
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,530
-He got there.
-Awesome!

793
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,000
The next block is the star.

794
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,330
Can he make it? Oh, no...

795
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,000
When someone clears it,
the others will know how.

796
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,900
That's right.

797
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,570
Kometani reached the yellow star
for the first time.

798
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:38,070
A brilliant attempt to encourage
the army to follow suit.

799
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,870
-Komechan was great.
-Yeah. He showed us his spirit.

800
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,700
As his fellow team member, I feel proud
and I want to clear this game.

801
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,430
-Come on!
-Awesome!

802
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,530
Go for it!

803
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,930
-I'll do it!
-Good luck!

804
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,630
BMK
KENNOSUKE MATSUOKA (21)

805
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,370
They're so pumped up.
It's like a festival.

806
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,500
Too slow! No, he did it.

807
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,630
Get on it quick!

808
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,970
Good!

809
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,800
All right!

810
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,600
Great! He did it!

811
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,370
-Keep going!
-Get over there!

812
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,670
Quick! Go quick!

813
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,700
His strength is running out!

814
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,800
His strength is running out!

815
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,670
-Go back to the blue one!
-Go back!

816
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,200
Almost there!

817
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,770
So close!

818
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,500
Matsuoka was very close
to the finish line,

819
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,830
but the rotation of the block
pushed him back and he fell.

820
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,300
He couldn't conquer Block Block.

821
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,270
-You were so close.
-I'm sorry!

822
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,070
One more step...

823
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,700
-He's losing his voice.
-This is so much fun.

824
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,730
-You did so well!
-Thank you.

825
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,130
-Well done!
-Thanks!

826
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,200
The next challenger

827
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:04,370
is Risa Okuma, the only challenger
who cleared From Right and Left.

828
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,600
It's Okuma!

829
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,700
Can she conquer Block Block as well?

830
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,400
-She's hopeful.
-Charge!

831
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,130
RISA OKUMA (22)

832
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,970
I'm the only one to have cleared
the first game. I believe I can do this!

833
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,100
We know! Good luck!

834
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,600
Risa!

835
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,530
Good luck!

836
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,630
-Keep calm!
-You got this!

837
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,470
-Good luck!
-You got this!

838
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,770
-Those blocks are huge.
-Yeah.

839
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,000
You're doing great. Stay calm.

840
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,400
Keep calm.

841
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:39,600
-Next one. She'll jump. Oh no...
-Not that way!

842
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,830
Keep calm.

843
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,970
-Next one. She'll jump. Oh no...
-Not that way!

844
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,830
That was the wrong timing.

845
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,500
She was too late.

846
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,230
Is that the right timing? Really?

847
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,900
I know. So does everyone.

848
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:01,730
She seemed to have timed it carefully,
but she crashed head-on into a green wall.

849
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,830
Takeshi's Castle is not that easy.

850
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm so disappointed.

851
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,070
Was it difficult?

852
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,430
Well. I couldn't think properly.

853
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,930
You were too hasty.

854
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,170
When should I go?

855
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,730
Hey, Kyan!

856
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,730
YUTAKA KYAN (37)

857
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,170
The army's elite continue to take on

858
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,770
one difficult challenge after another.

859
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,370
WORLD RANK BEACH TENNIS PLAYER
MITSUHIRO OGAWA (54)

860
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,700
That's amazing.

861
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,030
CLEARED MUSHROOM PLOP
RYOTA YOSHIDA (18)

862
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,100
He's great.

863
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,370
Yet, no one has succeeded.

864
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,730
The fiercest challengers
are falling into the water.

865
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,070
OTTER FAIRY
CHIITAN

866
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,070
That's too dangerous.

867
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,700
It says "Mostly successful."

868
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,270
-Really?
-Not even close.

869
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,370
-Was it mostly successful?
-No way!

870
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:53,270
Haru Yamaguchi,
a current high school student

871
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:57,030
who successfully cleared
a very difficult game, Mushroom Plop.

872
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,400
-He's sporty.
-Sure.

873
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:02,900
I'd like to be the youngest
to clear this one and get everyone going.

874
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,570
-He'll be a hero if he makes it.
-Charge!

875
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,570
-Good luck!
-He might make it.

876
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,470
Let's go!

877
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,730
-He's hopeful.
-He's a fast runner.

878
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,030
Show us what you've got!

879
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,000
Haru! Haru!

880
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,870
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT
HARU YAMAGUCHI (16)

881
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,170
Haru! Haru!

882
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,470
-That's right!
-Great!

883
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,370
-Fantastic!
-He's still going!

884
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,170
-Go!
-Awesome!

885
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,430
-You got this! Go!
-He'll make it!

886
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,730
He did it!

887
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,370
-Go!
-Awesome!

888
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,630
-You got this! Go!
-He'll make it!

889
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,130
He did it!

890
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,370
-You got this! Go!
-He'll make it!

891
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,070
He did it!

892
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,930
You got this! Go!

893
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,630
He did it!

894
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,070
-He did it!
-Seriously?

895
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,070
All right!

896
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,570
Is he for real?

897
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,000
Fantastic!

898
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,770
Awesome!

899
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,030
You did it!

900
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,700
Well done!

901
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,130
-He's awesome!
-Seriously.

902
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,670
-He's so lean.
-The only survivor?

903
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,470
Why could he clear it that easily?

904
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,700
He overcame the blocks so smoothly,

905
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:19,000
and finished in a spectacular fashion!

906
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,470
A high school student, Haru Yamaguchi,

907
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,500
will advance to the final battle
at Ennosuke Castle!

908
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,070
Well done!

909
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,000
-Congrats!
-Thanks!

910
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,470
-You're the first one to clear it.
-You're awesome.

911
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:38,200
When I was interviewed earlier,
I said I would clear it first.

912
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,730
-I'm so glad I actually did it.
-You're super cool!

913
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,470
With this spirit,
you can win the final battle.

914
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,570
-Let's do that!
-Congratulations!

915
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,030
Thank you!

916
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,770
Mr. Yamada's coming.

917
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:50,970
-It's him.
-Mr. Yamada!

918
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:54,070
This man's time has finally come.

919
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,770
We believe in him.

920
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,130
He came here dreaming to get
the title of Mr. Takeshi's Castle.

921
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,530
Yamada didn't perform well at all.

922
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,800
That was awful.

923
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:08,300
At the Loser Resurrection,
he cleared a game for the first time.

924
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:12,930
With this momentum,
can he make it to the final battle?

925
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,330
I'm sure he'll pull it off!

926
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,730
I'll run through the red, green,
and blue blocks to get to the yellow one.

927
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,570
I'm not afraid of falling anymore.
I've fallen over and over again.

928
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,800
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

929
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,700
Good luck.

930
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,770
"Everyone calls me Mr. Sasuke.

931
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,700
"It can't end here.

932
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,600
"Younger fellows love me.
Other challengers shed tears.

933
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,170
"I owe it to all of you
to live up to your expectations.

934
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,000
"I'll prove it to you right here and now.

935
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,270
"Katsumi Yamada can still do it!"

936
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,630
-Mr. Yamada, show us you're a legend here!
-Please!

937
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,470
Good luck, Mr. Yamada!

938
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,200
-Good luck!
-You got this!

939
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,970
Will Mr. Sasuke be able to get the title
of Mr. Takeshi's Castle?

940
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,970
Katsumi Yamada, 56 years old.

941
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,170
The timing is key.

942
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,970
I'll get through this. Count on me.

943
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,970
Yamada!

944
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,230
They're cheering for Yamada.

945
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,600
He's a legend after all.

946
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,570
Can he take those cheers
and turn them into power?

947
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,600
Can Mr. Sasuke get across in one go?

948
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,630
He said he was going to run through it.
He got to the green one.

949
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,470
-Is he okay? He's calm.
-Watch out.

950
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,300
Can he clear Block Block?

951
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,970
-You got it!
-Is he okay?

952
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:33,200
He needs to get over this one.

953
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,370
Otherwise, he'll fall backwards.

954
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,030
He's getting slower. Yamada!

955
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,130
Yamada!

956
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,600
What a way to fall!

957
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,600
-What was that?
-What a way to fall!

958
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,200
-You got it!
-He's all right.

959
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:55,470
The sixth stronghold,
Block Block in the dark of night.

960
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,770
Katsumi Yamada,

961
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:01,800
in a dark Takeshi's Castle,
again disappearing beneath the water.

962
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,830
He doesn't show us
any prowess at Takeshi's Castle.

963
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,470
What was that then?

964
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,700
He didn't panic, not even once.

965
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,730
How come he's so calm?

966
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,370
I tried to get over it with my legs.

967
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,270
Look at his hair through those holes...

968
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,500
A student settles the score
for his master.

969
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,570
Here he comes.

970
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:30,100
Sasuke finalist, Yoshiyuki Yamamoto.

971
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,270
He's great.

972
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:35,270
To reach the final of Sasuke,

973
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:39,230
it was Mr. Yamada who guided him
through hard training.

974
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,730
I can still do it.

975
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,830
He and Yamada always
worked together at Takeshi's Castle,

976
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,600
and Mr. Yamada has been
his biggest supporter,

977
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,230
working together
and improving each other's skills.

978
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,370
For his master's sake,

979
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:58,730
he wants to advance
to the final battle at all costs.

980
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,470
-Here he goes.
-Charge!

981
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,600
-His student is good.
-He can make it.

982
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,470
Sasuke finalist, Yoshiyuki Yamamoto,
29 years old.

983
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,970
I'll clear this!

984
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,700
He's the ace from the Black Tigers.

985
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:14,830
Katsumi Yamada couldn't get the title
of Mr. Takeshi's Castle.

986
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,200
Now he entrusts his spirit to his student.

987
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,230
YOSHIYUKI YAMAMOTO (29)

988
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,130
He started moving,
while he hears his name.

989
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,000
He jumped onto the green one.

990
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,370
He's calm.

991
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,800
The same green block
his master couldn't overcome.

992
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:30,170
He needs to jump to the blue cross.
He's very calm.

993
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,900
He moved onto the blue block.

994
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,070
He did it.

995
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:37,430
He's the absolute ace, expected
to win a flawless victory in Sasuke.

996
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,700
He's getting over the rotating blue cross.

997
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,470
-Cheering and clapping.
-There he is.

998
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,630
His master's cheering for him.

999
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:51,370
His master entrusted him
with the title of Mr. Takeshi's Castle.

1000
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:56,600
Getting over the yellow star
and he threw himself onto the goal!

1001
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,330
-Wow!
-He's awesome!

1002
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,170
Yoshiyuki Yamamoto!

1003
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:04,930
His steel-like body
and his cheerful nature.

1004
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,870
-He looks proud.
-Yeah. He did it.

1005
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,670
He settled the score for his master!

1006
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,300
The second winner!

1007
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:11,230
I did it!

1008
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,800
2 SURVIVORS

1009
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:16,430
Thanks to his success,
now two challengers cleared Block Block.

1010
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:21,670
Finally, we'll have the final battle
at Ennosuke Castle.

1011
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,100
Wow! Two challengers!

1012
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,970
Two of them. They got through.

1013
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,300
That was Block Block.

1014
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:31,230
I thought I was done,
but now I have to go to the castle.

1015
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,670
-That's right.
-You have to.

1016
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,630
Two challengers made it to the final.

1017
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,070
-That boy with super motor skills...
-Yamaguchi!

1018
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,270
-He's fantastic!
-I know!

1019
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,470
-Yes.
-He's awesome.

1020
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,930
We should be careful.

1021
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,570
Plus Yamamoto, Mr. Yamada's student
from the Black Tigers.

1022
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,970
-He avenged his master.
-Sure.

1023
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:52,730
-Count!
-Count!

1024
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,800
Are you gonna be okay?

1025
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:58,270
We'll have a head-on battle now.

1026
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:01,100
You can't afford to lose.

1027
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,270
Ennosuke, make sure you win. All right?

1028
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,000
Of course, I will.

1029
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,900
I'll get ready and be on my way now.

1030
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,130
Don't rattle on. I'm counting on you.

1031
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,770
Trust me!

1032
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,300
He says, "Trust me,"
but the count says, "Don't rattle on."

1033
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,830
This isn't a conversation.

1034
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,100
The AI is starting to rattle a little...

1035
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,570
We'll fight for you, our lord.

1036
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,570
I trust you. I'm counting on you.

1037
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,470
-Shall we go now?
-Yes, let's go!

1038
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:29,700
-Let's go!
-Yes!

1039
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,800
The brave warriors who have conquered

1040
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:44,330
the impregnable strongholds
and made it to the final battle,

1041
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,730
now charge toward Ennosuke Castle.

1042
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,930
I can't wait.

1043
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,400
Are you excited?

1044
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,770
Here comes the lord of the castle!

1045
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:02,070
LORD OF THE THIRD FORTRESS
ENNOSUKE ICHIKAWA

1046
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,470
It's time for a battle!

1047
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,570
He was born for it. Excellent. So cool.

1048
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,830
He looks so cool.

1049
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,030
"It's time for a battle."

1050
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,970
You're right, Lord Ennosuke.

1051
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,400
You're an Omodakaya. You're so cool.

1052
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,670
Omodakaya!

1053
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,170
But how was it? Amazing, right?

1054
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,770
I thought it was like Disneyland.

1055
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:29,570
-Isn't it?
-I got so excited.

1056
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,430
-Takeshi's Castle, right?
-That's great.

1057
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,900
-Wait a second!
-What?

1058
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:34,900
What is this?

1059
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,470
-Hey, you. I've finally found you.
-What?

1060
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,000
That is my line.

1061
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,570
-What's up with him?
-Something's going on.

1062
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:48,770
I'm the one who appointed you
as the captain.

1063
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,030
Right...

1064
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,800
-But, I heard a rumor.
-What is it?

1065
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,070
I hear you are fighting this battle
out of spite.

1066
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:59,070
That's right. You're so right.

1067
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:01,770
That hateful Beat Takeshi...

1068
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:05,300
That hateful Beat Takeshi
who took my mother's life.

1069
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,500
I'll avenge her.

1070
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,900
-No!
-Shut up!

1071
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:11,030
-Is this Takeshi's Castle?
-Oh dear.

1072
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,730
-No, you can't do that!
-Shut up! Shut up!

1073
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,970
Why can't I do that, Father?

1074
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,400
-They're father and son.
-I see.

1075
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,530
Are you done?

1076
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,530
Sorry. We got so into it.

1077
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,870
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry!

1078
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,100
Lord Ennosuke is here.

1079
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,200
Shall we begin the battle?

1080
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,870
Shall we fight?

1081
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,400
Shall we fight?

1082
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:39,170
-Let's fight!
-Yes, let's fight!

1083
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:41,000
-Right.
-Here they are.

1084
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:46,200
-Here comes the army's elite.
-Sorry for keeping you waiting.

1085
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,370
-A word, please.
-Yeah. Let's hear it.

1086
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,970
I'll dedicate our victory to Mr. Yamada.

1087
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,870
-I'll try my best!
-All right!

1088
00:49:55,930 --> 00:50:00,200
So far I've never failed.
So I want to win this battle and...

1089
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:04,600
-move on to the next one.
-Okay!

1090
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,670
They're not good with speeches,
but they're the elite, right?

1091
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:11,730
-They're good.
-He's the youngest challenger of all.

1092
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,930
-How old are you?
-I'm 16.

1093
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,900
-Wow!
-Is he that young?

1094
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:20,200
-It's better to pick young shoots early.
-Well said!

1095
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,670
He's a nasty guy.

1096
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:25,470
I want the young shoots to grow.

1097
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,370
You're so nice.

1098
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:31,200
-Be strong and fight.
-A word, please.

1099
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:32,270
Sure.

1100
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,230
All right!

1101
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,530
-Prepare yourselves!
-Yes!

1102
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,600
-We're up for it!
-Let's do our best!

1103
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,730
That's great.

1104
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,930
YABUSAME

1105
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,830
The final battle of the night
is called Yabusame.

1106
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,600
Both parties will board their carriages,
but only the army's will be mobile.

1107
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,570
From there, they will aim at the target
on the other person's carriage.

1108
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:59,570
The army wins if they can get
a ball into the red basket.

1109
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,170
Takeshi's army wins
if their ball hits the blue banner.

1110
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:09,800
But if both succeed, it'll be deemed
a draw and neither wins.

1111
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:14,500
Come on, bring the shooting machine!

1112
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,700
Finally!

1113
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,700
-Here it comes.
-This is the one!

1114
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:21,530
-Looks great!
-Yeah!

1115
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,630
There you go.

1116
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:30,000
Ennosuke's shooting machine looks so cool.

1117
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,770
Looks quite rugged.

1118
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,770
ONLY ONE WIN IS NEEDED
TO RECEIVE A MILLION YEN

1119
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:38,570
The first challenger
is a high school student, Haru Yamaguchi.

1120
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,770
He's a physical monster who cleared
the tough games Mushroom Plop

1121
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:47,970
and Block Block,
and survived till the end.

1122
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:51,000
This is great. I feel like a pilot.

1123
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,500
-Can you do it?
-Of course I can. I'll try my best.

1124
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,400
I'm nervous.

1125
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:57,630
FATHER
MINORU

1126
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,030
But I believe he will win.

1127
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,500
-Wonderful.
-I know he can do it.

1128
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,370
THE FIRST FORTRESS
UEDA CASTLE

1129
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:06,730
At the battle of the first fortress,
Shinya Ueda's castle,

1130
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,330
and the second fortress,
Naomi Watanabe's castle...

1131
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,830
THE SECOND FORTRESS
NAOMI CASTLE

1132
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,130
...the army unleashed a fantastic attack
and almost caught the enemy by surprise.

1133
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:20,870
Today is the day
to throw the ball in and win!

1134
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,470
-I can see a ball inside here.
-That's so close.

1135
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:28,500
For the first round, from Takeshi's army,
the lord of the castle himself will fight.

1136
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,030
What will happen?

1137
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:35,270
YABUSAME
DIFFICULTY RATING: 200%

1138
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,770
All right. Yabusame, first round.
Let's begin.

1139
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,070
Good luck!

1140
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,800
It's coming!

1141
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:59,300
-It's a hit!
-You've got it!

1142
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,300
Yeah!

1143
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,000
It's coming again!

1144
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,130
It's a hit!

1145
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,370
That one hit the target!

1146
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,100
-It hit again!
-You've got it!

1147
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,930
It won't get in. Seriously?

1148
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,600
THE ARMY FAILED

1149
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,770
He failed?

1150
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,900
-He failed?
-Oh no.

1151
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:37,030
TAKESHI'S ARMY WINS

1152
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,230
Lord Ennosuke, great job!

1153
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,400
Seriously? So disappointing.

1154
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:47,470
That was an onslaught from Lord Ennosuke.

1155
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:53,300
Once the third shot hit,
he didn't lose the target.

1156
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,100
A robust attack.

1157
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:57,700
This one.

1158
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:01,100
On the other hand,
the balls from the army...

1159
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,970
One ball actually got in. So close.

1160
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,630
-Oh dear.
-So close!

1161
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,430
-He did well.
-One ball got in.

1162
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,900
-Wow.
-He's amazing.

1163
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:13,700
-Well done.
-Nice work.

1164
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:18,100
-Lord Ennosuke is the winner!
-Yeah!

1165
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,400
-Thanks.
-Yay!

1166
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:20,870
Wonderful.

1167
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:26,330
-What a shame. I'm so disappointed.
-I bet. What do you think of the rules?

1168
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:29,930
It's so unfair. Very unfair.

1169
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,870
Very unfair?

1170
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,600
The last challenger from the army

1171
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,430
is Katsumi Yamada's best student,
Yoshiyuki Yamamoto.

1172
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,000
-If you hit it, you'll win. Good luck.
-Thank you.

1173
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:46,270
The dream of getting the title
of Mr. Takeshi's Castle

1174
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:51,670
was pursued by his mentor, Katsumi Yamada.

1175
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,700
Now that Yamada is out,
his unfulfilled dream

1176
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,900
has been entrusted
to his best student, Yamamoto.

1177
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:04,900
Finally, please give him
a motivating and helpful piece of advice.

1178
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:08,330
-You can do it! Let's do this!
-All right. I will do it!

1179
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,370
WIFE
MARINA

1180
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:11,400
Charge!

1181
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:12,670
All right!

1182
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,770
-Thank you.
-You can do it!

1183
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,770
From Takeshi's army, it's Osamu Shitara.

1184
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:23,370
I get anxious when it's my turn.

1185
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:28,570
I've been watching their attacks,
and the ball hits this target.

1186
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,800
The next one
is the guy from Black Tiger, right?

1187
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:32,370
I'm scared.

1188
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,030
But I'll beat him.

1189
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:39,930
Takeshi's Castle
can't be brought down that easily.

1190
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,200
-You're right.
-Sure.

1191
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:45,500
Will the army pull off
a miraculous victory?

1192
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,770
It's the final round of Yabusame.

1193
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:51,400
Here comes the second round
of Yabusame.

1194
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,470
Charge!

1195
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,570
You got this!

1196
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:13,370
-Keep shooting.
-Good!

1197
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:17,930
You got this!

1198
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:22,530
Good! Keep going!

1199
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,530
You've got it!

1200
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,730
You got this!

1201
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,830
Good. You got it!

1202
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,130
It's all right!

1203
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,470
Did I get it?

1204
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,930
THE ARMY FAILED

1205
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,130
We won!

1206
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,430
It didn't get in.

1207
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
-Damn it!
-Oh no!

1208
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,230
TAKESHI'S ARMY WINS

1209
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,430
I'm so glad.

1210
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:54,230
-You smashed the target!
-You did!

1211
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,270
Before the game started,
Shitara was anxious.

1212
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,870
He shot balls at the center of the target
and smashed it.

1213
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,830
Takeshi's army defeated the opponents
and won a total victory.

1214
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:12,600
-Well, well...
-A total victory!

1215
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:15,070
Takeshi's army won!

1216
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:16,830
We did it!

1217
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,200
We did it!

1218
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:26,300
-Fireworks!
-Looks awesome!

1219
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:29,300
-We never lose!
-But if I were a challenger,

1220
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:33,770
I would go, "Damn it! There's no way
I could make it fit into that hole!"

1221
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,700
Next, Takeshi is coming!

1222
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:42,330
NEXT EPISODE,
ROBUST ATTACK AT TAKESHI'S MAIN CASTLE

1223
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,070
The strongest army in history finally
launches an attack on Takeshi's Castle.

1224
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:50,900
An elite group of challengers
selected from the three previous battles

1225
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:55,700
will take on a more challenging game
in an attempt to bring down the castle.

1226
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,700
The most powerful assassin is coming.

1227
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:10,030
Hey, merman.

1228
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,830
Well done.

1229
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,530
WHAT IS CAPTAIN KIMURA UP TO...

1230
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:27,400
THE ASSASSINS AT ENNOSUKE CASTLE

1231
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:33,300
WATER MARSHAL, TOM BROWN

1232
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:36,700
It's been a long time
since I've seen such a fun show.

1233
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:39,230
-Everyone is pumped up.
-Yeah.

1234
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,330
It's a show where you can feel the energy.

1235
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,870
STRUGGLING WITH THE INCREDIBLE MACHINE,
YOSHIAKI UMEGAKI

1236
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:47,800
WATER GUN

1237
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:50,530
I can shoot quite far with this,
but I haven't used it.

1238
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,070
HE WANTED TO USE THE WATER GUN

1239
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,500
No time to use this.
I want to shoot someone too.

1240
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:05,870
MERMAN, AUDREY KASUGA

1241
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,000
The merman got her!

1242
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:14,130
A GREAT JOB SINKING THE ARMY
ONE AFTER ANOTHER

1243
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,200
He sank. Yes!

1244
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:18,370
This gun's got some fire power.

1245
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,230
BOWLING MONSTERS
HAMAGUCHI FAMILY

1246
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,370
-This is the place for Dad and Kyoko.
-The place for us!

1247
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:29,570
-You throw a ball and make them fall.
-Right.

1248
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:32,070
-Number two and eight!
-Go and get it!

1249
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,500
Go and get it!

1250
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:37,300
SERIOUS MEETING AND PRACTICE

1251
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,030
I used to watch this. It was fun.

1252
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,330
THOUGHTS ABOUT THE SHOW

1253
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,630
I'm on the show now.
It's like a dream, but it's real.

1254
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:47,800
GOING ON A SHOOTING RAMPAGE!

1255
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:50,270
Love, love, love!

1256
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,970
It was so much fun.

1257
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:57,230
Takeshi's Castle is fulfilling our dream.

1258
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,300
-Let's say "Dream" 10 times.
-Okay.

1259
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:00,530
Let's go.

1260
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,230
Dream, dream, dream!

1261
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,600
It's a dream!

1262
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,700
-Love, love, love! Dream!
-All right!

1263
