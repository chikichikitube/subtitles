00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
(This is a recap of part 1. Skip to 2:10 for the start of this one)

2
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,070
I'm hungry!

3
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,270
You okay?

4
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,710
Oh shit, I'm starving!

5
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,820
I wonder why

6
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,560
I really did it now

7
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,490
Should've ordered more!

8
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,070
"Even after three stores, there's no end to their hunger!"

9
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,160
They've got lots of stuff!

10
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,040
"Next restaurant, with over 1000 locations in Japan,"

11
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,780
"ice cream specialist, 31 ice cream"

12
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,270
"With lots of variety,"

13
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,070
"and whatever size you would like"

14
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,220
"What awaits these hungry five?"

15
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,360
Would you like to try these samples?

16
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,960
The senpai should try them first

17
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,930
What are you waiting for?

18
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,380
You can have this one

19
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,420
No sorry I'm the kouhai (junior)

20
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,870
No no no take it, take it

21
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,870
No sorry I'm the kouhai (junior)

22
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,470
This is our recommendation

23
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,470
Senpai

24
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,110
"The hungry five devour their samples"

25
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,110
"Hamada raises concerns"

26
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,640
Hold on, what will we do here?

27
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,420
There's lot's of variety

28
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,800
For one person, this is a lot of volume

29
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,490
excuse me a second

30
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,620
What, what do you mean?

31
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,530
It's just,

32
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,240
you wanna eat this by yourself?

33
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,470
If you wanna eat i-

34
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,200
I really do wanna eat it but,

35
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,930
I have too many cavities

36
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,200
Yeah tha-

37
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,570
Stop lying!

38
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,160
"Hungry Drive, Restaurant #4"

39
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,020
So what? We share it?

40
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,760
We can't really split this

41
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,440
We can't split this,

42
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,110
Matsumoto-san you like this right?

43
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,580
Yeah I uh yeah

44
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,730
I could eat 1

45
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,710
Is that so?

46
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,710
Of course, go ahead

47
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,090
There's no way,

48
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,510
you guys don't want some?

49
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,960
Well I'm having some

50
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,130
I am-

51
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,130
Of course, of course

52
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,130
"Nobody here agrees that they don't want any"

53
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,600
OK then order some, order some

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,070
Alright

55
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,070

59
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,090
That seems good

60
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,090
That seems good

61
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,670
Hell yeah!

62
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,330
I asked which has the most volume!

63
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,960
No, no

64
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,960
That's all you did?

65
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,730
All you did was ask?

66
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,980
You have to eat that one

67
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,690

Get them to write "TANAKA" on it

98
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,240

Please enjoy!

127
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,400
You're the tallest in many ways

That's sweet!

129
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,000
Here I go!

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,430
I could eat so many

131
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,000
Are you hiring part-timers?

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,160
We are

133
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,090
You are?!

134
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,110
I'll talk to my wife about it

135
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,090
I could just keep eating!

136
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,090
Right?

137
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,670
Should you order more?

138
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,130
I'm honestly thinking about it

139
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,390
Oh really?

140
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,180
Endo should get more

141
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,560
You're finishing that quickly

142
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,200
I could totally go for seconds

143
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,960
You should get a double or something

144
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,070
No uhh-

145
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,070
Or a king waffle

146
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,560
I'm being serious here

147
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,020
Is he actually being serious?

148
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,940
Yeah I think so

149
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,620
Not just for TV or anything

150
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,020
He said not just for TV

151
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,180
What if you order a double, I'm saying

152
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Not just for TV

153
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,180
Endo?

154
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,800

159
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,040

Who are you waving to?

185
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,470
You're waving to Tsu-tsun? (staff member)

186
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,670
He's a staff member!

187
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,220

194
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,110
Yeah I'm really loving this

195
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,290
I see you're just making it tastier

196
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,710
It's already finished!

197
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,070
Damn it, I'm done!

198
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,070
No more

199
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,930
"Only Tanaka is left"

200
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,870
You don't wanna eat that?

201
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,200
You don't wa-

202
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,730
What the hell did you say?

203
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,690
You're eating slowly

204
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,690
You're eating slowly

205
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,390
If you wanted to eat it, you'd be faster

206
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,600
This is so damn good

207
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,490
Really?

208
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,490
Yeah

209
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,690
You wanna try some?

210
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,560
No no that's ok

211
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,110
"It seems they got hungry while waiting for him"

212
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,130
"Then, finally"

213
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,040
You're done eating?

214
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,600
Yay!

215
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,600
Yes!

216
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,220
That was great!

217
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,310
Matsumoto eat it already

218
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,330
There's a lot on there

219
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,530
Wow, you're lucky!

220
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,780
So lucky!

221
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,780
Thank you

222
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,530
Here I go!

223
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,220
"They head towards their next restaurant"

224
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:26,420
"After the 4th restaurant, they should not be as hungry ..."

225
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,070
I'm STARVING!

226
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,050
Hungry!

227
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,110
Yeaaah I'm kinda hungry

228
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,070
If I don't eat something now...

229
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,330
"All they can talk about is their hunger"

230
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,930
(idle chatting)

231
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,690
Now that I think about, Baskin Robbins is great huh?

232
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,440
Yeah it is

233
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,560
We should go back and do it again

234
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,270
There's gonna be traffic now

235
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,820
Really?!

236
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,490
Yeah I uhh

237
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,980
I looked it up, earlier

238
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,490
Ah just in case we tried again right?

239
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,470
If 100% means you're really full, Endo what would say you are?

240
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,470
2%

241
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,870
Same for me

242
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,620
2%

243
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,620
2%?

244
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,310
Matsumoto-san?

245
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,670
I don't really have that sort of conception

246
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:33,270
"The eternally hungry 5 drive to their next destination"

247
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,730
Tanaka you're pretty full after that ice cream right?

248
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,360
No no, uhh, not at all

249
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,420
You were having a great conversation,

250
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,450
and I'm just so hungry, right?

251
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,200
I didn't know you're hungry

252
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,200
So I didn't wanna interrupt

253
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Didn't hear anything about your hunger

254
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
I was just hungry that whole conversation

255
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,360
What would you eat if you could have anything?

256
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,620
A large katsu curry

257
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,110
Seriously?

258
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,110
Yes

259
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,770
large katsu curry

260
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,770
large?

261
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,020
An extra-large if possible

262
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,020
What is your full percentage?

263
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,110
Honestly ...

264
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,530
0%

265
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,530
Really?

266
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,530
Yes

267
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,200
"Up ahead,

268
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,200
Even after all that-

269
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,270
"Up ahead, there is a GO GO Curry"

270
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,440
There you go Tanaka

271
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,490
So goddamn lucky!

272
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,820
You said katsu curry LOL!

273
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,580
I wish I was that lucky!

274
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,580
Katsu Curry!

275
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,710
Do they have it?

276
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,040
They do yeah

277
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,040
They do, they do

278
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,290
An extra-large

279
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,440
"Tanaka does a 'guts pose' at the sound of curry:

280
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,130
"Will their hunger finally end?"

281
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,000
"And then"

282
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,800
There it is

283
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,930
I hope they can do it (extra large)

284
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,330
yeah hopefully

285
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,820
Thank you for the food!

286
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,400
Let's fill our stomachs!

287
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,640
"Too much for a man" Katsu curry?

288
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,290
Let's go!

289
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:11,670
"The next restaurant, with 41 locations"

290
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:17,380
"With plenty of volume, the roast katsu curry"

291
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,360
"A surprise scene when they enter the store ..."

292
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,870
Oi!

293
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,780
Tanaka!

294
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,980
They have an extra large!

295
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,980
Wow they have it!

296
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,700
You're so goddamn lucky!

297
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,620
It's 5 dishes in one!

298
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,980
They might not have it anymore

299
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,980
Yeah they might not have it

300
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,280
Do you still have this?

301
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,870
Yes we do

302
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,180
"Tanaka can't help but smile"

303
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,820
Alright then you're getting that

304
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,600
"Major Katsu"

305
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,600
Tanaka!

306
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,760
C'mon select it

307
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,470
Just check it out man

308
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,690
Yeah it's this item here

309
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,220
We all wanna eat too

310
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,110
You said you wanted this

311
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,980
You really did say you wanted this

312
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,270
Give this to them

313
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,420
I might challenge myself too

314
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,090
OK yeah let's go!

315
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,400
It's sold out!

316
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,400
Sold out

317
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,120
I'm not satisfied with this!

318
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,160
I can't believe it sold out just that moment!

319
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,510
You got the last one

320
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,800
So lucky!

321
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,710
Snatched last one!

322
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,670
I snatched it!

323
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:53,020
"The 4 order from the healthy class, instead of the world champion class"

324
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,710
I want sushi next

325
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,200
I could go for 100 pieces

326
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,090
That sounds good

327
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,290
300

328
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,290
Could go for 300

329
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,390
That's great

330
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,240
"The hungry five get their curry"

331
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,160
This looks delicious!

332
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:31,490
"The 4 enjoy the rich taste of their healthy class curry, though lacking in volume"

333
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,580
We can get extra cabbage?

334
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,310
I'm grateful for that!

335
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,690
Tasty

336
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,960
Yeah, delicious

337
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:58,840
"They enjoy their curry like no other two syllable word exists"

338
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:07,180
"Tanaka's world champion class curry arrives"

339
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,800
"Major Curry - World Champion Class"

340
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,620
"Volume fit for a champion - 2.5kg of food"

341
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:40,050
"Five times the volume of the healthy class"

342
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,490
Oi

343
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,220
Face your reality!

344
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,710
Tanaka it's here!

345
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,890
Face your reality

346
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,990
It's here Tanaka

347
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,490
It's great isn't it? You said you wanted this

348
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,360
Yeah I didn't expect this

349
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
His dreams came true

350
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Yeah

351
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,760
I'm so hungry

352
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,590
OK let's go!

353
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,840
Tanaka...

354
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,310
He's not touching it at all

355
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,240
What happened?

356
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,270
Thank you for the meal!

357
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,530
Is it OK I get to have all this?

358
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,710
Of course man

359
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,730
You said you wanted it, so eat it

360
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,910
yeah honestly

361
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,930
That's delicious

362
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,960
Delicious

363
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,670
Tasty?

364
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,410
Tasty! Yup, tasty...

365
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,930
Damn it I'm still not full

366
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,110
Forget the cabage, eat the curry!

367
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,400
Eat the cutlets

368
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,580
You're not hungry?

369
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,960
I am, super hungry

370
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,110
Then eat it

371
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,730
I saying eat the cutlets

372
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,560
The curry

373
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,160
I'm telling you eat the cutlets!

374
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,730
What happened, Tanaka?

375
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,340
What happened?

376
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,650
I like to leave the best parts for last

377
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,330
Just try the cutlets though

378
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,820
Yeah, yeah you're right

379
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,270
What happened, Tanaka?

380
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,800
What do you mean?

381
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,020
It's just, your fork isn't moving

382
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,690
Dude you should just eat the weiners all at once, with your fork

383
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,870
That's the easiest way to eat them

384
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,600
Take the weiner first, for now

385
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,440
Like this?

386
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,040
Take more, more

387
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,440
Like this?

388
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,640
Could you go for another?

389
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,040
If you can, get another

390
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,620
Can you?

391
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,780
Can you or not?

392
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,000
He can

393
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,580
OK yeah just eat that

394
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,090
Eat it hurry

395
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,000
You're hungry right?

396
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,670
Eat it, eat them all

397
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,820
Put it in your mouth

398
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,220
This in my mou-

399
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,420
The people outside got scared

400
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,330
I will eat this

401
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,210
Delicious!

402
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,730
Right?

403
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,580
See!

404
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,870
Delicious

405
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,670
Eat the cutlets Tanaka

406
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,910
There's no point if you don't

407
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,400
Cause you ate the weiners

408
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,560
Cause I wanted Katsu curry

409
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,560
Yeah exactly

410
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,400
Eat the cutlets

411
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,980
C'mon you can eat them

412
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,530
What are you gonna do man, quit?

413
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,110
What do you mean quit?

414
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,110
You gonna quit?

415
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,310
What do you mean quit?

416
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,330
You can't eat anymore?

417
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,600
No of course not

418
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,110
Really?

419
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,250
I'm gonna really dig into this

420
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,310
"The four eat at a good pace, just waiting for Tanaka"

421
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,730
I want us to take our last bite at the same time

422
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,300
That's why we're watching you

423
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,200
We have to match your pace

424
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,290
Yeah I wanna eat faster!

425
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,560
C'mon man

426
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,200
Yeah

427
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,710
Eat it faster

428
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,610
He's just doing that same thing

429
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,240
You've been digging in that same place!

430
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,330
Seriously Tanaka, what's with you?

431
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,360
You're full aren't you?

432
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,980
Stop making a fuss, I'm trying to eat here!

433
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,800
We're all waiting for you man

434
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,400
What are you doing? Eat it

435
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,580
He's not eating the roux

436
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,640
I don't like that one weiner by itself, just eat it

437
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,890
I refuse

438
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,840
"I refuse"?!

439
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,330
"I refuse"?

440
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,400
He said "I refuse"

441
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,710
"I refuse"?!

442
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,910
Ask him Hamada-san,

443
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,490
ask him what he means

444
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,690
Just eat the weiner man!

445
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,350
Tanaka what's with you?

446
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,620
Eat that weiner!

447
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,910
I will not!

448
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,110
Why not?

449
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,380
Why not?

450
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,380
Cause I'm so damn full!

451
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,200
I'm so goddamn full!

452
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,780
Please forgive me, I am full!

453
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,400
I won't eat anymore!

454
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,490
Thank god!

455
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,310
This sucked!

456
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,930
So tough!

457
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,890
Thank god, I drank so much water

458
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,000
Thank god!

459
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,960
The weiner ... what the hell was this guy saying?!

460
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,530
"What the hell is he saying" I thought

461
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,870
I had that episode, didn't I?

462
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,200
(Tanaka's Breakdown)

463
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,360
Our family had a small incident cause of that

464
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,360
What happened?

465
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,570
It wasn't anything too bad

466
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,490
That really showcased your acting right?

467
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,560
Mitani Kouki called you after that right?

468
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,200
"A fantastic performance" he said

469
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,180
After that,

470
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,560
I always watch this show of course,

471
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,890
But I was away for that broadcast, so I didn't watch it real time

472
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,790
I was planning on watching it next evening,

473
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,560
It was during the spring break,

474
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,070
My oldest son, 7 years old, recorded it,

475
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,870
"Tanaka's Breakdown"

476
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,580
He watched it by himself

477
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,640
And I do a lot in that episode right?

478
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,480
Like I said I was gonna fuck that girl after leaving Don Quijote

479
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,690
And he said that and thought,

480
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,780
"Dad is having an affair!"

481
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,720
Cause he's just 7 right?

482
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,440
Yeah exactly right?

483
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,910
He doesn't understand it's a skit

484
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,760
Right?

485
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,310
Exactly

486
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,760
He thought it was like a documentary

487
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,640
He thought it would make mom depressed if he told her,

488
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,580
He just held it in, "Dad is having an affair!"

489
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,870
But it got too much for him,

490
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:13,440
He didn't know how to tell his mom about this without hurting her

491
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,520
But his mom explained, this is a Gaki no Tsukai skit

492
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,490
This is a skit

493
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,040
Explained its a comedy show?

494
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,310
Explained it's a comedy show

495
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,990
Dad is not having a breakdown, so calm down please

496
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,760
So he calmed down, but,

497
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,640
I had that bit where I yelled at that guy right?

498
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,180
Like I really laid into him

499
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,230
And, he understood that it's just a skit,

500
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,100
Kids leave their toys around right?

501
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,000
Normally he doesn't listen when I tell him to tidy up,

502
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,710
But recently, when I tell him.

503
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,380
he starts cleaning up so fast!

504
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,810
He thinks you're gonna have a breakdown right?

505
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,070
He thinks I might start yelling

506
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,090
You should go all out

507
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:01,960
Go in the washroom, blacken your teeth, blacken your nails,
