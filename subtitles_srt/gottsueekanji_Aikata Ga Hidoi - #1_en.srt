Oonyudo-kun

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,720
Good morning

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,770
Here it is

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,720
Hurry, you're slow

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,270
I'm sorry

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,270
Here you go

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,350
Hamada-san, how old is your kid now?

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,430
3

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,180
3?

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,060
Imada-kun, you're not married right?

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,020
I am

13
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,020
Oh, you're married?

14
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:29,470
Yes

15
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,520
You are?

16
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,140
Yes

17
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,140
Any kids?

18
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,220
2

19
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,270
Eh, 2 kids?

20
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,560
4th and 2nd graders

21
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,060
Must be rough

22
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,390
Well... Yes, it is

23
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,310
I guess

24
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,430
Excuse me, but can I have this gum?

25
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:44,930
Why?

26
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,930
It's my older kid's birthday

27
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,430
Sorry about this

28
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,470
Well, it can't be helped, he only makes 1000 yen a day

29
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,100
I see

30
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,310
I can only afford food

31
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,520
Get a part-time job

32
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,680
Yes

33
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,970
Excuse me

34
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,520
What?

35
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,020
Actually I found a new partner to perform comedy

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,100
Again?

37
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,100
Well, this time it will be good

38
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,220
How could you find him so quickly?

39
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,220
I happened to meet him at a bar

40
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,640
Yes

41
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,020
OK

42
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,270
Well... he's here

43
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,520
If you are OK with it, I would like you to meet him

44
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,100
He's here?

45
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:22,930
Yes

46
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,520
Whatever

47
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,890
It's OK? Thank you!

48
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,890
Oonyudo-kun?

49
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,520
Oonyodo-kun!

50
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,020
Hi! Good morning! Master, Good morning!

51
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,560
Thank you for taking a good care of my
partner! Everyone Good morning!

52
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,560
Good morning! Good weather,
isn't it today? It's good, really..

53
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,100
He's my partner

54
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,220
Thank you! Thank you!

55
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,890
How old are you?

56
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,140
I'm 22

57
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,350
22?

58
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,220
Yes

59
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,140
Do you work?

60
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:53,140
I was an office worker, but I wanted to try and win a
successful gig... I really watch you everyday on TV

61
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,470
I really think you are great and it
is really great to see you, yes

62
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,600
Any siblings?

63
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,680
I have 2

64
00:01:58,970 --> 00:01:59,640
2?

65
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,560
Yes

66
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,930
Which?

67
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,600
I have one younger sister. She is a big fan of yours, well
but I didn't tell her that I was meeting you today...

68
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,270
Yes

69
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,270
Seems he can talk

70
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,220
Yes

71
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,850
Ok, so show me your performance

72
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,310
Is it OK to show you?

73
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,720
Yes, everyone please watch

74
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,930
Thank you. It's short, but I wrote it so..

75
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,430
Really? Did you write it?

76
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,020
Yes

77
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,060
Is that OK? Thank you, let us start

78
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,180
Yeah

79
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,180
Hi I'm Shinji from Sakigake-sandaizu

80
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,770
I'm Koji

81
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,350
By the way, I really think we need to try harder. Now that its
the information age, we have to challenge a lot of things...

82
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,180
Yes, you're right

83
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,100
For me, even when I have nothing to do, I don't doodle

84
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,520
You don't doodle?

85
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,850
I usually use my PC

86
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,020
Do you? Cool

87
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,520
You need to know how to use PC. Do you?

88
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,430
Yes, you're right

89
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,220
Oh please! Of course I can use it!

90
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,430
Can you? Please show me what you can do

91
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,180
OK

92
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,220
Use the PC

93
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,060
No problem

94
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,680
Try it

95
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,470
First of all, press the key

96
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,020
Bring a PC! We don't have PC here!

97
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,310
What is that!

98
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,850
You are being too precise!

99
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,850
Bring a PC from there!

100
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,930
OK, I understand!

101
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,770
Chop chop

102
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,350
I'm bringing a PC... and putting it here

103
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,560
And type like this...

104
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,470
You didn't turn it on!

105
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,850
Power? Come!

106
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,470
PC won't work without the power on!

107
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,600
Alright, alright! Turn on the power and type..

108
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,060
Continue..

109
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,520
You didn't plug it in!

110
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,470
I don't care!

111
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,390
OK, I will!

112
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,350
Plug in, turn on, press keys and
you can see letters on screen!

113
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,720
Letters appear

114
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,140
Letters appear

115
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,600
What's wrong?

116
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,810
Let's continue

117
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,720
Hey, Master is watching...Press the keys! And...

118
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
...Press..the keys..

119
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,890
Press the keys

120
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,220
Press the keys!

121
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,640
Screen appears

122
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,060
Say something!

123
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,060
Oh no...

124
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,890
Oh... I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

125
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,430
That's enough already!

126
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,180
I'm sorry!

127
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,060
I'm sorry

128
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,180
I forgot the script

129
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,180
What are you guys doing!

130
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,430
Didn't you practice?!

131
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:06,930
Yes

132
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,390
That's it!

133
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,180
You wrote that right?

134
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,060
He tried hard

135
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,180
It is old fashioned

136
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,890
Is that so?

137
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,470
What are you doing?

138
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,430
What's the matter?

139
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,680
He gets nervous on stage

140
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,270
Oh..

141
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,180
But I think he is talented

142
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,220
But the theme was old

143
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,100
Are you OK?

144
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,720
Hey hey hey, Imada!

145
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,270
What is going on?!

146
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,270
Hey! Hey!

147
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,390
Oonyudo-kun!

148
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,560
Oonyudo-kun! Oonyudo-kun!

149
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,560
Please somebody call an ambulance!

150
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,100
You take him!

151
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,970
I'm sorry..Somebody...I'm sorry! Oonyudo-kun!

152
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,850
Are you OK, Oonyudo-kun!
