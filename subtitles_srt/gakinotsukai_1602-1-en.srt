1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,020
1st Time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende "I'm the One Who Understands you Best!"

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,050
"Anyways, You'd Look Great in this Thing" Tatekawa Shiraku Edition!!

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,190
Matsumoto-san, we've done this 15 times already...

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Ah is that so

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,260
What's with this title... cut it out already

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,030
What's with this title... cut it out already

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,900
"Anyways, You'd Look Great in this Thing"

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,900
(Sounds old fashioned)

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,940
What time are we in?...

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,810
Cut it out...

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,140
Change it already

12
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,640
Change with the times

13
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:37,520
A special series on Gaki, where the members buy gifts for guests based on their interests

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,190
It's safe to say we've done pretty poorly so far

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,750
Suprisingly...

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,750
Leave it

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,990
Leave it, you're the worst of us...

18
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,990
I'm not the worst

19
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,500
Suprisingly, we've got the previous results, and apart from Hamada-san, we're all terrible

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,260
No way

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,260
No way that's true...

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,260
No way

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,260
No way

24
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,000
Suprisingly... the worst, Look

25
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,470
I've only lost once

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:14,790
Endo

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:14,790
Hamada

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:14,790
Hosei

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:14,790
Matsumoto

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:14,790
Tanaka

31
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,200
Yes, Hamada-san was missing for one but

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,170
Matsumoto-san has 6 losses

33
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,410
Look at Yama-chan

34
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,410
Hosei-san with 9 losses...

35
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,180
Wait, you're the one with no style

36
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,420
When you think of someone with no style it's Tanaka

37
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,600
The board says otherwise

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,090
Anyway, without further adieu...

39
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,690
Let's welcome our guest Tatekawa Shiraku-san!

40
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:34,770
Rakugo-ka
(Storyteller)

41
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,770
Both a commentator on various shows and an active Rakugo-ka, Tatekawa Shiraku

42
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,850
This time the Gaki members will choose a top and an accessory to present to Tatekawa Shiraku

43
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,750
Ah yeah this is what we're used to seeing him in

44
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,120
Yes, this is my usual getup

45
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
I've no idea how he dresses casually though

46
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,820
That's true

47
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,820
Surprisingly... you dress quite differently right, in your own time?

48
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,260
Surprisingly... you dress quite differently right, in your own time?

49
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,160
(Hysteric Glamour is a Japanese fashion brand
known for western style clothing)

50
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,160
Usually I wear Hysteric Glamour and rock style clothing

51
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,700
Ehh... Really?

52
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,870
I've seen him in it

53
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,500
Shishō in Hysteric Glamour clothing

54
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:09,410
Shishō = A term for a master in their field

55
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,770
The five of us are going to pick out stuff and you'll choose your favourite

56
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,410
The worst will have to pay

57
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:16,050
Timed, Typeset & Translated by Inepped

58
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:25,290
Before the show the five searched for a top and an accessory they think will suit Tatekawa Shiraku

59
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,000
I can't really picture him in casual clothes

60
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,430
He's actually the same age as me (58)

61
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,300
Understated but kind of scary sort of image, right

62
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,170
Understated but kind of scary sort of image, right

63
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,910
What about something cute instead?

64
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,340
I think everyone else is probably thinking about one kind of thing

65
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,780
Make it wild or something...

66
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,210
Someone is definitely gonna get something wild

67
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,380
How about something kinda like this

68
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,590
A red parka or something

69
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,890
He likes baseball right? Shiraku-san

70
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,890
A baseball shirt... hmm

71
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,700
I mean I think he likes baseball but I don't think he's a huge fan or anything

72
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,460
A hat, that's definitely more Tanaka's thing

73
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,500
A hat, that's definitely more Tanaka's thing

74
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,940
I don't want to see him wear something like that

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,340
I haven't really seen anything so far

76
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,610
It's a great feeling when they choose to keep the item you picked for them

77
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,620
It's a lot harder than it looks, looking for someone else

78
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,090
I don't think he would go for something I would wear

79
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,320
How about this?

80
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
I can't imagine him in that

81
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,330
Right, I can't picture it

82
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,860
It's a poncho, isn't it? The pattern is quite cute

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,370
"Ethnic" poncho

84
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,830
What's does "Ethnic" mean?

85
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,100
I have no idea what "Ethnic" means

86
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,740
I also like Hysteric Glamour style stuff

87
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,110
It's kind of Rock n' Roll

88
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,750
The style goes with the music

89
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,050
Heavy Metal

90
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,020
Rock

91
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,990
80's and 90's Heavy metal suits him perfectly

92
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,260
This is bad! You guys know who this is? ACDC Angus Young

93
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,600
A legendary guitarist

94
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,100
What's this? Wait a minute, this is cool

95
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,670
An angry skull

96
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,570
A skull right?

97
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,300
Hey?

98
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Wait a sec...

99
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,840
This is bad

100
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,220
No good?

101
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,320
Sunglasses are a great style item, they can change your look quite a lot

102
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,090
I was looking for LEON or similar styling

103
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,530
Since we've come this far...

104
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,440
This looks like something Renege-san would wear

105
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,380
These... well they're pretty interesting

106
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,680
Top Gun

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,910
Like from Top Gun

108
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,250
These are a little more wild

109
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,460
Today you're searching for a top and an accessory

110
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,300
What about this?

111
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,800
What's your best price?

112
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,140
121,000 Yen (approx. £730/$900)

113
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,010
This looks good

114
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
It's nowhere near as warm as it looks

115
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,420
It's nowhere near as warm as it looks

116
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,720
What do you think of this?

117
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,990
I think this would be pretty good

118
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,230
Total comes to ???,??? yen

119
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,600
This is the most expensive item so far

120
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,370
But, I did just win 100,000 yen from Kiki

121
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:04,780
Shiraku will take home his favourite item, the worst will have to pay out of their own pocket

122
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,420
So first off, which of our tops will suit Tatekawa Shiraku-san

123
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,790
I hate to be last in this

124
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,190
I'm gonna go full attack on this one

125
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,660
First off is Endo to present his top to Shiraku

126
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,550
Here is the product I came up with

127
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,870
I've never really seen the Wild look of Shishō

128
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:36,170
When I was looking for wild kind of stuff, I thought this might suit Shishō

129
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,910
The idiot side of Endo is coming out

130
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,020
A leather jacket

131
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,460
But don't you think it really suits him, the size is perfect too

132
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,860
It doesn't suit him at all

133
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,460
Not at all

134
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,090
It's supposed to be wild, right?

135
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,860
This time it's wild themed, yeah

136
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,600
This isn't wild at all...

137
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,700
It's not wild whatsoever

138
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:10,540
Maybe he hasn't worn anything like it before, but I can see him wearing stuff like this more and more

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,540
Endo

140
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,910
How many years has it been since you became a member?

141
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,050
How many years has it been since you became a member?

142
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,680
How can you have so little understanding

143
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,520
It's pretty good

144
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,190
It's wild and it's not too long

145
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,960
I mean, leather jackets can be quite wild and all but...

146
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,160
Here it looks alright but I don't know when Shiraku-han would wear this

147
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,500
Well let's leave it to Shishō

148
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,430
Chiaki is gonna be super mad

149
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,730
Chiaki is Endo's ex-wife

150
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,730
Chiaki is gonna be super mad

151
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,730
It's been 7 years already

152
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,210
Next up is Hamada to present his top

153
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,210
I know that Shiraku-han has kids

154
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,110
I was thinking of the cute Shiraku-han image

155
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,980
Cute?...

156
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,850
This kinda image is what I was going for

157
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,190
The colour is kinda off

158
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,160
Overalls?

159
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,130
These are great for spring and summer

160
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,070
I thought the colour would be more POP

161
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,770
He's struggling with his 50 year old shoulders

162
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,610
Am I going fishing?

163
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,950
The colour should definitely have more POP...

164
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,850
It's kinda like work wear...

165
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,950
All you lot do is complain!

166
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:35,730
Look it's a LEGO man

167
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,200
I think having something like this works occasionally

168
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,630
Pooping is gonna be difficult

169
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,400
Shiraku-san takes loads of dumps

170
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,780
Matsumoto is confident with his top

171
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,450
I am super confident with this one, Shiraku-san

172
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,680
You're definitely gonna want to keep this

173
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,690
Definitely?... The overalls are pretty good

174
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,790
Shiraku-san's wife is quite young, right?

175
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,260
Yeah, 18 years younger

176
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,760
That feeling of youth

177
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,360
Also this year it's been quite in...

178
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,760
Sty sty sty style...

179
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Sty sty sty?

180
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,290
Isn't this awesome!

181
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,370
Long jean jacket

182
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,880
Jean jackets have been in style this year, am I right?

183
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,680
See everyone is agreeing with me

184
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,510
Nobody has said anything...

185
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,510
See it's super awesome!

186
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,520
NO WAY!!

187
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,290
NO WAY!! LOOK AT IT!!

188
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,510
This is...

189
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,090
Would you mind spinning around?

190
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,730
It's super cool and cute

191
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,760
Cool and cute

192
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,770
Where would you wear this...?

193
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,830
He could wear this on stage

194
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,640
No way he could wear this on stage

195
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,240
Of course he'd then take it off

196
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,310
Are you sure about this one?

197
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,480
You maybe can't wear it all the time but...

198
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,880
It'll be just right about now, with a t-shirt underneath

199
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,060
Shozo's was a bit less aggressive

200
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:20,130
Shiraku-han, do you think you'd enter a Yose wearing this?

201
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:20,130
Yose = a theatre where rakugo perform

202
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:25,200
Soon you'll see all the Rakugo-ka wearing this

203
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,670
Tanaka, who is overflowing with confidence, presents his top

204
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,750
I was trying to find something a little different

205
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,620
It'd probably suit everyone apart from me

206
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,580
What... I've no idea what that is

207
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,440
Shishō let out a little Eh? Eh?

208
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,770
What is that?

209
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,690
Don't you think this colour is perfect for Shishō

210
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,690
What is that?

211
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:57,040
Shishō usually wears a Kimono, a Japanese Kimono, this is sort of like a Kimono, but maybe a bit more casual

212
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,570
See, what about this colour?

213
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,570
What country is this from?

214
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,610
He looks like one of those guys at the UN

215
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,820
Africa...

216
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,350
African kind of style

217
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,620
I think it can be worn whenever, like in summer maybe

218
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,990
The material also kinda...

219
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,260
Are you laughing?

220
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,570
Shiraku-Shishō is definitely not laughing

221
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,040
What top has Hosei chosen to challenge with

222
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,850
I think I understand Shirakushō the best of all

223
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,850
Shirakushō?

224
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,420
I understand Shiraku-Shishō

225
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,830
I know that he loves Hysteric Glamour

226
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,060
He still can't speak...

227
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,260
I also like Hysteric Glamour

228
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,930
So I think we have the same mindset

229
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:08,440
I guess people who like Hysteric Glamour should be able to understand each other better

230
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,610
So I thought, what would you not buy for yourself

231
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,450
You're joking right...

232
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,850
Enough already

233
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,050
You're just bullying Shiraku-han

234
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,050
I'M NOT BULLYING HIM

235
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,560
Are you kidding around?

236
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,560
I'm not kidding around

237
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,830
It looks great

238
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,340
Kids'll cry...

239
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,080
Everyday when I'm taking my kids to kindergarten

240
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,310
Everyday when I'm taking my kids to kindergarten

241
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,950
It's cool don't ya think

242
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,390
Looks like it's searching for water

243
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,390
Which top is Shiraku going to choose?

244
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,390
Shishō, please pick honestly

245
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:09,900
I want something to wear in my spare time, taking my kids to kindergarten etc.

246
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:16,040
Without further adeu, Shiraku-san, which top is your favourite?

247
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:26,520
Endo

248
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:26,520
Hamada

249
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:26,520
Hosei

250
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:26,520
Matsumoto

251
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:26,520
Tanaka

252
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,260
Can you tell us the reason?

253
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,530
I wouldn't normally wear such a long one but

254
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,000
I like the feel of this one

255
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,940
I really like the various colouring and patterns

256
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,740
Taking or picking up from kindergarten...

257
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,740
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING!

258
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,410
You say anymore and I'll throw you to the lion

259
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,220
Please tell us, which is you're 2nd favourite?

260
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,860
Endo

261
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,860
Hamada

262
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,860
Hosei

263
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,860
Tanaka

264
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:13,930
This is good for when I'm playing around with my kids

265
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,230
Like for when we go to the park

266
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,570
Please tell us, which is you're 3rd favourite?

267
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:26,040
Endo

268
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:26,040
Hosei

269
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:26,040
Tanaka

270
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,120
Of course it's gonna be that one

271
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,050
It's nice and clean, but a bit bland

272
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,490
A bit bland, okay

273
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,420
We're down to the last two

274
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,690
Forget about the kindergarten run

275
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,960
Let's go to the zoo

276
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,570
Which top is the worst?

277
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,170
Hosei

278
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,170
Tanaka

279
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,070
The worst is...?

280
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,580
It had to be

281
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
Shishō, are you serious?

282
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,450
Everyone would be looking at me

283
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,450
It's Dainoji

284
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,290
Hosei has to pay 3,295 Yen (approx. £20/$25)

285
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,260
Next, what accessory will Shiraku choose, first up is Hamada

286
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:26,240
Similar to earlier with the overalls, I was going with the cute look

287
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,910
The total image

288
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,780
Something his kids would like as well

289
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,750
What a long bag

290
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,380
Shoes?

291
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,280
Sneakers

292
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,960
Something's attached to it

293
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,230
A dog?

294
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,030
Eh? This is from Adidas?

295
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,370
Yeah, Adidas

296
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,340
I'm not sure about this, it's neither good nor bad

297
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,710
He might love it or hate it

298
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,910
I think Shiraku-Shishō will hate it

299
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,910
He hates these the most

300
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:16,190
Think of how his kids will feel, "Dad, these sneakers are so cute"

301
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,090
"It has a tail!"

302
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,790
Not gonna happen

303
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,330
Isn't a bunch of stuff going to get in between there...

304
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,360
Where?

305
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,200
Between the cover and the shoe

306
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,470
What are you rambling about?

307
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,740
The design is good, nothing's gonna get in between

308
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,270
The hem doesn't go all the way down

309
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,680
It's cute

310
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,150
I don't think it'll be first...

311
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,090
You guys do nothing but complain!

312
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,260
Tanaka hopes to challenge with his item

313
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,260
Mine is quite simple

314
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,460
A hat?

315
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,460
Thanks for your time

316
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,700
It's a sauna hat

317
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,770
It's a sauna hat, Shishō

318
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,750
It's to wear in a sauna

319
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,910
All you've been saying is sauna

320
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,790
Do you often go to the sauna?

321
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,350
From time to time

322
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,890
I don't really have a sauna hat

323
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,030
What's the effect of wearing a sauna hat?

324
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,300
It keeps the heat out

325
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:38,270
It'll stop you from feeling feverish and stop your hair from frizzing

326
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,310
You look like an idiot though

327
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,110
You look like ET

328
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,580
Endo is unsure of his item

329
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:58,120
Along with the leather jacket earlier, I've also gone with the overall look

330
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,040
It's a tiny bag

331
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,040
Glasses?

332
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,860
Sunglasses?

333
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,100
The Wild kind of feel

334
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,330
What is wild about these?

335
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,300
Super cool

336
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,070
Hamashokan

337
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,650
Suprisingly... they do suit you

338
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,420
Ah, really, I can't see anything out of these

339
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:31,890
These are a popular brand of sunglasses, Ray-Ban

340
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,560
Do you wear sunglasses at all?

341
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,460
I actually do wear them quite a bit

342
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,470
Endo has done alright this time

343
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,470
Really, I think with the wild theme

344
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,610
Hosei has a pretty tricky item

345
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,940
I'm going all out with this one

346
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,050
You can't just be messing around like earlier

347
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:05,790
This isn't really for everyday use, more like for playtime

348
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,930
What is this?

349
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,930
And... there it is

350
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,560
The worst of all

351
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,300
Yama-chan, what is wrong with you?

352
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,330
Haven't we seen this before?

353
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,330
We have, from Endo

354
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,070
Mine had a different colouring

355
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,070
This is just awful

356
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,340
You just copied Endo

357
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,410
It's just a different colour

358
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,210
You're just bullying him

359
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,010
You're just bullying him

360
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,020
Shishō, it's absolutely perfect for you

361
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,820
Seriously... This is...

362
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,900
Is this for when you're taking out the trash

363
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,630
Kabukichō in the morning

364
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,240
Kabukichō is an entertainment and red-light district in Shinjuku

365
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,250
Last up to show his item is Matsumoto

366
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:10,520
There's no way I'm losing this one

367
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,920
Going last always sucks

368
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,960
This time I went

369
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,830
for something adventurous

370
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,070
It's quite large

371
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,940
What is it?

372
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,310
A hat?

373
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,180
It's a sun visor

374
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,810
No, it's a bag

375
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,180
LAME

376
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,320
It's an over the shoulder one

377
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,920
This is...

378
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,990
Could you sling it over your body?

379
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,060
Ah that's it, that's it

380
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,020
How about around the back

381
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,270
It's got loads of style right...

382
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,800
This is kinda...

383
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,470
Can I tell you the price?

384
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:07,650
This was 161,700 yen (approx. £990/$1,190)

385
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,280
Who cares...

386
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,220
Seems like a nuisance

387
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,490
Having it around the back is the best method

388
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,130
The practicality...

389
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,500
You can fit loads of stuff in it

390
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,200
There's no way you can

391
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,200
The cap part is just in the way

392
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,070
It's not about what's in the way or not, it's about fashion

393
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,510
Then what about the tail on the sneakers!

394
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,980
Those are cute...

395
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,610
If the cap is a nuisance then so is the tail

396
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,910
It's just in the way

397
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:48,150
If this goes wrong I have to pay 160,000 yen

398
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,120
The one with the worst item has to pay, who will it be?

399
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,090
Which item is in 1st place?

400
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,560
Endo

401
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,560
Hamada

402
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,560
Hosei

403
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,560
Matsumoto

404
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,560
Tanaka

405
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,560
C'mon miracle

406
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,970
Miracle...

407
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,500
Endo

408
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,500
Hamada

409
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,500
Hosei

410
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,500
Matsumoto

411
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,500
Tanaka

412
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,880
I can wear these to play with the kids

413
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,750
But it may be a little hard to wear them at work

414
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,620
Your 2nd choice please

415
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,720
Endo

416
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,720
Hosei

417
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,720
Matsumoto

418
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,720
Tanaka

419
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,360
Yeah, they suited him

420
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,000
That's true, I think they really suit you

421
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,300
Well, these are quite normal

422
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,470
Wear them to feel to wild

423
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,070
He said earlier that they're not that wild

424
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,580
Your 3rd choice please?

425
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:51,820
Hosei

426
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:51,820
Matsumoto

427
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:51,820
Tanaka

428
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,240
Think of the parties

429
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Let's get him paying 160,000 yen

430
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,100
Right, of course

431
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,720
Thank you, Shishō

432
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,660
Right, that's all for today...

433
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,530
We've still got the best part of the program

434
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,030
It's between these two

435
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:14,340
There's not a chance I can lose to THAT thing, if I do there's something wrong with Shiraku-san

436
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:22,310
Is the worst Matsumoto's sun visor bag or Hosei's crow mask?

437
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,050
Time to decide the worst item

438
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,490
The worst is?

439
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,430
YES!

440
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,500
Hosei pays 5000 yen (approx. £30/$40)

441
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,060
That was close!

442
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:47,540
I can't think of a single use for this, it'll scare kids, it's something that no one would ever need

443
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:55,250
I thought there'd be something I'd really like but in the end I was just being bullied

444
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,880
No way, no way

445
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,880
It was these guys
