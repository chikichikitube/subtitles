00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,380
Good afternoon...

00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,920
Laura will interview the recruits of the Earth Defense Force

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,190
Laura's interview

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,200
TN: Laura is a Talent and Model

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,330
Good afternoon...

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,170
You just came in...
I don't really like this

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,840
Seriously it's good...

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,610
Fujiwara-san is playing with us...

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,280
She enters with a laughter...

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,750
She's laughing

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,560
She makes you wanna laugh

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,800
That girl... instigates laughter...

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,300
Laura please be composed...

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,430
Please be composed

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,440
What you have to say...

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,540
I have to instill...

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,370
Have to be quiet... quiet

19
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,640
I have to be quiet...

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,310
Laura is really bubbly

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,490
This is really HARSH

22
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,860
Really, please stop this

23
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,260
Really... please stop this!!

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,900
We haven't even gotten into the real scene yet

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm hurting... hurting

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,600
I'm a reporter for the Earth Defense Force Magazine...

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,740
And the reporter for the magazine publishing company

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,640
I'm here today to interview the new recruits...

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,850
Laura will interview the 5 members

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,480
I'll ask "here and there" questions to each one

31
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,480
Here and there??

32
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,720
Please listen carefully...

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,020
Hamada-san...

34
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,490
Why do you hit people in the head??

35
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,660
Is it fun to hit them?

36
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,330
It's part of my job/work... um...

37
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,430
The role is "Tsukkomi" to "Heighten"...

38
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,000
Well that's the reason

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Why are you the only one with breasts?

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,210
It's true, you see that

41
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,050
I completely forgot about that

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,520
I would be curious too

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,850
I never thought of it

44
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,560
On this episode it's like a female recruit.

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,090
Alright, I understand...

46
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,990
I'll ask you the next question...

47
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,660
Hamada-san, do you still kiss your wife on your way out?

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
Please answer the question

49
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,140
I haven't done the kiss on my way out

50
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,740
What, really?

51
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,170
Yes

52
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,610
What does still mean?

53
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,040
Mean in the past you had?

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,880
That's right!

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,210
Like a routine

56
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,920
Oh... well...

57
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,520
Maybe when we were newlyweds...

58
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,260
How creepy

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,600
Maybe when my wife and I were newlyweds

60
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,040
I've been only asking Hamada-san questions...

61
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,830
Yeah

62
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,740
I'll ask Tanaka-san some questions...

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,740
That's good... please!

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,610
Tanaka-san, do you wash your hair?

65
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,080
What kind of question is that?

66
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,020
It's question that a reporter would ask...

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,450
That's what she thinks

68
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,920
Getting beaten up...

69
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,060
I'm hurting

70
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,590
Yes, of course

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,300
I wash my hair everyday

72
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,200
I understand

73
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,600
You know what... I'm 23 year old now

74
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,770
My classmate from high school got married

75
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,170
Recently, you know she had a baby

76
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,440
I've been really wanting to meet her husband

77
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,010
I'm gonna meet them soon

78
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,080
What type...

79
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,250
What is the husband like...?

80
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,880
What's the husband like...?

81
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,520
How is he like...?

82
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,090
What kind of husband...

83
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,230
I wouldn't call this an interview

84
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,200
What the...?

85
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,170
I don't care about the husband...

86
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,110
She's just playing with us!

87
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,980
Yeah... I'm playing you all

88
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,620
Playing??

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,550
Playing... Like you are "Jerking" us off...

90
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,960
Yeah... I'm "Jerking" you off

91
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,300
When you "Repeated" the sentence... I couldn't hold back!!

92
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,430
They came flying

93
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,700
When you repeated that part... We couldn't resist

94
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,800
You're right!

95
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,170
There's no other way to express it

96
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,980
Hamada-san, how much savings do you have?

97
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,080
I really don't know the exact amount...

98
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,380
um...

99
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,080
I don't really know... I have someone manage it

100
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,350
Is that so... By whom?

101
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,050
Excuse me...

102
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,560
Who manages it?

103
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,620
Like my wifey

104
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,260
Your wifey!

105
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,930
Yes

106
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,960
I bumped into your WIFEY the other time...

107
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,140
His "WIFEY"... yeah WIFEY!

108
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,010
Please support Gaki no Tsukai next year too.
