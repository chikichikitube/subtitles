00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,300
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,970
It's okay, we're being paid

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,580
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,120
Hello everyone

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,530
Savannah's Takahashi

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,110
Thank you

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,880
Quite often in cartoons

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,880
When people are drinking and suddenly burst out laughing they spray the water

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,160
Has anyone actually had this experience?

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,740
When you're about to laugh, you'll feel a little bit of water coming out, so it wont all shoot out

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,360
It won't spurt out, you'll just swallow it

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,320
In relation to this, the theory I bring this time is:

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,200
In reality, spraying a drink when laughing or being frightened is quite rare

14
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,100
The first thing that must be done is to drink a little bit

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,460
Then something will happen

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:10,080
This difficult verification will depend on timing

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,210
It's quite difficult

18
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,210
It's very difficult. What do you all think?

19
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,760
I've had it come out of my nose because I've been holding it in

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,990
Don't say things like it bursting out of your nose that exceed the concept

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,620
It's way beyond this theory

22
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,790
So, later

23
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,250
The laughing or surprised water spray challenge

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,400
And the widely known air cannon is used in an experiment

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,800
To attack artists an invisible stench

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,640
Out of standing or sitting, which is more painful to do for a long period of time?

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,850
And, can anyone beat Naoki Iketani at Naoki Iketani-style push-ups?

28
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:11,020
In reality, spraying a drink when laughing or being frightened is quite rare

29
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,250
First to be tested is the "surprised" scenario

30
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,280
Once the target pours water into their mouth

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,790
Bento lunchboxes placed in the room will explode to frighten them

32
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,160
The first target is

33
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,340
Noro Kayo

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,510
Gained weight again!

35
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,230
That's bad

36
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,500
To ensure water is drunk

37
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,620
She is forced to run as part of a fake stamina test program

38
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,810
Looks like a wrestler

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,680
How is your strength now?

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,950
Already the limit...

41
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,880
Can I take a break?
-Absolutely

42
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,850
It is forbidden to drink inside the gymnasium

43
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,260
So you can go to the break room

44
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,930
Just go to the break room now

45
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,150
Looks super angry

46
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,700
Really thirsty... ok I know

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,930
She naturally goes to have a drink

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,460
Looks exhausting

49
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,450
When frightened, will the water in her mouth spurt out?

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,640
Indeed quite large

51
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,290
Just now ... are almost flying to the eyes ...

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,440
What are you talking about?

53
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,780
Always panting

54
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,430
If only she could drink in peace

55
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,520
Just fell down

56
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,970
No spray

57
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,340
The timing was right...

58
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,750
A beautiful fall but no spray

59
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,730
So the project was revealed

60
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,430
It's scary!

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,570
What the hell... scared the hell out of me

62
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,230
I almost cried

63
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,370
This is Wednesday Downtown

64
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,040
No way!

65
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,380
She's happy about it

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,680
How did this happen? Why me?

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,150
If you are frightened when drinking something, the water will spray out of your mouth, that sort of thing

68
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,080
It didn't spurt out... I drank it down

69
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,890
Did you drink it?
-It's gone

70
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,700
As the shock was too much she drank it all instead

71
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,140
The next second target is

72
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,790
Tiring!

73
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,120
Sakura Inoue

74
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,690
This one is also made to be thirsty enough to go to rest room

75
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,050
Timing, please!

76
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,950
Selected the plastic bottle

77
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,120
Drinking...

78
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,320
Use this opportunity to get fired up!

79
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,910
Scary scary scary

80
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,830
Talking to yourself?

81
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,120
What just happened was really something

82
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,180
What was that?
-A time lag

83
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,450
This kind of response?

84
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,490
Jumping through the air in fear

85
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,480
It sprayed out!

86
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,930
Sprayed, sprayed!

87
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,030
Sprayed on the floor

88
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,510
It's just a little different that expected

89
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,600
It's not what I thought it would be

90
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,280
And then the third target is

91
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,530
Harry Sugiyama

92
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,510
What kind of candidates are these?

93
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,500
His run has a superfluous feeling about it

94
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:14,050
Hot hot hot

95
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,350
Drink up! Drink up!

96
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,500
Where are you going?

97
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,400
Talking to yourself is scary!

98
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,030
Everyone is talking to themselves

99
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,830
Shit... tsk

100
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,500
Sugiyama, you can do better, right?

101
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,210
This is really something!

102
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,560
This is actually more interesting

103
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,540
The falling type

104
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,560
Yes, and a bit leaked out

105
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,790
What a pity, I want to see a fountain

106
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,660
How much is enough?

107
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,260
Loads more

108
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,350
Flamboyantly stunned

109
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,890
A waterfall of spray comes out

110
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,610
Hey? What is this?

111
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,530
What are you doing?

112
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,310
Time to explain this project

113
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,950
You saw that, right? I spewed it out, didn't I?

114
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,350
Yes you did

115
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,990
So wasn't it what you wanted?

116
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,960
Isn't it all over me?

117
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,490
It really scared me...

118
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,590
Seriously, i'm gonna die

119
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,110
Although different from what we expected

120
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,280
But this verifies that spray will occur when being scared

121
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,280
And that everyone will fall to the ground in fear when they encounter a benevolent explosion

122
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,020
So, how will the "funny" scenario turn out

123
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:57,120
This time, the target was called in with a fake plan to conduct an on-location shoot after getting drunk

124
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,700
At the table where getting drunk, the others will attemp to make the target laugh

125
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,650
Attempting to make the target laugh is...

126
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,200
FUJIWARA's Haranishi

127
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,500
Stop it!

128
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,510
Haranishi is preparing intently

129
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,570
The targets are...

130
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,040
Oh, his partner

131
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,160
No... wait...

132
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,630
This...

133
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,770
This is unbearable!

134
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,140
Quite unpleasant

135
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,370
A common scenario for group artists

136
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,880
It's hard to be alone with each other

137
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,750
And so, a temporary departure

138
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,620
Well...yes...

139
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,250
If the camera is on it is okay...

140
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:07,090
But just two people alone...

141
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,210
It's true

142
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,660
Absolutely not!

143
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,410
After 15 minutes of convincing a reluctant Fujimoto

144
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,650
Super reluctant Fujimoto

145
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,840
He accepts on the condition that his agent comes with him

146
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,650
Obon Kobon style - START

147
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,480
There is no such style

148
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:40,700
In addition, this time, if the setter judges that it is no longer possible to amuse the other party

149
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,630
They will use "bill" as a code for giving up

150
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,630
My back hurts!

151
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,010
Eh?

152
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,950
Can I have the bill, please?

153
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,030
So fast

154
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,320
What are you doing?

155
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,090
A one-hit gag to get things going

156
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,390
And a quick exit

157
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,540
What did you see?

158
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,580
Did you notice the staff?

159
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,750
So what do you think this is?

160
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,150
Down, right?
-Down is correct

161
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,150
Found out too soon

162
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,220
This is Down

163
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,200
So the project was explained

164
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,180
Next

165
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,390
Who will spray water at this joke?

166
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,160
It's impossible with this

167
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,130
Well its just a one-shot gag, just once chance

168
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,700
I've seen that "poof" thousands of times

169
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,540
I thought it was powerful enough that you'd think it was strange and laugh

170
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,670
So I settled on this

171
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,810
You use something as simple as "poof" to elicit a response?

172
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,540
I probably trust "poof" a lot more than I trust you

173
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,080
In your eyes i'm super low, then

174
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,580
Are there other people doing this?

175
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,620
How can it end like this?

176
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,190
The VTR time is way too short

177
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,720
You've shortened it

178
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:28,960
To continue the verification the target will be changed

179
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,770
It's impossible to spray water

180
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,370
I thought i'd be able to do something funny to make it happen

181
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,280
You're practicing "poof"?

182
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,340
You're practicing my "poof", but you said it wasn't funny

183
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,180
Ah, it really came out

184
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,350
How about this? How about this?
-No, it'll just scare people

185
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,950
This would make you laugh, right?

186
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,520
The audience will be scared, don't do it

187
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,890
No way! That was a real "poof"

188
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,860
The next target for the FUJIWARA group to challenge is

189
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,070
Viking's Nishimura

190
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,730
I get the impression that he doesn't laugh much

191
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,840
Hey... camping?

192
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,570
Not camping, just work

193
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,680
Not a camping trip?
-Not camping

194
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,090
The atmosphere seems a bit more relaxed

195
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,580
So, Yoshimura
-I'm Nishimura

196
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,520
Nishimura, Nishimura
-I am Nishimura

197
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,250
It's a trap!

198
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,400
Doing faces now

199
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,040
A bit strange, huh?

200
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,670
Weird vibe

201
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,210
Weird emotions.
-Not weird at all

202
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,610
Just drink more

203
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,010
I'm not much of a drinker

204
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,380
I'm a little drunk

205
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,620
Yeah

206
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,690
After this

207
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,900
Haranishi
-Thank you very much

208
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,540
Thank you very much. Thank you very much

209
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,070
Nishimura, please

210
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,980
Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much

211
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,120
Weird drinking game

212
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,770
At this point it's almost time for the next target to arrive so it's forced to end

213
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,610
So difficult

214
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,690
Nishimura you're coming over here now

215
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,730
Eh? Eh~
-Offensive side

216
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,910
Me attack? So just now you were pranking me?

217
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,400
I was pranked?

218
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,300
Haranishi pranked me

219
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,530
The target moves to the offensive side afterwards

220
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,640
So you're an attacker now
-Wow~ tough!

221
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,420
So the next target was

222
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,850
Omiya, that...
-I'm Komiya

223
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,890
You don't need to do such a old joke

224
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,120
Omiya... it's Omiya

225
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,690
I was wondering if you would reply with something like "I'm Shima"

226
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,490
Can I feed you some air?

227
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,060
Eh, what what what

228
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,000
Air, air

229
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Feeding air?

230
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,240
Aren't you a bit too far gone for recording?

231
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,270
The store manager just recommended it to me

232
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,510
How is it possible to recommend air?

233
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,880
Hand Hair Spice

234
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,450
If you're gonna do that then please really pluck some hair

235
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,780
With me you don't joke back you just criticise

236
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,190
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that

237
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:49,070
Don't just do the ambulance sound, do a bit more movement
-So strong, so perceptive.

238
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,590
Although everyone is playing dumb, no spraying is occurring

239
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,640
Has anyone ever told you you have bad breath?
-No, i've never heard such a thing

240
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,150
When you put the beer in your mouth

241
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,150
Gargle a little bit

242
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:11,720
Dirt on the tongue will come off.
-Never heard it

243
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,200
What's this rumor?

244
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,720
You'll see

245
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,440
Impressive

246
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,210
What are you guys doing here?

247
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,910
You're too drunk!

248
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,740
What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

249
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,780
I'm sorry, it's because I laughed out loud

250
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,170
Not bad

251
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,530
It did spray out

252
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,800
So the project was revealed

253
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,740
-It worked!
What worked?

254
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,360
What is this success about?

255
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,470
But he held a bit in...

256
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,100
But I guess it doesn't matter

257
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,300
Just a little bit

258
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:05,280
Does below 100% not count as success?

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,670
As the result was slightly less than expected

260
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,210
And somewhat stoic

261
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,660
The verification continues

262
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,200
Komatsu, what did you do today?

263
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,830
Who'd spray at this?

264
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,370
What did you say?
-Komatsu

265
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,440
What does Komatsu mean?

266
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,650
Is that Ota?

267
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,650
{Ota: Yutaka Ota, a former Japanese national team fencer who won the silver medal in the men's foil final at the Beijing Olympics on August 13, 2008, although he lost 9:15 to Germany's Kleblinck, but it was a breakthrough for Japanese fencing at the Olympics.

268
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,750
Ota, right?

269
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:51,820
{Phishing: A scam in which users' accounts, passwords, and account information are obtained from electronic communications disguised as well-known trusted corporate media
Here, Otake is confusing Fencing with Phishing

270
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,590
Phishing

271
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,360
Phishing…

272
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,920
Otake displays his "talents" without an ounce of regret

273
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,100
What is the name of that fortune-teller, do you know?

274
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Do you know what they are called?

275
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,970
Like this?

276
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,300
It's a stick thing, right? Like that, right (the chopsticks)?

277
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,340
I don't, no
-Neither do I

278
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,640
I can't believe he's amused by this kind of thing

279
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,610
This makes him laugh?

280
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,950
Although it didn't spurt, it came out of the mouth, and so it was a success

281
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:37,290
In the challenge so far, the results have varied

282
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,110
The next targets are

283
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:46,110
That Canthony.
-I'm not Canthony. I'm Anthony

284
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,050
Hey, Anthony?

285
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,680
It's Anthony. Why don't you know my name all of a sudden?

286
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,980
You've never done this joke even once before

287
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,420
Movie Capital

288
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,720
What is Movie Capital?

289
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,920
Ah, sorry, it's Hollywood

290
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,260
Too different
-Putting a spin on it is good

291
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,260
What is Movie Capital

292
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,600
Let's settle the bill then

293
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,470
Is it not doable?

294
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,870
Can we please pay our bill?

295
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,900
Settle the bill for us, please

296
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,780
The final target of the day is...

297
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,890
Panther's Ogata

298
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,150
All drunk, right?

299
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,800
They've drunk quite a lot

300
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,020
Where's Ogata today?
-I am Ogata

301
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,920
I am Ogata, what is this all of a sudden?

302
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,090
I am Ogata

303
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,530
Drink up, drink up

304
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,520
Now, right?

305
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,630
Please wait, I haven't caught up yet

306
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,970
Sorry, I'll have another drink

307
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,020
Definitely had more

308
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,310
Where are you looking?

309
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,550
Is that ok?

310
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,210
Cheers!

311
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,500
Ah, what are you doing?

312
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,900
That can't be done to seniors, right?

313
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:23,500
With an armpit appearance by Anthony, Ogata's weakness is discovered

314
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,570
So

315
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,970
Hurry up!

316
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,290
What's going on?

317
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,490
Stop it!

318
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,250
Super defenseless

319
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,070
Stop, hey, don't come again

320
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,560
What the hell is going on?

321
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,910
What exactly...

322
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:03,640
In summary
There are indeed some people that will laugh and spray

323
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,870
What do you think, Matsumoto?

324
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,310
I don't know, I don't understand what the hell was going on

325
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,470
But it was pretty interesting

326
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,500
The people drinking water had it pretty tough

327
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,590
The bento blast

328
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,100
I can't believe someone would say "get fired up!" to themselves

329
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,510
And FUJIWARA's unexpected relationship
-It is really bad

330
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,190
You both hate it when you're alone too, don't you?

331
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,260
As soon as you open the door, you'll be overwhelmed to a certain degree, right?

332
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,550
Yes, it is pretty annoying

333
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,670
I hate talking

334
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,470
And I hate having to talk to Hamada alone

335
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,040
I always feel like he's gonna come over and kiss me

336
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,500
Let's welcome the next presenter

337
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,970
It's Chocolate Planet!

338
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,850
Hello everyone

339
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,350
They're always here!

340
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,550
You should just stay here

341
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,010
Why are you dressed like this?

342
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:19,670
Good question, I've brought a small prop with me

343
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,810
When it comes to small props I must be mentioned

344
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,700
I am the king of small props

345
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,130
Is he OK?

346
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,790
So, what do you see?

347
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,690
What the hell?
-Don't see anything

348
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,980
Can't you see anything? What about when I open it like this

349
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,420
Oh, awesome

350
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,930
Isn't this one of Chujiro's?

351
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,190
※Yonemura Chujiro: After graduating from Tokyo Gakugei University, he was a physics teacher at a metropolitan high school, and then founded Yonemura Chujiro Science Production and began appearing in magazines and TVs. The reason for starting the show was that he used to hate science, so he wanted children to learn science happily.

352
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,190
Yes, yes, it's Chujiro's

353
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,300
This is the air cannon that we have all seen before

354
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,980
This time we bring a theory related to this air cannon

355
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,200
Oh yeah?

356
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,020
Please take a look

357
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,860
If the air cannon's air is colorless, there is no way to dodge it

358
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,710
What?

359
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:01,130
The smoke just now, you could all see it

360
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,840
That means it has color.
-White, right?

361
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,720
If you don't add anything, what you put out is just a cloud of air

362
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,540
Indeed

363
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,070
If it's just a cloud of air, you can't see it

364
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,280
There is no way to detect that air mass

365
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,820
Because it is colorless
-Yes, colorless

366
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,950
Then who can see it when you broadcast it?

367
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,000
Instead of color, we are adding a smell

368
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,180
A very stinky type of smell

369
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,980
If you get hit, you'll smell it
-So that's how it is

370
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,870
There's no way to avoid it

371
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,870
This way no way anyone can hide, right?

372
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,850
The volume just went up!

373
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,450
Yes, yes, yes, yes

374
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,800
That's the theory we came with

375
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:06,230
If the air cannon's air is colorless, there is no way to dodge it

376
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,520
There is no way to avoid it!

377
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,770
For this, individuals are called out for a fake shopping show project

378
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,830
Yes, there is no way to avoid it

379
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,040
And the air cannon commonly seen in science experiment programs on TV is used

380
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,760
And will be launched by this sound operator during the shoot

381
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:30,320
Although there is no color, the stench will be unprecedentedly strong

382
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,320
The first target is...

383
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,560
Hello, I'm Mikako Tabe.

384
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,370
Yoshiko

385
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,370
This has nothing to do with Mikako Tabe

386
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,330
How dare you!

387
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,540
So delicious

388
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,230
So dirty

389
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,940
After nearly an hour of serious shopping location shooting

390
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,660
It's quite real!

391
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,790
It's almost time to give Yoshiko a shot of the air cannon

392
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,160
Here you are
-Thanks

393
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,920
Wow, it looks really good

394
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,940
Please take your time.
-Okay, thanks

395
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,060
Is the lighting OK?
-Yes

396
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,240
Then start eating one.
-Okay, I'll eat it

397
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,490
That box is really...
-Didn't notice?

398
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,940
It looks so delicious!

399
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,000
There's already smoke in it

400
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,330
Yes, but its invisible

401
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,340
Here I go

402
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,680
It's steaming hot!

403
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,580
What will happen?

404
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,450
That stinks!

405
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,570
That stinks!

406
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,430
That stinks!

407
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,700
What the hell is this?

408
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,880
If there's color then they'll be able to avoid it!

409
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,080
What's going on here?

410
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,180
So~ stinky!

411
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,150
It stinks!

412
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,510
The next target is...

413
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,160
Hello everyone, I'm Nadal

414
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,670
Nadal

415
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,530
White teeth la

416
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,130
Quite popular

417
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,470
Like Yoshiko, after almost an hour of shopping outside

418
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,100
He receives an air cannon one-shot to the soul

419
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,410
This is shrimp, right?

420
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,650
This is a crab.
-Excuse me

421
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,280
At least it was in the shell category

422
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,170
Wow, shellfish is really delicious!

423
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,450
What will happen?

424
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,390
Ah, stinky stinky stinky

425
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,830
What? What? What? What? What? It stinks!

426
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,630
Super stinky!

427
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,070
What are you guys doing?

428
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,830
Ah, stinky stinky stinky

429
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,670
What? What? What? What? What? It stinks!

430
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,290
Super stinky, what are you guys doing?

431
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,190
Ah, stinky stinky stinky

432
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,960
What? What? What? What? What? It stinks!

433
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,150
Super stinky, what are you guys doing?

434
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,150
Damn, that stinks. What the hell?

435
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,190
That's enough, that stinks!

436
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,190
What are you doing? It stinks, right?

437
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,360
What do you think it was?

438
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,930
It stinks. Is it shit?

439
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,100
Being smoked at close range surely cannot be avoided

440
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,090
You'll be smoked, certainly

441
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,680
There's nothing you can do about it

442
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Really can't be avoided at such close range

443
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,110
Next, individuals are tricked to participate in fake commercial performances

444
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:42,780
In the middle of the show, the air cannon will be fired from a distance of 15 meters

445
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:48,420
In the middle of the performance, will this inconvenient situation cause them to react? We will see

446
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,470
The target this time is

447
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,960
No problem

448
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,490
Akira100%

449
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,340
This is concerning

450
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,370
Sketch: Unarmed detective

451
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,240
Sheriff, thanks for your hard work

452
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,300
Is this the scene of the convenience store robbery?

453
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,330
The one over there is the store manager?

454
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,340
Store Manager!

455
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,330
It's about to launch

456
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,650
Wait a minute, there is something on the ground

457
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,320
It's blonde hair

458
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,160
Wait, there's one over there

459
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,420
There are also blondes here

460
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,530
Store manager, do you have any blondes here?

461
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,530
Difficult to time

462
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,600
Yeah, can only aim when he's standing

463
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,600
What? The part-time worker who quit is blonde?

464
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,070
Woo, woo ah, stinks...

465
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,740
That guy's a-

466
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,300
Oooh, stinks...

467
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,880
That guy's-

468
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,550
I'm sorry...

469
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,150
That guy-

470
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,510
What? The one who worked here before was the blonde?

471
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,950
Woo, woo ah, stink...

472
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,000
That guy's a-

473
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,260
Must not be a normal kind of stench

474
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,480
Indeed

475
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,170
Despite being in the middle of a performance

476
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,240
He lets out a series of violent dry heaves

477
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,130
Next

478
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:24,420
Excuse me, have you seen any blond men around here?

479
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,300
What? They went over that wall and ran across?

480
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,840
Sheriff, let's also go quickly

481
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,520
He can't work out where the stench is coming from

482
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,180
Next...

483
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,840
Must be pretty disturbing

484
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,240
Don't argue

485
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,090
Too loud is very-

486
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,330
I know, I know, I know

487
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
Wearing-

488
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,420
This is really the best thing to wear

489
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,920
Uhhhh- sorry sorry sorry

490
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,090
Then I'll take it off

491
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,550
Despite stench after stench, he manages to finish his 15-minute performance

492
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,930
Oh uh ah thank you thank you

493
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,970
The plan is revealed

494
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,110
Thank you!

495
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,910
I'm sorry

496
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,380
Any thoughts?

497
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,540
Ah, it's great that everyone was so enthusiastic about the show

498
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,120
It seems he hasn't realize this was all a set up

499
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,490
Is there anything that felt wrong?

500
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,590
Something wrong?

501
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,790
Something a little concerning was...

502
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,230
A smell...

503
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Uh that... if it was someone in the audience then I shouldn't be saying this

504
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,190
A nice man

505
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,010
In fact, this is not a commercial performance, but Wednesday Downtown

506
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,410
What!?

507
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,590
This prank is too lethal, right?

508
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,080
The next target is

509
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,280
He won't respond much, surely

510
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,820
Mr Playing Cards

511
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,700
Doesn't even talk

512
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,820
The man who doesn't say a word

513
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,000
What reaction will occur in the face of a sudden mid-show stench

514
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,290
What the hell is this thing?

515
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,670
Gently pushed away

516
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,490
A wave of the hand

517
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,030
Presumably due to the stench

518
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,490
How can such a thing happen?

519
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,510
He fluffs an important part

520
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,430
The last target is...

521
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:10,150
Hello everyone

522
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,720
It's Ikesaki

523
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,320
Ikesaki

524
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:21,290
Unprecedented! The single artist of amazing wind and fury!

525
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:26,010
The man who both loves and is loved by the humor!

526
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:33,730
Sunshine!

527
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,540
This is a big deal!

528
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,490
Ye——————！

529
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,380
Justice-

530
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,450
That stinks

531
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:53,760
In summary
It seems like the colorless air cannon could be useful in the future

532
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,340
How was it?
-Very interesting

533
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,470
You can't hide from it, right? There's no way to hide from it

534
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,190
There is indeed no way to hide

535
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,700
Why?
-Eh?

536
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,270
Why do you have to do such things?

537
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,410
Well, the results were quite strong

538
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,890
What would you do if something like this happened during a performance

539
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,980
If you encounter something like this when performing...

540
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,780
If it was manzai then you'd probably talk about it

541
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,850
If it is a duo, they'll both think its the other one's fault

542
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,380
They'll think thats the reason

543
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,730
I'd think "Is this guy taking a dump?"

544
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,950
I'd probably be pretty worried

545
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,220
Be brave and see how the veterans deal with it

546
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,900
Try it with Obon Kobon
-No please no

547
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,440
They'd probably start fighting

548
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,710
They will fight because they suspect each other

549
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,040
"This old man's finally shitting on stage"

550
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:52,350
Now its time for Everybody's Theories

551
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,290
Tonight's presenters are...

552
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,120
Alco&Peace

553
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,630
Without further ado

554
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,540
When someone reaches the status of the guests tonight

555
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,900
They are bound to have a lot of work of sitting around watching video's like tonight's show

556
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,770
That doesn't sound too good
-You are too bad

557
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,030
This is people that are already at the top

558
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,410
Sitting in a situation like this

559
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,980
How many hours do you think you could stay seated for?

560
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,400
Sitting the whole time?

561
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,600
The plane trip to foreign countries takes a long time
-Indeed

562
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,660
That's true
-You get tired of sitting

563
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:31,280
In relation to this, today we bring you this hypothesis

564
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,980
Out of standing or sitting, which is more painful to do for a long period of time?

565
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,140
Hard to say
-It's really hard to say

566
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,720
Sitting all the time is very tired
-Is it?

567
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,770
Two hours in the car, your butt hurts

568
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,990
True

569
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,140
Its very tiring having to stand while going through so many ero-videos that don't appeal to you

570
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,060
Just leave then

571
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,340
Out of standing or sitting, which is more painful to do for a long period of time?

572
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:12,210
So, the validation is conducted in this studio

573
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,060
The four challengers are

574
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,870
I think it will be very miserable

575
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,460
This cast

576
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,870
First, the challenge is decided by drawing lots

577
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,600
Sitting on the floor
-I can move while standing

578
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,230
Can't move while standing

579
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,620
Standing but can't move is too tiring

580
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,090
What's going on?

581
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,560
Oh, no, no.
-Can't move, right?

582
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,640
This is super easy for me
-Sitting in the chair

583
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,000
By the way, the chair is this one

584
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,570
The chair is at the lower limit of what can barely be considered a chair

585
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,810
Accidentally standing is more tiring than you think, right?

586
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:56,040
Once I hit 40 I want to sit in a soft chair and act as host

587
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,470
This time it's a combination showdown

588
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,800
The duo who stays until the end wins

589
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,100
The challenge begins

590
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,760
It begins

591
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,360
Is Anthony sitting in the right position?

592
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,890
Sitting on the ground, hands cannot touch the ground

593
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,860
If I sit cross-legged, my legs will go numb immediately

594
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,360
My weight will instantly slow down the blood circulation

595
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,180
Not good, this position is also a little strange, i'm getting some numbness

596
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,570
Only sat for three minutes

597
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,200
You're not going to die, are you?

598
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,040
Hands can not touch the ground

599
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,070
You don't have to be so nervous at the beginning

600
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,930
I can stand on both legs separately

601
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,610
If I get tired I can change legs

602
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,540
Feet cannot leave the ground

603
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,480
So maybe it is more difficult to sit

604
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,620
My friends back home

605
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,080
And others think that when we test such theories

606
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,190
There's a break in the middle

607
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,660
If we actually had a chance to rest it wouldn't be so bad

608
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,720
They're huddled together

609
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,160
By now, an hour has passed in a harmonious manner

610
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,200
This light looks so nasty

611
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,300
Surprisingly, it is completely fine

612
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,710
At this moment i'm not as tired as expected

613
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:03,810
I'm suffering

614
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,860
Anthony looks pretty tortured

615
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,930
I'm feeling slightly tormented

616
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,910
I didn't expect my butt to be so sore

617
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,220
Really?

618
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,490
You're impressive to stand for an hour and not feel anything

619
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,420
Totally comfortable

620
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:21,230
Restlessness begins to set in for the seating team

621
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,410
Two hours after the start

622
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,960
Is this the toilet?

623
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:41,010
▼  They can go to the toilet once every two hours for One minute
▼  But must keep their position

624
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,260
In there

625
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,450
How to go to the toilet

626
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,190
Can I stand up to open the door?

627
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,800
Should be able to?

628
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,730
And then I can only sit down to piss?
-Yeah

629
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,470
Then the time reaches 12:30

630
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,980
It's already midday

631
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,790
There are three capsules in this room with menus written on them

632
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,790
Please find them

633
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,560
I'm super hungry

634
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,260
I'm hungry too.
-Can't you give it to us properly?

635
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,490
Only three so one goes without?

636
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,990
It's lunchtime

637
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,090
Find the hidden menus in the room

638
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,830
And get the corresponding lunch

639
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,470
Sakai can look for it then

640
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,810
There's one!

641
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:17,080
Inside that, put your hand inside

642
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,990
The Alco&Peace team get the first capsule

643
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,660
Find more

644
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:23,810
Not only that

645
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,760
Ah, there's one below

646
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,660
This is something only Anthony can get

647
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,390
No, it's out of reach

648
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,390
Use your feet to reach

649
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,760
The sofa's gotta be moved to reach it

650
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,200
That's it!

651
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,730
Great!

652
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,300
One more to go!

653
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,540
There is a good chance that it is in here

654
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,040
Dangerous!

655
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,310
I'll hold it for you.
-What?

656
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,180
There it is, there it is

657
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,710
Hey, is there one there?

658
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,790
Found it! But out of reach

659
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,960
I see it!
-It's out of reach!

660
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,030
I got it.
-Great!

661
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,870
Found it!

662
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,030
Curry Rice

663
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,870
Superb

664
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,770
Cup Noodles
-Also good

665
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,670
Bento
-Wow!

666
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,270
No, no, no. One of them is mine

667
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,270
Your sense of survival is really too weak

668
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,040
I didn't think it would be so easy to steal it from you

669
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,580
Why should we give it to you?

670
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,550
You are not in a position to blame me

671
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,050
You didn't do anything

672
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:26,880
I found it!

673
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,050
Then don't tell them!

674
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,290
Get it yourself, isn't that better?

675
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,190
It's too high I can't reach it

676
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,410
The final result of the discussion is...

677
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,620
Sakai gets cup noodles

678
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,580
Otoni and Hirako share the curry rice

679
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:47,800
And Anthony, who refused to compromise, took the bento box

680
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,040
You can eat at the table

681
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,680
Yes, I'm eating here

682
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,440
You're good
-Yes i'm good at looking after people

683
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,280
Thank you

684
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,520
Want a bite?

685
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,990
If we were in the movie, you'd be the first one to die

686
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,140
After eating, 3 hours has passed from the start of the verification

687
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,810
But it's really good to be able to stand the whole time

688
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:30,810
I'm getting a bit of a reprieve now, my fatigue level has dropped from 3 to 2

689
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,980
Only 2

690
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,220
Just now it was 3.5, now it's about 2, and time is going faster

691
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,820
I'm about 6

692
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,660
Standing all the time is good

693
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,220
I feel more relaxed than before

694
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,130
However

695
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,840
It's been 4 hours

696
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,730
I'm feeling fatigue of 9.5. It's bad

697
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,370
Seriously, I'm really dying, its 9.5

698
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,500
Really?

699
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,010
I'm really in pain

700
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,080
At this stage

701
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,050
Anthony on the floor's pain level seems to have increased dramatically

702
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,310
The floor isn't even soft
-Yes

703
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,450
It's over. 9.85.
-This is bad

704
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,680
It's impossible

705
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,920
It's great to be able to walk around

706
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,540
You'd be jealous!

707
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,220
I want to walk!
-The view is completely different

708
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,490
I want to see it too

709
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,760
Look at me and tell me what it looks like.
-Ok

710
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,400
A different angle is good
-Indeed

711
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,790
8 hours and 30 minutes have passed and no one has admitted defeat

712
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,200
Amazing
-8 hours?

713
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,220
I'm sorry.
-Huh?

714
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,620
Let's have dinner together before we go

715
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,020
Do not give up, Anthony!

716
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,490
Time for dinner.
-Great!

717
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:55,200
This time there are no teams, you'll cook and eat together

718
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:00,610
So, the two people who can move cook dinner

719
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,810
Everyone's gone, and suddenly it's painful

720
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,030
Lonely, isn't it?

721
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:12,370
Hirako, who cannot move, has pain in his legs and feet at this time

722
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,400
Next

723
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,720
My back is not working

724
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,290
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

725
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:18,960
No, seriously

726
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,120
Let's eat, let's eat

727
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,690
Let's talk after dinner, Anthony

728
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,760
Don't overdo it

729
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,660
Anthony, don't!

730
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,230
Wait wait

731
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,370
It's not a good time, is it?
-It's almost time to eat

732
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,930
Sit up, Anthony!

733
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,370
Great job!

734
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,810
Safe

735
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,470
He's not a baby!

736
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,580
Where do you hurt?

737
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,480
It hurts everywhere. It's starting to hurt in the neck too.
-Neck?

738
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,650
Neck, back, waist and legs

739
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,450
Every part from top to bottom

740
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,450
Pain all over my body

741
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,620
No, Anthony!

742
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,420
Hurry up and make dinner!

743
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,790
OI, YAKISOBA!

744
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,560
OK

745
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,990
Ah, I can't!

746
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,330
Check it out. Yakisoba.
-It looks delicious!

747
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,800
Anthony, eat

748
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,570
Can I eat it?

749
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,050
So gentle

750
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,230
It's okay, eat it

751
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:14,050
Anthony can only forget the pain when he eats

752
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,310
This guy doesn't given up easily

753
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,850
Is Anthony still alive?

754
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,480
I'm fine, i'm fine

755
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,180
Let's eat this ramen too!

756
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,820
Do you have chopsticks?

757
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,090
Heh~

758
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,920
Quickly answer to "i've got some"
-I've got some

759
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,790
Say "Yes" loudly

760
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,330
I can't take it anymore

761
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,800
Anthony!
-What have you done?

762
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,030
You've held on for so long already!

763
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,170
ANTHONY!!

764
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,470
Seriously?

765
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,510
Ramen!
-Anthony!

766
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,510
I can't

767
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,280
Anthony!

768
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:52,440
Sitting on the floor, Anthony loses after 9 hours and 39 minutes

769
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:53,990
Still very impressive

770
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,790
Whoa it feels super weird

771
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:02,020
Super weird

772
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,130
Feels like being on a train

773
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,970
After sitting for so long and suddenly standing up you look so big

774
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,700
Anthony looks weird

775
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,900
Was he this tall before?

776
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,740
I feel a really powerful shaking

777
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:13,970
It's shaking!

778
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,940
This room is not tilted, right?
-No.

779
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,620
Sure enough, sitting on the floor is torturous!

780
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,340
Hands can't even lay on the ground is also tough

781
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,790
I feel like Haranishi couldn't sit on the floor for a second

782
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,430
He's the kind of person who can't sit still?

783
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,950
Another two hours have passed since Anthony's defeat

784
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,110
The time is 10:00 p.m

785
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,730
Finally

786
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,940
Fatigue and a feeling of fullness cause Hirako to be attacked by the Sandman

787
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,560
Bed time

788
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,870
I can't hold it any longer

789
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,910
Standing still without moving is too tough

790
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,240
It seems that you two will have to battle it out

791
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,640
Well, that's fine for the moment

792
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,350
But it won't last much longer

793
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,490
Torturous

794
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,830
Can't even imagine the torment

795
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,200
Already asleep?

796
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,080
Moved?

797
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,700
Wow, this is really...

798
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,400
The end

799
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:22,000
Standing and dozing, Hirako lost his balance

800
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,170
What a tragic exit

801
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,210
Defeated in 13 hours and 34 minutes

802
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,440
After eating, the soles of the feet were nourished

803
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,650
So it felt like I could still hold on a little bit

804
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,150
Are you relaxed in this position now?

805
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,420
Super relaxed

806
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,390
I guess it that's how it'd be

807
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,620
So now it's a duel between Sakai and Otini

808
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,830
How is it going now?

809
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,330
Pretty exhausted

810
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,300
The minute you stop walking your legs will stop working

811
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,670
The heel is especially uncomfortable

812
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,070
My back and butt is surprisingly tired

813
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,980
At 0:00, midnight, the calendar is turned forward a day

814
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:00,870
And we ask them what they would like to eat

815
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,590
As a late night snack

816
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,720
It's delicious! It's so good!

817
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,480
After 15 hours and 20 minutes

818
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,660
It's after 1:00!

819
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,190
I can't do it anymore

820
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,290
Otini, I can't

821
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:23,400
I really want to use my hands as support
-No.

822
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:27,700
Can I please?
-What?

823
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,770
Can I ask you?

824
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:42,080
It's also hard to give up

825
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,390
Don't look at me

826
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,070
What's going on here?

827
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:56,500
I'll leave the rest to you. I'm sorry

828
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,310
Too tiring!

829
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,320
Standing and walking Sakai is defeated in 15 hours and 37 minutes

830
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,630
Impressive you could stand that long

831
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,730
Too tiring!

832
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:10,350
Now it's too easy, super comfy

833
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,940
That's for sure

834
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,810
At this point, the winner is decided

835
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:18,520
And Otini attempts to complete 24-hours

836
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,120
Wow~

837
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:23,400
But

838
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:35,010
Like a little baby

839
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,570
Thirty minutes after Sakai's defeat

840
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:48,510
Sleepy Otini is also attacked by the Sandman

841
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,660
It's easier to stay awake if you have someone to talk to

842
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,690
Oh no
-He's gonna fall!

843
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,520
I'm going to be scolded again

844
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,840
Otini, sitting in a chair, is defeated after 16 hours and 10 minutes

845
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:06,890
We won't scold you

846
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,910
In summary
If it wasn't Otini, the 24-hour mark might've been reached

847
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:16,660
What do you all think?

848
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,660
Sitting is easier to hold on

849
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,210
It was awesome! Like a blockbuster movie

850
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:23,920
In the end, there was lots of "Don't look at me" and "I can't do it"

851
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,920
There was a sense of teamwork too
-Yeah

852
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,120
It was a great story

853
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,960
If anyone says "comedians are useless"

854
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,600
I'll beat them up

855
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,130
You're in that headspace now?

856
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:33,760
After all, we went through this theory together

857
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,600
It gave rise to many emotions

858
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,800
So, that's that. But we also have another theory today

859
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,540
More?

860
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,770
I presume everyone has done push-ups before?
-Yes

861
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,400
Matsumoto is good at them because he is a meat daruma...

862
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,900
What a venomous tongue!

863
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,620
You're saying strange things today

864
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,260
Because his muscle is very well developed, I mean...

865
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,300
In a good way, right?

866
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,350
Yes, I say this with great respect

867
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,860
When it comes to the basic technique its like this, with the hands as support

868
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,660
You bend the elbow and go down

869
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,680
Yes, yes

870
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,980
Yes, that's it

871
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,380
On the TBS former program

872
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,400
Sport Man No. 1

873
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,220
Was there cheating in regard to this?

874
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,580
Push-ups were performed on this show in a peculiar way

875
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,070
Really?  -Yes.

876
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:18,920
Someone did?

877
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,440
Please take a look at this evidence

878
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,920
On the right Nakayama bends his arms flexing arm

879
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,880
But Iketani next to him

880
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,880
Doesn't seem to be moving his elbows much

881
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,880
Yes, indeed

882
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,660
Ah, he's not using his arms

883
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,500
Pretty sly

884
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,340
Indeed

885
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,060
Only the chin?
-Jaw only

886
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,260
Super happy, but too cunning

887
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:44,230
Why is this being brought up now?

888
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,520
Someone needs to intervene

889
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,420
Now?

890
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,560
In the final days of the Heisei era

891
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,000
Yes, you can't leave it until after the next year

892
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,020
Exactly
-Yeah

893
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,460
So, the theory is this:

894
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:00,320
Can anyone beat Naoki Iketani at Naoki Iketani-style push-ups?

895
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,760
You've already said it!

896
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,350
He's already obviously the best!

897
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,900
Can it be proven?

898
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:28,440
Can anyone beat Naoki Iketani at Naoki Iketani-style push-ups?

899
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:33,020
First, we ask the man himself

900
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:38,690
What "Naoki Iketani style"? First of all...

901
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,440
Look, he's getting angry

902
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:42,120
We've been doing push-ups like that since we were kids

903
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,300
Although very concerned about the "we"...

904
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,560
His brother also does it, right?

905
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,230
Yukio too
-Yeah

906
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,900
As he doesn't seem to realize, we ask the question again

907
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,540
There is an impression that "it is a bit cunning"...

908
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,510
No no no no

909
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,210
It's not a trick!

910
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,800
This place is stiff, right?

911
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,510
It's not about that, though, it's about going down

912
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:08,520
So I think its a standard push-up

913
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,260
So

914
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:17,720
This time, we apply Naoki Iketani's so-called "standard" to the rules for a competition

915
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:23,200
Whether the arms are bending or not is of no concern

916
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,300
Instead, the person who presses the button more than once with his or her chin wins

917
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,880
So, this is Naoki Iketani-style "Quick Muscle"

918
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:39,350
It's "Iketani Naoki style", because it has my name on it

919
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,480
I don't think I can lose

920
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,140
Yeah

921
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,390
You have to win

922
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:47,680
Challenging this founder are 3 people who are proud of their muscle

923
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,440
First of all, the first winner of Sasuke

924
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,240
Who once did 307 push-ups in 3 minutes

925
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,060
Kazuhiko Akiyama, the world Quick Muscle record holder

926
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,480
This is a good one

927
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,640
I hold the record with confidence

928
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:09,180
But I think I can exceed 307 times

929
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,600
The next challenger is

930
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:17,360
The man with both flesh and chin, Antokino Inoki

931
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,700
Ah, this is a good one

932
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,620
Just the right type of potential for this competition

933
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,160
Naoki Iketani-style, that's not a push-up

934
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,900
He'll witness the chin difference

935
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,320
The final challenger is

936
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,680
There he is!

937
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,880
The injured Katsumi Yamada

938
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:40,740
3 minutes of push-ups changed my life

939
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,980
I participated in the Kinki Regional Competition and won there.

940
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,550
Then I was called up to take part in Sasuke

941
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,920
He cares a lot, then

942
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,880
So, Yamada and the other four

943
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,280
Employ the system in a competition

944
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,020
Quick Muscle in the style of Naoki Iketani

945
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,140
Naoki Iketani style push-ups

946
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,100
Who will be the winner?

947
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,140
Cares a lot!

948
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,060
The result...

949
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,040
3 2 1

950
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,620
Now the 3 minutes of hell begins

951
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,080
Who will be the king?

952
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:19,920
What will happen?

953
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:25,640
First of all, Iketani doesn't bend his arms and only moves his face up and down to press the button

954
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,120
Look at the Iketani-style Quick Muscle!

955
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,600
To not be called "cunning"

956
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,540
Tonight this man is the rule

957
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,520
This man cannot lose. How about it, Iketani?

958
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,280
However, Quick Muscle world record holder Akiyama

959
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,860
Is going at a speed that exceeds that of Iketani

960
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,060
That's fast!

961
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,960
No bending of the arms at all

962
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,160
Only small movements to increase the count

963
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,920
Not bad for world-class Akiyama

964
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,280
He's showing a nice understanding of the Iketani-style rules

965
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,610
And quickly exceeds 130 times

966
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,300
So fast!

967
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,710
Is this a push-up?

968
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,550
Not push-ups at all

969
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,490
So, what about the injured Mr. Sasuke, Yamada?

970
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,880
What's going on?

971
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,860
What are you doing? This guy...

972
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,140
For some reason, he is the only one doing actual push-ups

973
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,700
Although he shows strong power, his count is growing slowly

974
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,000
Next: Antokino Inoki

975
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,500
It's almost not push-ups at all

976
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,980
He is just using the stretch of his jaw to increase the count

977
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,140
This is not Iketani-style anymore!

978
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,220
Will this be allowed?

979
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,520
However, there is no problem at this time

980
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:21,440
Only with this rare chin and his sense of competition

981
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,980
A very impressive chin!

982
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,660
So, one minute has passed

983
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,740
Akiyama leads the pack

984
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,120
He will soon reach 300

985
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,780
Then, our own Iketani, followed by the black horse Antokino Inoki

986
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,180
How is Yamada?

987
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,640
He's been overtaken too far

988
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,540
Yamada, go for it!

989
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,420
Is his suspicious injury okay?

990
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,600
So,

991
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,320
Half of the time has now passed

992
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,980
They're doing the same thing

993
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,220
So, at this point it's 1:30

994
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:57,000
Will the creator Iketani be able to hold on and catch up to international champion Akiyama?

995
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,060
2 minutes have passed

996
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,620
At about twice the speed of the normal Quick Muscle

997
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:10,040
Several people experience head and jaw fatigue they had never experienced before

998
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,880
Next

999
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,620
3 2 1

1000
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,160
It's over!

1001
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:26,640
Naoki Iketani-style push-ups: the winner is Akiyama with 544 times

1002
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:31,680
What you just did was not push-ups, right?

1003
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:32,910
Yeah

1004
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,000
In summary
Although it wasn't a push-up, Akiyama won

1005
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,520
So... the results

1006
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,180
The person that can do standard push-ups the best can also do Iketani-style push-ups very well

1007
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,720
That's right

1008
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,920
Yes, indeed

1009
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,460
It's easier than push-ups, right?

1010
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,580
Yes, you just have to move here

1011
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,760
Is Iketani unchanged from the records of that time?

1012
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,560
Good question

1013
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,740
He's been doing it since the old days, Iketani-style

1014
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,610
I see

1015
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:02,020
What good did this serve in the end?

1016
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:34,910
