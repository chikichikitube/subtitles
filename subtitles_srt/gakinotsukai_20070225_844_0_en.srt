8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,320
It's been a while

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Right?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,200
So it's Fujiwara today,

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,200
Not Haranishi (his partner)

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,200
That does seem to be the question

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,800
Yes

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,100
Really?

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,120
And it's Fujimon...he's not really that funny,

16
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,520
What the hell?

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,720
He gets by using his health

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,320
Let's introduce him

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,420
It's strange

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,820
Come in FUJIWARA

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,280
Looking forward to this

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,280

Toshifumi Fujimoto

26
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,740
It's not Haranishi right?

27
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,640
Yes, it said Fujimoto on the schedule

28
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,640
You look weird!

29
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,640
Weird

30
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,280
What kind of face was that?

31
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,800
It's too early for us, for a guy like me

32
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,800
Ah really?

33
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,800
"Ah really?"

34
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,800
Encourage me

35
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Right right

36
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,560
Was the room always this small?

37
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,720
My face is too big!

38
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,220
Sorry?

39
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,120
My face is too big

40
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,960
It makes the room feel small

41
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,800
Oh is that so?

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,900
He's the 25th one,

43
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,460
What's your goal?

44
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,480
The top

45
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,700
Indeed

46
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,060
Where do you think you'll come?

47
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,080
Right, I want to be above 13, Miyasako

48
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,360
Ah I see

49
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,320
Ameagari Kesshitai - Miyasako

50
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,940
I think of this as a turning point for us

51
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,720
You think you can still succeed?

52
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,920
I can still keep going!

53
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,920
You should be telling me that

54
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,920
You'll just dawdle around after

55
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,440
I don't want to dawdle like that!

56
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,840
Fujimoto you might get job offers after this

57
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,840
That's true

58
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,200
Just keep getting laughs here,

59
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,600
You might get top billings after this

60
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,900
People might talk about your performance

61
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,680
But I've been doing this for 25 years. I can usually tell the face of a comedian that's going to fail.

62
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,560
So, how will Fujimoto fare?

63
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,080
Downtown Gaki no Tsukai Arrehende!!

Maybe that one

68
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,840
"Hamada presents Comedian Impersionation competition" - Why does Hamada present it?

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,440

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,240
So this guy can't do impressions?

75
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,240
They must pay 1000 yen for laughing

76
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,440
Probably not this one then

77
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,260
Hamada's not doing anything?

78
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,440
Well I don't know

79
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,290
Hamada has to do it right?

Hamada has to do it right?

83
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,440
TN: Endo should've called him Hamada-san

84
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,440
You're calling me Hamada?

85
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
I said Hamada?

86
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,540
He said Hamada right?

87
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,780
You heard that right?

88
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,580
I was taken back

89
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,480
What about this one?

90
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,430
"How much coffee is Matsumoto worth?"

91
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,870
How much coffee can we buy using Matsumoto's savings?

92
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,970
I wanna see that

93
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,970
I bet it's a lot!

94
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,890
I bet it is a lot

95
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,360
He's changing the subject

96
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,600
I changed the subject

97
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,060
He changed the subject

98
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,720
The Yama no Ishimatsu, we did that because I did Kendo before

99
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,740

Haranishi's mom

102
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,720
It was rather funny

103
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
You didn't bomb today, don't worry

104
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,960
Don't get so upset

105
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,970
People laughed at your jokes

106
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,840
You and Kito-san

107
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,840
I'm gonna go greet Tamori-san, alright?

108
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,720
That was awful, we got no reaction

109
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,200
Nobody was laughing

110
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,400
I told you right?

111
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,450
Shut up bitch

112
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,120
You're the one who froze up!

113
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,880
What's your problem?!

114
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,120
What's your problem?!

115
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,120
Asshole!

116
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,120
What the fuck do you want?!

117
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,120
You keep messing around like that

118
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,120
Tell me what you mean

119
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,380
What do you mean?

120
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,120
You messed it up

121
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,120
Well it's your fault too!

122
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,120
It's your fault

123
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,120
I didn't do anything

124
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,120
You only blame others!

125
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,720
I got some laughs didn't it?!

126
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,840
I want to get good ratings, what's wrong with that?!

127
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,380
It's cause you messed up! It's cause-

128
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,680
Am I wrong?

129
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,140
All you care about is the ratings!

130
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,480
Am I wrong?

131
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,820
This is - *pant* - your fault! - *pant*!

132
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Let me go!

133
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,820
Let me go!

134
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,440
Let me go!

135
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,440
Let me go, then I'll show you

136
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm not ever letting you go

137
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,140
What? You bald asshole

138
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,760
You're fucking bald aren't you?

139
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,420
Bald!

140
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,300
Baldy!

141
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,020
Bald!

142
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,820
Shut up bitch, you're gonna go bald too!

143
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,120
What the hell are you doing?! Stop it! Stop it!

144
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,100
How did this happen?

145
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,460
Calm down, alright calm down

146
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,720
Calm down, alright?

147
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,720
What are you doing?!

148
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,370
What are you doing? Cut it out idiot

149
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,420
Shut up!

150
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,420
What?!

151
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,420
What are you doing?!

152
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,420
Stop it stop it

153
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,420
Stop!

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,270
STOP! STOP IT!

155
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,770
It's her fault!

156
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,320
Bald!

157
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,170
Bald!

158
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,420
Stop

159
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,270
Stop saying that

160
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:26,980
Bald!

161
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,280
Stop

162
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,880
Bald!

163
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
Don't say that!

164
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:28,980
Bald!

165
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,380
Stop!

166
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,980

Bald!

170
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,420
He didn't do anything

171
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,920
He didn't do anything right?

172
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,220
It was so long too

173
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,300
It was so long, they were really fighting!

174
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,420
Right?

175
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,520
This isn't Shichi Henge

176
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,100
This isn't Shichi Henge at all!

177
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,640
Penalties are given to charity.

178
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,110
Was that your mom?

179
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,960
It's my mom, and his mom

180
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,360
That was amazing, they were so angry

181
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,360
They sure were

182
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,480
That aside, he didn't even perform his first act by himself

183
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,560
He left it to his parent!

184
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,360
Have you ever seen that? A comedian who leaves it to his parents

185
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,720
Commercial Break

186
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,120
Well, we should get started on that soon

187
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,960
If we don't get the first steps done,

188
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,880
Yeah

189
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
We can't keep going like this-

190
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,160
That's true

191
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,200
That guy plays dirty doesn't he?

192
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,840
Put it in

193
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,050
It was too long,

194
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,820
He needs to stop doing multiple transformation during one transformation

195
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,200
That's true!

196
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,220
He had his skits written on his hand

197
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,430
The next skit he's gonna do?

198
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,970
All the timings and everything

199
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,120
He's quite a crude man isn't he?

200
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,650
Hidenori Nakai
- Yoshimoto executive who helped out DownTown when they were young

201
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,650
Good morning

202
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,640
Hey Fujimoto

203
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,540
Good morning

204
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,900
Hey Fujimoto

205
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,150
Good Morning

206
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,360
Hey Fujimoto

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
Yeah recently-I've asked for an appoitment

208
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,720
An appoitment

209
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,620
To get-

210
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,280
You're not taking this seriously

211
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,280
How many regular gigs?

212
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,850
Yeah, yea-

213
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,150
Zero

214
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,850
Zero?

215
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,550
Yes

216
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,880
Who gave you the name FUJIWARA?

217
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,280
Oh um, you sir

218
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,580
You know, when FUJIWARA does bad,

219
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,350
It's like I'm doing bad too, right?

220
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,560
Show me your payslip, your latest one

221
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,950
Oh, yes

222
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,040
So short!

223
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,440
"Job Change Festival"?

224
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,240
"Job Change Festival" huh?

225
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,540
yes

226
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,220
You made 60,000 from this? (< $600)

227
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,760
It was um, it was half the payment

228
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,560
Just 60,000 yen ?

229
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,260
So with the apperance fee that's just 150,000 yen

230
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,560
No that-

231
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,960
This is the only work you had for one month?

232
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,690
Yes

233
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,990
You're fooling around

234
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,290
I'm doing my best!

235
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,890
You're getting mad?

236
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,890
I'm working really hard too

237
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,390
No if you were-Are you trying to look cool?

238
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,190
You're putting up appearances

239
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,600
Let me get my payslip

240
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,390
No you don't need it

241
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,390
Sorry just-

242
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,250
Who needs that shitty payslip

243
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,730
I can't let my juniors see that

244
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,430
That guy is the lowest of the low

245
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,430
Nakai-san huh?!

246
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,990
I looked and saw Nakai-san heading over, I thought we're in trouble now

247
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,890
That was his real payslip right?

248
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,890
It must be

249
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,560
I saw everything on it

250
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,120
That guy is way too careless

251
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,410
Nakai-san can speak better than comedians

252
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,680
I was thinking the whole time, "Man he doesn't stutter"

253
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,580
How come after his skits end, we're the ones who get all excited?

254
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:44,820
TN: He's parodying one of Hamada's songs

255
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,440
"Should I put down the car seat and take--Masatoshi Stinky Mouth

256
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,520
"The cigarette fills up the room-Masatoshi Stinky Mouth

257
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,000
Hamada you're not funny, You're not  funny Hamada

258
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,920
"Make the sunrise my background music"

259
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,520
"Hamada is f*cking an ugly girl on the side"

260
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,840
"Everything"

261
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,860
"Hamada by himself"

262
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:27,040
"A fading dream - ****** Hamada"

263
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,040
"A place I want to reach"

264
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,560
"In your arms, Hamada's Black Sunday"

265
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,970
If you're gonna use me, get a few more laughs!

266
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,400
Yeah. This was simply your junior insulting you!

267
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,500
I'll never forget that bitter smile he had when he came in

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,220
She is Fujimoto's stylist

269
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,840
Morning!

270
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,220
Good morning

271
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,220
This will be your hat today

272
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200
Ok

273
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
Alright. Will it fit?

274
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,280
It's a bit tight

275
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,640
Oh? I apologise

276
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,050
This is a larger one

277
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,040
Ok

278
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,280
My head really hurts

279
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
It kinda hurts

280
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,330
This, this one

281
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,010
I can't do that one

282
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,510
Are there more?

283
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,880
This is impossible!

284
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,920
I can't get it on

285
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,280
It even says LOVE, let's do this one

286
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,280
That one? Alright

287
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,560
Let's go

288
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,560
2 more left?

289
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,640
He got some money at the start right?

290
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,940
But we didn't laugh because of him

291
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,940
Yeah it wasn't cause of him

292
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,280
Nakamura-san and everyone, they're pretty vintage

293
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,980
That's true

294
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,800
Where is the Gundam?

295
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,890
I found you Gundam!

296
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,840
Put your hands down!

297
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,340
Your ha-

298
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,140
Guntank!

299
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,950
Guntank!

300
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,150
What are you doing?!

301
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,050
Amuro's gonna hit!

302
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,290
Well done Amuro!

303
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,960
Amuro's gonna hit!

304
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,130
Well done Amuro!

305
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,280
Amuro's gonna hit!

306
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,040
Well done Amuro (x5)

307
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,960
Amuro's gonna hit!

308
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,960
Amuro's gonna hit!

309
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,440
The Gundam guy was funnier

310
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,200
That was an avant-garde performance

311
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,200
Indeed

312
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,700
A song is good too

313
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,700
I couldn't hear anything at all

314
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,920
Yeah, we need to bring them in again

315
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,570
Marks from the bat on his bare ass

316
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,800
Marks from the bat on his bare ass

317
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,800
That's dirty!

318
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,160
That's why he did the Gundam skit!

319
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,010
That's why!

320
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,080
What's he doing?

321
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,280
This guy...I bet he got his ass smacked while preparing

322
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,400
It's swollen isn't it?

323
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,290
Amazing!

324
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,890
I've never seen someone with such a swollen ass!

325
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,740
In these few minutes

326
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,400
That's amazing if he planned it

327
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,280
That hurts, that's gotta hurt

328
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,040
I couldn't hold back against that

329
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,440
Couldn't hold back

330
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,660
If he planned that ass swelling, that's amazing

331
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,280
He probably calculated that

332
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,160
Indeed

333
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,140
Well it's over

334
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,140
Thank you!

335
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,840
Well done!

336
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
He passed 30,000

337
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,840
Hmm?!

338
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,120
35,000 yen

339
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,040
9th place

340
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,890
Where did I come in?

341
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,920
9th, amazing!

342
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,120
Exactly as I predicted

343
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,640
Exactly as you predicted?

344
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,580
Did you really plan that ass thing?

345
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,580
Yes

346
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,480
It would be hard to see otherwise

347
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,400
I told them to smack it hard, real hard!

348
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,200
He got so excited from showing off his ass

349
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,720
You really cultivated that joke

350
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,330
Maan...

351
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,330
(Can't hear over audience)

352
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,250
I heard from LICENSE,

353
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,130
Yes

354
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,850
They got laughs for the first time in a while!

355
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,290
They always get laughs!

356
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,730
LISCENCE is getting laughs!

357
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,130
It's fine!

358
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,650
Those M1 Comp-

359
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,830
Enough already!

360
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,650
That's fine, they're doing their best

361
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:50,090
Just before this, I took a shit,

362
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,090
Yes

363
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,090
Yes

364
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,610
The toilet at my house, has an automatic lid,

365
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,590
An automatic bidet,

366
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,590
And it also flushes automatically,

367
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,890
If I get used to this,

368
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,450
He's so rich!

369
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,360
No no

370
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,330
It's amazing you knew those toilets existed!

371
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,690
It means you have one like that too right?

372
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,330
What's with that reaction?

373
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,580
You're like (hilarious reference)

374
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,010
So cause of that, the other day I went to a store

375
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,110
And I took a shit without flushing!

376
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,810
Right?

377
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,880
You thought it would flush by itself

378
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,090
I thought it would flush by itself!

379
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,090
So I let it all out, got up

380
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,610
"Well you know" - "OH SHIT I DIDN'T FLUSH!"

381
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,130
You know, there's something that pisses me off,

382
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,130
Yes

383
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,660
The washing machine,

384
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,120
It's too new

385
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,070
It has a child lock on it!

386
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,010
Oh?

387
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,930
So I can't open the dryer!

388
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,930
Cause it's locked

389
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:59,630
During the cycle, like enough already I can see it's totally dry!

390
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,130
It's definitely dried out, I can see that the clothes are fluffy

391
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,990
And I'm the one who told the dryer to make sure it's thoroughly dried

392
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,140
And I did do that, I did that, but,

393
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,220
You know I-

394
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,660
Cause you're too young

395
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,510
You overdid it?

396
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,180
I overdid it, I apologise

397
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,850
I want to open it, but "Channel Lock Channel Lock"

398
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,690
Sorry that was a TBS thing

399
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,390
The child lock

400
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,450
I can't open it, it's impossible

401
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,050
It opens after a certain time right?

402
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,130
And like if you press the suspend button,

403
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,330
If you press it?

404
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,130
After that, no it doesn't open, after that,

405
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,890
It enters "Cool Down"

406
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,570
Yes

407
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,730
Cause it's too hot, so that's another 5-10 minutes, sometimes 2 hours!

408
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,630
I see

409
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,130
It's horrible right? All Japanese manufacturers have this

410
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,530
Oh? I didn't know that

411
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,090
And I want to open it, and I'm just waiting the entire 20 minutes

412
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,700
And when it finally finished-

413
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,790
So just go do something else!

414
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,490
I want to watch it the whole time

415
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,610
I can't do anything else

416
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,370
If I do something else I'll forget about it

417
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,620
Just come when it's finished

418
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,420
And sometimes when it's finally finished, it's not dried properly!

419
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,260
"What the hell!" I thought

420
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,550
And then it takes a really long time for it to heat up after cooling down

421
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,100
So you're judgement was wrong then, it wasn't fully dry

422
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,930
No no, first off what's the deal with that child lock?

423
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,930
Why is there a child lock?

424
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,340
It's so you don't open it right?

425
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,490
What's gonna happen if I open it?

426
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,180
You'll get burned

427
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,250
I'm not gonna get BURNT!

428
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,610
If I was gonna get burned then my pants would be on fire!

429
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,670
They won't!

430
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,770
What the hell! What the hell!

431
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,470
It should be enough for a mom to say "Don't do that!"

432
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,690
It's to prevent a need for that

433
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,090
Even in a new car,

434
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,550
Sometimes you drive it home with the child lock on right?

435
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,550
I've never done that

436
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:09,030
You know in the side of the door, like in the back door there's a child lock right?

437
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,410
So the guy at the dealership probably left it on by accident

438
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,030
And so you can't open the back door from the inside!

439
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,930
You have to open it from outside right?

440
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,040
Exactly! And well this is an indecent story,

441
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:27,680
I told a girl to sit in the backseat and hide herself

442
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,710
Did you really need to say that

443
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,770
Well maybe not,

444
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,090
So I want to keep her hidden right?

445
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,810
But when I said "Alright, get out now!"
She said "It won't open!"

446
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,680
Like that

447
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,530
What was that?

448
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,710
Like "Ladies first"

449
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,950
It would be awful if someone took a photo of that!

450
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,350
That would suck. The fact you had to get out really sucks too

451
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,970
They should make different products for people who have kids and people who don't

452
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,810
You...

453
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,130
And if a kid sticks their hand in and gets hurt it'll be another pain in the ass

454
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,350
yeah

455
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,570
You have a shredder?

456
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,610
Yes, I have.

457
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,370
Why?

458
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,340
Because there's something I don't want anyone to see.

459
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,610
What's that?

460
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,610
It's an obscene document . . .

461
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,250
"Obscene!?"

462
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,210
It's not obscene.

463
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,150
"Obscene?"

464
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,150
It's like a pay stub or something.

465
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,820
Ah, do you cut up your pay stubs?

466
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,950
Of course, so what?

467
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,590
It's not just a vertical slice now, It's a full slice.

468
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,360
It can be cut very small, like this.

469
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,700
Even if it's a vertical slice, that's still a "full slice."

470
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,570
It can be cut very small.

471
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,070
Is that so?

472
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,070
Mine can be cut very small.

473
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,440
But the amount of money in my pay stub isn't small, though!

474
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
I see.

475
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,340
