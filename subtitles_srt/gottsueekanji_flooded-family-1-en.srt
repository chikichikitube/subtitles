Yes

70
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,670
He works with Yuko

71
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,170
He's still young, but he's a supervisor

72
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,900
So you must be making a lot of money?

73
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,670
Don't talk about that, dear

74
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,670

75
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,190
Oh yes, Yuko!

A really nice person

174
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,520

Yes

192
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,590
It's rare that I like someone
the first time I meet them

193
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:22,920
Yes

194
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,350
Actually, when you ask someone something...

195
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,450
you should bow deeply

196
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,620
or it doesn't seem sincere

197
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,670
Right?

198
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,940
You should learn

199
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,470
to understand about how to bow to other people

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,670
Wrong. Hamada-kun

201
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,200
That's not right

202
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,200
I really took care of my daughter

203
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,250
Right?

204
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
Because of that...

205
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,620
you should be able to bow a little deeper

206
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,590
Noodles...

207
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,420
Please let her get married to me

208
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,770
Dear!

209
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,140
Dad!

210
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,650
Hamada-kun
- Yes

211
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,320
It should be 4-5 minutes

212
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,290
No appreciation

213
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,650
Yes, that's true

214
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,190
It shows no appreciation

215
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,200
Do it

216
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,200
Yuko, you too

217
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,600
Don't let your future husband do it by himself

218
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,670
Please let her marry me

219
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,370
Please

220
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,020
Dear!

221
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,820
From our side

222
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,100
Please take care of her

223
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,870
This isn't good
