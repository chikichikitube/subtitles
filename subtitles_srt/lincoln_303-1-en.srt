00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:07,820
On tonight’s “Lincoln,” we present in full the incident that stirred all of Japan!

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:15,790
May 4th, Saturday, 1PM

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:15,790
Setagaya Kinuta Studio

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,140
Ten days ago, Japanese internet users were in a tumult.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,140
The incident that was even covered by Yahoo! News...

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,140
We present the whole truth tonight!

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,590
The members are made to wait in a renewed classroom set of “The Lecturer".

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,910
Hey, everyone, look!

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,100
He opened the door so hard

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,100
he surprised himself.

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,420
It’s like how an animal reacts.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,860
He can’t gauge himself.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,660
He went “boom!” and he’s the one most freaked out.

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,060
He was the closest to the door.  Because the “boom!” was closest to him.

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,800
Quiet!

17
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,670
Changed to a teacher position from today

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,670
Mr. Hamada Masatoshi

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,670
Hamada is the teacher? Mr. Hamada?

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,670
Good morning.

21
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,870
He used to sit with us together, right!?

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,440
Ok, I mean, good morning, but, you’re always sitting here, right?

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,910
From this time, this is “The New Lecturer,” so…

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,650
But if Mr. Hamada is the teacher, then that’s going to be for real.

25
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,390
A real lecture?

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,560
No… I’m going to be your homeroom teacher.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,690
And for every episode a special lecturer will be coming.

28
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,260
So there won’t be that strong… “pressure” coming from the homeroom teacher then?

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,460
That will depend on the time and place.

30
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,770
Can't say there won't be.

31
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,170
That can’t be helped.

32
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,520
What…

33
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,500
The classroom has been renovated and improved.

34
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,270
Everyone’s uniforms, as well, from those dirty tracksuits you had before.

35
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,000
Like private school.

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,770
It’s like those nice ones that rich kids wear, right?

37
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,880
It looks smart.

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,410
And now for our special lecturer.

39
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,220
Please come in!

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,440
Who is the new lecturer?

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,520
Bam!

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,770
Ok!

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,860
The other door, the other door.

44
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Our teacher is Miss Rola!

45
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:10,480
Tonight’s lecturer, looking surprisingly good in a teacher’s outfit is the 23-year-old Rola.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,480
Miss Rola

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,480
Today's special lecturer

48
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,880
What sort of lecture will they receive from a teacher who is twenty years younger than them?

49
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,400
I am angry today!

50
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,660
You’re not angry at all!

51
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,010
I am! Huff, puff…

52
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,130
The teacher is angry. Listen properly.

53
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,330
You’re angry at us?

54
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,410
That’s right!

55
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,470
We haven’t done anything to be angered at.

56
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,490
You have!  First, here I go.

57
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,170
“First, here I go….”

58
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,010
The teacher is speaking!

59
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,910
Ok. This is my name.

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,910
Rola

61
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,150
We know…

62
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,020
You’re pretty famous.

63
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,890
I say “Rola” more than “Saijo Hideki”. Really.

64
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,730
Starting from Miyasako, please introduce yourself.

65
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,930
Whoa, that’s scary.

66
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,030
A self-introduction?

67
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,030
Yup.

68
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,740
Like where do you live…

69
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,400
Personal information like that!?

70
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,670
The teacher told you to do it!

71
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,910
Personal information like that in a self-introduction!?

72
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,480
Your address! Say your address!

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,180
Mr. Mimura! A self-introduction.

74
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,180
What food do you like?

75
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,050
Um, sukiyaki

76
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,620
I love sukiyaki, too!

77
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,520
Really?

78
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,320
Do you dip it in egg when you eat it?

79
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,160
An explanation of sukiyaki?

80
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,640
Really nice.

81
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,370
Matsumoto!

82
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,040
Tell us like where you grew up…

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,270
Like where you grew up or I mean,

84
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,680
Ok, where did you go for Golden Week?

85
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,680
Thas has nothing to do with that!

86
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,680
That’s totally different!

87
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,780
Where I grew up?

88
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,820
What he did for Golden Week, is what you’d like to ask?

89
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,820
Yeah, I'm curious!

90
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,820
For Golden Week?

91
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,120
I was at home at times, I went to the park as well at times…

92
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,990
Huh? Which park?

93
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,900
I don’t know the exact name of the park.

94
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,460
It wasn’t a famous park or anything.

95
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,530
Oh, really. Did you like jump-rope or— were you playing a lot there?

96
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,830
It’s not like he went there alone!

97
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,140
What did you play there?

98
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,370
Well, I mean, I brought my daughter there...

99
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,540
What, you have a daughter?

100
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,850
Do you know absolutely nothing about me?!

101
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,130
Wow!

102
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,610
That’s cute!

103
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,150
Why would he go to the park alone to play jump-rope at his age?

104
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,050
That’s really nice.

105
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:43,060
Rola, on her A-game, thoroughly teases the members at her own pace.  She then reveals the topic of tonight’s lecture.

106
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,230
What I am angrily huffing and puffing about is...

107
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,400
Yes, what is it?

108
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,410
She’s going to write.

109
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,300
Yup.

110
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,380
Just erase it if you want to.

111
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,640
She has long legs.

112
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,640
Do you know this?

113
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,310
Twitter.

114
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,010
Yeah, Twitter. Heard of it.

115
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,010
In English, it’s “Twitter.”

116
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,850
Whoa.

117
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,070
What’s that about?  I didn’t know you had that kind of thing going on.

118
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,590
That’s right.

119
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,460
Are you all on Twitter?

120
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,560
People who are on Twitter?

121
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,100
Just Miyasako?

122
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,000
Just me?

123
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,880
I have been on Twitter before!

124
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,770
I’m not on it anymore!

125
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,270
So that’s just Miyasako, then.

126
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,400
The others aren’t doing it.

127
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,440
I really have no clue how it works.

128
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,840
I see!

129
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,610
Teacher, what are you "huffing and puffing" angrily about?

130
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,650
Because everyone isn't on Twitter !

131
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,250
Who wouldn’t be on Twitter in this day and age?  That's what she’s angry about.

132
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,490
You’re all behind the times.

133
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,930
So today I’m here to force everyone to get on Twitter !

134
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,120
Social media evolves at a dizzying pace.

135
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,900
The Lincoln members have not been paying attention and have been left behind by technology.

136
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,940
This cannot continue!

137
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,740
So this episode, Rola’s lecture is: “Let’s all start Twitter.”

138
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:15,690
(as of May 4th, 2013)

139
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:15,690
Ariyoshi Hiroiki


Son Masayoshi

140
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:15,690
Japanese Twitter Users With The Most Followers

141
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:15,690
Shinoda Mariko


Rola


Kyary Pamyu Pamyu

142
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,140
Rola is actually one of the most popular Twitter users in Japan,

143
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:15,690
having the fourth-most Twitter followers in Japan after people like Ariyoshi and Son Masayoshi.

144
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:22,640
Rola, with her credentials of 1,440,000 followers, brings a revolution to Lincoln!

145
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,900
And then...

146
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,970
Everyone, don’t be like Mr. Matsumoto, ok?

147
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,140
Matsumoto embarrasses himself with his first tweet!

148
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,560
I want to tweet!

149
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,370
You’re tweeting too much.

150
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:41,000
Their trials and tribulations of using Twitter for the first time!

151
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:41,000
Their trials and tribulations of using Twitter for the first time!

152
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,040
These middle-aged comedians have avoided the internet until now –

153
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,310
we document their foray into Twitter.

154
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,080
It’s unbelievable that Mr. Matsumoto would be on Twitter.

155
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:55,330
The Twitter incident that believe-it-or-not was taken up by Yahoo! News – here we present in full.

156
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:02,100
Because I love Lincoln

157
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:02,100
A breath of fresh air to Lincoln: Rola’s "The New Lecturer."

158
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:02,100
The

159
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,100
New

160
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,100
Lecturer

161
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,100
~The Rola Episode~

162
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,100
~The Rola Episode~

163
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,000
So why are you on Twitter, Mr. Miyasako?

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,230
There was a TV program that…

165
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:12,120
that asked, would you try this for a segment?

166
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,120
Oh, that’s how—

167
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,680
That’s how I started and—

168
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
and Hoto quit after a while.

169
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,420
Why did you quit?

170
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,360
I hadn’t gone golfing in a while so I tweeted, “I want to go golfing.”

171
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,160
Then I got a reply from someone I didn’t know who said, “That’d be wasted on a guy like you.”

172
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,200
So I got pissed, threw it away,
.

173
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,330
So I got pissed, threw it away,
and I quit.

174
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,360
Yeah, that’s uncalled for.

175
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,150
No wonder he quit.

176
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,560
That’s how I quit.

177
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,150
That makes sense.

178
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,700
No way you deserved to have that, come on!

179
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,700
No way.

180
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,400
That’s the thing.

181
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,440
That sort of thing could happen, which is

why I don’t really want to do it either.

182
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,340
Oh, really.  I see.

183
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,550
Other than Miyasako, it seems that people have a negative view of the Twitter experience.

184
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,900
So Rola starts by teaching the positives of the Twitter experience.

185
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,560
So these are the positives of the Twitter experience according to the teacher.

186
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,560
Yes.

187
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,660
Take a look.

188
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,730
Circle number one:

189
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,510
Don’t need that part.

190
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,140
You can make friends.

191
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,120
Circle number two:

192
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,580
You get information.

193
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,310
Like current events, political things— you would want to get the news about that, right?

194
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,580
You can really get updated on things like that.

195
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,250
It’ll tell us about that?

196
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,250
Yup, it will.

197
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,580
Circle number three: You can become popular.

198
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,620
What? Really?

199
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,020
Become popular?

200
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,690
Among whom?

201
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,690
Among whom?

202
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,260
Among the people who are, like, walking around on the street.

203
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,430
I think there are more people who aren’t walking around on the street.

204
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,700
Miyasako, the only one of us on Twitter, would you say these are right?

205
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,460
Yes, things that you really wouldn’t know about.

206
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,930
For example, I might say “I went to a really good ramen place.”

207
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:49,270
Then replies like “This other place is good”, “This place is better,” information like that comes right to you all at once.

208
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,150
In general, most of it is messages of support!

209
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,150
Most of it is positive.

210
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,300
Yeah, it is.

211
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,050
How often do you tweet, Miss Rola?

212
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,150
Hmm, I haven't tweeted at all these couple of days.

213
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,820
And then you’re telling everyone to “Go, go do Twitter!”?

214
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,320
That doesn’t make sense.

215
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,930
Don’t you tweet a lot?

216
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,090
It doesn’t seem like simply tweeting a lot will always increase your number of followers.

217
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,940
What are show businesses personalities on Twitter with a lot of followers tweeting about?

218
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,580

219
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,580
Let’s look at the tweets of popular Twitter users.

220
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:32,020
Now, everyone, are you curious about what

Miss Rola tweets about?

221
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,020
This is Miss Rola, the fourth most popular Twitter user.

222
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,450
It can be short, right?

223
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,760
That’s right.

224
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,130
Mr. Miyasako, what does this part here mean?

225
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,990
That’s where a follower, a regular person, is asking a question.

226
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,690
This is what someone wrote to me.

227
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,070
Don’t say it first!

228
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,070
Oh, sorry.

229
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,980
Someone said “If you use English first, you lose,” and you replied with “Ok” .

230
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,010
So you lost there as a joke, ahh.

231
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,000
“I’m starting to go bald.  What do I do?  Rola, tell me!”

232
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,650
Ahh! Just stick something on there~.

233
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,850
How crude!

234
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,950
Well, there is some truth there!

235
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,950
Yup.

236
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,780
*Gushiken Yoko is a former Japanese boxer.

237
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,780
Lastly, “What is that on Mr. Gushiken’s head?"*

238
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,740
Broccoli!

239
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,860
This is like ogiri  !

240
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,400
This, this is the fourth most popular Twitter user.

241
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,830
Fourth place in the country.

242
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,130
It’s like ogiri, so, it’s tiring, you know?

243
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,830
To see what popular users are tweeting…

244
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,010
For example, this person.

245
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,410
Oh, RG is popular!

246
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,630
Believe it or not.

247
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,680
He’s popular for his “Did you ever notice”-type of jokes.

248
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,640
“A ‘Did you ever notice’ joke for this once-in-a-decade cold wave we're having, please!”, someone tweeted him.

249
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,770
RG replied,

250
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,460
“The news on TV tends to show shots of people slipping on frozen sidewalks.”

251
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,570
So you can just give a straight answer.

252
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,270
For us in the business, it wasn’t that funny.  But for regular people, maybe…

253
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,670
It was a very RG-type of joke.

254
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,010
“A conveyor belt sushi ‘Did you ever notice’ joke, please.”

255
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,250
“Tends to expand the possibilities of mayonnaise.”

256
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,350
They’re getting better!

257
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,050
One more person.  Please take a look at this.

258
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,420
Oh, Wakky.

259
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,220
Oh, Wakky is on, too!

260
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,890
Wakky is popular for his face bits.

261
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,700
You can post photos, too?

262
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,700
Yes, you can!

263
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,500
I see.

264
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,610
“I’m feeling down this morning.  Cheer me up!”

265
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,400
Wakky replies with the title “Face!”

266
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,500
He looks like he's giving it his all.

267
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,720
He put some time into that!

268
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,530
Eww.

269
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,150
He's giving it his all!

270
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,720
Even if I could do that face,  I probably wouldn’t do it!

271
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,170
“Nothing much happened today, so can I get a 'nothing' face?”  He replied with “Face!”

272
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,640
That’s definitely a "nothing" face.

273
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,540
Other than those, there were requests like,

274
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:19,480
“Please give me a face that will energize me” and “Congratulate me on my birthday” to which Wakky gave his faces with full effort.

275
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,820
He put this much in

and he has 18,000 followers.

276
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,290
Even after giving it his all like that?

277
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,540
I haven’t done anything in years.

278
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,800
He has less followers than Hoto.

279
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,130
Even though he’s putting that much effort into these?

280
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,570
But it's amazing!

281
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,340
It’s hard to tell what really works.

282
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,340
So as everyone knows, Miyasako is also on Twitter. You want to see Miyasako’s Twitter as well, right?

283
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,920
Yeah, I want to see Miyasako’s.

284
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,750
Miyasako is the only one of the members that's on Twitter.

285
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,850
Let's take a look at his tweets, with special narration.

286
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,820
I tweet about once every few days.

287
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:22,910
Location-tion shooting from the morning.

288
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:22,910
The great weather makes the location-tion shooting great.

289
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:22,910
I’m excited about what I might encounter-tion!!

290
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:22,910
I've been saying

291
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:22,910
-tion-tion repeatedly,

292
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:22,910
but not because I actually think it’s funny.

293
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:22,910
It’s just that I haven’t gotten any sleep so I just feel like thaa~t

294
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,910
thaa~t…

295
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,020
Mr. Matsumoto, you have a "nothing" face...

296
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,690
You saw this a while ago, right?

297
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,990
First of all,

can I have a chat with the guy doing the narrating?!

298
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,540
Sit down.

299
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,390
Settle down!

300
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,230
That’s not Miyasako?  I thought it might be Miyasako’s voice.

301
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,040
Come on, that’s not my voice!

302
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,040
It sounded similar.

303
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,110
I only feel ill will from him.

304
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,410
There’s more.  Take a look.

305
00:13:51,120 --> 00:14:13,770
Going for a haircut now.

306
00:13:53,570 --> 00:14:13,770
I always think about going for a really different style,

307
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:13,770
but in the end I just settle with something safe.

308
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:13,770
Because I’m scared of the waiting time of being bummed until my hair grows back.

309
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:13,770
Am I a scaredy-cat?

310
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,770
Am I a scaredy-cat?

311
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,770
Eww! Eww!

312
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,470
Scaredy-cat?

313
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,980
Hot, hot.  I feel hot.

314
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,800
Gross.

315
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,590
You can write this much if you want, too.

316
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,480
Disgusting.

317
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,410
It’s a tweet!

318
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,410
Tweets are known as whispers in Japanese.

319
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,180
Right!  Even a short —  what’s that?

320
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,620
It’s disgusting, isn’t it?

321
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,690
Keep that locked up inside yourself!

322
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,630
It’s not like I was specifically telling someone that.

323
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,200
It’s an example.

324
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,830
It’s supposed to be like talking to yourself in a way...

325
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,140
There are those like these and those like — one more here!

326
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,700
I've had enough, come on.

327
00:14:53,610 --> 00:15:01,780
Between shooting, a chapter in my life: Drinking an ice coffee at

328
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,780
the Starbucks at North Shore, Hawai'i.

329
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,780
Eww!  Eww!

330
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,680
Hey!

331
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:12,320
Killed it!

332
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,360
A picture post!

333
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,330
Narcissistic!

334
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,630
What do you think, Miss Rola?

335
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,630
Gross!

336
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,380
It’s aloha.  In Hawai’i.

337
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,000
Aloha...

338
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,340
Isn’t the aloha thing like this?

339
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,970
That was Stan Hansen.

340
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,880
If you’re gonna do it, do it right.

341
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,650
I shouldn’t have tried something I'm not familiar with...

342
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,890
There are mistakes like these as well!

343
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,990
I made a mistake -tion.

344
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,990
I made a mistake-tion!

345
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,660
I made a mistake -tion.

346
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,660
I made a mistake-tion!

347
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,760
Ok, already!

348
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,480
So we’ve shown you many examples.

349
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,300
By the way, we also have Hoto’s.

350
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,690
These are fine.

351
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,990
They’re normal, right?

352
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:05,710
“Today at Kumamoto. It’s been a while. I’m excited. I want to be kind.”

353
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,850
“Today, work at Okinawa. I’ll do my best. I’ve had to go to a lot of places this week. But it’s fun, so it’s all right. I want to be kind!”

354
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:22,730
“In Sapporo. The weather is… I’m bummed. Can’t be helped. I want to be kind!”

355
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,950
That has nothing to do with the weather.

356
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,070
So he puts it at the end as a kind of signature!

357
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,240
There are a lot of people who do that.

358
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,070
A signature phrase at the end.

359
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,280
So it’s your signature!

360
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,070
Yes, as a signature.

361
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:38,580
So if you type in “I wa”— the rest appears on your screen.

362
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,860
Since it's your signature.

363
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,580
Yes, it comes up.

364
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,030
Finally, we have the members start Twitter.

365
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,570
First, registering an account.

366
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,600
So now, we would like everyone to register!

367
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,230
That’s ok, right, teacher?

368
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,230
Yup.

369
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,460
So we’re really going to do it?

370
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,250
Here, everyone.

371
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,100
An “account,” right?

372
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,770
That... sort of thing, yeah.

373
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,290
The teacher doesn’t really know…

374
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,870
Is it already done for us?

375
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,410
Won’t this become quite a stir in the news?!

376
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,910
It will!

377
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,300
We’ve never done anything like that.

378
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,880
That all the Lincoln members started Twitter ?

379
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,950
Yeah, fine, everyone just get on Yahoo! News for that!

380
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:23,120
It will really get on Yahoo! News.

381
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
It really will get on the news.

382
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,260
Yeah, it will.

383
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,120
I think it really will.

384
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,040
To start Twitter, enter these four items.

385
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:34,920
*Miyasako is known for losing hair and then getting hair loss treatment

386
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:34,920
The username, like Miyasako’s “motohage” (meaning ex-baldy*), is like your nickname on Twitter.

387
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,440
It needs a sense of style, so we ask the teacher to give them out.

388
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:46,980
Because you’re bald, “Matsu Matsu Baldy.”

389
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,000
So Mr. Matsumoto, you’re Matsu Matsu Baldy.

390
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,320
This has to be in Latin characters, right?

391
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,540
Now, for Mimura.

392
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,390
Umm.

393
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,960
“Hentai Mimura”

394
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,130
With “Mimura?”

395
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,370
The teacher is telling you.

396
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,440
You’re already putting in “Mimura” in there.

397
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,000
The teacher said it. Please put in “Hentai Mimura.”

398
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,110
Ok, for Amano.

399
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,910
“Forever Alone Amano”

400
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,810
I have to put my name in there, too?

401
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:30,120
They then took each other’s photographs that will be shown next to their tweets.

402
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,260
Lemme see!

403
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,260
I made it with “tu,” but that’s ok, right?

404
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,480
This is wrong. Wait.

405
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,230
Is “tsu” better?

406
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,870
Do you not know English?

407
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,120
You’re being laughed at.

408
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,810
No, I mean, it doesn’t have to be “tsu,” right?

409
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,210
No, “tsu” is better!

410
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,440
Really?

411
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,590
Yeah.

412
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,770
Thus, everyone’s registrations were completed.

413
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,120
Initially registered with “tu,” Matsumoto re-registered with “tsu.”

414
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:09,460
Otake is “Take Take Baked Potato,” Hotohara is “The Three Kappa Brothers,” and Udo is “Udo Udo Acorn.”

415
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,220
Next are the members’ commemorative first tweets.

416
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,070
Now we will do everyone’s commemorative first tweets.

417
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,070
Here we go.

418
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,410
First, write something like “I started Twitter!”

419
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,570
How do you do it?

420
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,210
We push the button that says “tweet?"

421
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,480
But it’s on Miyasako’s page right now!

422
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,480
Yeah, we’re on Miyasako’s page.

423
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,290
How do you do this?

424
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,560
Wait, wait, on my page, see --

425
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,390
Please wait for a moment.

426
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,770
We are currently doing the first tweet!

427
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,650
Just for a moment.

428
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,740
After this, Matsumoto embarrasses himself with his first tweet!

429
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,870
Now we will do everyone’s commemorative first tweets.

430
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,870
Here we go.

431
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,210
We can write anything we want-tion?

432
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:57,880
-tion?

433
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,210
-tion?

434
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,750
That’s my thing, ok?

435
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,620
"-tion" is forbidden!

436
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,090
He said it. That’s Miyasako’s thing.

437
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:17,500
Everyone nervously enters their first tweets.

438
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:17,500
Everyone nervously enters their first tweets.

439
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:17,500

Everyone nervously enters their first tweets.

479
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:17,500
Everyone nervously enters their first tweets.

480
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:17,500
Everyone nervously enters their first tweets.

481
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:17,500
Everyone nervously enters their first tweets.

482
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:17,500
Everyone nervously enters their first tweets.

483
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:17,500
Everyone nervously enters their first tweets.

484
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,260
This will go out to everyone?

485
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:14,990
Yup

486
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,270
It’s nerve-wracking, doesn’t it?

487
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,500
Yeah, it is.

488
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:24,300
Star comedian Matsumoto’s first tweet is this:

489
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,750
Here’s Mr. Matsumoto’s.

490
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,010
Mine is normal!

491
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,000
Here it is.  “I have debuted.”

492
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,410
That’s so ordinary!

493
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,090
I don’t know!

494
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,400
This isn’t good?

495
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,990
That’s no good!

496
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,740
This is bad!

497
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,130
No, no, no!

498
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,930
I don’t understand!

499
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:50,900
Ah!~

500
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,760
Ah!~

501
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,700
Then what do we do? What do we do?

502
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,840
After the panicking Matsumoto, Mimura’s first tweet is:

503
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,650
Let’s look at Mimura’s then.

504
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,490
Ok.

505
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,820
Ok.  “This is the real Mimura.  I will do my best!”

506
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,820
Wow. That wasn’t funny!

507
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,550
That was me making a declaration!

508
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,960
Miss Rola, is this good?

509
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,510
This is better than the last one.

510
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,200
It has two phrases and feels fine!

511
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,430
It has two phrases so it’s ok.

512
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,200
Yup.

513
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,830
Let’s look at Amano’s.

514
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,640
Mine…

515
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,370
Here.  “I am starting Twitter.  This is the real me.  I am 43 years old and I like cooking and female broadcasters.”

516
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,340
Really good! Totally not ordinary at all!

517
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,370
Ok, let’s look at Udo’s as well.

518
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,220
“Amano~!  It’s the real me!”

519
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,580
Why are you tweeting at me?

520
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,220
Just tell me here.  Don’t tweet at this distance.

521
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,590
Good, good.

522
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,430
Hoto’s.

523
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,530
“I’m tweeting after a long while.  I want to be kind.”

524
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,630
This sort of thing, right?

525
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,930
It's good!

526
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,640
Now, Otake’s, too.

527
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,240
With Otake’s style.

528
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,410
“I will start.  I will start?”

529
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,710
He already quit!

530
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,110
Your premise is that you’re quitting!

531
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,580
I feel self-conscious.

532
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,620
This is embarrassing!

533
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,890
Everyone,


don’t be like Mr. Matsumoto, ok?

534
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,630
A bad example.

535
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,100
I feel this feeling of rejection.

536
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,140
I feel like I’m going to get a rashes as a reaction to all of this.

537
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,500
It’s annoying to have to think up something!

538
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,000
I don’t like how even something like this feels like work!

539
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,900
Yes.

540
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:43,610
We have already started with this

541
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,610
there might be reactions out there.

542
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,610
You might get tweeted at!

543
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,780
Are there any?

544
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,550
Sorry, I’d like to tweet, “I have retired.”

545
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,550
Sorry, I’d like to tweet, “I have retired.”

546
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,420
You’re retiring after three minutes?

547
00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:01,070
Thus, they debuted on Twitter. But this is just the beginning of their Twitter lives.

548
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,430
Next:

549
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:08,330
We finished our first tweets so let’s all take photos!

550
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,100
First, let’s take a photo of Mr. Hamada!

551
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,100
Huh?

552
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,970
I’ve got nothing to do with this.

553
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,140
Let’s all take whatever photo of Mr. Hamada we want and then post it.

554
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,020
Take them in different poses.

555
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,090
Why do I have to get my photo taken by these kids and put on Twitter?...

556
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,960
That’s really close!

557
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,960
The lower lip? Very nice.

558
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,160
This is nice!

559
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,000
What do you mean it's “nice?”

560
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,860
Can you wink?

561
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,870
Scary. I got a scary one!

562
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,810
Adding a caption to a photo of Hamada and then tweeting...

563
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,610
First, Otake’s photo of Hamada:

564
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,980
“This is Mr. Hamada when he isn’t pissed.”

565
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:57,050
Translation by typesoshee
Timing & Typesetting by BassGNT

566
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,860
He’s totally pissed.

567
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,160
This is Mr. Hamada when he isn’t pissed?

568
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,140
So this is Otake’s.

569
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,690
So this sort of thing.

570
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,160
Here’s Mr. Matsumoto’s!

571
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,340
“This is our gorilla.”

572
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,710
This sort of thing, everyone.

573
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,340
That’s quite on the human-side!

574
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:30,350
########################

575
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:30,350
He loves ketchup!

576
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:28,880
The members’ photos have been posted on to Twitter.

577
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:30,350
###########################

578
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:30,350
This is what you call a monster.

579
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,350
However,

580
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:35,900
Miss Rola didn’t want to just teach how to use Twitter.

581
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,360
The real subject of this episode will now be presented to the members.

582
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,830
Now, we will have a competition on who will get the most followers.

583
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,000
We do these frequently?

584
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,600
How long should we do this?

585
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,710
About one week!

586
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,180
Longer than one week, but first, just one week.

587
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,380
Does something happen if you get last place?

588
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,910
There will be a batsu game for the last place!

589
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,120
Good thing I’ve been doing Twitter.

590
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,590
Miyasako has already been doing Twitter, so he’s not part of it.

591
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,490
But Mr. Otohara will be part of it!

592
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,560
It’s “Ho-”, ok!

593
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,860
Of “Ha hi hu he ho.”

594
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,860
Yes, Mr. Hotohara.

595
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:16,860
So Hoto —

596
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,930
What happens for me?

597
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,830
The 60,000  followers I had?

598
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,940
It’ll be a perfect handicap for you!

599
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,270
Hey. That’s enough from you!

600
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:33,280
Thus, a one week competition of who will get the most followers starts.

601
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,900
Tweets get sent over the whole world…

602
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,310
What kind of tweets will they make?

603

Did Mr. Hamada hit you?*

605
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:50,000
*There is a Japanese TV meme that because of Hamada’s celebrity power in show business, if you are a newcomer and Hamada comedically hits you on TV, that moment will be your ticket to success and fame.

606
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:50,200
First, the members’ strategy is to have Miss Rola spread their tweets to her 1,440,000 followers.

Oh, I got something from Mr. Matsumoto.

649
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,780
You got something, right?

650
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,710
Here.  “I’m a little hungry.  What’s good for this sort of thing?”, he says!

651
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,990
Uh oh! Uh oh! Why did she say it like that?

652
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,900
Why do you seem to have this thing against Matsumoto?

653
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,720
Here I go. I’m going to do it! Everyone’s going to see it.

654
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,130
Once Rola retweets the members’ tweets to her followers, reactions to the members’ tweets come in quickly.

655
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:28,400
We have a reply to Mr. Matsumoto from a regular person!

656
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,950
“Is this the real Ma-chan?”

657
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,470
Wow.

658
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,540
Yes!

659
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,310
Let’s reply to this!

660
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:42,590
Wow, that guy’s lucky.

661
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,920
Would it be bad if I was abusive towards him?

662
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,420
What sort of abuse?

663
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,420
He said “Is this the real Ma-chan?”  Why would you reply to that with abuse?

664
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,030
I just did it.

665
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,030
To “Is this the real Mr. Matsumoto”:

666
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,370
The real one. I want to be kind.

667
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,350
My thing.  “I want to be kind,” that’s my thing.

668
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,640
Oh, really?

669
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,640
You didn’t say that.

670
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:14,010
Miyasako said before that “-tion” is only his thing.

671
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,810
I said the “-tion” thing is only my thing.

672
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,010
You didn’t say “I want to be kind” is only your thing!

673
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,010
But, wait,

674
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,680
isn’t that the rule?!

675
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,680
Sorry, sorry about that.

676
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,290
I just, didn’t really understand...

677
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:27,430
For people who don’t know what’s going on here they must be like

678
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,430
“What the hell is Matsumoto saying?!”

679
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,060
I got tweets as well, saying...

680
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,330
“Rola, you’re following too many fake accounts!”

681
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:38,670
They’re not trusted yet!

682
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,450
We’re not fake!

683
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,520
We’re not fake!

684
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,970
If you say “They’re real,” that would increase our followers?

685
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,170
Yes.

686
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,970
It’s going up.

687
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,530
Wow.

688
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,010
Wow, Mr. Matsumoto.

689
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,580
Otake is already at 300!

690
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,380
They trust you.

691
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,340
Wow

692
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,190
Wow, it went up again.

693
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,450
It went right up to 460.

694
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,600
500, wow.

695
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,700
The number of followers is already increasing.

696
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:19,420
The members are embarking on a one week experience never done before.

697
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,880
Ok, everyone, good luck on your one week!

698
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,080
Your followers will decrease if you don’t tweet, so tweet everyday.

699
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,260
And if I see them and think they’re good, I’ll retweet them!

700
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,260
There you go.

701
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,250
So that means that that will increase your followers.

702
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,430
Ok, bye everyone!

703
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,500
You’re leaving just like that?

704
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,140
Bye, take care!

705
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,570
Good luck on your one week!

706
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:54,580
Everyone’s beginning Twitter now starts to create a stir!

707
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:02,270
At the dressing room after shooting ended, Otake takes a photo of Miyasako in his personal attire.

708
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,690
Got it. And then?

709
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,530
My leopard-skin is gonna be posted!

710
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:17,770
What caption will Otake add regarding Miyasako’s unique style of clothes?

711
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,030
It’s sent.

712
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,740
That's sent?

713
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:31,020
Rod Miyasako Stewart

714
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,530
There’s a worry whether it was sent or not, you know.

715
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,020
Then...

716
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,720
10,000 people.

717
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,720
The leopard-skin went to 10,000 people.

718
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,030
10,000 people?

719
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,500
It amazes me. I don’t really understand it,

720
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,670
but to think that at this moment, a lot of people are looking at it!

721
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,300
Meanwhile, at Matsumoto’s dressing room…

722
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,070
So it means there might be replies to this.

I’m a little hungry.
What’s good for this sort of thing?

730
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:18,360
To do that, I go, here, right?
To “How about a pastry?”  I do this, right?

731
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,120
And then I press tweet?

732
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,330
Yes, on the upper right.

733
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,450

Oh, the tweet is sending.

Yes.

742
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,110
Just from this conversation about pastries…

743
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,020
It’s already at 17,000 people. Wow

744
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,840
It’s at 17,000…

745
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,290
Oh, it’s coming in.

746
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,230
What kind of tweets will Matsumoto make in the future?

747
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,460
And then...

748
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,530
“I’m gonna be tsukkomi-ing.”

749
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,840
Mimura’s “I’m gonna be tsukkomi-ing” tweet…

750
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,090
I’ll make it “I’m gonna be tsukkomi-ing something crazy vicious! Christmas!”

751
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,850
It’s so bad they might just take me out of the competition.

752
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:24,330
I’m gonna be tsukkomi-ing
something crazy vicious!
Christmas!

754
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,720
Like the saying,
“Regret never comes
beforehand,” you know…

755
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,960
I might regret this.

756
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:24,330
Like, “No, no, I was just joking.”  “I was just joking about the ‘Christmas’ part.”

757
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,430
Now, I’m going to send this to Amano.

758
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:36,480
Amano~!
Can I come over now?

759
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:36,480

760
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,980

761
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,260
This is fine, right?

762
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:46,490

Meanwhile, using his cooking skills, Amano tweets in a quiz form.

765
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,230
In reply to this…

766
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,330
Here.

767
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,320
The char siu.

768
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,960
So I should enter “char siu rice bowl” to this?

769
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,400
Unfortunately, it was ramen.

770
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,240
So I should enter “ramen.”

771
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,100
Yeah, yeah.

772
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,870
No, then I’m just doing this with you!

773
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:05,670
Not between us, tweet about your own stuff!

774
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,670
I’ll spread the word, then, to everyone.

775
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,470
Wow, there are a lot of replies!

776
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,470
Because I spread it to everyone!

777
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,080
That makes it sound like it was thanks to you!

778
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,090
Retweet means to spread it out?

779
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,580
Yes, retweet means to spread it out.

780
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,750
Wow, Mr. Matsumoto is tweeting!

781
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,520
He says “The correct answer was Yo-chan Squid.”

782
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,350
He’s already really into it.

783
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,540
He’s already really into it.

784
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,790
He’s giving out quiz questions.

785
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,930
Mr. Matsumoto’s giving out quiz questions!

786
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,570
Meanwhile, at Matsumoto’s dressing room...

787
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,800
3, 2, 1, OK.

788
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,850
Got it.

789
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,730
was taking a picture of himself in the middle of changing.

790
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:45,710
A photo in his underpants.

791
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,610
From a different angle…

792
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,260
and just in case, another shot.

793
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,760
What will Matsumoto tweet...

794
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,760
What will Matsumoto tweet...

795
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,760
“Surprisingly, zebra pants.”

796
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,400
That’s fine, right?

797
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,020
Tweet.

798
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,520
Ok, there we go.

799
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,000
Matsumoto actually gives out a fan service photo.

800
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,610
And with this photo, the number of his followers increases dramatically.

801
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:32,000
Starting from that night, the members began to tweet regularly.

Mitsukan pork bone broth soy sauce flavor.

Mitsukan pork bone broth soy sauce flavor.

843
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,430
To this, Amano answers referring to a TV commercial that he himself appears in

Mitsukan pork bone broth soy sauce flavor.

845

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,400
My mind was seriously running on full cylinders that time.

850
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,200
I was thinking “This is gonna be hell


if this keeps going on!”

851
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,890
And Matsumoto as well…

852
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:06,220
I’m drunk.

853
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,620
Shows himself getting a bit tipsy with a cute tweet.

854
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:06,220
This cute tweet from Matsumoto greatly increases his follower numbers.

855
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,490
By the next day, Matsumoto starting Twitter is picked up by the news

856
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,820
This here “I’m drunk” (Matsumoto’s tweet), right?

857
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,970
This is quite precious!

858
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,280
Really.

859
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:31,880
It’s unbelievable that Mr. Matsumoto would get on Twitter

860
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,640
I think a lot of people out there are thinking the same thing.

861
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,720
There will be a lot of interest in this.

862
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:54,170
When I said to my daughter,
“P down,” she said, “Huh?
What does that mean?”
It means “Sit down.”
I want to be a kind Osaka dialect.

863
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:51,620
As it becomes a societal phenomenon, Hotohara, in no hurry, tweets heartwarming moments of his family.

865
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:55,650
What?

00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,250

867
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,250
Ok.

868
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:05,010
If I do that, followers will take a look at it.

869
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,240
Ok, Amano.

870
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,210
Gee, what is this?

871
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,040
Here… and this…

00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,000

*Takeyama Takanori is a TV personality in a comedic duo called Cunning.

875
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:20,060
Amano~!-“Now!”

Takeyama’s of Cunning!*
Looks like it-now!
Both of them good-now!

876
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,370
Now!

877
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:24,330
I want to tweet!

878
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,330
You’re tweeting too much!

879
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:30,540
This is the man who got into this the most. Mimura Masakazu.

880
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,710
Oe, how are you? I, am going to bed.

881
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,710
Oe, how are you? I, am going to bed.########

882
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,650
On the night of the first day, after tweeting to TV Tokyo broadcaster Oe Mariko,

883
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:40,510
Oe, how

884
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:40,510
Oe, how###

885
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:40,510
this conversation also, for some reason, was picked up by Yahoo! News.

886
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,610
Amano, are lava flow baths good? I mean, Amano~!

887
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,610

894
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:45,490
Furthermore, tweeting 20 tweets right from the start,

895
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,670
Hey, Otake’s wife is on TV.

896

915
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,980
Inspired by his duo partner, Otake also…

916
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,900
Golden Week just ended so the sky of Tokyo was still blue.

917
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,520
I got it.

918
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,670
“Golden Week just ended so the sky of Tokyo was still blue.”

919
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,880
To that, someone quickly replied, “That has nothing to do with Golden Week, lol.”

920
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,050
But that’s not what I meant.

921
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,320
That’s where the fun of tweeting begins!

922
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,320
What?! The expert speaks!

923
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,290
This is where it starts!

924
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:25,290
Because during Golden Week,


the factories in Tokyo are closed,

925
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,290
and because there are fewer cars,

926
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:30,060
so the sky...

927
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,850
becomes blue.  People from other
areas might not understand,

928
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,970
but this is Tokyo trivia.

929
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,070
That’s what I meant.

930
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:37,340
So tweet that!

931
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,910
What was it again?

932
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,410
That’s how you feel out the communication!

933
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,290
Then they’ll say,

934
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:48,280
“Oh, Mr. Otake said something good,”

and then you get more followers!

935
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,920
I see.

936
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,950
But unless you see more of the reaction first…

937
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:58,160
because there might be people out there who

get it, so the rebuttals might come quickly.

938
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,890
Why, you just told me to tweet it right now!

939
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,060
Cancel!

940
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,060
You observe it for a while.

941
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,770
You have to understand what the followers are feeling.

942
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:11,740
There aren’t many that are replying right now!

943
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,740
Because you haven’t waited!

944
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:21,990
Thus, while the members were forced to start Twitter by Rola, they were enjoying it for the time being.

945
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,330
Then:

946
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,020
The competition over follower numbers revealed amazing numbers.

947
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,760
The results of the Twitter follower numbers competition!

948
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,000
It has been one week. It seems that you all were tweeting a lot.

949
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:52,810

Udo###

963
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,510
Just one person!

964
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,510
That’s right.

965
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,940
Who got extremely into it

966
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:50,940
Yes.

967
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,470
Who was really feeling it.

968
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,180
This right here felt like my hand.

969
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,190
He’s definitely going to continue tweeting

even after the competition ends.

970
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,620
Are you going to continue?

971
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,620
Am I not allowed to continue?

972
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,320
No, no, of course you’re allowed to continue.

973
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:12,000
Let’s take a look at some of the exchanges the members had that became popular.

974
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,000
This tweet by Matsumoto was how it began.

975
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,740
I didn’t have anything to tweet about,

976
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,680
so being almost Hamada’s birthday, I tweeted,

977
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,910
“Like I got anything to do with that!”

978
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:31,250
This is where the hell started.

979
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,550
Everyone would— the members would tweet all these things.

980
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,720
These would normally go to Hamada.

981
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,960
But Hamada’s not on Twitter so they all came to me!

982
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,380
“Congratulations, Mr. Hamada!”

983
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,890
Since Mr. Matsumoto is the closest to Mr. Hamada.

984
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:43,980
I see.

985
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,180
Mimura sent one, too.

986
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:51,400
“Thanks, Mimura.  Such a happy occasion.  Like I got anything to do with that!” I tsukkomi-ed again.

987
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,400
A play-along tsukkomi.

988
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,200
The play-along tsukkomi, it keeps coming.  Udo ,all over here.  “Happy Birthday, Mr. Hamada!”

989
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,010
After a while, I got tired,

990
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,800
and I was saying “Like I got anything to do with that!”

991
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:09,120
But it still wouldn’t stop.

992
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,020
It still wouldn’t stop, so I just gave up and said, “I’m gonna go buy a present.”

993
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,100
You were broken.

994
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,160
He just went along with it.

995
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,560
But it still kept going.

996
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:22,000
It still kept going.  Here, from Amano.  From Hoto, too, I think.

997
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:22,900
Here.

998
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
“Completely late.”

999
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:30,680
“Congratulations.” There was no use, so I thought if it comes to this, “It’s a party! Don’t tell Hamada.”

1000
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,000
“Going to bed.”  The End.

1001
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,300
That was a sign meaning “The End.”

1002
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,280
This whole time was really tiring.

1003
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,520
That day was a rest day for me.


I couldn’t rest at all!

1004
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,740
So the members had some pleasant Twitter exchanges.

1005
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,580
There is a message from Rola for them.

1006
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,400
Boo!

1007
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,270
Yay! How are you?

1008
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,870
I can’t be there today,

1009
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:05,780
but I’m going to present, um, the batsu game for the person with the fewest followers now.

1010
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,810
Last place will…

1011
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:12,850
have embarrassing photos of them tweeted by everyone!

1012
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:22,010
Start taking photos of the last place person and upload them.

1013
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,120
I think Mr. Otohara will be in last place.

1014
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,800
Mr. Otohara will be in last place~.

1015
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,900
That’s wrong.  It’s “Ho-”, ok?  It’s “Ho-.”

1016
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,100
See you, bye!

1017
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,600
The batsu game is this.

1018
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,840
Here.

1019
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,530
The face bit?

1020
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,270
Wakky’s thing.

1021
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:40,950
Do these face bits with maximum effort.

1022
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,310
Nine of them?

1023
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,780
Well, all of them!

1024
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:50,930
The batsu game is to do an impression of Wakky’s face bits and have them spread out on Twitter.

1025
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,020
Once they’re circulated, there’s no taking the photos down.

1026
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,050
And now, the competition over getting followers over one week:

1027
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:02,270
presenting the first place person, who attracted an amazing number of followers:

1028
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,700
First place is:

1029
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,570
The first place finisher’s amazing numbers actually set a new record in Japan.

1030
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,550
Wallpapers of the opening animation are now available on Android.

1031
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:19,550
Don’t forget to watch hilarious videos from Lincoln.

1032
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,890
First place is:

1033
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,210
Mr. Matsumoto. Wow. In one week!

1034
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:35,780
Matsumoto’s followers are still increasing and have passed 520,000.

1035
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:44,080
He is the only person in Japan to have passed 520,000 followers with just 39 tweets.

1036
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,360
Now, second place is:

1037
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,370
Yes!

1038
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,040
There it is.

1039
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,890
If it keeps going like this, this is gonna be crazy.

1040
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,460
But, really,

1041
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:03,630
Miyasako’s one million followers?

1042
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,630
That’s what's really amazing.

1043
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,730
But that's a longer time.

1044
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,730
You just had one week.

1045
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,340
Third place is:

1046
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,290
Mr. Otake.

1047
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,130
Not bad.

1048
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,030
300,000.

1049
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,270
Well, Otake didn’t tweet that often.

1050
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:22,210
Who will receive the batsu game!?

1051
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,580
Fourth place is good for me!

1052
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,010
Fourth place is:

1053
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,810
Yes!

1054
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,740
Uh oh.

1055
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,310
This is bad.

1056
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,830
So it’s one way or the other way.

1057
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,460
We’ll uncover them in one go.

1058
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,600
What I heard is that it’s surprisingly close!

1059
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,600
I don’t even wanna—

1060
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,240
This is bad!

1061
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,000
It’s as of 4PM today.

1062
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,570
Down to the wire.

1063
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,410
The two left are Hoto and Amano.

1064
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,780
Let’s uncover them in one go.

1065
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,840
The one on the bottom is the last place person.

1066
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,050
Open!

1067
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,060
It’s Mr. Otohara!

1068
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,160
It’s “Hoto-.”“Ho-.” It’s “Hoto-!”

1069
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,290
Rola was right.

1070
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,230
It was close.

1071
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,540
It was as Rola said it.

1072
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,330
The difference is 7,000 and change.

1073
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:06,980
You’re right.

1074
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,130
Wait a minute!

1075
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:15,030
I… when Rola was here… the 60,000 people.

1076
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,540
Oh!

1077
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,670
She said “That’ll be a good handicap for you,”

and it pissed me off,

1078
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,110
So it hasn’t been included.

1079
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,110
but won’t the 60,000 get added?

1080
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,810
Yes, Mr. Hotohara.

1081
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:23,810
So Hoto —

1082
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,880
What happens for me?

1083
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,780
The 60,000 followers I had?

1084
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,950
It’ll be a perfect handicap for you!

1085
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,440
Hey.

1086
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,220
That’s enough from you!

1087
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,390
That hasn’t been included.

1088
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,930
170,000 followers!

1089
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,930
There might be some overlap.

1090
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,860
If he’s going to be that desperate about it,

I’m fine with it!

1091
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:47,570
Huh?!

1092
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,400
What is this?

1093
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,410
Which do you want?

1094
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,640
It feels like you were just told by Amano

and you’re just doing what he says!

1095
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,450
Do you want to take the handicap or not?

1096
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,120
I’ll take it!!

1097
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,550
He has taken the handicap.

1098
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,550
So you’re gonna take it.

1099
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,760
Understood, so the last place person is Amano Hiroyuki!

1100
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:13,930
I was 700 behind Udo.

1101
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:14,960
Which do you want to do?

1102
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,050
The bottom left, please.

1103
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,930
Ok, the bottom left.

1104
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,970
Maybe I was a face bit-type of guy all along?

1105
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,540
I’d like an original work!

1106
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,580
Making me think… You’re really horrible.

1107
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,390
If he really wants to do that, then.

1108
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,320
We’re never gonna finish!

1109
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:48,880
Nice, nice.

1110
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,490
An original.

1111
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,900
Yeah, an original.

1112
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,070
This one isn’t that…

1113
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,070
Why the hell.

1114
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,070
For those who are continuing, please do continue tweeting.

1115
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:02,820
Thank you very much.

1116
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,990
Thank you very much.

1117

Good work everyone!
How was it?? I wish I could be there!

1120
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,000
Ok, bye everyone!
