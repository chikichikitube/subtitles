00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,220
Seen last week,

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,530
A series of shocking truths unveiled

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,820
Yamasaki Hosei Sneaky Thief Trial!

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,140
The first one...

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,470
Even though he lost the quiz,

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,780
Yamasaki ignored the rules and asked Umezu for an autograph!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,820
Excuse me, your autograph?

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,800
Excuse me, your autograph?

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,730
A rule violating sneaky thief!

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,130
Like an autograph,

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,300
It's fine isn't it, to get one?

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,400
No it isn't!
- That's what we're telling you!

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,380
When Tanaka did that thing with Ikko, you didn't even approach her!

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,490
Well I couljn't joo anything then-

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,670
"Couljn't joo" he says

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,090
And the second one ...

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:06,220
When Yamasaki tried an image change, he stole the entire outfit!

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,530
Oh this is kinda scary

19
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,310
No way...

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,640
This is straight up theft!

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,690
You can't do this!

22
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,040
There's a limit to how much you can steal!

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,240
This is horrible

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,060
What did I do wrong here?

25
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,380
And the third one...

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,690
An incident where Yamasaki stole gags from two young comedians!

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,290
"Cause it doesn't matter, cause it doesn't matter!"

28
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,110
"That don't matter, oh that don't matter!"

29
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,110
"Cause it doesn't matter, cause it doesn't matter!"

30
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,360
"Cause that's no problem, cause that's no problem!"

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,380
A shameless gag theft!

32
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,380
But just let me say this,

33
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,330
I used that gag I remembered, the "doesn't matter" gag

34
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,600
And I remembered his rhythym, and all I did was combine them!

35
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,070
That's what we're saying is wrong!

36
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,910
We're telling you that's bad

37
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,690
Why are you calling this theft, you're making me look bad!

38
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,460
You can't copy and combine them!

39
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,330
And tonight, another victim makes an appearance

40
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,510
A shocking revelation awaits

41
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,300
What will Yamasaki's fate be?

44
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,690
By the way,

45
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:48,040
All the gags Yamasaki has done, his material ... It looks like this

46
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,360
It's not really that special

47
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,620
In November 1992, he came up with this

48
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,090
This, "Yey yey yey"

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,090
This is the one I most...

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,820
I wish I could remember them

51
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,090
There's also "Yosha-Ko", "MA" ... "Chopsticks"?

52
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,020
"Face Paku Paku", "Doi Takako", and "Chucky"

53
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,490
What was this "Face Paku Paku" one?

54
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,560
So it's like this

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,300
Paku Paku, Face Paku Paku

56
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,300
What's with the hands...

57
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,440
When do you use this...

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,020
When do you pull that out?

59
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,460
When do you use that?

60
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,670
If someone doesn't tell you-

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,780
It's for times like this

62
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,800
Meaning?

63
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,270
If someone says "Do that one"

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,600
If they tell you to do it?

65
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,240
TN: Doi Takako was a prominent Japanese politician

66
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,240
And this "Doi Takako"?

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,960
"Murayama Tomiichi has been appointed as Prime Minister"

68
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,620
It was that age

69
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,130
Well that's how it is

70
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,270
So Yamasaki-san, would you say these are you original creations?

71
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,670
Indeed

72
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,710
You thought up all of these?

73
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,720
Yes

74
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,270
I see. Your Honour,

75
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,110
We have another victim in regards to his gags

76
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,730
Can we call in this victim?

77
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,360
Understood

78
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,020
Witness, enter

79
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,040
Haranishi

80
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,710
You all know him already, this is Haranishi from FUJIWARA

81
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,910
Yes, that's right

82
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,840
Now, Yamasaki invented everything on this board,

83
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,490
According to him

84
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,140
As he says

85
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,460
You know, honestly, up until now he's been changing things other people did,

86
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,760
He straight up stole from me though

87
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,490
He blatantly stole from me, he didn't change anything

88
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,300
Really? Exactly the same?

89
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,800
Exactly the same

90
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
This is shocking news isn't it?

91
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,870
Do you have any proof?

92
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,620
Yes, let's watch the VTR

93
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,740
How he stole "Doi Takako"

94
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,980
September 1999 - 9 years ago

95
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:04,090
This was material he came up with for Matsumoto's 36th birthday

96
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,270
So, Yamasaki-san?

97
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:13,070
Using an impression of Doi Takako, I will wi-wish you Happy Birthday

98
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,900
"Matsumoto-san"

99
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:22,490
"Murayama Tomiichi has been appointed as Prime Min-"

100
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,580
What does that have to do with him?

101
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,020
You didn't say "Happy Birthday" at all!

102
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,300
Yamasaki finally came up with a great new gag at this occasion,

103
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:36,310
This became one of his signature acts, and there are many scenes of him doing it

104
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,300
However, there is one thing that sticks out about this gag...

105
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,300
This happened 1 year before that performance...

106
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:56,300
This was an Osaka TV show that FUJIWARA were regulars on

107
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,310
This is the scene that sticks out;

108
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,620
An imitation that a comedian shouldn't do

109
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,300
An impression a comedian shouldn't do? Alright then, do it

110
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,290
Former speaker of the house, Doi Takako

111
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,270
Please begin

112
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:19,660
"Murayama Tomiichi has been appointed as Prime Minister"

113
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,130
You straight up copied him!

114
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,360
"Murayama Tomiichi"

115
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,740
"has been appointed as Prime Minister"

116
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,380
"has been appointed as Prime Minister"

117
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,040
The exact same performance,

118
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,380
Is Yamasaki a serial gag thief?

119
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,360
You ... you went this far?

120
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,900
It's just one after another!

121
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,840
I guess coincidences do happen

122
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,310
What'd you say?

123
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
Is he laughing?

124
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,420
So you didn't know Haranishi did that a month ago?

125
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,560
Well I've never watched that show before

126
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,820
I don't mean the show,

127
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,090
In private,

128
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,090
I did it in front of other comedians,

129
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,930
and Yamasaki was there too, no doubt

130
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,760
He said you were there

131
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:19,220
First off, the choice of Murayama Tomiichi is outdated

132
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,420
It was something happened a long time ago

133
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,560
It doesn't match his generation

134
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,640
That phrase is from Haranishi's generation

135
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,910
You know, I....

136
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,000
I feel really sick all of a sudden

137
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,980
That's unacceptable

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,020
No way, we're only just starting

139
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,690
Can I be excused?

140
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,180
No no no

141
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,820
No way

142
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,040
Incidentally Haranishi-kun, do you have more to add? Other than that one

143
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,870
Nothing else?

144
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,330
Actually, can I say it?

145
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,670
There's more?

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,160
Can I see that board from before?

147
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,490
Those are supposed to be Yamasaki-san's original creations

148
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,180
This, "Face Paku Paku"

149
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,930
He got some laughs with that before

150
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,960
The discussion before of "when do you use that?"
"what's the setup?"

151
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,960
It does have a setup, because it's my gag!

152
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,530
It's unfortunate

153
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,330
Really?

154
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,620
What kind of face is that?

155
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,960
Stop your cheap acting!

156
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,730
The origin of how he knows this,

157
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,020
On that TV show, there was a weekly skit corner

158
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,040
I see

159
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:31,960
Miyagawa Daisuke and I were supposed to have a conversation,

160
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,600
I thought it would be boring if I did it normally, so I thought up a character,

161
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,640
And it was this, exactly this

162
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,870
I thought talking like this would be funny

163
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,220
"Hey dad, dad listen"

164
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,980
So I was gonna talk with that face, I thought that up

165
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,420
So I showed that to Yamasaki in the train, since I was scared

166
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,530
I thought it might not work

167
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,160
You tried it out on Yamasaki

168
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,870
And he found it really hilarious

169
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,840
I thought it would work then

170
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,490
But I never got to do that skit,

171
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,140
I see

172
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,380
So I never showed that gag to anybody,

173
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,890
But after a while, that person...

174
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,780
He was getting big laughs using that "Face Paku Paku"

175
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,690
What is the meaning of this?

176
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,360
There's no footage bu-

177
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,690
Don't just listen to him

178
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,060
Look carefully, they're totally different!

179
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,960
Then Yamasaki-san, how did you come up with that?

180
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,760
Yes, why that gag?

181
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,060
Well, certainly, in Osaka we worked on the same TV show

182
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,090
I might've seen a little bit

183
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,580
So that was just seared into my memories,

184
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,900
So in regards to him,

185
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:57,060
Um, can you stop that? Looking at me with those dirty eyes

186
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,840
You guys are all so dirty

187
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,930
You should apologise-

188
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,620
Apologise! Why do I need to apologise?

189
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,490
Can I say something?

190
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:15,200
Back when we worked together in Osaka on a TV show, there were many times when I went to him for advice

191
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,200
Oh really?

192
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,930
It was along the lines of
"We wanna leave for Tokyo soon,"

193
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,930
I see

194
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,600
So I asked him, and he said "It's the time for you yet"

195
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,780
"I know best about these things. Don't leave yet.

196
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,620
"I'll tell you when you should come to Tokyo"

197
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,420
So he said he'll have your back?

198
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,530
But that's messed up isn't it?

199
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,420
It is

200
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,310
The only reason he said that,

201
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,760
If I use that gag he wants to steal before him, everyone will know he stole it

202
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,760
Exactly

203
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,870
So because of that, he told me to stay

204
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,070
That's awful!

205
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,580
For that reason

206
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,300
And in the end, he never told me to come to Tokyo!

207
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,620
"I know best about these things"?

208
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,620
You're the one who knows the least!

209
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,690
This one is terrible

210
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,980
It's not terrible

211
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,780
I need some advice,

212
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,930
Advice?

213
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,090
What do you mean?

214
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,980
For example, if a criminal admits his crime, the punishment is lessened right?

215
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,580
Slightly right? It's only slightly.

216
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,380
How much will it be lessened?

217
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,980
I'm not really sure about that

218
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,730
Will we still be able to smile together and be friends after this?

219
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,600
If you're found guilty, you'll be banned from using the stuff you stole

220
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,710
This is a trial after all. You can't use them anymore.

221
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,330
But that "Doesn't Matter" one,

222
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,330
They were chanting it in the bar

223
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,240
That made you really happy didn't it

224
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,300
You keep bringing it up

225
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,980
And that's never happened to me, in my 20+ years of comedy,

226
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,420
So that made me really happy

227
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,460
So then shouldn't you make one up yourself?

228
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,960
Yeah, make your own original gag

229
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,960
It's not my fault I can't think of anything

230
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,220
You might come up with something right now

231
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,820
Right now? Maybe, that could happen

232
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,240
Naits

233
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,220
I can't think of a thing

234
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,580
What was that "Naits"?

235
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,020
I heard that "Naits" somewhere

236
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,620
It's a bad habit of mine

237
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,110
Finally, it's time for Yamasaki to be sentenced.

238
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,620
Alright, please announce his sentence

239
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,800
There is no end to the defendant Yamasaki's sneaky thievery,

240
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,440
Since he has caused trouble so many people, we had to take that into account,

241
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:10,170
His sentence is ... to be slapped by Chono!

242
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,770
WHAT?! HOLD ON!

243
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,690
You're kidding!

244
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,460
You have to be slapped by him, there's no escaping it

245
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,800
Now come here

246
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,400
What do you mean "Mouuuu"

247
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,140
I don't like Chono-san

248
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,940
I seriously don't wanna!

249
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,970
What the hell?

250
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,400
Also, after this, you can't do those gags anymore

251
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,800
You're banned from those gags

252
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,770
Hold on...

253
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,490
C'mon, you gotta get past this

254
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,260
I did didn't I? I said sorry at the end.

255
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,060
No you didn't say that

256
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,860
You didn't say that!

257
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,900
I did say that! I said it at the end didn't I?

258
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,920
You didn't

259
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,710
I said "I have a bad habit. Everyone please help me fix it"!

260
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,230
However, the strength of the slap,

261
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:17,220
If you really ask Chono-san to make it weaker, he just might do it

262
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,460
Do I absolutley need to take this?

263
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,060
If I have to- Alright then,

264
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,830
I'll take it. I will take the slap, but,

265
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,830
Chono-san, I am genuinely...

266
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,380
A nice guy

267
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,460
I'm really a nice guy! So, just,

268
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,460
Chono-san, which is your dominant hand?

269
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,690
Just tell me that

270
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,630
I'm really sorry!

271
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,630
Check this out!

272
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:46,430
I'm really sorry! But, this hand, could he use this hand?

273
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,310
I'm not sure about that

274
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,140
This is supposed to be your sentence after all

275
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,140
In fact, because it's this hand,

276
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,510
But in the past,

277
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,030
I got slapped on New Years right? Because of that, 3 months later ...

278
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,940
What happened 3 months later?

279
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,060
I was hospitalised

280
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,460
You weren't!

281
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,820
Why?

282
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,370
But I seriously can't do that. For real, and this is true,

283
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,430
The doctor looked at me

284
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,340
and got on the phone immediately

285
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,170
"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!" he said

286
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,800
Enough of that lie now

287
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,260
No really!

288
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,830
It's true!

289
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,840
Idiot!

290
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,290
Let's move on

291
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,380
Wait wait wait wait!

292
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,770
What the hell is it man?

293
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,290
Please, just wait

294
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,340
No really, the doctor really did get mad

295
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,630
Why'd he get angry

296
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,770
He told me to say "Stop messing around!"

297
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,710
To who?

298
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,380
Chono-san

299
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,170
Chono-san?

300
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,820
Yes, exactly

301
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,510
Why do you have to tell him?

302
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,630
Well he didn't know Chono-san's phone number!

303
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,770
No seriously, because what if,

304
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,570
The hospital might shut down!

305
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,290
The hospital will shut down?

306
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,490
That doctor might get fired! Who will treat me next time?

307
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,000
What kind of worry is that?

308
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,000
Let's move on!

309
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,970
Then you get slapped first please!

310
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,910
You get slapped first!

311
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,170
If Hamada-san takes it I'll do it!

312
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,860
Just let Hamada-san do it!

313
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,490
I'll do it if he does!

314
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,060
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

315
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,660
ENDO!

316
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,400
I'M GONNA GET MAD FOR REAL!

317
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,140
I'M GONNA GET MAD FOR REAL!

318
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,400
Zaki-san, Zaki-san please!

319
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,660
I'M GONNA SNAP FOR REAL!

320
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,600
I'M GONNA SNAP FOR REAL!

321
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,230
What happened?

322
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,310
WHAT HAPPENED?

323
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,310
YOU! YOU STOLE FROM ME!

324
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,200
Enough idiot!

325
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,740
Enough already!

326
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,000
Wait wait wait wait! Hold on, wait!

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What happened

328
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,970
You've become a frantic miserable man

329
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,940
That's true

330
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,370
Put your mic on

331
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,310
I went a bit frantic there...

332
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,600
You just stole that line from Ryu-chan!

333
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,570
Wow, just now!

334
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,660
He just stole that from Ryu-chan didn't he?

335
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,680
That is his phrase

336
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,310
And he copied the whole thing!

337
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,110
I'll take it

338
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,910
I, too,

339
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,200
Am a man after all

340
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,510
Of course

341
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,340
So I will take this slap,

342
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,090
But with your left hand please

343
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,120
No, you can't do that

344
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,230
That's not allowed, otherwi-

345
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,510
Then, then!

346
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,200
Then I won't do it!

347
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,220
What the hell!

348
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,240
Where should he stand?

349
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,200
Where should he stand?

350
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,740
He's so uncool

351
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,540
Are you gonna do this bit again?!

352
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,460
He's doing this shit again!

353
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,060
Enough already!

354
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,540
I got it

355
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,570
Come stand here already!

356
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,910
I got it! I got it

357
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,370
Do it when I say please

358
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,260
When I want to

359
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,340
I'm sorry

360
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,340
You're making the guy who has to slap you wait

361
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,170
Yeah if you keep wasting time...

362
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,300
Yes, exactly

363
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,630
I'm sorry everyone, really, but,

364
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,690
I'm scared

365
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,660
Well that makes sense

366
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,490
Even after all I've been through in life,

367
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,460
I'm scared

368
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,060
That was funny just now!

369
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,690
Very funny!

370
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,430
It doesn't matter that I'm a fully grown man,

371
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,060
I'm scared

372
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,630
Hurry up!

373
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,340
I said I got it!

374
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,800
Did I really do something that bad?

375
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,200
You did!

376
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,060
It's because you did!

377
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,910
I have to get smacked by a Pro-Wrestler?

378
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,980
Did I do something that bad?

379
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,310
Yes, you did

380
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,820
Sorry, it's just,

381
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,830
Can you not spread your stance like that?

382
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,310
How else would you stand?

383
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,490
Sorry, it's just

384
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,900
Have you seen a wrestler slap like this before?

385
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,140
HEY ENDO!

386
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,460
I'M GONNA HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU

387
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,490
Why? Why me?

388
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,540
I'll never forgive you!

389
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,540
What do you even mean?

390
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,890
You know, it's more dangerous if you try to dodge it

391
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,460
So let's do this

392
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,490
Wait!

393
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,830
The punishment slap!

394
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,970
That's dangerous!

395
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,490
Put your hands down, your hands

396
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,890
The punishment please!

397
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,260
Dirty! So dirty!

398
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,600
His shoe!

399
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,370
How did it come off

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,460
That was amazing as expected

401
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,000
That went like "BACHIKYON!"

402
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,970
So the trial has been decided. Yamsaki-san, never again can you use those gags.

403
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,710
You must promise that,

404
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,660
Do you understand, Yamasaki-san?

405
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,910
yes

406
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,260
Hello!

407
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,380
Quiet down!

408
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,000
Shut up!

409
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,970
Go ahead

410
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,400
How does it feel to see a star in the flesh?

411
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,660
You've been saying that a lot recently!

412
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,060
Recently? I don't know about that, I've always been a star

413
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,800
You weren't famous

414
00:20:53,800 --> 00:21:00,030
Some of the guests here might have come here again, after last week

415
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,400
Oh poor things

416
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,890
Last week we were supposed to have this talk segment right?

417
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,370
But then they told you to come again today

418
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,510
Do you know the reason why?

419
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,740
For real, last week Hamada said "Let's not do the talk man"

420
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,690
Because of that, we didn't do it

421
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,740
It was you

422
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,510
Hold on, my memories of being hit,

423
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,110
I've been hit 2 times

424
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,570
I've been hit twice, OK now three times

425
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,770
And alright alright, FOUR times

426
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,900
You wanted to skip too didn't you?

427
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,370
What do you mean?

428
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,510
You were feeling sick and said you couldn't do it

429
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,830
Ah yes, I was feeling a bit sick in the opening

430
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,890
So we had to stop cause of that, and you had to come again, and we have this bad weather again

431
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,140
Well, that's-

432
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,690
So I was standing outside with an umbrella, I even wanted to give out starbucks

433
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,690
TN: I'm not sure Matsumoto said Starbucks here

434
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,540
Did you really?

435
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,940
I did want to

436
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,940
Well sometimes there's trouble on set when people come to watch,

437
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,710
But you know it was cold,

438
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,800
I thought about handing out 2 Starbucks per person

439
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,660
Well, I'm sorry, really

440
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,900
I really did think that,

441
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,230
Things like that happen sometime,

442
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,200
Excuse me sorry, I've been feeling ill lately

443
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,980
Well yes, last time you were

444
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,310
I noticed something after getting sick,

445
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,890
I think, if you timed me,

446
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,570
You'll find I'm really fast at inserting suppositories

447
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,400
I won't lose to anyone,

448
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,200
Inserting suppositories?

449
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,340
You know, in Japan, uhhhhhh

450
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,060
I'm the 80th-

451
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,060
Spit it out already!

452
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,490
That pause is unneccessary

453
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,260
You can stick them right in?

454
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,770
I'm probably the 80th fastest

455
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,910
For example, have you ever used suppositories?

456
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,400
I have

457
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,660
Oh really?

458
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,740
They're like these,

459
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,760
these white things

460
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:56,980
So if you put a bunch of unwa-unwrapped ones on a table, a table like this,

461
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,600
And I have my hands to the side,

462
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,970
Start the stopwatch and ...

463
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,980
That's...

464
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,230
And my fingers will be completley clean

465
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,860
Just smooth

466
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,300
Are you inserting all the way?

467
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,570
All the way, it's amazing

468
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,290
If you hold them for too long they dissolve

469
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,460
Yeah exactly, so I'll just be like this. "Ready, start" ...

470
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,510
Slides right in,

471
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,910
My fingers won't be sticky at all,

472
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,510
They'll be strai-

473
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,510
Enough already

474
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,940
I can do it with anything

475
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,580
Why are you eating Sushi?

476
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,310
You know, it's not that impressive to be quick at that...

477
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,910
I do want to do that for an episode

478
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,400
It's amazing you get it in right away, usually you need to look for it a bit,

479
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,310
"Here? Oh here!"

480
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,740
That is just plainly stupid

481
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,110
It's impossible to be good at it!

482
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,710
You're dumb, you're dumb

483
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:51,690
You have a messed up asshole!

484
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,290
Your asshole is all loose is why!

485
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,800
Are you saying you don't know where the anus is?

486
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,820
It's cause your asshole is always wide open!

487
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,740
Are you saying I need to put a cork in it?
