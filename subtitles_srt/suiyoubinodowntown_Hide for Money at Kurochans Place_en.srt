00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,400
Suiyoubi No Downtown starts once more, thank you all for being here.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,030
Let's kick things off with our first presenter, this person!

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,670
Hello everyone! - It's Jinnai Tomonori!

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,970
A question for you all!

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,890
3 years ago we did a project at Kuro-chan's place.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,110
The "theory that a person could live under Kuro-chan's bed". Do you remember that? - Yes!

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,830
Quite a shocking project. - Indeed.

8
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,200
Back then we weren't exposed for 1.5 days, 39 hours! - Right.

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,830
At some point the hiding person had to go to the toilet ...

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,570
... where he did his business, but at the fear of getting exposed by the noise he didn't flush.

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:52,950
In the morning Kuro-chan saw his dump and he got exposed because of that.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,000
It's probably scarier to find someone's dump than a person.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,380
He might've thought he forgot to flush himself! -Like he had some kind of memory disorder!

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,520
But it didn't look like the shape he normally produces.

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,320
"I couldn't have made that", I know what you mean. - You do?!

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,760
Well this time our project takes us to Kuro-chan's home once more!

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,560
"Hide for money - at Kuro-chan's home"

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,470
Indeed! - "Hide for money"?

19
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,030
Kuro-chan actually moved to a new place on this show recently!

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,870
It's a lot more spacious than his last place.

21
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:35,480
What we did is to hide 10 TV personalities in his home while he was away. - 10?!

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,630
Wow! - Once Kuro-chan came home, ...

23
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,990
... we observed to see how long it'd take him to find them all.

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,690
Did he by chance figure it out after finding 10 people's worth of shit?

25
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,960
Not one of them would flush?!

26
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,260
You're about to witness "Hide for money - at Kuro-chan's home"!

27
00:01:54,370 --> 00:02:01,140
Moreover, there's a segment about kids with a long way to school that's not covered in this fansub!

28
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,290
Hide for money - at Kuro-chan's home.

29
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,100
This time is all about hiding yourself at Kuro-chan's place!

30
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,290
We've gathered 10 TV personalities who seem like they might be good at hiding!

31
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,550
What's Takahashi Minami doing in a lineup like this?

32
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:48,600
I'm actually quite good friends with Kuro-chan, so that's the reason I'm here!

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,660
I'm also here as a friend. - We're both here for that reason!

34
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,110
Including these two, who are Kuro-chan's friends, ...

35
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,340
... everyone's average height is 158cm!

36
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,340
They're all quite short!

37
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,840
10 contestants who've all cleared their PCR tests!

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,440
The biggest light weight of all of them is ...

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,830
Me, Seiga! I weigh 39kg, ...

40
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,780
... so I want to make the most of that and do my best! Count on me!

41
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,150
He has a face that could beat Inada (Naoki).

42
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,560
Meanwhile, the home owner Kuro-chan ...

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,600
Q: Describe your life in a few words.
K: "From now on"

44
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,310
Doing some kind of interview?

45
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,920
He's taking part in a fake interview.

46
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,150
What kind of answer is "from now on"?! - Seriously.

47
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:46,110
And so the contestants head into Kuro-chan's place that's been equipped with 19 hidden cameras.

48
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,110
What's that supposed to mean? "From now on".

49
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,730
Still messy as always!
- That even his new place would turn out like this.

50
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,170
Everyone, please hide!

51
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:58,940
By the way, the contestants will earn 10 yen for each second of hiding until they're found!

52
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:05,130
Kuro-chan will arrive in an hour, so please hide before then!

53
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,150
That's his NEW place?!
- Clean the place! - It's filthy!

54
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,330
The toilet is filthy!

55
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,600
This place is ... - A mess!

56
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,400
He really doesn't change.

57
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,740
I'm thinking of hiding among all this cardboard. It seems like a blind spot.

58
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:27,080
And so he hides by ripping a hole into the cardboard boxes that have been sitting here since Kuro-chan moved in.

59
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,020
Looks pretty good! - Right?

60
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,340
Pretty good spot.

61
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,340
They say "it's hard to see what's under your nose".

62
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,910
The closest place would be here, right? Since he'll sit there.

63
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:42,000
If I hide back here ...

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,340
... I'll be able to know what he's up to, because I'm so close!

65
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,630
That could work in my favor.

66
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,010
I've got this one in the bag! Money, here I come!

67
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,010
Ah, very good!

68
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,650
One by one, each of them decides on their hiding spot.

69
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,800
It starts when Kuro-chan gets back, so please do your best!

70
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,990
Under the sink, under the bed ... - The apartment isn't so bad.

71
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,380
Quite spacious!

72
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,530
And then ... the home owner returns.

73
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,970
"Hide for money - at Kuro-chan's place" starts!

74
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,890
Clean up, dammit!
- Yes, it's a new place!

75
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:29,230
As soon as he gets home, he starts digging into the bento he got at his shoot ...

76
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,940
... as well as a convenience store meal. It's double portions for him.

77
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,630
And then ...

78
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,800
"Breakfast & lunch in one! Grated yam soba & onion soup!"

79
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,860
That's not true!

80
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,890
"Living the healthy life-dashiiiiin~!"

81
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,430
He just can't stop lying!

82
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,570
He doesn't mention the yakiniku bento, and falls back into the habit of lying in his tweets.

83
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:59,910
He also doesn't notice the contestant who's hidden only 2m from where he sits.

84
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,910
He's moving around! - This is bad!

85
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,800
Kuro-chan is fully immersed in his bento.

86
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,250
He doesn't notice!
- How's he so carefree?

87
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,250
But then ...

88
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,420
The curtain moves in an unnatural way.

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,800
And then ...

90
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,600
Now he's noticed it!

91
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,750
But you wouldn't expect someone to be there!

92
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,470
Kuro-chan sensed that something was off.

93
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,110
And in that moment ... !

94
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,800
What? Some kind of noise?

95
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,920
A big mistake - he dropped his phone!

96
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,090
What's wrong with you? - Bad move, Wes-P.
- He just dropped his phone?

97
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,260
Those thighs piss me off!

98
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,650
Not one milimeter of thigh gap!

99
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,440
Kuro-chan instinctively takes a step back.

100
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,510
He seems frightened. - Yes, he can't speak!

101
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,490
He's not even asking "Who's there?".

102
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,710
Although he's frightened, he slowly comes closer.

103
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,710
It moved again!

104
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,050
He wanted a blind spot, but it's no use.

105
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:23,360
Ah, I knew it!! There's someone there!

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,870
After 15min 26sec, Wes-P has been secured.

107
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:32,830
Wes-P, that was no good. - Big blunder on your part.

108
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,830
Eh, who are you?!

109
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,340
Ugh, so soon ... - "So soon", what's that supposed to mean?!

110
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,230
Shit. - Eh, what are you on about?!

111
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,510
Nice to meet you. - Uhm, you too ... ?

112
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,260
Oh man ... - What is this?!

113
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,170
Why's someone in my home I don't even know?! - This sucks.

114
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,830
It ended so soon. - What's that supposed to mean?!

115
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,190
Why were you here anyway?! HEY?! - So frustrating.

116
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,800
W-who was that?!

117
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,890
Some dude I don't know was here!

118
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,800
What kinda prank is this? Huh?

119
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,540
Are you with Wednesday('s Downtown)?!

120
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,910
But hang on, he just left!

121
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,310
Wes-P, unrecognized by Kuro-chan, is headed for ...

122
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,860
... a jail up on the roof of the building.

123
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,910
Eh, what is this? Is it over? Hey!!

124
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,600
Come out for the reveal already! What is this?!

125
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,830
I don't get what's going on! Come and do the reveal!

126
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,830
But our "Hide for money" has only just begun.

127
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,440
There's no way we'd reveal it this early on.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,910
10 minutes pass.

129
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,910
And then ...

130
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,420
Perhaps he thought there were hints behind the curtains?

131
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,690
Kuro-chan investigates all the curtains.

132
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,860
Ah, this is bad!

133
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,860
And then ...

134
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,860
The cardboard!

135
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,030
Eh! There's someone here! Right?! There totally is!!

136
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,860
Right? Who are you?!

137
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,210
Uwah, I knew it! There IS someone! Who are you?!

138
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,980
BICSMALLN's Chiro has been secured.

139
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,290
Hang on, you're that Choro guy, right?

140
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,030
Choro? His name's Chiro!

141
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,600
Kuro-chan isn't very familiar with entertainers.

142
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,310
How many are there?! Are there still more?!

143
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,960
And so at last he sets out on his journey as ... hunter!

144
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,870
If he's going like this, he'll search under the bed next.

145
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,380
And then ...

146
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,440
Ah, there's someone!! I knew it!! Right there!

147
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,000
Who are you?! - Ugh, I figured I'd be fine here.

148
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,570
Once he knew something was up, he was bound to search there.

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,340
What are you on about?!

150
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,630
Shit, that was so soon ...

151
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,350
What are you cursing for?!

152
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,350
I really thought I could pull it off.

153
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,030
What's your point, seriously?!

154
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,540
And with this, Kuro-chan follows the contestant.

155
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,970
And what he finds is ...

156
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,200
Eh ... ?

157
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,700
Wh-what are you doing?!

158
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,470
What is this? What are you guys doing here?!

159
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,340
Was this especially set up for Kuro-chan? - Yes, just for him!

160
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,200
While the hunter has left his post ...

161
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,770
I need to stretch myself a little ... !

162
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,310
Is Takamina doing fine?

163
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,060
I'm a bit thirsty.

164
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,770
Maybe I'll help myself to some water. This one still looks sealed, so I guess it's fine.

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,580
Is that really ok?
- He'll come back!

166
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,770
The contestants use the time to catch a breather!

167
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,000
But this is the roof of my building!

168
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,060
Are you doing "Run for money"?

169
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,240
You are, right?

170
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,710
Enough already! I figured it out, enough!

171
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,140
What's wrong with you?!

172
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:09,740
At last Kuro-chan figured out that this is a parody of "Run of money".

173
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,400
He's back! - This is bad!

174
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,110
Oh, who's there?!

175
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,550
What are you doing?
- What's wrong with that guy?

176
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,550
Who are you?! I know you're there! I found you!

177
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,550
Ah, shit.

178
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,940
He was being too reckless!

179
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,670
You're doing "Run for money", right? - Ugh, shit.

180
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,540
How terrifying would it have been if he'd found Seiga first.

181
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,750
At this point, 1 hour has passed since the project began.

182
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,390
Only the 6 people seen here still remain.

183
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,860
But then ...

184
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,730
My manager gave me this earlier, what is it?

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,260
He said "Use it at your next job". So he wants me to wear it?

186
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,740
That's right. For his "next job", ...

187
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:06,680
... in other words, for THIS job, he was given a black suit just like the one hunters wear.

188
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,090
I should wear this, right? Right?

189
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,290
Are there still more?!

190
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:17,240
Kuro-chan changes his clothes as he keeps voicing complaints about everything.

191
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,800
Now put on these sunglasses ...

192
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,460
Why'd you wear them at home?

193
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,460
There's even a camera attached on the side!

194
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,000
I really look like a hunter!

195
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,500
A unique kind of hunter.

196
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:37,870
A hunter he may be, albeit more reminiscent of Umibozu from City Hunter.

197
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,210
How many are there? I guess I gotta search for them?

198
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,460
I'll find you! I will!

199
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:48,290
He's found 4 already. - But he doesn't know how many are left.

200
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,290
I already caught this one.

201
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,260
Next would be ...

202
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,320
This would be the main room, right?

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,670
Here, my walk-in closet.

204
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,920
Eh, what's that? Did something fall off the rack?

205
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,710
I found you! I totally did!

206
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,740
What the hell!

207
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,540
Gimme a break! - It's Makino Suteteko!

208
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,870
I was sure you wouldn't find me! - You're number 5!

209
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,120
Whatever. - I found you-shiiiyo!

210
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:31,090
Having found 5 people, Kuro-chan does ...

211
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,800
That should be everyone, right?

212
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,370
That was easy-peasy.

213
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,890
Ok~! The staff just needs to show up now.

214
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,540
I got all 5, bingo~!

215
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,170
No part of him thinks there'd be 10 people hidden in total.

216
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,110
He mistakenly thinks 5 would be a nice round number.

217
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,830
With that, his search comes to an end.

218
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,770
Clean up the place! - Seriously.

219
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,830
Someone save us. - Someone, please!

220
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,460
That's right!

221
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,000
If someone can rescue the members on the roof without being caught by Kuro-chan ...

222
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,400
... they can earn a bonus of 50 000 yen, as an extra rule!

223
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:21,940
And so this man, who was hiding on the veranda, is making his move.

224
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,980
Alright, I'll head up to save them!

225
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,480
Chance is coming for us!

226
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:34,140
He enters the apartment from the veranda via the window, ...

227
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,140
He'll find you like this, isn't this dangerous?

228
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,830
... and heads to the roof.

229
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,830
Oh, he made it!

230
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,540
Ah, Chance is here! Chance has come!

231
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,140
Thank you~!

232
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,310
However, only 1 person can be rescued at a time!

233
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:55,000
Please save me! - Please save me!

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,370
He worked hard at King Of Conte, so I'll pick Sakai! - Ah, thank you!

235
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,940
Come out! - Come back for us as well!

236
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,190
With this, Chance Oshiro earns a 50 000 yen bonus!

237
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:17,530
Unnoticed by an inattentive Kuro-chan, Chance makes it back out to the veranda.

238
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:24,090
The veranda seems dangerous.

239
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,090
Sakai also ...

240
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:34,940
... heads back underneath the bed, thinking there's no way he'd search the same place twice.

241
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,030
Is the staff still not coming out? Hey!

242
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,260
Ah! Another phone?!

243
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:49,710
Eh? Is there someone there?

244
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,170
Eh, wasn't there a sound just now? Is there someone?

245
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,370
Where was it? I heard some kind of bang.

246
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,890
I think it was back here!

247
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,660
Sakai turned Kuro-chan's hunter switch back on!

248
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,140
And then ...

249
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,140
There's someone!!

250
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,000
He got Chance caught with that!

251
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,930
Sakai repays his rescue from the roof by getting him caught.

252
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,460
Are there still more of you?!

253
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:33,940
With this, Kuro-chan realizes there are more than 5 people, ...

254
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,750
... and he resumes his search.

255
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,170
There's someone! - Kyah~! - Who's screaming?!

256
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,140
Eh, Takamina?!

257
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,600
Why'd you have to find me?!

258
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,470
What-, wait ... why is Takamina in my home? - Seriously, why?! You're so cruel!

259
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,170
I don't get what's going on but you can't just come in here with a bunch of comedians!

260
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,550
After that ...

261
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,340
Uwah! Another one!

262
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,570
You found me ... - Ah, it's Yabe!

263
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,920
Screw you! - You can't say that to the home owner!

264
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,200
Screw you! - You can't speak badly of people!!

265
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,760
You make me sick! - Don't say that!!

266
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:33,970
[These subs are brought to you voluntarily, without the support of any of the sponsors listed up there]

267
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,910
3 hours have passed since we started.

268
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,650
The 3 listed here still remain.

269
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,930
Sakai is doing well! - You'd think he'd be out by now.

270
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,760
I'll look around the kitchen.

271
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,000
As Kuro-chan appears to investigate the kitchen ...

272
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,770
... the man under the bed makes his move.

273
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,770
He's coming out? - Something he wants to do?

274
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,110
In order to prepare for the long term, ...

275
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,100
... he grabs a blanket, pillow, ...

276
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,730
Gotta check the smell.

277
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,940
... potato chips, gummi candy, and ...

278
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,890
Those make noise!! - He's gonna come!

279
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,860
It's so cold!

280
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:14,060
He even grabs some warm clothes!

281
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,510
Much warmer~!

282
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,870
And then ...

283
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,030
Koishida? - Yeah?

284
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,200
Right now I think you can grab anything you need.

285
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,000
Sure seems like it.

286
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,460
Ah, he was there?

287
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,290
After gaining this information from his neighbor Sakai ...

288
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:41,030
... Koishida emerges from his closet for the first time in 3 hours!

289
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,890
Was that a noise just now?

290
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,980
Was there a noise? Hey, is someone there?!

291
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,950
It really turned into "Run for money"! - Hide quickly!

292
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,340
Hey, where are you? Where?

293
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,260
There was a noise just now!

294
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,260
He'll be found like that!

295
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,770
I'm sure there was a noise, it was pretty loud!

296
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,830
It's wide open!

297
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:16,970
But it's a small closet, it seems unlikely someone would be in there.

298
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,910
Did I leave it half open like this?

299
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,310
It feels somewhat warm ...

300
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:30,000
Found you! I got you!

301
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,610
Oh, come on! - I found you~!

302
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,610
Are you Koishida?

303
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,590
Sorry, Sumire!

304
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,860
They got your (Sumire's) dad. - Daddy!

305
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,400
And so only 2 remain.

306
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,210
Moreover, since it's past 4 pm ...

307
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,630
I don't have much time before my next job, so ...

308
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:59,060
... I need to change and leave! Got it? I gotta go!

309
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:05,890
Kuro-chan might be going somewhere, but the project will continue until everyone is caught.

310
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,200
Damn, my apartment's all messy now!

311
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,640
It was messy from the start!

312
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,460
Have fun at work!

313
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,890
Here the remaining two can catch a breather at last. But ...

314
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,970
You're here, right?! - Woah, he's back!

315
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,700
Eh, that's scary!

316
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,510
You're here, right? I know you are!

317
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,910
The way he goes about it is scary! - Hey, hey, hey!

318
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,600
You're here, right?

319
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,970
Getting dangerous ... !

320
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,760
I really gotta go, you know?

321
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,450
I do have to go, even though I'm not sure I really have work tonight.

322
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,020
But I'm short on time, so I'll head out now!

323
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,630
What was that?

324
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,400
Did he leave?

325
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,570
This time he really left, right?

326
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,300
No, wait a bit more!

327
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,940
He left, right? Then so will I. Here I go.

328
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,610
Uwah! - Thank gosh it's you.

329
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,830
Thank goodness.

330
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,450
He really did leave, right? - Yeah!

331
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,520
And then ...

332
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,930
I think he might not be back for another 3 hours. - 3 hours?!

333
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:24,170
That's according to Kikuchi, who works with Kuro-chan every day.

334
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:28,290
We're basically free to do anything for these 3 hours.

335
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,370
And so ...

336
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,810
Shall we order food?

337
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,770
Hello ... ?

338
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,650
They order pizza.

339
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,860
Wow, this is great!

340
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,050
They fill their stomachs to prepare themselves for the long haul.

341
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,430
You sure he won't come back?

342
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,050
Meanwhile, on the roof.

343
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,570
I actually have work after this, so ... - Eh?

344
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:57,690
Takahashi Minami, the only TV personality here who's actually in demand, retires from the game.

345
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:03,170
Now 3 hours have passed since Kuro-chan left for his work.

346
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,220
Let's get back to it again. Thanks for everything!

347
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:14,090
They head back like employees staying at a business hotel on a work trip.

348
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,400
Each of them goes back to their old position.

349
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,300
The bath ... - He'll be found for sure!

350
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,960
It's tight around my stomach, I ate too much!

351
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,000
This bath is actually quite pleasant.

352
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,000
The bath's dangerous, Kikuchi!

353
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,170
He's even got manga.

354
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,470
He hasn't even searched it yet.

355
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,540
7 hours since the start.

356
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,010
They've gotten fairly used to their life in hiding.

357
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,030
But then ...

358
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,870
He's back!

359
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,730
Very slowly.

360
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,630
The home owner returns, on tiptoes like a burglar!

361
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:53,540
At his own home! - I get how he feels though.

362
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,800
And then ...

363
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,890
I'm back, hear me?! I'm back!!

364
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,630
Why's he announcing himself?

365
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:11,690
Hm, where are you? Where might you be? I'm back! Did you wait for me?

366
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,890
He startled me ... - Did I startle you?!

367
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,770
I'm back! The home owner has returned!

368
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,570
Hey there~!

369
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:26,910
I came back dashing once my broadcast was over! Hear me?

370
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,910
"Dashing"

371
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:33,130
Where are you? Let's put an end to this alright?

372
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,800
Seriously, where are you? Where?!

373
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,600
Scary! - Why's he so agitated?

374
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,540
We really need to end this now! Seriously!

375
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,650
If we don't end this soon I'm gonna lose my freaking mind!

376
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,510
In a complete reversal from the cat burglar style he showed at first ...

377
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:01,590
... Kuro-chan runs around from room to room in a bizarre state.

378
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,960
Once I wear this I'll be in hunter mode!

379
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,630
There are still more left, aren't there?!

380
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,060
He once again picks up his search!

381
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,300
The bath's dangerous!

382
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:17,200
There's still a place I haven't searched yet.

383
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,260
This is bad, he'll come in here ... - A place I haven't searched~!

384
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,650
You're in trouble!

385
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,630
And then ...

386
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,710
Who's in here?

387
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,140
Uwah, shit! - Kikuchi? Eh, Kikuchi?!

388
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:49,740
Wanwan-nyannyan's Kikuchi is secured after 7h 12min.

389
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,540
Now I've found everyone, right? All 10?

390
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:58,080
I've found everyone! ALL TEN OF THEM!!!!

391
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,370
Of course Kuro-chan doesn't know about the rescue rule.

392
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,690
He's convinced this means it's over.

393
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,970
He's just casually eating something.

394
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,460
The staff still won't show for some reason.

395
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:17,370
In that case ... I've gotten all sweaty, so I'll take a bath.

396
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,830
He's taking a bath. That's my chance!

397
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,740
He's in the bath!

398
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,200
Zero privacy!

399
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,450
Taking this chance, Sakai goes and ...

400
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:36,370
Sakai's coming! - He'll rescue us, right?

401
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,790
Aaaah, nice!

402
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,490
Who are you picking?

403
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,300
Chance! To repay you for earlier!

404
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,570
Sweet! - I'm still in the game because of you!

405
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,640
To thank him for rescuing him once, he rescues Chance.

406
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,600
Kuro-chan is defenseless as he's still occupied with shower time.

407
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,510
While he's busy, they both make their way back to the apartment.

408
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,950
As their hiding spots, they pick ...

409
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,540
That was Takahashi Minami's spot!

410
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,970
Chance heads into the closet Takahashi Minami was hiding in earlier.

411
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,540
It smells like Minami~!

412
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,930
What are you talking about?

413
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,630
Sakai on the other hand heads back underneath the bed.

414
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,770
I rescued Chance!

415
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,950
9h 30min have passed since the start of this project.

416
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,950
I'm about to get ready for bed after this ...

417
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,990
... so is the staff really not gonna show up?

418
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,860
Ah, wait! Isn't everyone on the roof still?

419
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,630
They'll be exposed! Oh-oh.

420
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,630
I'll go up there and ask them!

421
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,600
Ah, no one's there!

422
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,510
Eh ... ?

423
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,710
He must think it's over.

424
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,710
Eh? They're gone?

425
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,140
Did they all go home? What's the meaning of this?

426
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,690
As a matter of fact ...

427
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:16,570
... when Chance was rescued the scheduled time for the shoot was already exceeded ...

428
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:21,220
... so the group on the roof dissolved and left.

429
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,060
Does this mean it's over?

430
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,540
There's no one here, right? Did they go home?

431
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,370
Where are they going with this? Why does no one tell me stuff, seriously.

432
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:39,540
At this point Kuro-chan is convinced the shoot is over.

433
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,750
Hence, he switches to off-time mode.

434
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:51,490
Tonari No Totoro, Totoro~!

435
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,090
He might be relaxing in the living room.

436
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,540
This makes me remember the time I got bullied in Amagasaki.

437
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:03,430
I'd get locked up in narrow spaces like this.

438
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,940
I've been confined like this before.

439
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:14,540
I also remember ... a murder ... happening right before my eyes.

440
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,980
What are you talking about?!

441
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,020
10h 30min since the start.

442
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:27,660
As Kuro-chan is convinced the project is over ...

443
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,940
Welcome to my evening routine, the Kuro-chan livestream~!

444
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,000
He starts livestreaming on TikTok.

445
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:40,110
"You look like Cromartie", aah it's a homerun to be compared to a Giants player!

446
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,600
"Your face is too close", are you shy of faces?

447
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,200
"Shiro-chan", wrong, it's "Kuro"!

448
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,890
Who'd wanna watch Kuro-chan?!

449
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:55,980
"What are you into lately?". I'm too embarrassed to tell, but thanks for the flowers and heart-piipii~! Baby-tappii~!

450
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,630
Kuro-chan, stop talking ...

451
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,330
Is he crying?!

452
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,800
Kuro-chan ...

453
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,910
This hellish livestream continues for 40 minutes.

454
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:09,310
"Hell". - Well they're not wrong.

455
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,310
"You're a baby", that's how my parents see me. Baboo~!

456
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:13,170
"I like a guy who's just like you". You shouldn't like anyone apart from me!

457
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,090
His fast talking is making me insane.

458
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,170
It's like a cult leader chanting spells.

459
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,840
Chance's stress is hitting its limits.

460
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,750
This would make anyone go insane. - The stress of the narrow place is getting to him!

461
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,290
Kuro-chan, shut up already! Phwgh!!!

462
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,290
Tomorrow, do you ... - Shut up, Kuro-chan!!

463
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,090
Hm?

464
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,670
Some kind of noise.

465
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:40,710
Tomorrow, do you ... - Shut up, Kuro-chan!!

466
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,430
Hm?

467
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,770
You'll be caught! - This is scary!

468
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,340
This must be scary for his viewers.

469
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,690
This is bad!

470
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,340
A major blunder by Chance!

471
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:56,630
His voice reached Kuro-chan in the room next door.

472
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:03,170
Scary! - Especially for his viewers.

473
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,170
Sorry, my bad, it was nothing-dashiiin~!

474
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,510
Thanks for the gift, Kagetora!

475
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,140
One of the comments says "Wednesday's Downtown".

476
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,140
Then, as he ends the livestream ...

477
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,360
Thank you-dashiiin~!

478
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,910
There really was a noise just now!

479
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,400
Is there still someone there? Huh?

480
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,270
There was a noise, right?

481
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:44,730
Ah! Who are you? Who?!

482
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,270
Eh, aren't you Chance Oshiro?!

483
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,570
Ugh, sorry ...

484
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,000
Why are you here a second time?!

485
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,800
Eh wait, so it was never over? It's not over at all?

486
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,930
It's not over at all?!

487
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:07,570
This is bad, now I'm the only one left.

488
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,690
What's this about? This was your second time, wasn't it?!

489
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,500
Please tell me there's no one left!

490
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,270
There still is someone~!

491
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:25,230
And so, just to be sure, he checks every place for a second time.

492
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,970
This is impossible.

493
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,830
If they can revive, I'm stuck in an infinite loop!

494
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,170
He doesn't check under the bed ...

495
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,870
I'm going to bed!

496
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,850
And then ...

497
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:46,530
Kuro-chan retires for the night.

498
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:56,500
With this, Sakai has entered a time where he can focus entirely on increasing his prize money!

499
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,730
However, 30 minutes later ...

500
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,340
Sakai has fallen asleep.

501
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:13,330
You're kidding! - It's a bunk bed of hell!

502
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:20,070
What kind of image is this? - How can he sleep there?!

503
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:22,820
For one hour, they both sleep soundly, snoring both above and below the bed.

504
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,970
Is he serious? - What is this?!

505
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,060
Eh?

506
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:44,600
That must be scary! - It might've sounded like his own snoring at first!

507
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,850
Scary ... ?

508
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,840
Eh?

509
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,830
Snoring?

510
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,970
How can you sleep there, Sakai?!

511
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,610
You've gotta be kidding me.

512
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,330
There's someone there! Hang on, what's this about?!

513
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,450
Isn't that Sakai?!

514
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,630
You're back again?!

515
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,300
Wake up! Go home! Leave!

516
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,270
What the hell?!

517
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:36,600
Am I ... am I at Kuro-chan's place? - Of course!

518
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,930
Why ... ? Oh, I see.

519
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,670
Wh- ... what are you on about?!

520
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,670
I was scared!

521
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,240
You snored like crazy!

522
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,850
I was seriously scared!

523
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,830
You snored just as loud!!

524
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,380
I can't get out ... - Get out! You got under there yourself, didn't you?

525
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,730
And I found you once before!

526
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,290
What the hell, leave already!!

527
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,670
You're noisy! - Don't tell me that, it's MY home!

528
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,670
You're noisy! - What's the matter with this guy?!

529
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,300
I just woke up, I'm in a bad mood!

530
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,730
And so, after a recorded 13 hours and 13 minutes, ...

531
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,410
... Sakai wins 402 180 yen!

532
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:23,800
This ends this tremendous project. What did you think?

533
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
What surprised me ...

534
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,420
... is how there are actually people who tip Kuro-chan in his livestream. - There are!

535
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,620
He had like hundreds of rose gifts. - Right!

536
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,200
Sumire, your thoughts?

537
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,200
I think if it had been me, I would've fainted! - Since you sleep alone? - Yeah!

538
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,830
Unfortunately they caught Koishida straight away. - Yes, my dad got caught right away!

539
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,970
What about Matsumoto?

540
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:53,740
They should've added Yaguchi as a contestant. - With the closet and all.

541
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:53,740
[Referring to an incident where Yaguchi Marika cheated on her husband and hid her lover in a closet when he returned]
