1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,940
Matsumoto, out of 100 how would you rate yourself?

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:12,790
Subbed by: HouseiGIFs, Dael, GodzillaRadio, J-Hive, Mickstar813, Razuberii

3
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,950
Q: Out of 100, how would Matsumoto rate himself as a man?

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,950
100.

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,790
100 Questions

6
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,790
Matsumoto Hitoshi's

7
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,690
Last week on the show was a quiz:

8
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,790
Matsumoto Hitoshi's 100 Questions!

9
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,190
I've said this from the start,

10
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,000
Q: What is Matsumoto's favourite adult video genre?

11
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,000
I only watch girls debut performances.

12
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,360
---------

13
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,360
Alright!

14
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,360
He got it.

15
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,970
A: Debut performance

16
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,970
That must feel good.

17
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,970
New Recruits

18
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,970
But you all knew that, right?

19
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:29,410
Punishment on the line - Everyone does their best

20
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,940
With a punishment on the line, everyone was serious.

21
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,410
And so...

22
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,410
Who will receive the punishment?

23
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,240
The loser is none other than...

24
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,480
Yamasaki Housei!

25
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,720
Last place

26
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,720
Yamasaki Housei

27
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,050
No way!

28
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,720
-------------------------------

29
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,780
Oh my god...

30
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,080
You're kidding!

31
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,550
What will his punishment be?

32
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,720
So, what will his punishment be?

33
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,460
100 Shouts of Matsumoto!!

34
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,330
You're going to go to loads of places

35
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,900
and shout "Matsumoto-san!"

36
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:00,370
Punishment
Commences

37
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,540
And now Yamasaki Housei

38
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,170
will live out his sentence!

39
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,710
Cocorico

40
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,710
Cocorico

41
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,710
Downtown

42
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,710
Downtown

43
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,710
Endō Shōzō

44
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,710
Hamada
Masatoshi

45
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,710
Matsumoto
Hitoshi

46
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,710
Tanaka Naoki

47
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,710
Yamasaki
Hōsei

48
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,970
I'm still angry personally!

49
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,080
You knew too little about Matsumoto.

50
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,880
You didn't know anywhere near enough.

51
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,910
He has every reason to be angry.

52
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,910
But wait, Matsumoto-san,

53
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,980
it's true I didn't know a lot about you,

54
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,590
but Hamada-san knew even less than me.

55
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,780
But me and him are just like 'business partners'...

56
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,620
While you, er...

57
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,460
Him and I have been together since we lived in a Yakult apartment.

58
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,560
It's a long history between them.

59
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,560
Very long, you know.

60
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,770
With a vending machine of only Yakult to drink.

61
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,620
Seriously...

62
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,670
Let's move on.

63
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,380
Ahh, Matsumoto-san!!

64
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,680
What was that?

65
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,450
MA~tsumoto-san!!

66
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,850
100 Shouts of Matsumoto Punishment
Will they be able to endure such a harsh penalty?

67
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,380
What are you on about?

68
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,380
Ow!!

69
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,790
Shall we look at how you did?

70
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,790
So, Yama-chan, please introduce the video.

71
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,090
Please enjoy watching.

72
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,860
So now, this video...

73
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,260
START!

74
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,400
Enduring this is also a punishment.

75
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,570
At 6 in the morning,
the 100 shouts punishment starts at dawn.

76
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,800
In the morning?

77
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,940
Yamasaki arrives at today's
meeting place, the Takeshiba Pier.

78
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,710
At dawn!

79
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,610
Staff: Good morning!

80
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,910
Today, Yamasaki, you're going to

81
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,680
do your punishment "100 Shouts of Matsumoto."

82
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,390
First, I'll explain.

83
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,520
It's a heating belt but

84
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,560
touch it here and see.

85
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,760
SWITCH

86
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,430
You see it vibrates, now...

87
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,700
Yamasaki-san tie the belt around your waist

88
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,440
and when it vibrates

89
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,670
you think of Matsumoto-san and yell:

90
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,540
MATSUMOTO-SAN!

91
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,510
So he can't
decide himself.

92
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,540
Whilst thinking about Matsumoto-san...?

93
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,040
It's to help
with timing.

94
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,810
When the vibration starts he shouts
"MATSUMOTO-SAN" as his punishment.

95
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,720
Also, we'll give you directions with this transmitter.

96
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,720
May I attach it?

97
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,720
Yeah.

98
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,730
Right, we'll give it a test, then begin.

99
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,800
Face towards the sea.

100
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,800
Ah, that's
a nice spot.

101
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,930
Don't laugh!

102
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,200
Your punishment will begin
at the same time as the test.

103
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,940
Right.

104
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,940
Well, good luck.

105
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,710
Just a second...

106
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,780
Can I shout then, if I'm meant to shout?

107
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,020
You've got to wait
for instructions.

108
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,960
I see.

109
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,820
It was so early
in the morning...

110
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,030
Starting in:

111
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,470
What was that?

112
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,900
STARTS!!

113
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,900
100 SHOUTS OF MATSUMOTO STARTS!!

114
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,340
He freaked out
when it vibrated.

115
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,670
Good, we'll go somewhere else now.

116
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,950
Wait, I'm going to be
by myself the whole time?

117
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,510
That's right.

118
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,090
Did  I do something that bad...?

119
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,520
Yeah you would
be feeling unsure...

120
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,120
To accomplish his punishment Yamasaki travels by car.

121
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,260
This is amazing.

122
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,760
OK, I'm in the car.

123
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,860
Aw man, what will happen to me now?

124
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,370
The car heads towards the next location,

125
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,110
right next to Tokyo Tower, in Shiba Park.

126
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,410
You'll get out here.

127
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,410
Ah, Tokyo Tower?

128
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,220
Where?

129
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,450
Can you turn left and enter the park?

130
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,360
Geez, this is stressing me out, I dunno why
but I feel something bad's gonna happen.

131
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,300
Doing this alone is really worrying me.

132
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,030
Stop saying "AHH!"

133
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,870
I can't help it, I'm not
used to it at this point

134
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,470
Then get used to it.

135
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,470
Yeah.

136
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,150
I think your screams aren't loud enough.

137
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,010
It needs more guts.

138
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,720
I am shouting loudly.

139
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,990
Er, see the bench?
Where there are elderly people.

140
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,490
Yeah, I see they're doing something.

141
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,160
Can you go talk to them?

142
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,260
Good morning. What are you doing?

143
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,690
Good morning. What are you doing?

144
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,500
Stretches.

145
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,500
Ah, stretches.

146
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,160
Aren't you a comedian?

147
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,160
Ah, Yama-san!

148
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,160
That's right.

149
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,130
You looked fatter on TV.

150
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,100
When you were imitating a lawyer.

151
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,300
When I played a lawyer? That's true.

152
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,050
Shout louder!

153
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,050
Yeah, for real.

154
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,140
Is Matsumoto-san here?

155
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,720
I wonder if Matsumoto-san is around here somewhere?

156
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,610
No, no, no...

157
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,450
What are you filming today?

158
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:46,160
* Gaki = kid, hence the confusion after

159
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:46,160
It's for Gaki no Tsukai.

160
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,590
* Hidden camera show following kids on their first solo errand

161
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,590
Hajimete no Otsukai?

162
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,590
Hajimete no Otsukai...? Yeah, well, uh...

163
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,060
It's time to go.

164
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,060
OK, excuse me, goodbye!

165
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,270
Good luck!

166
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,270
OK, thank you very much!

167
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,770
This is...

168
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,110
Are you not just sending me around random places...?

169
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,410
Is it going to be OK?

170
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,310
OK!

171
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,880
Aah...

172
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,390
This is exhausting.

173
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,790
I still haven't heard
one I'm happy with.

174
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,720
* Business area of Tokyo

175
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,720
The next step is to Shimbashi.

176
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,800
It has the most people travel through it during rush hour per day

177
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,800
Yamasaki prepares to do his punishment during rush hour.

178
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,600
For now just head to the station.

179
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,600
The station?

180
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,040
Put yourself under the traffic light.

181
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,040
Under the traffic light?

182
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,080
Eh seriously? This is so tough...

183
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,720
Can you be a little more in the center of the square?

184
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,180
Uwah, woah!!

185
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,180
Wow, this is...

186
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,990
Eh, you see this?
Just look at that!

187
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,990
This is so tough...

188
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,990
The camera shoots
from quite far!

189
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,130
Here we go.

190
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,200
No way, you didn't
even shout.

191
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,870
Please shout louder.

192
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,640
Of course.

193
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,640
Just make it loud enough that we can wrap it up.

194
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,180
Ugh, that's just...

195
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,220
It just looks like you're
calling someone.

196
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,420
You're like one of those little old Japanese men
waiting for you at the airport to rent a car.

197
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,420
----------------------------------------------------

198
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,160
Yamasaki-san on the sidewalk in front of you is a bakery.

199
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,930
Bakery

200
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,930
You can go there.

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,840
There's lots of different
delicious-looking bread!

202
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,780
This isn't what
I was imagining...

203
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,820
It's so quiet..

204
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,350
Pardon me.

205
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,050
This is really bad.

206
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,020
Come on!

207
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,890
That'll be 1620 yen please.

208
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,890
OK.

209
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,560
Can I get a receipt?

210
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,560
Sure.

211
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,330
Matsumoto-san, correct?

212
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,330
Right.

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,210
Hey this... is pretty intense.

214
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,640
Hey this... is pretty intense.

215
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,680
3 hours after beginning,

216
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,680
Yamasaki is only on his eighth shout.

217
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,490
You haven't done a damn thing yet they feed you.

218
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,390
* A prominent TV channel which also airs Gaki

219
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,390
The next place is the NTV headquarters.

220
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,130
Eh, where? What?

221
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,700
Eh, where? What?

222
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,900
Eh, where? What?

223
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,800
The cooking segment of "PON!" should start soon.

224
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Go and shout during their broadcast.

225
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,370
Woah! Seriously?

226
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,210
If "PON!" is starting,
it's probably about 10:30am.

227
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,750
Aw, I don't like this...

228
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,120
What is this, I have to shout here?

229
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
Geez, come on...

230
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,590
They will think I'm crazy, geez...

231
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,720
Weekly Mon ~ Fri
10:25 Live
(Except some areas)

232
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:11,130
"PON!" LIVE

233
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,330
On the morning broadcast of "PON!"

234
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:15,530
the goal is to shout live.

235
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,770
I really dunno about this...

236
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,480
See, now that
was a shout!

237
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,480
Yeah, that was.

238
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,480
Good, good!

239
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,280
This is your best
shout so far.

240
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,220
So he didn't give
his all before!

241
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,920
True!

242
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:39,020
"PON!" LIVE

243
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,520
You had no
intention of yelling.

244
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,520
It's not like
I didn't want to!

245
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,020
Yamasaki

246
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,020
MATSU MOTO -SAN~!!

247
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,020
MATSU MOTO -SAN~!!

248
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,020
MATSU MOTO -SAN~!!

249
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,960
MATSUMOTO-SAN~!!

250
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,960
MATSU MOTO-SAN~!!

251
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,790
This is awful.

252
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,430
It's good.

253
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,170
Ah, it's freezing!

254
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,870
"PON!" LIVE

255
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,870
Next is to interrupt the segment for The Touch.

256
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,870
* Comedy duo

257
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,870
Takuya

258
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,280
But it's not good if I interrupt them.

259
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,580
I'll actually be interrupting them, seriously?

260
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,580
Yes.

261
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,110
No way!

262
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,650
He's really happy!

263
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,380
"PON!" LIVE

264
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,850
Is it here you really
wanted to yell?

265
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,250
It's not about
wanting to or not!

266
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,780
He's loving this...

267
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:16,630
"PON!" LIVE

268
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,790
Matsumoto-san!!

269
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,790
Huh?

270
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,320
Wait a minute...

271
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,960
Matsumoto-san!!

272
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,360
Not bad!

273
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,670
Have you finished?

274
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,570
I'm sorry.

275
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,570
Even The Touch
apologises.

276
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,980
In here?

277
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,480
Tower Records

278
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,980
Yes.

279
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,280
You went everywhere!

280
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,150
Yamasaki tries out his own CD

281
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,350
But here you don't
have to hold back.

282
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,750
22nd Shout
of Matsumoto

283
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,650
Geez...

284
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,650
Oh dear...

285
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,330
In the Elevator

286
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,000
Totally wrong.

287
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Wha??

288
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,760
27th Shout
of Matsumoto

289
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,330
Hibiya Park's Matsumoto (restaurant)

290
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,330
36th Shout
of Matsumoto

291
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,810
Matsumoto KiYoshi (pharmacy)

292
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,970
You can't get
anything out of him!

293
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,980
* As if the shop is a person

294
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,980
Look at you, shouting "Matsumoto-san!"

295
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,550
Woah...

296
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,920
What a bitch!

297
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,050
This is harsh.

298
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,890
Are you doing something?

299
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,890
Yeah...

300
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,590
What a bitch...

301
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,860
41st Shout
of Matsumoto

302
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,860
Ahahahaha!

303
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,660
King of Gyoza

304
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
For one person.

305
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,360
OK.

306
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,070
You're gonna eat!?

307
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,070
Of course, everything
I did is in this...

308
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,170
But you haven't
done a damn thing.

309
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,400
Thank you for the meal.

310
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,340
50th Shout
of Matsumoto

311
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,210
This is so bad.

312
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,680
Zaki-san, honestly!
Just go for it.

313
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,680
I am doing it.

314
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,450
Man, I waited ages for that meal.

315
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,150
Ah, this is irritating!

316
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,490
Irritating!?

317
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,390
Yamasaki has shouted 50 times,
just half of his punishment.

318
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,720
You kidding me?

319
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,460
The car now heads towards its next destination.

320
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,760
He said it's irritating...

321
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,660
Oi, you can't be serious...

322
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,500
What's up?

323
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,060
What am I doing here?

324
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,000
What is it?

325
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,000
Ah, wow!

326
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,570
This is the house of parliament.

327
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,570
Eh, you're serious!?

328
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,210
Well of course,
that could happen...

329
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,680
I can't shout here, it's not possible!

330
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,650
Besides there are lots of police...

331
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,650
There sure are!

332
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,890
The atmosphere here is different.

333
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,290
See the pair of guards?
There's a space in front of them.

334
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,560
Go over there.

335
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,890
I can't do that, no way!

336
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,900
Yamasaki

337
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,900
I'm not being held responsible...

338
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,170
Well, are you ready?

339
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,870
No. no, no way, no way, no way, no way!!

340
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,600
The place itself
makes it scary

341
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,810
It is a punishment after all.

342
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,810
True.

343
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,280
See the pair of guards?
There's a space in front of them.

344
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,310
Go over there.

345
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,780
I can't do that, no way!

346
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,780
Yamasaki

347
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,780
I'm not being held responsible...

348
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,120
Well, are you ready?

349
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,590
No. no, no way, no way, no way, no way!!

350
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,360
I can't, seriously, there's no way!

351
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,260
I can't do that, no way, no way...

352
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,660
Oi oi oi oi oi oi oi!

353
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,060
Oi oi oi oi oi oi oi!

354
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,430
Oi oi oi oi oi oi oi!

355
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,900
Oi oi oi oi oi oi oi!

356
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,230
Oi!

357
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,100
I can't do this.

358
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,370
Geez...

359
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,170
It was too quiet so it doesn't count.

360
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,940
No, no, no, I can't, no way!

361
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,180
It can't count as a shout.

362
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,940
I can not shout here... No way.

363
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,750
I can not shout here... No way.

364
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,990
He's been infront of the gate for 3 minutes.

365
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,460
His voice just will not come out.

366
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,360
What the hell does that even mean,
"His voice won't come out"?

367
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,190
This is impossible...

368
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
It's not impossible.

369
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,500
Let's go.

370
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,560
Seriously? Seriously?

371
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,330
We're counting on you.

372
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,330
Seriously? Seriously?

373
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,270
Ahh, come on...

374
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,970
This is awful.

375
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,100
No no no no!

376
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,240
No no no no!

377
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,370
No no no no!

378
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,240
No no no no!

379
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,280
Yamasaki-san, you weren't even heard!

380
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,780
Not in the slightest!

381
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,950
You love running away...

382
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,810
Geez...

383
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,050
We can't count that one.

384
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,620
Too right!

385
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,290
So Yamasaki-san, ready to move on?

386
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,000
* A big production agency for stage artists

387
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,000
2PM, heading to 'Lumine the Yoshimoto' in Shinjuku.

388
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,000
Ah, you're on stage.

389
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,030
Hello.

390
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,030
Hello.

391
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:25,370
Imada Kouji's once per month performance

392
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:25,370
Today he's playing a part with comedian Imada Kouji.

393
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,510
OK.

394
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,350
Yamasaki receives a bracelet.

395
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:36,790
They prefer a wristband for him instead

396
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,020
I can't wear this,  please!

397
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,180
During the real thing?

398
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,790
I can't do it, there are customers...

399
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,690
---------------------------------------

400
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,690
Will Yamasaki shout!?

401
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,690
Will Yamasaki be up to it, facing so many people?

402
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,120
Look how his
belly sticks out!

403
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,290
But here, you should
really be able to go for it.

404
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,560
Yoshimoto New Comedy Troupe

405
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,860
Hold on now!

406
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,540
* A popular stage gag of Housei's

407
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,540
MA~!!

408
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,700
Eh, what're you doing here!?

409
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,140
Wait, what's with that tone?

410
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,910
Huh, what did you say?

411
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,580
You know I could

412
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,580
make you disappear from this world in 3 seconds.

413
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,680
Go on then.

414
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,680
Right then.

415
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,420
In 3 seconds?

416
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,420
Yeah, I will.

417
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,820
MA~tsumoto-san

418
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,290
MA~tsumoto-san

419
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,760
What are you on about?

420
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,760
Ow!!

421
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,130
Why yell someone's name?

422
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,300
He's done so well to play along and get people to laugh along...

423
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,170
Hamada-san, that's not it, it's not even about that...

424
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,810
Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building

425
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,550
63rd Shout
of Matsumoto

426
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,610
It should be like this.

427
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,610
Right, yeah.

428
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,550
Shinjuku Station

429
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,550
Shinjuku Station, East Exit

430
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,650
So embarrassing.

431
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,020
These kind of places,
he should really...

432
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,220
Yeah, yeah.

433
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,560
71st Shout
of Matsumoto

434
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,690
Meh...

435
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,760
Are you just here to shout "Matsumoto-san"?

436
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,760
Yeah...

437
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,030
I'm only here to say "Matsumoto-san!"

438
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,030
Hahaha.

439
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,270
That's so annoying...

440
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,540
Shinjuku Station, East Exit Escalator

441
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,270
Yeah...

442
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,410
"Is that it?"

443
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,450
78th Shout
of Matsumoto

444
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,380
Ah, it's too quiet!

445
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,480
On to the next location

446
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,290
What's with this?

447
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,100
83rd Shout
of Matsumoto

448
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,330
Why here?

449
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,270
Geez, they don't let me
rest for a second, seriously...

450
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,270
* An upscale Tokyo district

451
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,270
The next place is Ginza.

452
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,110
I'm in the heart of Ginza.

453
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,310
Everyone here is
upper class and stuff..

454
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,710
Yamasaki-san, see the little police station?

455
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,050
Ah, there it is, a tiny police station.

456
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,850
OK, let's shout standing right next to it.

457
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,790
Police
Station

458
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,850
Eh!?

459
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,120
Police
Station

460
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,390
Police
Station

461
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,160
I was terrified of yelling
by a police box like that.

462
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:51,850
Police
Station

463
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,860
Yamasaki

464
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,490
Why?

465
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,490
Why?

466
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,490
It was scary somehow,
I didn't wanna get in trouble.

467
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,360
That's pathetic.

468
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,730
Trying to pretend he's
looking for someone.

469
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,670
He's just pretending to
look for someone!

470
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,670
Seriously!

471
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,840
To try and make
an excuse.

472
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,610
So true.

473
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,240
Ah, I was
really scared...

474
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,840
Look at what
he's doing!

475
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,810
You're not
doing it at all.

476
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,850
Yamasaki

477
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,620
The police are watching me...

478
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,450
Yamasaki

479
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,350
No they aren't...

480
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,290
Next is a place where silence is mandatory.

481
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:30,290
Next place, a gallery

482
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,990
An art gallery.

483
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,800
It's super quiet...

484
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,440
Wait, I absolutely can't do it here...

485
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,540
How can you shout in a place like this...?

486
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,640
I'm counting on
you here, okay?

487
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,770
Please do.

488
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,110
Ideal place for
this punishment.

489
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,270
This is impossible, no way, no way, no way!

490
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,140
It's not right to shout in such a place.

491
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,710
Don't say that, it's a
punishment after all.

492
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,250
Eh...?

493
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,210
Right, come on.

494
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,490
No good Yamasaki-san, it doesn't count.

495
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,920
But it's too risky to shout here.

496
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,920
That was no good.

497
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,760
Do it once then immediately return.

498
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,560
Do it once then immediately return.

499
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,730
I'm sorry.

500
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,200
What the hell is this?

501
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,370
Plus, he quietly
apologized.

502
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,440
I dunno about this...

503
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,940
They were just so shocked, ugh...

504
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,450
-----------------

505
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,450
So pathetic~!

506
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,020
Only 14 shouts are left.

507
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,290
86 shouts
complete

508
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,290
It's time for
the climax!

509
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,290
I haven't heard any shouts
and it's already evening.

510
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,290
Now it's time for the climax!

511
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,630
-------------------------------------

512
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,630
12 hours since the start

513
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,630
Yamasaki's nearing his limit...

514
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,520
Yamasaki's stamina has reached its limits.

515
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,790
No, no, no, no...

516
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,630
Arrived at it's final checkpoint

517
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,630
The car comes to its last destination.

518
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,230
No, no, no, no!

519
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,370
Seriously, where are we?

520
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,740
Where are we?

521
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,850
Hold on now, oi...

522
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,480
What is this!?

523
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,390
Yamasaki-san?

524
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,390
Eh?

525
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,930
Currently for your "100 Shouts of Matsumoto"

526
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,630
you've completed 86 shouts.

527
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,270
86 Shouts
of Matsumoto

528
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:17,270
14 Shouts

529
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:17,270
Left:

530
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,830
So now there's 14 shouts left.

531
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,270
Really?

532
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:23,010
Yama-chan, see the mannequin before you?

533
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,110
This is a model of Matsumoto Hitoshi.

534
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,310
A dummy of Matsumoto-san?

535
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,250
It's really similar to Matsumoto-san...

536
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:42,020
Right, can you turn to the path you just took?

537
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,560
You'll carry the Matsumoto-san mannequin

538
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,130
using all your strength.

539
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:56,070
Then, run to the red cones doing your last 14 shouts.

540
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,170
Are you ready?

541
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,340
Wait a sec! Wait!

542
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,640
Wait a sec! Wait!

543
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,150
Uwah~ This is revolting!

544
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,850
"Revolting"...!?

545
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,450
Are you alright?

546
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,450
Give me a second...

547
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,390
What did you mean?

548
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,760
Starting in 3 seconds!

549
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,760
What you trying to say??

550
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,760
Well...

551
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,790
Two!

552
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,790
One!

553
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,330
Start!!

One!

558
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,570

559
00:20:30,740 --> 00:21:16,150
Shout Counter:

560
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,550
HOT! HOT! HOT!!

561
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,030
You bet it's hot.

562
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,640
He was like, "Waah!"

563
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,440
SO HOT!!

564
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,580
Yamasaki-san, you still need three shouts!

565
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,580
HOT!!

566
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,450
Yamasaki-san, still three left!

567
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,250
I protected you!

568
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,730
I saved him!

569
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,860
With this the "100 Shouts of Matsumoto" punishment

570
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,970
has been successfully completed.

571
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,070
Good job.

572
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,240
THANK YOU!!

573
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,540
Just the last one...

574
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,540
That's so bad.

575
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,510
Just the last
one was loud.

576
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,510
100 SHOUTS OF MATSUMOTO ENDS!!

577
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,940
What did you think, everyone?

578
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,910
He wasn't shouting at all...

579
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,720
Are you happy with his volume?

580
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,720
No, I cannot accept that.

581
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,420
It really wasn't shouting at all, right Zaki-san?

582
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,190
What!? Really I--

583
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,990
After all, it is a punishment.

584
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,990
It's a punishment!

585
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,020
It's pointless if you try to fit in with your surroundings,

586
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,760
Right!

587
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,220
for a punishment you had to belt it out.

588
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,560
Like wherever you are...

589
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:56,960
Sure.

590
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,470
You have to do it like that.

591
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,870
You should've screamed like that in the gallery.

592
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,870
The gallery!?

593
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,300
You're seriously able to
do that in an art gallery!?

594
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,170
Like seriously,

595
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,510
if you had properly yelled
100 times "Matsumoto-san"

596
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,710
your voice would have gone...

597
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,440
That's true.

598
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,440
But you're fine.

599
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,510
Your "THANK YOU!!" was incredibly loud without restraint.

600
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,210
It was his best shout.

601
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,210
What's that about?

602
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,750
Come on, seriously shout, let us see.

603
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,760
That's not what we saw, right?

604
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,430
Yeah.

605
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,430
I did do that...

606
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,430
It wasn't in the video.

607
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,930
What did you do in the gallery?

608
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,460
As if!

609
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,400
Don't just shamelessly lie.

610
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,770
But I did do it...

611
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,270
Wait, in what you just saw...

612
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,840
what was I doing wrong?

613
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,050
You had to shout "Matsumoto-san"
at the top of your voice

614
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,480
regardless of the situation or place.

615
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,390
You'd really belt it?

616
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,390
Come on show him.

617
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,390
I would!

618
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,820
Like that in Shinjuku or an art gallery.

619
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,820
Like with that much energy.

620
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,820
That's the way.

621
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,930
There's absolutely no way--

622
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,930
Endo show him, go Endo, go.

623
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,030
That's good.

624
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,070
You had to shout like that 100 times.

625
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,070
In a gallery or wherever.

626
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,670
I did it before as well...

627
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,670
Go for it.

628
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,570
That was superb!

629
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,840
He's the best.

630
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,710
Hamada you don't need to use the "-san" you know.

631
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,580
Oh, who gives a shit...

632
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,550
But the phrase is "Matsumoto-san."

633
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,680
Ah OK, it just surprised me.

634
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,250
Come on, try it yourself.

635
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,030
Now that's a shout!

636
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,590
Honestly, Yamasaki's been especially awful this year.

637
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,360
Indeed, I've been awful.

638
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,970
Like you're late all the time...

639
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,270
Right.

640
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,270
Since last New Year's party.

641
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,900
* New Year's Yama-1 Grand Prix - GnT #1090 29/01/2012

642
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,270
"Indeed, I've been awful," he says.

643
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,900
Right, the New Year's party, you were just dawdling about.

644
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,640
Yeah.

645
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,140
* Katamari Grand Prix - GnT #1093 19/02/2012

646
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,140
Then after that, you couldn't read
the atmosphere in the Katamari contest.

647
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,980
This time too, for this punishment, again
you weren't able to figure out what we wanted...

648
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,880
Seriously, what are we to do with you?

649
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,450
Do you want to take like a 8 month break?

650
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,920
No, no, no...

651
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,720
You're finished for this year.

652
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,720
Really...?

653
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,090
Uwah!! Matsu--
Matsumoto-san! WAHH!

654
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,990
HOT! HOT! HOT!
