1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,720
Let's move on to our last request today.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,480
Yes, our last request comes from the 35 y/o Nagata Nami, a housewife, who lives in the Wakayama prefecture.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,980
"Good evening, Detectives."

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,400
"My request concerns my 4 y/o daughter, Nana."

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,160
"She has abnormal strength in her fingers."

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,060
"In fact, when we start a thumb war, in a position where she holds me down ..."

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,280
"... I can't manage to free myself, no matter what."

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,220
She's that strong?

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,520
"No matter how often me or my husband have tried, she always pins us down."

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,340
"Could one of the Detectives come and try to challenge her?"

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,400
It's something everyone does, right? Thumb wars.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,100
Everyone does it! Holding the other one down like this.

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,240
Yes, everyone.

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,080
And you can easily free yourself, right?

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,600
But when this 4 y/o girl pins you down, you can't get out!

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,280
Could you say the same of yourself? Probably not, right?

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,940
As a matter of fact, I thought our client just wanted their daughter to appear on television.

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,860
That's what I thought. Wouldn't you?

19
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,180
Yes, probably.

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,700
And would you have no idea what to tell her?

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,160
In any case, I went there for the time being.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,300
Take a look!

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,320
Our client claims, that if we start in a pinned down position, it'll be impossible to break free.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:31,440
Is is easy to keep the opponent from breaking free?

25
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:31,440
Trying it with the show staff first

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,380
That's right.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,240
Like this, get in position ...

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,380
And, start!

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,380
1,2,3,4,5,6, ...

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,440
One more time.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,880
I need to put a lot of strength into it. Ready? - Ok.

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,600
And ... start!

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
1,2,3,4,5,6,7, ...

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,660
You do it!

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,300
And ... start!

36
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,400
1,2,3,4,5, ... - See?

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,140
It's in the grip, right?

38
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,140
And ... start!

39
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,580
1,2,3,4,5,6,7...

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,660
There's no way! You can break free instantly!

41
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,740
Even for an adult, it's difficult to pin down the opponent ...

42
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,680
Even when doing it with an adult, you can break free.

43
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,880
So with a 4 y/o, even if she pins me down, I'll break free instantly!

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,300
So you're saying the request she sent us was a lie? - She's lying!

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,320
She's definitely lying! A 4 year old?!

46
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,120
What's the truth?

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,860
So I'm in the Wakayama prefecture ... ehm ...

48
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,800
... and I don't really know what to say ...

49
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,200
Yes!

50
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,040
Lying is pointless.

51
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,600
Seriously. - I'm over here!

52
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,380
Everyone in this family is a liar! - Not at all! It's true!

53
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,680
Have you seen it? - I have. I've even tried it!

54
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,220
I ... didn't think it was possible for a 4 y/o!

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,160
Don't you just want to appear on television? - No, no, I don't!

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,400
Can we try? You're definitely weaker than me.

57
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,780
Put a lot of pressure into it.

58
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,060
Not yet, wait for the signal!

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,720
Shall we do it?

60
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,560
Not yet! Only when he gives the signal! - But you pressed down already!

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Hold on a second ...

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,600
And ... go! - 1,2,3,4,5, ...

63
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,880
Can you do it with me? - Yes.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,900
And ... go! - 1,2,3,4,5, ...

65
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,980
See, even if you press down, I can break free!

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,660
But when a 4 y/o does it, it's supposed to be impossible? - Definitely!

67
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,500
It's been 4 years since she was born? - Yes.

68
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,700
In my case, it's been 66 years!

69
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,700
And she can supposedly pin me down like that? That's what you're saying? - Yes, that's right.

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,240
Hello ~

71
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,880
Nana has returned from preschool

72
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,400
Hello!

73
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,040
How old are you? - 4 yearth old.

74
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,540
She can't really say it.

75
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,640
4 years old, she goes "4 yearth".

76
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,200
Now you sure have been pranked by mom and dad, haven't you?

77
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,060
You see it now, don't you?

78
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,520
Could you do it with mom?

79
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,820
It starts when I yell "start", ok?

80
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,720
Ready? Start!

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,440
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

82
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,380
You're liars, all of you!

83
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
How about dad?

84
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,040
Take position, ready?

85
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
And, start!

86
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,660
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

87
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,200
You liars! All of you! Nothing but liars!!

88
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,580
Were you serious when you tried? - Absolutely!

89
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,040
Can you do it one more time? When I say start.

90
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,460
Start!

91
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,820
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

92
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,020
Liars, all of you!

93
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,220
This family is starting to scare me!

94
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,520
You know that if you hold me down and I break free, this shoot is over? Then I'll just go home.

95
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,500
Get in position ... like that ...

96
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,280
In position ...

97
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,940
And, start!

98
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,100
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

99
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,520
Hold on!

100
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,920
Hold on a second!

101
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,960
Ready? - Yes.

102
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,800
And ... start!

103
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,300
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

104
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,420
How ... ?

105
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,160
How ... ?!

106
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,800
How old are you?

107
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,440
66.

108
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,100
She can't be that strong!

109
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,020
Her power ...

110
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,200
One of the staff should try as well!

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,940
In position? Ok. And ... start!

112
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,340
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

113
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,640
She's strong!

114
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,000
Ready?

115
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,920
And ... start!

116
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,300
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

117
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,920
Hey ... why are you so strong?

118
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,100
Why are you so strong? - 4 yearth old!

119
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,960
Well, that much I know already.

120
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,700
Since when have you been so strong?

121
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,460
Alwayth.

122
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,460
Always?

123
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,080
It's all in that hand.

124
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,480
Look.

125
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,540
Now we've seen that we've all lost to her, but perhaps the viewers at home can't quite grasp it yet.

126
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
So should we take a walk around town?

127
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,120
Hello!

128
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,460
Ready? And ... start!

129
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,360
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

130
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,660
She's strong! - How was it?

131
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,740
Why do you think? - Talent?

132
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,180
Isn't that Kanpei?

133
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,740
Ready? And ... start!

134
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,600
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

135
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,120
It wouldn't budge.

136
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,900
All set? Ready? And ... start!

137
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,500
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

138
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,960
I lost.

139
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,800
And ... start!

140
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,240
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

141
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,240
Ah, it's impossible!

142
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Did you use glue or something?

143
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,100
It's like glue? - Yes.

144
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,700
The secret of her strength?

145
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,840
Can you count a little slower? You're so fast!

146
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,860
And ... start!

147
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,660
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... 5 ... 6 ... 7 ... 8 ... 9 ... 10!

148
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,220
How ?

149
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,820
... 36 ... 37 ...

150
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,820
Ah, excuse me.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,680
Dr. Tani Hitoshi

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,680
Knight Scoop - Medical Supervisor

153
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,840
My thumb won't budge at all.

154
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,480
Please try your best to break free! And ... start!

155
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,040
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!

156
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
What is this?

157
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,000
What is this? She's 4!

158
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,880
She's 4! - But it won't budge.

159
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,920
It has to do with how human fingers can move.

160
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,880
What do you mean, "how fingers can move"?

161
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,300
If I press it down normally,  I can just slip out.

162
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,780
But this girl goes for this joint.

163
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,560
If you press down this joint, you can't move around freely anymore.

164
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,860
But even if you do it this way, holding down from above, you can still break free to the side!

165
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,300
That's why this girl pins you down in this position here. - Ah, so she does it there?

166
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,120
Here, she wraps her finger around the first joint.

167
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,200
That way, you can't escape in any direction.

168
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,260
So even escaping to the top is impossible?

169
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,960
Yes, just like in that direction.

170
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:20,820
Did someone teach her this? - She didn't want to lose, so she thought of her own special way.

171
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,040
This little kid ... so much talent!

172
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,060
Amazing! I tremble before you! - I tremble before you!
