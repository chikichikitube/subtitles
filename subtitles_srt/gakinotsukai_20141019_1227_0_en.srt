00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:10,710
Let's go!
Nakameguro Edition!

8
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,210
Let's go!

9
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:11,860
We're here!

10
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,830
This is our second time doing this.

11
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,350
-Yes!
-Yes.

12
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,630
We visited Daikanyama last time.

13
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,880
Right, right...
We visited Daikanyama last time.

14
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,720
Right, right...

15
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,850
But we found absolutely no one!

16
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,340
Yeah, it was deserted.

17
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:19,990
I think it was also because of the heat.
Yeah, it was deserted.

18
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,260
I think it was also because of the heat.

19
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,720
Right, that was another factor.
I think it was also because of the heat.

20
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,230
Right, that was another factor.

21
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,890
No one was on the streets.
Right, that was another factor.

22
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,410
No one was on the streets.

23
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:24,960
But today's a bit cold.
No one was on the streets.

24
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,860
But today's a bit cold.

25
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,480
-That's right, this time it's pretty chilly.
-It's completely different.

26
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,290
Last time, this program was recorded under the scorching sun.

27
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,620
Thank you for having me at "Hey! Hey! Hey!".

28
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,880
She's been on Hey! Hey! Hey!

29
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,320
Although they did meet a few famous people in the Daikanyama area...

30
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,520
-Ah, Ms. Repro.
-You're from the agency Repro, right?

31
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:51,190
...they didn't manage to name a single one of them. Could this be due to a generational gap?

32
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,470
So to get their revenge, the guys have moved to another area this time around.

33
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,950
They will try their hand at Meguro Wards' Nakameguro area!

34
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,980
The area around Meguro River.

35
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,050
It's a trendy town, surrounded by popular restaurants and famous stores!

36
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,070
Will they encounter any celebrities in this town full of talent agencies?

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,800
But, the very guy that said,

38
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,430
"Since we didn't find anyone last time I wanna get my revenge", is not here because of a tummy ache.

39
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,890
-That's right.
-He's resting.

40
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,880
Does he have a stomach ache?

41
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,080
I mean, I don't know the exact cause...

42
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,480
He's just feeling unwell.

43
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,910
Yeah, he's feeling unwell.

44
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,190
But I mean, what's with that?

45
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,640
You know, just last week at the waiting room he bragged to me and said, "You'll never get sick if you keep eating yogurt.".

46
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,560
-He told me that last week!
-For real?

47
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,980
He told me this the other day too, "I'm never gonna get a cold and won't be getting one anytime soon".

48
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,030
And now we're here.

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,860
I was so shocked when I heard!

50
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,660
-It was last week, wasn't it?
-Yeah, it was!

51
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,260
He told me all of that last week!

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,590
Just like last time, these are the rules.

53
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,960
We won't stop until we find someone.

54
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,190
They have to be on their personal time.

55
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,980
They can't be in a shoot or anything like that.

56
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,930
We didn't even see anyone filming the other day.

57
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,040
That's right!

58
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,120
Right! No one was even filming!

59
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,540
And this rule is the harshest, don't you think?
Right! No one was even filming!

60
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,180
And this rule is the harshest, don't you think?

61
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:09,960
Yeah...

62
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,720
You have to say the person's full name.
Yeah...

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
You have to say the person's full name.

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,540
And all of us have to say it, right?

65
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,690
-Yes, that's right.
-That's right.

66
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,890
Lastly, if their agency doesn't consent to the filming then it's no-go.

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,110
Will we complete the task this time?

68
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,110
How do you guys feel?
We're in Nakameguro!

69
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,360
Yeah!

70
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,750
Have you guys met anyone famous here?

71
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:32,890
I said this before, but back at Don Quixote, I met husband and wife, Kaera Kimura and Eita.

72
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,420
Whoa, marvelous.
I said this before, but back at Don Quixote, I met husband and wife, Kaera Kimura and Eita.

73
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:33,620
Whoa, marvelous.

74
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,110
-That's right.
-Isn't that great?
-It is!

75
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,420
It really is amazing.

76
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,180
You know, I am really hoping to meet Yoko Kumada at the Nakameguro Don Quixote.

77
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,040
Didn't you meet her before?

78
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,570
-Yeah, I did!
-Oh, right back then.

79
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,150
-Yes, I've run into her before.
-I see, I see...
-Yeah, I did!
-Oh, right back then.

80
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,620
-Yes, I've run into her before.
-I see, I see...

81
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,400
So I think we'll run into her today as well.

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,650
I also ran into someone at that same Don Quixote.
So I think we'll run into her today as well.

83
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,790
I also ran into someone at that same Don Quixote.

84
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,900
Everyone's at Don Quixote!
I also ran into someone at that same Don Quixote.

85
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,060
I also ran into someone at that same Don Quixote.

86
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,670
I had the pleasure to run into Nenji Kobayashi.

87
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,410
That's amazing!
I had the pleasure to run into Nenji Kobayashi.

88
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:54,740
I had the pleasure to run into Nenji Kobayashi.

89
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:54,990
You ran into Nenji?!
I had the pleasure to run into Nenji Kobayashi.

90
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,990
You ran into Nenji?!

91
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,140
What was he doing there?

92
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,770
He was doing some shopping.

93
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,040
For real?!
He was doing some shopping.

94
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,390
For real?!

95
00:02:59,390 --> 00:02:59,670
I gave him a proper meeting and we chatted for a while.
For real?!

96
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,000
I gave him a proper meeting and we chatted for a while.

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,280
We'll be fine today.
I gave him a proper meeting and we chatted for a while.

98
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,270
We'll be fine today.

99
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,150
Yes, we'll be fine!

100
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,730
What about you? Have you run into anyone around here?

101
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,370
In their off time, I mean.

102
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:07,600
Not on their off time, but while I was on a shoot, I saw Saburo Tokito on his bike riding out of the gym next to Don Quixote.
In their off time, I mean.

103
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:15,220
Not on their off time, but while I was on a shoot, I saw Saburo Tokito on his bike riding out of the gym next to Don Quixote.

104
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,690
-I wanna meet him!
-That's so great!

105
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,910
I really wanna run into him!

106
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,420
I'm so jealous!

107
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:19,730
That's a great encounter!
I'm so jealous!

108
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,900
That's a great encounter!

109
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,750
He was going home after a gym session, I think.

110
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,840
The hour is 3:39 p.m.

111
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,720
Unfortunately the sky is riddled with clouds...
But let's get started!

112
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,850
Someone is bound to be here!

113
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah... Maybe...

114
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,400
We'll find someone, won't we?

115
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,560
First off, we'll be aiming for the heavily trafficked Yamate Street.

116
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,330
But then, Hamada immediately blurts out something negative.

117
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,760
Isn't the EXILE office right around there?

118
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,680
That's right.
Isn't the EXILE office right around there?

119
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,350
Isn't the EXILE office right around there?

120
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,150
If we meet one of the E-girls I'll never get their names.

121
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,160
I've only ever met them as a group.

122
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,500
You're totally right.
I've only ever met them as a group.

123
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,690
You're totally right.

124
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,620
I'm never even sure if I'd be able to name them.

125
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,080
There's just too many members, right?

126
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,440
I'll never guess their names if they come at me one by one.
There's just too many members, right?

127
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,360
I'll never guess their names if they come at me one by one.

128
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,110
You never know, we might meet one of them.
I'll never guess their names if they come at me one by one.

129
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,230
You never know, we might meet one of them.

130
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,280
Oh, there’s Don Quixote.

131
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,840
We're finally here, huh?

132
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,880
I'm 100% sure we'll find someone there.
We're finally here, huh?

133
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,240
I'm 100% sure we'll find someone there.

134
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,170
-I hope that's true.
-I'm certain.

135
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,180
But we can't go in with the cameras.

136
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,950
Oh, it's fine.

137
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,400
You're gonna get fired, man!

138
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,080
-Huh? Can we really go inside?
-Really?
-Yes, we can.

139
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,440
What?!

140
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,080
Then it's gonna be an easy shoot.

141
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,930
What? Really?
The shoot's gonna end so soon.
Then it's gonna be an easy shoot.

142
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,490
What? Really?
The shoot's gonna end so soon.

143
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,020
-Is it really okay?
-Can we really go in?

144
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,720
Of course.

145
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:28,910
I mean, we've only been walking for a few minutes...
Of course.

146
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,000
I mean, we've only been walking for a few minutes...

147
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,010
We won't fill the full run time!

148
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,870
Yoko Kumada is gonna be there, you know?
We won't fill the full run time!

149
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,920
Yoko Kumada is gonna be there, you know?

150
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,250
It's just around the corner so we'll be stopping by.

151
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,320
We won't fill the full run time!
It'll be a short episode!
It's just around the corner so we'll be stopping by.

152
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,700
We won't fill the full run time!
It'll be a short episode!

153
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:38,590
Right?

154
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,210
The four guys have an unwavering trust in Don Quixote.

155
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,200
Will they run into someone famous?

156
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,830
Alright then, let's go in.

157
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,460
Let's go.

158
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,970
-There's bound to be someone.
-Let's go.

159
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,960
Yoko Kumada is on the second floor.

160
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,980
Should we go up?

161
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,760
I think there's a better chance upstairs.

162
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,720
-They should be up there.
-Let's go up then.

163
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,160
Huh?

164
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,950
That girl looks like an actress.

165
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,290
That girl, the one getting money at the ATM.

166
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,990
Isn't she a celebrity?

167
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,830
Maybe...

168
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,850
I saw her face but I don't think I'd be able to say her name.

169
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:10,550
Huh?

170
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,160
-I saw her face but I don't think I'd remember her name...
-You don't remember her name?

171
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,630
But she really looks like a celebrity.

172
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,860
-She was pretty cute.
-Yeah.

173
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,580
Just drop it, we're already upstairs.

174
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah, you're right.

175
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,140
Isn't that one of the EXILE guys?

176
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,480
Oh, I guess not.

177
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,720
-He looks like a famous magician.
-Right, a magician.

178
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,850
Sorry about that.

179
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,240
The other day... Was it Reina Asami that I met?

180
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,640
Yes?

181
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,250
I ran into her here.

182
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,770
But this place is empty.

183
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,280
You're right.

184
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,380
There's no one here.

185
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,400
Wait, wait...

186
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,010
What's going on?

187
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,520
What time is it? Around 4 p.m.?

188
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,800
-Yes, it's 4 p.m.
-That's right.

189
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,380
Huh?

190
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,210
I guess it is a bit of an odd time.

191
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,840
Is that so?

192
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,010
We should have come by a bit later.

193
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,720
Yeah, they usually come through here before having dinner.

194
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,460
-Oh, I see...
-Yeah, before dinner.

195
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:09,830
Huh?

196
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,100
Endo, what's going on?

197
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,110
Your calculations were wrong.

198
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:13,810
Endo?!

199
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,950
Your calculations were all wrong.

200
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,710
There's not many clients because of the time.

201
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,510
And a wave of disappointment washed over the guys.

202
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,940
You guys told me we'd definitely find someone here.

203
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,350
-I mean, it's an odd hour...
-That's right...

204
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,380
We better suck up some of that outside fresh air for now.

205
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,940
In the end, Don Quixote was a swing and a miss.

206
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,580
-I am so disappointed about that...
-Wait, wait...

207
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,990
I can already see our future...

208
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,040
Hold your horses! This is only our first stop!
Just be patient!
I can already see our future...

209
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,290
Hold your horses! This is only our first stop!
Just be patient!

210
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,020
It's all because you set up such high expectations.

211
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,370
It's just the time...

212
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,970
It really is the odd hour...

213
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,610
We can still make it a short one.

214
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,560
Isn't that Bobby Ologun?
We can still make it a short one.

215
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,640
Isn't that Bobby Ologun?

216
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,650
He looks like him, but it's not him.

217
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,090
It's not him, it's not.
He looks like him, but it's not him.

218
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,000
It's not him, it's not.

219
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,350
That was close!

220
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,680
-Meeting Bobby Ologun here would be amazing.
-Yeah.

221
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,840
It really would.

222
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,220
Yeah.

223
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:03,850
Sorry...

224
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,870
Isn't this the gym you were talking about?

225
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,870
Yes! That's right, this is it.

226
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,520
He came out of here.

227
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,360
-I think Shoji from "Shinagawa Shoji" is also a member of this gym.
-Oh, really?

228
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,770
Look, look, she's wearing a mask.

229
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,630
Yes, yes, yes.

230
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,530
You're right!

231
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,270
I wanna talk to her...

232
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,620
Looks like it could be someone.

233
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,880
-Someone has to go talk to her.
-She really looks like a celebrity.

234
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,430
She's gotta be famous!

235
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,210
For sure.

236
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,550
-Hold on, should we just go?
Should we?
-She came from over there.

237
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,070
Let's go then.

238
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,190
-Let's try.
-Should we?
-Yeah, let's go.

239
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,440
Let's seize our chance.
-Let's try.
-Should we?
-Yeah, let's go.

240
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,420
Let's seize our chance.

241
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,520
-Let's go.
-You guys go ahead.

242
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,040
I'm tired.

243
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,710
Is the girl in the mask a famous celebrity?

244
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,230
I'm almost sure that girl is famous but I don't think I'll ever remember her name.

245
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,670
Right, Yama?

246
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,010
Huh?

247
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,640
I'm almost sure that girl is famous but I don't think I know her name.

248
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,520
Well, I don't know about that...

249
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,370
She might be part of one of the EXILE groups.

250
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,470
Excuse me, would you mind talking to us for a bit?

251
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,520
It's you, right?

252
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,360
It's that girl from earlier!

253
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,520
-He's going in!
-Okay!!

254
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,400
But it all comes down to the name!

255
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,940
But they really found someone, look!
But it all comes down to the name!

256
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,350
But they really found someone, look!

257
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,860
Tanaka is cracking up!

258
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,670
-Really?
-Yes.

259
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,200
If we know her name it's over then.

260
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,190
Maybe it's Yagu-chan?
(Mari Yaguchi)

261
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,010
No way!

262
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,240
Is the masked girl a famous celebrity?

263
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,040
Kokoriko is on the hunt.

264
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,820
Excuse me, do you have some time?

265
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,910
I'm from E-girls, E-girls.

266
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,740
Right?

267
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,600
It's you, right?

268
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:46,770
Aya?
It's you, right?

269
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,070
Aya?

270
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,170
-Aya? Right? Aya? Aya?
-What's this? What's going on?

271
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,270
Hamada!!

272
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,540
Aya, hold on...

273
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,180
Sure...

274
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,160
But it all comes down to the name!

275
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,830
But they really found someone, look!
But it all comes down to the name!

276
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,220
But they really found someone, look!

277
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,760
Tanaka is cracking up!

278
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,720
-Really?
-Yes.

279
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,160
You're E-girls'...

280
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,110
-I'm the leader, Aya.
-Aya!

281
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,710
Yes.
-I'm the leader, Aya.
-Aya!

282
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:03,740
Yes.

283
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,320
Right?

284
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,980
Yes, I'm Aya.
Nice to meet you.

285
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,320
This girl is E-girls' leader! Aya!

286
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,080
Are you working right now?
Or is this your off time?

287
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,270
I'm on my off time.
Are you working right now?
Or is this your off time?

288
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,060
I'm on my off time.

289
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,270
-It is, isn't it?!
-You were buying some bread, right?
I'm on my off time.

290
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:15,870
-It is, isn't it?!
-You were buying some bread, right?

291
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,390
I was buying bread!
-It is, isn't it?!
-You were buying some bread, right?

292
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:16,930
I was buying bread!

293
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,210
She was buying bread!
I was buying bread!

294
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,770
She was buying bread!

295
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,740
Come one, please...
Do they really know her name?

296
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,240
But I can already tell from Tanaka's reaction...
Come one, please...
Do they really know her name?

297
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,880
But I can already tell from Tanaka's reaction...

298
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,800
He went like, "Whoa!!".

299
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,200
Right, I know that expression.... Like, "Whoa! I've met you before!".

300
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,480
And then you go like, "Who?".

301
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,250
"What was your name again?", or something like that.

302
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,740
We'll see if Hamada can name her once he gets here.

303
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,060
We're waiting to see if Hamada remembers her name, right?

304
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,010
He won't remember! There's no way! No way!
We're waiting to see if Hamada remembers her name, right?

305
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,050
You never know...
He won't remember! There's no way! No way!
We're waiting to see if Hamada remembers her name, right?

306
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,700
He won't remember! There's no way! No way!
You never know...

307
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:43,910
You never know...

308
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,630
I'm scared!

309
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,250
If Hamada can't say it, then it doesn't count.
I'm scared!

310
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,560
If Hamada can't say it, then it doesn't count.

311
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,540
Okay then.

312
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,280
Hamada! Could you come over here?

313
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,850
She's a celebrity...

314
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,990
-She's a celebrity...
-I told you!

315
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,400
Right...

316
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,910
So, we have already explained what we're doing here.

317
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,500
She's a celebrity and we know who she is.

318
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,440
Tanaka and I, we both have worked with her.

319
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,710
You guys worked with her?!

320
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,090
-Yes, she was a regular at our show.
-What?!

321
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,310
I know her face but not her name.

322
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,170
So... Hold on...

323
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,880
She's on her off time so she's eligible.

324
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,350
And one of the rules... I mean, Tanaka and I already said it...

325
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,170
But they'll give us a pass if you can say her name.

326
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,180
That's outrageous!

327
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,650
Right?!
That's outrageous!

328
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:20,740
That's outrageous!

329
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,050
No way!

330
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,620
It's only a pass if everyone can say her name.
No way!

331
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,810
It's only a pass if everyone can say her name.

332
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:23,960
I already said it.
It's only a pass if everyone can say her name.

333
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,600
I already said it.

334
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,470
No way! One person is enough!

335
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,490
-Tanaka already said it, right?
-Yes, of course.

336
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,160
-And I also knew her name.
-Right.

337
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,670
So it's up to both of you.

338
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,150
What?!

339
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,530
Hamada is enough, no?

340
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,980
No way! I don't know her name either!

341
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,100
Right? I knew it...

342
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,960
Does it count if I just say the group's name?

343
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,330
Just say it then.

344
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:42,790
Go ahead.

345
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,080
Isn't she one of the E-girls?

346
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,660
-Yes, yes, yes!
-Amazing!

347
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,260
Yes!

348
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,760
-Right?
-She's one of the E-girls.

349
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,120
E-girls'...?
-Right?
-She's one of the E-girls.

350
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,720
E-girls'...?

351
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,770
I don't know...

352
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,090
There's like 20 members in the E-girls!

353
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,050
I've met them a couple of times.

354
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,080
But I don't know.

355
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,820
There's just too many of them.

356
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,290
Is there that many?

357
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,890
Of course, there's lots of them.

358
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,570
We're 27 now.

359
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,950
-Isn't there like an almost-there-girls kind of group?
-There's like 3 different teams, right?

360
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,680
-They make up 3 different teams, right?
-Yes, yes.

361
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:09,620
-Is she not one of the almost-there-girls group?

362
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,800
-But who are you?!
-Is she not one of the almost-there-girls group?

363
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,350
-But who are you?!

364
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,290
I really don't remember her name.

365
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,990
-So, everyone has their own name, right?
-Yes, we all have names.

366
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,660
Of course they do!

367
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,720
In the end, they couldn't come up with her name.
Task failed!

368
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:25,820
Alright then.

369
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,550
But I recognized her right away.
Alright then.

370
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,080
But I recognized her right away.

371
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,610
That was quick.

372
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,700
We've only just started.

373
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,690
Oh, is that so?

374
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,220
Have you seen any celebrities around here?

375
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,080
There's tons of them walking around here.

376
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,420
-Walking?
-Yes.
-Right, they're walking around.

377
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,700
Like, Shizuka Fudo.

378
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,340
-What? Really?
-Whoa, amazing!

379
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,570
-But this area is full of E-girls.
-Let's keep looking.

380
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,390
-Oh, really?
-Is that so?

381
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,690
But we can't name them!

382
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,660
-We can't remember a single name!
-What are their names?

383
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,630
After splitting ways with Aya from E-girls, they boys head to a more crowded area around Nakameguro Station.

384
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,530
Isn't there anyone around?

385
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,400
I wish Tatsuo Umemiya would just walk in front of me.

386
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,240
Mr. Umemiya...

387
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,630
-Oh, this is new...
-I haven't eaten here.

388
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:09,970
Isn't this a famous pizza place?
-Oh, this is new...
-I haven't eaten here.

389
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,280
Isn't this a famous pizza place?

390
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,310
It looks fancy.

391
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,160
But Hamada, you were on point back there.

392
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,840
-Right?
-You spotted that girl.

393
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,970
She was wearing a mask.

394
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,220
They always wear masks.

395
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,740
A mask... Huh?

396
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,690
A mask and some sunglasses.

397
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:26,940
Or a hat.

398
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:27,840
A hat...

399
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,080
It's only been three minutes since they started searching again...

400
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,910
Just minutes ago, Hamada spotted Aya from E-girls...
But he's about to make another miracle.

401
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,280
Ah...

402
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,070
I gotcha!

403
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:47,780
Huh?

404
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,170
I found her!

405
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,160
Awesome!

406
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,560
-Hello!
-Hello!

407
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,170
-That's amazing!
-And we all know her name!

408
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,640
We all know her!

409
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,430
-By the way...
-What are you up to right now?
-What are you doing here?

410
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,640
My husband is at the convenience store...

411
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,340
Alright!

412
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,090
So, are you waiting for your husband to come back from the store?

413
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:08,720
Yes.

414
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,920
-This is your off time, right?
-That's amazing!

415
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:11,430
That's right.

416
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,960
Let us check.
That's right.

417
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,680
Let us check.

418
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,070
-Hamada!
-Hamada, you're amazing!

419
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,930
-Hold on, that was unbelievable!
-That was incredible!

420
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,610
-Hamada, you're amazing!
-That's crazy!

421
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:18,870
You're on your off time, right?
-Hamada, you're amazing!
-That's crazy!

422
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,580
You're on your off time, right?

423
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,760
This is completely your off time, right?

424
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,940
You're just shopping, right?

425
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,540
You're not working?

426
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,680
Oh, right...

427
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,060
Hold on, we're just checking with your agency to see if you can appear on the show.

428
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,080
A famous person who has worked with the guys many times in the past.

429
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,210
Of course, everyone knows her name.

430
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,980
-Let's go all together.
-Alright!
-Yes.

431
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
One, two...

432
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,660
Akiko Hinagata!

433
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,610
Is that correct?

434
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,130
That's correct.

435
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,280
Thank you so much!
That's correct.

436
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,070
Thank you so much!

437
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,130
Alright!

438
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,510
Incredible!

439
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:48,700
-Sorry for startling you.

440
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,030
-If your agency doesn't give us the okay we have to go searching again.
That's the only part left.
-Sorry for startling you.

441
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,960
-If your agency doesn't give us the okay we have to go searching again.
That's the only part left.

442
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,550
I think it'll be fine.

443
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,150
Alright, how long has it been since we started?

444
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,930
It's 4:17 now...

445
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,340
So about...

446
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,410
-About 30 minutes.
-30 minutes?

447
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,730
-That was so fast!
-That's great!

448
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,000
We're still trying to contact her agency.

449
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,780
No way...

450
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,760
If her agency says no, I'll jump in her car right now.

451
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,240
It's been 8 minutes since we contacted her agency.

452
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,530
We couldn't get a hold of her agent so permission has not been given yet.

453
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:32,500
The guys will keep searching for famous people while we wait for confirmation.

454
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,740
Hmm... There are too many people around here.

455
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,920
-Right.
-Yeah...
-Right...

456
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,900
The more normal people, the less celebrities.

457
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,680
Right.

458
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,100
-But we're at the station already.
-Right...
Right.

459
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,710
-But we're at the station already.
-Right...

460
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,150
They are being careful.

461
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,760
They won't be around here.
They are being careful.

462
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,000
They won't be around here.

463
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,670
Right.

464
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,360
Yeah...

465
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,200
You know, there's plenty of restaurants by this side of the Meguro River.

466
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,580
Right, right...
You know, there's plenty of restaurants by this side of the Meguro River.

467
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:52,870
Right, right...

468
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,940
And I've heard there's a lot of famous people around there.
Right, right...

469
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,570
And I've heard there's a lot of famous people around there.

470
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,460
Oh, really?
And I've heard there's a lot of famous people around there.

471
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,440
And I've heard there's a lot of famous people around there.

472
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,570
But it's still early.

473
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,800
-Right...
-It's still only 4-5 p.m.

474
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,980
It's about to start.

475
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:04,870
Right.

476
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,340
What are you guys eating?

477
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,400
-Looks delicious!
-What a cute couple!

478
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,700
Are you in high-school?

479
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,320
We're in third-years in middle-school.

480
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,520
Middle-school!
We're in third-years in middle-school.

481
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,360
Middle-school!

482
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,250
Oh my...

483
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,600
That must be their first date!

484
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,910
How do you know that?!

485
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:18,880
Stop making stuff up!

486
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,570
Yeah, don't do that!
Stop making stuff up!

487
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,270
Yeah, don't do that!

488
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,210
Do you think someone's playing Pachinko?

489
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,770
I don't think they would play Pachinko...

490
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,090
Pachinko?
I don't think they would play Pachinko...

491
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,900
Pachinko?

492
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,840
One of you, go have a look.

493
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,150
-I'll go then.
-Sure.

494
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,700
-Tanaka, go have a look.
-I'll be back.

495
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,610
Is he gonna find something?

496
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,170
Tanaka will be searching the inside of this Pachinko parlor alone.

497
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,900
-Finding someone playing Pachinko would be so funny.
-That's so true!!

498
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,530
Who would be the funniest?

499
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,690
How about Tamao Nakamura?

500
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,100
Right, she does like Pachinko.

501
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,190
Akko! (Akiko Wada)

502
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,120
She also loves playing.

503
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,350
There's a chance...
She really does love it.

504
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,190
Tanaka has been searching the inside of the parlor, but what has he come up with?

505
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,690
No one was in there.

506
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,880
-Really?
-Yeah.

507
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,110
Tamao wasn't there?

508
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,030
She wasn't.

509
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,980
Actually, I was also thinking of her.

510
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,200
I was like, "I wonder if Tamao is here".

511
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,640
Let's go then.
I was like, "I wonder if Tamao is here".

512
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:08,920
Let's go then.

513
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,430
-Yes.
-Yeah.

514
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,430
-The camera man that followed you inside said he saw someone.
-What?!

515
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:13,980
-Who?
-Who?

516
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,300
-Huh?
-Who?

517
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,220
Just now?

518
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,070
Come on man! Go have a good look!

519
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,560
What?! Hold on!

520
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,450
-Are you serious?
-Huh?

521
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,410
Was it a celebrity?
-A celebrity?

522
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes, but I don't know his name.

523
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,800
Hold on...

524
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,580
Come on, man!!

525
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,450
Are you serious?!

526
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,120
For real?!

527
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,800
Yama, go with him!

528
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,010
It's only been 8 minutes since they parted ways with Hinagata.

529
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,160
Have they found another famous person?!

530
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,950
-Look!
-There!

531
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,370
Who?! Who is it?!

532
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,410
What?!

533
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,640
Come!

534
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:47,880
Come here!

535
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,700
-What?! Are you serious?
-Look! Look! Look!

536
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,290
You're kidding me!

537
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,520
Who is this celebrity at the Pachinko parlor?!

538
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,140
What?!

539
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,350
Come!

540
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,730
Come here!

541
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,460
-What?! Are you serious?
-Look! Look! Look!

542
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,100
You're kidding me!

543
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,960
Are you serious?!

544
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,850
For real?!

545
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,900
No way, no way!

546
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,410
What's up!

547
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,200
Let's go, over there.

548
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,760
What?!

549
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,750
What are you doing there?!

550
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,390
This is your off time, right?!

551
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,550
Yes, it's my day off.

552
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,120
Alright! Let's go!

553
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,170
Sorry to bother you.

554
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,680
Can you be on our show?
We have to contact your agency.

555
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,920
Of course.

556
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,670
-They won't refuse as long as it comes from you, Hamada-san.
-No way! No way!

557
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,980
-Then we'll contact your agency.
-Alright.

558
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,450
This is amazing! What are you guys doing?

559
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,280
What were you doing today?

560
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,160
-Well, I am on my off day...
-Right...

561
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,260
Yeah... And I was playing some Pachinko...

562
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,830
Pachinko?
Yeah... And I was playing some Pachinko...

563
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,850
Yeah... And I was playing some Pachinko...

564
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,070
How long have you been here?

565
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,540
About 2 hours.

566
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,280
Have you been making money?

567
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,490
-Just a little bit.
-Right.

568
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,120
-Did we catch you right as you were about to win?
-Yeah.

569
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,010
That's too bad.

570
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,910
I mean, I don't get to come here often.

571
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,720
I'm so glad.

572
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:58,910
I just finished playing.
I'm so glad.

573
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,330
I just finished playing.

574
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,810
Do you come here often?

575
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:02,930
Yes, I do.
Do you come here often?

576
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:03,820
Yes, I do.

577
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,070
Your house is over there, isn't it?

578
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,410
Yes, it's pretty close by.

579
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,320
-I see.
-I see.

580
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,970
I've run into a lot of people around here.

581
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,040
-Oh, is that so?
-Yeah.

582
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,020
-In your own time?
-Yes.

583
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,320
Like, Maki Carrousel.

584
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,380
She's coming such a long way!

585
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,390
I wanna run into her!

586
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,050
Right? I wanna meet her too!

587
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,380
Who else?
Right? I wanna meet her too!

588
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,860
Well... Masato Hagiwara.
Right? I wanna meet her too!

589
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,900
Well... Masato Hagiwara.

590
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,550
-Oh!
-Right, right!

591
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,510
Hamada, do you know his name?

592
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,000
Of course I know his full name.

593
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,310
Let's go on three.

594
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,240
Alright.

595
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,480
One, two...

596
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,320
Masaya Nakamura.

597
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,350
Thank you.

598
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,720
Alright.

599
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,540
Of course we know him.

600
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,520
-We're just checking with your agency, we'll use the footage if we get the okay from them.
-Sure.

601
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:35,930
Alright, sorry about that.
-We're just checking with your agency, we'll use the footage if we get the okay from them.
-Sure.

602
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,340
Alright, sorry about that.

603
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,400
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

604
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,050
Thanks!

605
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,100
Hang in there!

606
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,620
Thank you!

607
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,080
Hope you win the big bucks!
Thank you!

608
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,520
Hope you win the big bucks!

609
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,080
Just like with Hinagata, we couldn't get through to Masaya Nakamura's agent.

610
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,650
The guys will head forward toward the Meguro River in search for their next celebrity.

611
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,060
Let's avoid the train station.

612
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,130
We might run into 10 more people later at night.
Let's avoid the train station.

613
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,370
We might run into 10 more people later at night.

614
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,620
At this rate?
You might be right.

615
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,160
We can make a special.

616
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,120
A special?

617
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,500
I can't believe Masaya was at that place.

618
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:04,880
It's amazing.

619
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,040
It was incredible.

620
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,090
But I guess, celebrities... Right...

621
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,530
I mean, a lot of them like playing Pachinko.

622
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,430
-You're right.
-But is it normal to play like that?

623
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,500
-There might be someone doing some shopping inside that store too.
-Probably...

624
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:18,890
For real...

625
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,530
But you know, supermarkets are Yama's specialty!

626
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,160
My specialty?

627
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,800
It was like that last time!

628
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,280
That's true.

629
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,940
I was just cooling off last time.

630
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,550
I knew it.

631
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,940
Look at this trendy joint.

632
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,610
It's very fancy.

633
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,570
That's where the gym is.

634
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:36,580
-Oh, Hiromi's gym?
-Is that so?
That's where the gym is.

635
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,590
-Oh, Hiromi's gym?
-Is that so?

636
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,600
Is that so?

637
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,420
And Masaya's place is just down there.

638
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,170
Hmm...

639
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,170
At this hour... Is it around 5 p.m. now?

640
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,480
5, huh?

641
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,430
I feel like they could be anywhere around here.

642
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,200
But this is definitely better than Daikanyama.

643
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,240
Of course.

644
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,860
It's completely different.

645
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,640
Matsumoto was the one vouching for Daikanyama.
It's completely different.

646
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,190
Matsumoto was the one vouching for Daikanyama.

647
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,620
He said all the celebs hang out at Daikanyama.

648
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:00,970
Right...
He said all the celebs hang out at Daikanyama.

649
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,470
Right...

650
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,150
But I didn't find anyone.

651
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,950
While all of us were secretly thinking Nakameguro was the place to be.

652
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,240
But we couldn't say anything.

653
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,320
We were overwhelmed by his presence.

654
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,520
Ah... Damn it...

655
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,760
The Meguro River was empty!

656
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,830
Once again, the guys head back to Don Quixote.

657
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,200
Alright, we're back.

658
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,340
We have arrived at Nakameguro's promised land.

659
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,560
We walked for ages... But we're finally here.

660
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,110
The place all of you so admire, Don Quixote.

661
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,500
-We're bound to find something.
-And there's bound to be someone, since it's just before dinner.
-Definitely.

662
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,000
-We've come back.
-Yes!!

663
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,020
Look, that's crazy!

664
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,460
There's already tons of people inside.

665
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,350
Wasn't that quick?

666
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,270
Ah! Who's that?

667
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,040
Let's hang around here.

668
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,310
See? Hamada?

669
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,070
See? I told you.

670
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:52,720
Huh?

671
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,440
Wasn't that quick?

672
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,400
What do you mean by "see?"?

673
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,100
We still haven't seen anyone.

674
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,320
Have they found a famous person right at Don Quixote's front door?!

675
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,660
No way, we don't know her name.

676
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,760
Could I talk to you for a minute?

677
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,370
Ehm...

678
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,840
Are you in the entertainment business?

679
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,650
No, not at all.

680
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,230
Oh, you're not?

681
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:11,550
Are you normal...?
Oh, you're not?

682
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:11,830
Are you normal...?

683
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,300
Do you have a normal job?
Are you normal...?

684
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,600
Do you have a normal job?

685
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,040
Oh, I see...

686
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,560
-Sorry to bother you.
-If the camera wasn't there, Tanaka would be just a dude hitting on that girl.
Oh, I see...

687
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,140
-Sorry to bother you.
-If the camera wasn't there, Tanaka would be just a dude hitting on that girl.

688
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,360
She said she didn't work in the entertainment industry.

689
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,050
Right...

690
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,710
-An normal person?
-Yes.

691
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,030
Completely?

692
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,320
Yes.

693
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,760
I'm sorry.

694
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:27,920
She was so annoyed.
I'm sorry.

695
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,110
She was so annoyed.

696
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,940
Did she tell you off?

697
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,830
Although they came up empty, the boys' spirits are up.

698
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,850
Huh? Are you famous?

699
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,550
I'm not.

700
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,600
-You're not?
-Huh? You're not?

701
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,350
See? Look at all the people.

702
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,300
You can ask anyone, "Are you famous? Are you famous?".

703
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,050
You're right.

704
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,690
But we're just asking, aren't we?

705
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,380
She wasn't famous, was she?

706
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,450
Will they run into a famous person?

707
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,540
Look.

708
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,660
Huh? Ah! Ah!

709
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,330
Look!

710
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,580
I remember! I remember!

711
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:05,800
Look!

712
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,320
Hamada-san!

713
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,260
You go.

714
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,880
Nice to see you!

715
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,080
I know him, I know him.

716
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,420
Can you talk for a moment?

717
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,230
Ah! I remember! I remember!

718
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,180
I remember! I remember!

719
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,480
We're so close.

720
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,300
I forgot, but now I remember his name.

721
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,590
I know, I know, I know.

722
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,510
It's nice to see you.

723
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,240
You too.

724
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
By the way, are you on your off time?

725
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,040
Yes, I am.

726
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,930
Ehm... I just stopped by to get some hair products.

727
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,020
-Oh, you came to get some hair products?
-Yeah.

728
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,010
Alright!

729
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,510
We did it! We did it!

730
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,920
Awesome! Awesome!

731
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,370
We did it.

732
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:37,940
Amazing!

733
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,160
We're doing Gaki No Tsukai Arahende today.

734
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,430
Oh, really?
We're doing Gaki No Tsukai Arahende today.

735
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:40,830
Oh, really?

736
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,670
Amazing!

737
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,380
Please check with his agency.

738
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,110
-Do you know his name?
-Of course.

739
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,470
One, two...

740
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,760
Mandy Sekiguchi.

741
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,380
-Thanks you!
-Thanks!

742
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,500
By the way, have you seen any other famous people around?

743
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,200
Oh...

744
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,600
I just came out of the hairdresser and as I was walking out...

745
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,060
-I saw the slapper, Chono, from "God damn!".
-Huh?!

746
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,030
What?!

747
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,680
I wanna see him!

748
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,430
Let's stop!
No way! No way!

749
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,330
-Let's go search for him!
-No way! No way!

750
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,920
-No, no, no, no...
-Chono, huh?

751
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,100
-It was down at Omotesando.
-Omotesando?

752
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,500
Really?
-It was down at Omotesando.
-Omotesando?

753
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,010
Really?

754
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,280
Omotesando!

755
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,640
Omotesando?

756
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,340
Over there?

757
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,230
Ah... I'm so glad.

758
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,220
He was apparently going to Gold's Gym.

759
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,730
-I see...
-Oh, I see...

760
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:27,850
We got through to Mandy Sekiguchi's agency immediately and got their confirmation!

761
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,960
After that, we also got the approval of Akiko Hinagata and Masaya Nakamura's agencies.

762
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,180
Everyone, thank you!!

763
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,140
With that being said, the guys walked a total of 1 km and 868 m.

764
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,000
With a total time of 1 hour and 38 minutes.
It was a complete success!!

765
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,080
Where are we going next time?

766
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,820
We can just leave that up to Matsumoto.

767
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,900
He'll have to go alone.

768
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,680
Alone? That'd be great!

769
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:55,880
He said he wanted revenge but didn't show up today.
Alone? That'd be great!

770
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,100
He said he wanted revenge but didn't show up today.

771
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,530
Next time we'll force him to go alone.

772
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,640
He'll have to go to Kamata or somewhere like that.

773
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,160
Where there are no celebrities.

774
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,310
Great idea!
