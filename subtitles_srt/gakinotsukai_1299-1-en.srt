1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,940
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,480
Hollywood Zakoshisho Shichi Henge!

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,280
Here it comes again

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,730
Although Hamada is not into it at all

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,780
You are the one who said that

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,780
Oh, is it?

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,000
But we've had it up to here

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,980
It's been 8 months since the last challenger Tamura Kenji

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,260
The 45th challenger after Tamura Kenji

10
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,260
And I think this challenger and Tamuken

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,250
Are Douki (debuted at the same time), right?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,840
What about Cocorico?

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,230
We count as Douki

14
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,840
And Yamasaki is junior, right?

15
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,840
No, I'm not

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,200
I'm the senpai.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,360
Let's welcome today's protagonist, Hollywood Zakoshisyoh

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,540
Thanks for having me

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,780
You don't like this kind of gag?

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,350
When Hamada-san doesn't know how to entangle with you, he will not entangle with you at all

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,190
It was only until recently that he started to entangle with Lytton Chousadan

22
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,880
Oh, I see, I see, no wonder why

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,240
What do you mean "no wonder why", dude

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,990
Because I am Lytton-ish too

25
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,820
Which position are you aiming for?

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,080
Your name will be smaller if you don't get a high rank

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,140
Well, for me, it's probably either here or there

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,120
It must be one of these two, here or there

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,950
Dude, it's cunning to say that

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,550
Even if I try to put in a Tsukommi

31
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,790
I feel I like I'm going to bomb too

32
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,600
And if I ignore it

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,960
"Huh? Matsumoto can't handle this?"

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,970
That's not what I meant, that's not

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,630
Well, so you just have to aim high

36
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,820
Many of my colleagues are here too, so

37
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,680
I want to at least win Kenkoba and Tamuken

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,920
Tamuken's ranking is quite low, huh?

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,710
Why did you quit Yoshimoto, when there's so many Douki?

40
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,090
Well, actually, when Yoshimoto closed down Nichome Theater

41
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,160
They said to me "you are fired too"

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,180
So, as usual, what should we do for the next episode?

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,100
Let's decide the theme

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,910
I wonder what does the first line means?

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,910
Here comes Spring! Let's look for Matsumoto's favourite tank top!!

46
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,420
The tank top that suits you best

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,480
They are definitely making fun of you

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,420
Okay, well, I see

49
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,700
So I became someone that they can make fun of, huh?

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,580
It's not a bad thing to become a broad-minded person though

51
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,840
It's a good thing, honestly, it's a good thing

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,320
*Sakata-shisho's nickname is "Sakata the idiot"

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,320
We should aim to be like Sakata-shisho, right?***

54
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Even the juniors can make fun of him

55
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,740
He's the god of Owarai, Sakata-shisho

56
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,220
Hamada should be like him too

57
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,020
So our duo can become double Sakata

58
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,790
It's incredible to have double idiots, right?

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,320
It's so much fun to have a after-party, right? So much fun

60
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,680
It's really nice to have these parties after doing live performances, it's just so much fun

61
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,180
Huh? What?

62
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,150
The party is ending? Eh?

63
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,700
It's ending already?

64
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,150
I just arrived!

65
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,900
And it's ending already? Come on, what do you mean it's ending?

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,440
3,000 yen? Eh? 3,000 yen?

67
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,240
I need to pay 3,000 yen?

68
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,440
I was here for 30 minutes only, and I need to pay 3,000 yen?

69
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
That's so expensive, isn't it?

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,300
I'll pay it

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,030
I didn't say I won't pay it

72
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,030
I'll pay it

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
I didn't say I won't pay it, I'll pay it

74
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,620
I didn't say I won't pay it, I'll pay it

75
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,620
I'll pay it

76
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,820
I didn't say I won't pay it

77
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,460
All I said was it's so expensive to pay 3,000 yen for 30 minutes

78
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,940
Expens...but I'll freaking pay it

79
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,260
I'll pay it

80
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,520
It's so expensive to pay 3,000 yen for 30 minutes, isn't it?

81
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,760
After-par...but I'll freaking pay it

82
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,020
I'll pay it...30 minu...I'll pay it

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,100
It's so expensive to pay 3,000 yen for 30 minutes

84
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
I'll freaking pay it

85
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,800
3,000 yen for 30 minutes is definitely...

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I'll freaking pay it

87
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,160
I'll pay it, I'll pay it, I'll pay it

88
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
I'll freaking pay it

89
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,700
3,000 yen is just...

90
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,200
Expens...but I'll freaking pay it

91
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,260
I'll pay it, I'll pay it, I'll freaking pay it

92
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,360
That was an amazing voice he had.

93
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,540
The volume of his voice is amazing

94
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,000
What the heck is going on with that voice volume

95
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,430
Hey, no, no, no, Matsumoto-san

96
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,200
Don't try to muddle through

97
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,280
Well, yeah, I laughed

98
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,500
But, well, he's really persistent

99
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,120
He almost got me when he came back and took a seat

100
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,840
"The anger of our Tanaka! Storm in Shukan Bunshun (news magazine)!!"

101
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Hahh...I really dislike it...hahh...

102
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,350
Recently...you know...recently...

103
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,550
At places like Shibuya...

104
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,300
Those young people...

105
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:23,060
Always wear their pants below the waist, right? They call that sagging or something?

106
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,500
That's really pissing me off, you understand me?

107
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,960
After all, if you are a man, you should wear your pants...

108
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,800
Above the waist!!!

109
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:47,050
After all, if you are a man, you should wear your pants...

110
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:56,050
Above the waist!!!

111
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,450
After all...

112
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,600
If you are a man, you should wear your pants...

113
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:21,880
Above the waist!!!

114
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,020
After all, if you are a man

115
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,560
You should wear your pants...above the waist!!!

116
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,340
After all...after all...

117
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
Just leave, dude

118
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,720
That guy is so persistent!

119
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,580
Tanaka, you (laughed) so quickly!

120
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,610
He's going all out for each of his gags

121
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,760
There's still 5 more to go, can he make it?

122
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,580
Sorry for keeping you waiting

123
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,620
We shall start the 60 minutes one-point match

124
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,720
The red corner, 210 pounds

125
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Tigerrrrrrr Maskkkkkkk!!!

126
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
He's pissing me off

127
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,620
He's seriously pissing me off

128
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,620
What are you even doing?

129
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,800
That's enough already.

130
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,000
That's enough, honestly, that's enough

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,160
This is a waste of time

132
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,180
What the heck? He's doing nothing

133
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,820
What the hell's up with that guy?

134
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,500
He did absolutely nothing, but it got many of us, huh?

135
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,200
He's just behaving like a XXXXX

136
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,590
He won't leave until you pay up, that's what he's trying to do

137
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,780
He'll go round and round until you pay up

138
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,040
What's this about Hamada-san?

139
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,840
The journey to meet Hamada's favorite omelette rice!!

140
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,840
To meet his favorite omelette rice

141
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,840
Why omelette rice?

142
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,300
Because they think Hamada-san likes it, right?

143
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,060
But I'm not really that into omelette rice though

144
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,570
He likes ketchup

145
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,520
Oh, really? You like tomatoes?

146
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,630
But he hates tomatoes

147
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,320
I hate tomatoes, but ketchup is good...

148
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,290
We've been working together for so long

149
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,560
And yet you know nothing about Hamada

150
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,560
Did you guys even know he likes ketchup?

151
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,170
Yes, we know that

152
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,170
No way, you must be lying!

153
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,900
All you know is (that he likes) Yakisoba!!

154
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,900
You're so mean

155
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,520
He can even eat a mini car with ketchup on it

156
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,220
Why the heck, dude!

157
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:45,700
♫Bakufu Slump
Runner♫

158
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,080
Is that it?

159
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:13,280
*The singer of this song, Sunplaza Nakano-kun, is known for his trademark bald head, suit style and especially dark sunglasses

160
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,940
That's enough

161
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,140
That's it. Matsumoto-san.

162
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,340
Well yeah, I somehow laughed

163
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,630
He's always moving

164
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,180
I wonder if he can stick it out

165
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,900
Here it is.

166
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,500
Hello everybody, hello

167
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,440
I'm sorry for being remiss in not introducing myself

168
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,940
My name is...

169
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,840
*Furuhata Ninzaburo is a police detective drama, and was one of the most popular television dramas in the history of Japanese television

170
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,840
Huruhata (Ninzaburo)

171
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,340
I heard that an incident has happened, so please allow me some time to investigate

172
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:57,520
-Huruhata speaks in a halting, mumbling tone and hums while thinking.
-Huruhata has odd "tics", like poking his forehead with his forefinger when thinking.
-Huruhata always thinks aloud in a distracted, stream of consciousness manner.

173
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,520
*Huruhata always say "I know that feeling" to suspects

174
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,520
I know that feeling*

175
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
I know that feeling

176
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,660
I know that feeling

177
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,200
SAFE

178
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,830
It's unbelievable that he bombed out on his most famous gag

179
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,700
One of his most well-known gags

180
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,640
Endo Chiaki...........

181
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,740
Endo vs Chiaki's remarriage partner! Head-to-head Sumo battle!!

182
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,740
You two remarried almost at the same time

183
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,120
Well, yeah, within just half a year

184
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,080
And they ask you to...

185
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,210
Endo vs Chiaki's remarriage partner! Head-to-head Sumo battle!!

186
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,210
Do a Nipple Sumo

187
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,210
Not a nipple sumo, the word nipple never appeared

188
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,420
All it said is head-to-head sumo, not nipple

189
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:35,560
♫Mr.Children
Shirushi♫

190
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,020
I am...

191
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,080
Sakurai from Mr.Children

192
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,020
Sorry, sorry, please excuse me

193
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,020
I'm Sakurai from Mr.Children

194
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,600
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm a bit too excited

195
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,960
I'm just so happy to see so many people here today

196
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,340
Let's take a look from this side first

197
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,240
A beautiful girl here

198
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,420
And here's another beautiful girl

199
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,420
And then...skip this person

200
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,240
And here's another beautiful girl

201
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,640
But remember to skip that person

202
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,280
That's all from me, Sakurai

203
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,840
Last one.

204
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,940
This is Zakoshisho...

205
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,010
At his best

206
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,900
And it didn't take long

207
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,600
Yeah, it didn't

208
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,900
For him to prepare

209
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,750
He's coming out immediately

210
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,380
That kind of person could actually be very earnest in real life

211
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,000
"I can't let them wait, that's impolite"

212
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,440
Are you guys still doing it?

213
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,640
Well, well, it's about time

214
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,220
It's about time to take a bath

215
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,280
I just want to take a bath here, please excuse me

216
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,860
Please let me take bath here

217
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:59,340
I need get changed before taking a bath

218
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,880
I'm really sensitive to the cold

219
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,380
Okay, okay, I'm going to take a bath now

220
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:37,000
AHHHHHHH HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT

221
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's too hot, dude

222
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,610
It's too hot

223
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:48,580
I'll have a Kanpu Masatsu (rubdown with a rough towel) instead

224
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,750
The temperature should be just right now

225
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,210
Arghh...arghhh...too hot...

226
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,680
Kanpu Masatsu again, I need a Kanpu Masatsu again

227
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,140
Arghh...I'm so tired

228
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,760
ARGHHHH...SO HOT...

229
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,640
Ah...starting to feel good

230
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,360
What was up with that face?

231
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,490
His face look different

232
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,440
Good work

233
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,600
Good work

234
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,360
I laughed for 6 times

235
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,360
Really? Really?

236
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,420
The only one that I didn't laugh was...

237
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,940
Your most well-known gag, Huruhata

238
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,310
I did that for the audience

239
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,180
Do it just in case

240
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:14,460
No one was laughing when I'm performing, so I was actually terrified

241
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,190
But well, that was quite a lot

242
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,190
27,000 yen (about $270)

243
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,810
Tied with Waraimeshi Nishda (episode #945)
and Kimura Yuichi (episode #597).

244
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,100
It's a tie for 29th place.

245
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,720
You won Tamura (Kenji)

246
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,360
That Sakurai one was quite interesting, but no one else laughed...

247
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,360
Oh, really?

248
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,080
I laughed too, that got me

249
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,080
That's definitely not how Sakurai will behave like, right?

250
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,100
That's the Sakurai-san when he's talking nonsense like me
