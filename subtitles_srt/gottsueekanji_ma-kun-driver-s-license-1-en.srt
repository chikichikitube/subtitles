00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,680
Ma-kun!

4
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,380
Wait! Wait!

5
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,050
Give me a ride!

6
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,420
Huh

7
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,380
Give me a ride!

8
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,120
Are you an idiot?

9
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,220
Can't you give me a ride to the train station?

10
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,050
Just walk!

11
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,060
I'm just asking for a little favor!

12
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,660
It's just nearby!

13
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,130
You're so irritating!

14
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,560
I can't help it! You know my bicycle was stolen!

15
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,930
That's why I can't ride

16
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,800
Take me there...

17
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,930
near the train station

18
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,000
You don't have...

19
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:23,640
What?

20
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,340
you know.. that... seat...

21
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,670
Life... belt!

22
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,210
What is that?

23
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,640
Life belt!

24
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,410
Oh, here it is!

25
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,580
You know how I feel about riding in cars, it's dangerous!

26
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,180
Why are you complaining to me?

27
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,320
Where's your sea... oh here?

28
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:38,680
Here?

29
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,020
Do you have your's on?

30
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,050
I don't need it

31
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,420
Wear it for my sake!

32
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,490
I don't need it

33
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,220
Wear it, don't talk like that

34
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,190
It's scary if you don't wear it

35
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,360
Like you know... that...

36
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,330
That...

37
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,330
Boiled egg...

38
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,730
Raw egg... smashed!

39
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,540
What are you talking about?

40
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,770
If you don't wear it... YOU WILL BECOME
LIKE THAT RAW EGG!!

41
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,440
Seat!

42
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,480
Ok, already!

43
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,710
Let's go!

44
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
Where are we going?!

45
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,650
What?

46
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,650
Where?
The train station

47
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,290
Why don't you just walk!

48
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,020
That's ok, just do me this favor!
It's like we are both on...

49
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,530
the Chuo freeway!

50
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,260
What are you talking about?

51
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,890
Hurry, let's go

52
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,600
Hey! Watch your speed!!

53
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,570
I know! Irritating!

54
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,130
Shut up!

55
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,300
Watch your speed!!

56
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,240
I'm not speeding!

57
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,210
You have to use your signal when turning!

58
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,470
I know... don't touch!

59
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,040
Hurry, use it!

60
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,810
What are you doing!?

61
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,340
Hey! What was that?

62
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,340
You touched it!

63
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,050
Hurry up! Turn it on!

64
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,110
I KNOW!! SHUT UP!!

65
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,380
Make sure you use it!

66
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,380
Yea! Are you an idiot?!

67
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,090
I'm gonna kick you out!

68
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,250
Oh you...

69
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,490
What are you touching!!

70
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,660
What?

71
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,260
I can't see behind!

72
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,060
What?

73
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,360
I can't see the behind!

74
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,160
STOP!

75
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,760
What??

76
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,760
STOP!

77
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,400
What is it?!!

78
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,100
Itao-san!

79
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Here, here!

80
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,100
Where are you going?

81
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,840
Oh, Mrs!

82
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,280
Oh you're driving! Wow!

83
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,410
Who's car is this?

84
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,250
Ma-kun borrowed it from his friend

85
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,250
Wow!

86
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,320
It's so scary to be in a car

87
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,460
C.. can we ride?

88
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,490
Sure!

89
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,790
Shut up!

90
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,660
Where are you going?

91
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,590
Home

92
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,460
Oh, you're going home?

93
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,460
We just came from s...school

94
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,370
Get in!

95
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,370
What are you doing?

96
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,800
Why do I have to give them a ride?

97
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,340
Are you an idiot?

98
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,610
He said it's fine!

99
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,580
Oh it's ok?

100
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
Is it really ok?

101
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,580
Really?

102
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,910
It's fun...

103
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,380
with more people, it's fun

104
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
How does this work Ma-kun?

105
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,420
HOW MA-KUN?!

106
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,260
What?

107
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,860
MOVE THE SEAT FORWARD!

108
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,370
Sorry you have to sit in the back

109
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,130
Ok, let's ride

110
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,000
Sorry to bother you

111
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,410
It's a little cramped

112
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,940
Sorry, it's a little cramped

113
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,280
It's good to ride

114
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Ah, I'm getting a sunburn

115
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,510
Sorry! Sorry!

116
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,880
Sorry Mrs, please move down

117
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,520
Ok, where to first?

118
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,490
Tell him

119
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,850
Ok, me first

120
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,120
Tondabayashi

121
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,790
You know Nishimeihan?

122
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,790
Near Fujiidera

123
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,800
yea, near Fujiidera

124
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,130
Mrs, is it ok to smoke?

125
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,130
Sure, that's fine

126
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,640
What are you saying?

127
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,500
Oh, it's hot

128
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Yes, let's go, it's hot

129
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,940
Oh, it's so hot!

130
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,940
Where's your ashtray?

131
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,080
Mrs, ashtray?

132
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,650
Ma-kun where's the ashtray?

133
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,650
Don't drop your ashes in someone else's car!

134
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,420
Here, use this

135
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,820
Hey, why did you take it out!?

136
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,490
Do you have air condition?

137
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,700
Ma-kun where's the air condition?

138
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,500
What?

139
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,060
Air con!

140
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,930
It's there!

141
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,830
This one?

142
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,400
No! That's not it!

143
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,200
It's this one

144
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,810
It was scary today

145
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,540
This one right?

146
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,010
Ah, it feels good!

147
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,780
I don't understand these mechanical things!

148
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,220
I know what this is

149
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,690
When I press this, it will become cooler

150
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,620
HEY! WHAT IS THIS?

151
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,560
We'll be crushed!
