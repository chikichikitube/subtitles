00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,570
10th Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!
Can we all be on the same page?
Let's rendezvous without using your smartphones!!

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,770
Thanks!

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,610
Last time we were together the whole time.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,680
Didn't you guys purposely avoid meeting up with us?

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,650
Come to the place properly!
You know where to go when you see a theme, right?

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,690
- Tanaka, they know you're doing it on purpose.
- What the hell!

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,490
Here are the results so far.

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,430
I'm great, after all.

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,490
I knew you were terrible.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,800
- I know I'm terrible.
- I'd never met you on the first one.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:44,970
But last time, Hamada-san gave me the advice to go to the second place I thought of, not the first.

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,540
I took that ad..Nvice and....

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,880
"Advance"?

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,310
- Did you say advance?
- That's enough.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,020
Let's rendezvous without using your smartphones!

16
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:01,290
The rule is that each person goes to the place they imagine from the theme presented, and if everyone can meet up, it's finished.

17
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:09,260
Usually this is a five-person segment, but this time they will add a guest to the challenge.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,030
This person is the guest!
please come here!

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,600
Hi!

20
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,610
- This is going to be difficult.
- Yeah!

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,040
- Is it?
- Because there will be one more person.

22
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,680
- Do you know about this segment?
- Of course, this is a very popular segment.

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,620
- Are you confident about it?
- I have lived in Tokyo for about 18 years.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,860
- You are like a Tokyoite.
- I am more than happy to be invited to a decent segment.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,060
What kind of segments are not decent?

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,400
I am always invited to Big Dog Contests and other crazy segments.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,960
That's a decent segment!

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,270
That's crazy!

29
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,140
Here's the first theme!

30
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,770
Historical buildings.

31
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,140
This is a very wide range.

32
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,050
The definition of "historic" is difficult.

33
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,420
- Hamada's house is also a historic building in a sense.
- What the hell!

34
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,120
- Do you live in such an old building?
- What the hell!

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,420
It's 8 bedrooms.

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,290
"8 bedrooms"!?

37
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,620
And there's no bathroom.

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,660
It's a strange house.

39
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:17,800
[Subbed by RAIDEN1017]

40
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,540
At 1:00 p.m. they left Nippon TV in Minato-ku, Tokyo.

41
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,550
What is the strategy of the top in terms of meet-up rate?

42
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,550
They are idiots.

43
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,460
So I have to adapt to their ideas.

44
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,690
Otherwise, I would not be able to meet them.

45
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:52,670
Yes, the shortcut to meeting up is to adapt to the ideas of other members, not just your own.

46
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,110
Zojoji Temple, which I visited last time, is also a good example.

47
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,610
- Are train stations also historical buildings?
- Tokyo Station is a case in point.

48
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,850
Matsumoto reaffirmed the definition of a historical building.

49
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,990
Meanwhile, Hamada had something he definitely wanted to avoid.

50
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,060
Anyway, I don't want to meet my buddy on the first one

51
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,800
Hi.

52
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:33,140
Last time, Hamada met up with Matsumoto for the first theme.
He seems to have been traumatized by that.

53
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:44,120
The Tokyo Metropolitan Government selects historical buildings that have been built 50 years ago and are considered important in terms of landscape.

54
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,590
What do the members think is a historic building?

55
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,460
It's the National Diet Building, isn't it ?

56
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:04,040
Considering the distance from Shiodome, that is where they usually go.

57
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,240
- It is where the prime minister is.
- That's right.

58
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,480
Viewers would probably think that "Macchan is the most sane", everytime.

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,780
There is a possibility that about three people could meet.

60
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,520
- That's never happened before, right?
- Yes.

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,860
If you adapt to the thoughts of the other members, you will inevitably meet up with someone else.

62
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,230
- Do you have some options?
- Yeah.

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,830
I came up with two.

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:43,110
I know I' ve mentioned this a few times, but I used to go to the driving range at Gaien a lot.
Wasn't there something in the back there?

65
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,110
- The picture gallery?
- That's old, isn't it?

66
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,720
And,

67
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,690
*****.

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,620
That's old too.

69
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,420
The heads of state used to come there.

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,530
Where do heads of state gather?

71
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,000
Hamada-san likes the Diet Building, doesn't he?

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,300
Yeah, he parked his car in front of the Diet building

73
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,340
And stared at it, saying,
"Just you wait and see."

74
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,010
It's depressing when Hamada comes there, though.

75
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,420
Will Downtown duo meet again on the first theme?

76
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,420
And where will Housei, who currently lives in Kansai, go?

77
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,690
I came up with two. It's one of those.

78
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,400
Okay, let's go there.

79
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,900
I decided quickly.

80
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,400
But it's difficult.

81
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,400
He seems to have narrowed it down to two choices.

82
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,310
Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Sky Tree.

83
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:51,780
But Tokyo Sky Tree was built not long ago.

84
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,480
Tokyo Tower is a historical landmark.

85
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,690
I will go to Tokyo Tower.

86
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,320
He chose Tokyo Tower.

87
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,890
I lived in Tokyo when Tokyo Sky Tree was built.

88
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,330
It was built 10 years ago.

89
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,170
So I went to Osaka when Tokyo Sky Tree was built?
I have such memories.

90
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,070
The Tokyo Skytree was built because I left Tokyo.

91
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,280
I had that feeling at that time.

92
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,850
"I'll leave the rest to you."

93
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,950
But that's a bit ostentatious.
"Historical."

94
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,220
Do you think Endo understands that?

95
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,490
You're a bad guy.

96
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,930
When the theme was announced, he looked kind of complicated.

97
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,760
I don't think Endo knows what it's about.
Is he okay with it?

98
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,970
Does Endo really understand the themes?

99
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,140
The first is Tokyo Tower.

100
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,810
The second is Nippon Budokan.

101
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,450
There is the aspect that Tokyo Tower = Tokyo.

102
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:10,560
That one often appears in old monster movies.

103
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,700
The Nippon Budokan is a historical building.

104
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:21,770
Nippon TV has shot a 24-hour TV show at the Nippon Budokan.
Downtown hosted it in the past.

105
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,580
Endo was able to understand the theme.
Where did he choose?

106
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,810
Then please head to *****.

107
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,750
And where did the guest this time, Fujimoto, head?

108
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,490
I was very happy to be invited  to such a popular segment.

109
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,630
After the Big Dog Contest aired, a young guy came up to me and said, "Awoooooo!".

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,400
- You are completely teased.
- Yeah.

111
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,270
Where did Fujimoto, who has lived in Tokyo for 18 years, choose to go?

112
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,180
Akasaka Rikyu, the guest house, for example.

113
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,020
But the other one seems to draw more people.

114
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,690
*****.

115
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,960
After all, everyone uses that place.

116
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,000
What does Fujimoto mean by a place that everyone uses often?

117
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,970
*****.

118
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,830
Okay, we'll head there.

119
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:35,240
At this point, Matsumoto, Hamada,Housei, Endo, and Fujimoto are likely to meet someone.

120
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,380
The only one left is the troublemaker Tanaka.

121
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,220
Will he be able to clear his name of the past nine times?

122
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,720
The first thing that comes to mind is Tokyo Tower.

123
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,660
The second is the Budokan.

124
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,070
What a chance to meet up with Hosei or Endo, whichever he chooses!

125
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,800
But!

126
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,540
But I'd prefer something more solid.

127
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,210
Sorry for being vague, but I prefer something solid.

128
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,120
Suddenly he started saying "something solid.

129
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,120
What was the answer Tanaka came up with after much deliberation?

130
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,330
Then one came to mind.

131
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,000
*****.

132
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,900
***** has a very long history.

133
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,440
Please head to *****.

134
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,180
Where did Tanaka choose?

135
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,120
A great chance for all of them to meet up with someone on the first theme!
What will happen?

136
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,590
Let's rendezvous without using your smartphones!

137
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,900
Now everyone has a chance to meet up with someone!

138
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,970
We're in front of the Diet building right now.
If there are five of us here, we'll end up here.

139
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,840
There's a TV crew over there.

140
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,850
That's not Gaki's, isn't it?

141
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,650
That was close.

142
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,120
It's okay.

143
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,160
Okay, we're here.

144
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,260
Yanaoka, could you pretend to be an idiot once and ask the security guard if you can get into the building?

145
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,760
If I did that, I would be gone.

146
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,440
Matsumoto arrived at the Diet building.

147
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,450
The chances of him coming here are the highest.

148
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,920
Really? That would be a depressing.

149
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,060
At the same time, Housei arrived at Tokyo Tower.

150
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,530
I like the way it feels.

151
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,600
You still think this is awesome, don't you?

152
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,570
And the clouds are moving so fast!

153
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,810
The clouds are moving so fast!

154
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,380
He excitedly waited for the others.

155
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,510
We arrived.

156
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,850
Soon after, Endo arrived at his destination.

157
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,790
Where is that place?

158
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,160
Look,

159
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,290
It's the Nippon Budokan.

160
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:43,700
Endo went to the Nippon Budokan and did not meet up with Housei.

161
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,070
I don't want to be alone anymore.

162
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,770
Now we're here.

163
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,510
Where did Fujimoto come from?

164
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,850
Speaking of meeting up, it's Tokyo Station.

165
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,880
Tokyo Station.

166
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,190
You never know where they will appear from.

167
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,220
Don't leave me alone.

168
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,060
And Hamada, if he comes to the Diet building, he can meet up with Matsumoto.

169
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,470
Where did Hamada arrive?

170
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,480
- How old is this building?
- It's 113 years old.

171
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,280
Yeah, 113 years.

172
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,180
Akasaka Rikyu, the State Guest House.

173
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,450
He could not meet up with Matsumoto.

174
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,990
Did they go to the Diet building?

175
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Time's up!

176
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,400
They confirm their respective locations on the call.

177
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,530
Hello.

178
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,600
Enough of this!

179
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,200
By the way, where is Matsumoto-san?

180
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,210
Are you guys really stupid?

181
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,680
You guys should have come to the National Diet building!!

182
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,710
Come on.

183
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,150
I went through there.

184
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,020
I knew it.

185
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,720
That doesn't come to mind.

186
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,890
I've considered this.

187
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,330
- Endo, this was on your list of options?
- Yes.

188
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,030
If you didn't go to the National Diet Building, where did you go?

189
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,440
I came to the Nippon Budokan.

190
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,340
I see.

191
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,170
Oh, I forgot about that one.

192
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,810
Where was your second choice?

193
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,240
It's Tokyo Tower.

194
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,010
Can I talk for a second?

195
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,480
Don't talk!!

196
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,920
I'm here for Tokyo Tower.

197
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,620
I knew it!
You came to Tokyo Tower, Housei-san.

198
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,790
Tokyo Tower is too new.

199
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,260
Fujimon, where are you?

200
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,800
Don't you all remember that?

201
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,660
It's Tokyo Station.

202
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,530
Tokyo Station.
I know.

203
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,170
That was one of my options, too.

204
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,440
It might be true, but...

205
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,540
- Where is Hamada-san?
- CHAN-HAMA!

206
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,680
I'm in front of the Guest House.

207
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,210
That doesn't sound like you.

208
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,680
Hamada and the guest house don't go together at all!

209
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,430
I used to go by this area when I went to Nippon TV in Kojimachi by myself.

210
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,360
- I don't care about that.
- Don't say that.

211
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,830
Then, where is Tanaka?

212
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,000
Did Tanaka come to Ueno or something?

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,140
No, I'm in Nihonbashi, that bridge.

214
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,750
You better take care of your bridges with us than that!

215
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,780
A bridge between me and all of you?

216
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,250
Let's go to the next one!

217
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,760
Not a single person came here.

218
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,960
They were all scattered.
I'm relieved

219
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:04,200
I'm not wrong.
I said the guest house, didn't I?

220
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,770
Will Tanaka be able to meet up with someone?

221
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,410
50 minutes have passed since the start.
They have yet to meet anyone.

222
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,180
What's next?

223
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,450
Next.

224
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,780
What the hell is this.

225
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,420
I don't get it.

226
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,720
"Furniture store"?

227
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,630
One thing comes to mind. Is that still there?

228
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,560
Otsuka Furniture in *****.

229
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,710
Please head to Otsuka Furniture in *****.

230
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:52,150
I've been to Otsuka Furniture in *****.

231
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,320
Can they meet up at one of the several Otsuka Furniture locations in Tokyo?

232
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,490
The furniture store I usually use is Nitori.

233
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,160
Nitori also has many different stores.
Which store do you often go to?

234
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,500
I often go to the store in *****.

235
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,340
- Ah, that store on the corner over there?
- Yes, it is.

236
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:25,480
After I got divorced, I went there to buy beds and mattresses and stuff.

237
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,750
And dishes, too.

238
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,520
Nitori took care of me.

239
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,690
Let's not talk about these things.

240
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,860
Tanaka is a crook, and I'm not sure about Fujimon either.

241
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,270
I wanted Alice Hirose to come.

242
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,440
It' s fun when an actress comes.

243
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,310
I don't get excited when Fujimon comes.

244
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,310
Meanwhile, what about Hamada?

245
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,810
Isn't it Otsuka Furniture?

246
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,150
in Shinjuku.

247
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,620
There is a Cassina in Aoyama.

248
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,990
That place stands out too, doesn't it?

249
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,230
And then there's Nitori.

250
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,370
Fujimon will definitely go to Nitori.

251
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,840
He is likely to go there.

252
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,310
Hamada's prediction was right on the mark.

253
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,040
Which Nitori store did Fujimoto head to?

254
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,750
Here is their current location.

255
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,850
The area is narrowed down considerably, but where will they really go?

256
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,390
Will they be able to meet up?

257
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,120
The problem is still Tanaka.

258
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,030
How do we get Tanaka out of the regular members?

259
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,900
Let's go tell him that we're ending the show.

260
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,170
After all, that's especially difficult in the beginning.

261
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,040
That is why it makes sense for us to meet up with them.

262
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,050
Then, let's continue with Gaki as if nothing had happened.

263
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:14,860
And Tanaka would eventually notice that.
"Hey, this isn't over yet!"
But he won't tell us that.

264
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,530
He won't say to me or Hamada,
"Hey, why isn't it over yet?!"

265
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,800
Where did Tanaka, on the verge of being fired, choose to go?

266
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,540
How about IKEA?
Where is that?

267
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,380
Harajuku?
The Harajuku store is right in front of the station, right?

268
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,220
Let's go to Harajuku.

269
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,820
The answer Tanaka gave was IKEA Harajuku.

270
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,660
I'm in trouble.

271
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,400
And where did Matsumoto arrive?

272
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,140
Here?

273
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,780
Otsuka Furniture in Shinjuku.

274
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,490
Tanaka doesn't have to wait for someone, which is nice.

275
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,360
Who will be able to meet up with the others?

276
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,530
1 hour and 5 minutes after the start, a great chance for the members to meet up.

277
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,710
Matsumoto was waiting for the other members at Otsuka Furniture in Shinjuku.

278
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,180
Then...

279
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,180
Matsumoto-san, Matsumoto-san, Matsumoto-san,

280
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,710
Oh, what a surprise!

281
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,350
This is the only place, right?!

282
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,450
This was the only place I could come up with.

283
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:56,020
- 'm expecting about four of us to be here.
- I think this is an easy theme for us.

284
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,360
Anybody come here?

285
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,000
Good!

286
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,700
This is fantastic!

287
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,740
This is the only place, right?

288
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,470
- Can you think of any other place?
- No, speaking of furniture...

289
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,910
it's Otsuka Furniture in Shinjuku.

290
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,710
The three of them were able to meet up with each other splendidly.

291
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,820
Where did Hamada arrive with Otsuka Furniture as an option?

292
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,090
This is where today's young guys would come.

293
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,700
Fujimoto chose Nitori, and this was his chance to meet up with Hamada.

294
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,970
Well, here we are.

295
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,570
What will happen?

296
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,950
Is somebody there?

297
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,150
Nobody's here.

298
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:02,690
Fujimoto chose at Nitori in Nakameguro.
He couldn't meet up with Hamada.

299
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,160
Meanwhile, what about Tanaka?

300
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,470
You can see the furniture from outside.
There is no doubt here.

301
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,440
He arrived at IKEA Harajuku.

302
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,170
Time's up.

303
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,180
Did you meet someone?

304
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,550
We are now the Matsumoto Team.

305
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,820
Yamazaki and Endo are here.
There are three of us!

306
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:38,530
We are at Otsuka Furniture in Shinjuku.
Where else but here?!

307
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,460
I knew it!

308
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,230
They're all freaked out by us.

309
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,970
What did you say?

310
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,240
I first came up with Otsuka Furniture in Shinjuku.

311
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,440
Then why didn't you come here?

312
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:01,780
- But in these days, everyone buys at Nitori, don't they?
- You don't have to think about the these days.

313
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,920
Don't think you're right because you have more people!!

314
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,590
I'm scared!

315
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,060
Where is the Nitori where you are, Hamada-san?

316
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,030
- I'm at Nitori in Shibuya.
- Why did you go to that store?

317
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,000
- It's so big!
- I know that place, but I've never been there.

318
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,230
Where's Fujimon?

319
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,770
I'm at the Nakameguro store.

320
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,470
Ah, I know Nakameguro store.

321
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,270
Nitori in Nakameguro?

322
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,440
Fujimon is standing on stage at Shinjuku Lumine, right?

323
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,340
This is your neighborhood, you know.

324
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,350
You're doing all those hero show skits at Lumine, aren't you?

325
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,510
Shut up!

326
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,220
Where is Tanaka?

327
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,450
I'm at IKEA in front of Harajuku Station.

328
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,690
- Huh?
- Where's that place?

329
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,420
That store!

330
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,630
A short time ago...

331
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,660
I can't stand in a place like this (because it is so crowded).

332
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,970
Hamada was passing by IKEA Harajuku.

333
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,230
Hamada was passing that store.

334
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,870
We were absolutely right.

335
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,510
That's right.
Are you guys all scattered?

336
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,180
- You three have forgotten what it feels like to be an ordinary person.
- That's right.

337
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,080
That has nothing to do with it.

338
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,550
This is not that kind of segment.

339
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,680
Endo, don't be cocky.

340
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,420
That was very scary.

341
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,560
Endo, it's true,
you're getting carried away.

342
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,890
Oh, really?
We're comrades, right?

343
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,400
Next week.

344
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,570
