00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,030
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:09,500
Show business world man vs man home cooking showdown!

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,500
Yeaaahhh!!

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,240
So, guys

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,340
This is going to be good!

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,240
Today we'll have a home cooking showdown, it seems  - Yeah!

8
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,500
Downtown

9
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,500
Matsumoto Hitoshi___Hamada Masatoshi

10
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,910
And that's why you're all wearing an apron

11
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,450
Yeah!
Right! Exactly!

12
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,350
Yours will be the Team Gaki

13
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:18,750
Yeah!

14
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,750
And this time we'll also have a guest with us

15
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,120
Eeeh...

16
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,120
So it'll basically be Team Gaki vs the guest

17
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,750
Cocorico

18
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,750
Endo Shouzo______Tanaka Naoki

19
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,550
I'll have you prepare something to eat

20
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,720
Yamazaki Housei

21
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,420
To be honest I don't think we're really that good at this

22
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,460
Cooking showdown! Team Gaki vs the guest!

23
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,690
But we can gather our forces being 4 people!     - Yeah, that's it!

24
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,720
So we can actually do something

25
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,600
Yeah, we can manage it      We can do it, right?

26
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,130
We may win

27
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,070
Hamada will eat both teams' dishes and judge them

28
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,870
I'll be eating what you've cooked in the end

29
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,800
And the best dish

30
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,430
Yes?

31
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,570
Will earn the prize

32
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,540
100'000 Yen!

33
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,110
＊Winning team will get the 100'000 Yen prize!

34
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,210
That's awesome!

35
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,610
Now we're talking!

36
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,240
Is it really okay for it to be this way?

37
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,710
Well

38
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,010
I mean, the prize and everything

39
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,850
The fact there's no punishment...

40
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,550
Things like those

41
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,680
It's just for fun
Lightheartedly

42
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,590
It's not like you're doing something bad, you don't deserve punishments

43
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,700
Right   Absolutely right!

44
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:58,790
Ok, so

45
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,220
Combine your abilities all together

46
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,260
Yeah!

47
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
To face the challenger, which is this person!

48
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,390
Who?

49
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,760
Kishibe Shiro-san!

50
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,530
＊A japanese movie / drama actor from Kyoto

51
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,230
Home Cooking Showdown Guest

52
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,230
Kishibe Shiro

53
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,060
Please!

54
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,530
Thanks for coming!
It's a pleasure!

55
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:10,730
Wha-!

56
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,730
What?!

57
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,000
Kishibe-san!

58
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,260
Wha-

59
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,570
Kishibe-san!!

60
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:26,410
What just happened to Kishibe's body?!

61
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,410
Suddenly, Kishibe falls down in a deep hole under the ground

62
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,410
Just what happened to him?

63
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:37,900

00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,830
Kishibe-san?

67
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,990
What the hell!

68
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,530
I wouldn't say "what the hell"...

69
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,900
Why is there a boobie trap in here?

70
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,830
We don't...

71
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,230
Uhh...
We have no idea, really

72
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,870
Wait, what's this all about...?

73
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,040
A-are you okay?

74
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,800
Yeah, I'm fine...

75
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,040
But what the hell are you planning?

76
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,870
Well, today there's a cooking showdown...

77
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,870
Yeah...

78
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,610
Well, I'm just glad I'm unharmed

79
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,140
Yes, you're right

80
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,000
Maybe this was something from a previous recording or such...

81
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,210
Something they left behind?

82
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,450
Yeah, exactly

83
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,450
Yeah, must be it

84
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,250
Yeah but still today it'll be impossible to me

85
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,500
Please don't say such things...

86
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,500
We're sorry

87
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Do you have any idea who did this?

88
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,820
We have no idea...

89
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,120
I used to be filthy rich, you know that?

90
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,320
Yeah we're really...

91
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,890
Are you really ok?

92
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah I'm fine but I'm done with this today

93
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Come on, don't say so!
Come on!
Please reconsider it...

94
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,360
With his mood down, Kishibe says he want to have a talk with the producer

95
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,800
Kishibe, in a completely heavy mood due the unexpected happening

96
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Returns for a moment in the recording bus to have a talk with the producers

97
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,610
I'm going to have a talk with the producer

98
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,000
Uh...

99
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,740
You know...

100
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,740
About what they've been doing

101
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,300
Huh?

102
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,940
Okay but be sure to settle this down so...

103
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,650
Kishibe-san?
Kishibe-san!

104
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,520
What?

105
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,350
Settle this down and let's start this all anew!

106
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,460
For now I just have to

107
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,400
Calm down my spirits

108
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,690
So it would be better to give it some time

109
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,450
Because right now it's really impossible to me

110
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,360
Just let me relax a bit

111
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,660
Sorry about this

112
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,730
Ok but

113
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,000
Please be sure t-

114
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,540
KISHIBE-SAN!!

115
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,670
Kishibe-san!

116
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,270
Kishibe-san!!

117
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,410
Kishibe-san!!

118
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:05,500
Why are there so many boobie traps in such place?!

119
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,070
There was a hole even on that spot

120
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,680
Kishibe is yet again absorbed by the abyss

121
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,550
Could this be the definition of "It never rains but it pours?"

122
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,050
Kishibe-san!

123
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,050
What's happening?
Come on!
Woah, what the-!
For real?!

124
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,250
Woah, what the-!
Hey!

125
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,290
Aaah, I'm sorry! Sorry for this!

126
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,900
Sorry for this!

127
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,520
Who the fuck dug holes in here?!

128
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,900
This is really...

129
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,200
Who is the executive producer?

130
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,900
The executive producer...?

131
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,700
Uhm... it's Suga

132
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,600
I mean, the one beyond the whole thing

133
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,200
Should be Suga-san...

134
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,470
I'd like to have a talk with him in the bus

135
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,510
A moment please, for now

136
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,740
This is just messed up

137
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,050
It's just horrible, didn't expect this from my beloved Downtown...

138
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,680
With bitternes all over his face, Kishibe parts from them and gets on the bus

139
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,250
The guest Kishibe Shiro ends up secluding himself
together with the producer inside the recording bus

140
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,100
The crew faces him once more in order
to discuss about doing the cooking showdown

141
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,490
Shortly thereafter, the crew tries to persuade the embittered Kishibe

142
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,790
But by which conditions will Kishibe grant them to resume the shooting?

143
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,090
Excuse us...

144
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,100
Uhm...

145
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
We...

146
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,930
We're here for the filming

147
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,570
You know, me too

148
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,400
I went through lots of things

149
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Even pitiable ones I must say

150
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,970
Still, I could actually enjoy all these things

151
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,670
Of course, I understand...
But I never fell down a hole before

152
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,380
But I never fell down a hole before

153
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:07,740
Yes...

154
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,910
That was my first time falling down a hole

155
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,540
I understan-

156
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,310
Truth is, I enjoyed falling too

157
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:11,650
Yes...

158
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,650
But by now I can't enjoy this all anymore

159
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,300
A thing as crazy as this

160
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,750
Was something new even for me

161
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,780
Y-yes...

162
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,590
I have no idea whose idea was this, but it was already there filled with rubber, right?

163
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,690
I wonder...
I don't know who worked for that

164
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,730
I guess we can settle all of this talking about money

165
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,650
This thing can become a bit of a trouble for you

166
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,470
I don't want to make a fuss out of this though

167
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,900
A moment, we're not going to use cameras for now but...

168
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,340
Of course you're not

169
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,140
How... much...?

170
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,070
Well...

171
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,500
Well, today I came here for 50'000 Yen, so...

172
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,350
I guess that's what we call "luxury"...

173
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,050
Pay me at least 8 times this amount!

174
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,710
8 times?!

175
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,980
Eightfold!

176
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,520
Eightfold he says...

177
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,730
I'm not asking for ten times the price!

178
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,320
Yeah, eight times...

179
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,390
Yes
Eightfold...

180
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,290
That will make 400'000 Yen
Indeed

181
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,060
Can you manage to compensate me with these 400'000 Yen, producer?

182
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,320
I will, I will...

183
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,140
Kobayashi Hiromichi

184
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,140
Producer

185
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,230
Be sure to provide them to me as fast as possible

186
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,390
Sure, just...

187
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,860
Just look how muddy my induments got, I'm not waiting 2-3 months for my refund

188
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,230
Uhm...

189
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,700
We'll be sure to include the laundry charge...

190
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,970
If that's the case, then make it 8.5 times the original amount

191
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,760
Eh? Which is--
Wha-

192
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,570
Oh, for the laundry charge...

193
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,100
Yeah, the laundry charge

194
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,880
Ok, thanks! We'll wait you!

195
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,820
Our guest Kishibe Shirou has someway agreed to have a 8.5x times payback including the laundry charge

196
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,300
With an amount of 8.5x times the price plus laundry charge, Kishibe agreed on resuming the show

197
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,070
Thinking about the incidents happened until now

198
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,720
We can easily state this one was the most expensive

199
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,520
As expected from our guest of honour Kishibe Shiro

200
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,230
Ok so, let's get Kishibe out the bus and bring him there...

201
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,590
Yeah

202
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,930
So we can start this thing as soon as possible

203
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,900
Ok, got it

204
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,500
Are we doing this?

205
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,230
Yes!

206
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,100
So, Kishibe-san let's move together towards the set...

207
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,340
This way please!

208
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,900
Once you get here we'll start this

209
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,470
Huh?

210
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,270
This way please, let's just do this
Please

211
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,210
Wait this

212
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,510
This is a bit dirty, it's bad

213
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,510
You're right
Oh I understand

214
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,750
We'll deal with this once you're here

215
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,650
We'll pay for that, so...

216
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,480
Yeah
It's fine

217
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:52,680
We're counting on you

218
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,250
Let's go

219
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,480
Let's move towards the set

220
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,820
WHAT?!

221
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,820
Kishibe-san!!
Kishibe-san!

222
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,520
Kishibe-san...

223
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:06,600
Just who dug up all these boobie traps?

224
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,690
There are boobie traps even right in front of the bus

225
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,160
Kishibe Shiro, 53 years old: A man with no luck whatsoever

226
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,160
Kishibe-san!
Kishibe-san!

227
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,570
Kishibe-san!

228
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,900
Kishibe-san!

229
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,540
Gimme a break!

230
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,840
Are you okay Kishibe-san?

231
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,970
This is bad, this is sooo bad

232
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,110
With this I can't an-

233
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,650
Please ask the staff to come here and lend me a hand

234
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,880
Right, but yeah, uh...

235
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,880
I can't move my legs at all like this

236
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,050
Ah, got it
We're sorry

237
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,150
He's right, he's right

238
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,250
I'm actually 20 years older than my actual age, you know

239
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,860
I-is a hand going to help?

240
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,530
Sorry

241
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,960
Careful careful careful!
Watch out!

242
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,930
Come on, come on, almost there

243
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,930
Okay, he came out

244
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,830
Good, good

245
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,300
Thanks

246
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,770
Thanks

247
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,540
Thanks

248
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,450
How did these holes happen?

249
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,890
Well, I'm going home

250
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,890
No!
Nononono!
No, please wait!

251
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,120
Wait just a momen-

252
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Uhhh...

253
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,730
Thanks

254
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,990
Keep up the good work

255
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,430
Cooking...

256
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,860
What?

257
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,030
We still haven't cooked yet

258
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,400
The cooking showdown
Yeah, the "man vs man cooking showdown"

259
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,200
You were planning to film it in here?

260
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,150
Yes

261
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,750
And I was meant to be part of it?

262
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,580
As a guest
Yeah we invited you as a guest

263
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,580
A guest?  Exactly

264
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,000
You're saying I'm today's guest?!

265
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,980
Our guest Kishibe Shiro is gradually dismantling

266
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,250
That's right   ....Kishibe-san?

267
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,810
And what are we going to do from now on?

268
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,980
A cooking showdown

269
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,500
Thanks

270
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,300
Where are we going to have it?

271
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,500
Over there
On the other side

272
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,860
Okay

273
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,500
Let's do this

274
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,590
Everyone's walking before Kishibe Shiro
To avoid having him falling again in a boobie trap

275
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Matsumoto leads the way so his senpai Kishibe won't fall again in a hole

276
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,370
But even by this, his looks doesn't appear to be the best

277
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,700
It's okay, it's okay
Everything's normal

278
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,470
We're finally here, let's get through this

279
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,470
Right!
Let's do this

280
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,770

Yes

299
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,630
Well, to be honest I don't think we're that good,

300
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,000
But there are 4 of us together, so we won't lose!

301
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,700

305
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,690
Cooking showdown! Team Gaki vs today's guest

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,500
And Hamada will judge our dishes     That's right!

307
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,610
I'll be eating both your dishes

308
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,280
Hamada will judge and compare both dishes by tasting them

309
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,210
And the most delicious one will be rewarded with a prize of 100'000 Yen!

Thanks a lot!       Thank you!

312
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,380
So, I'll have both your teams go to the kitchen corner

313
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,450
We have a time limit for this right?

314
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,720
Yes, that's the point of the showdown

315
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,720
Okay, let's start!

316
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,420
Please!

317
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,330
KISHIBE-SAN!

318
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,430
COME ON!!

319
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:02,700
Why was there a boobie trap even in that place!?

320
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,330
A boobie trap was even before the kitchen corner

321
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,270
Without a doubt, this will leave Kishibe shocked by surprise

322
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,980
Kishibe-san!

323
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,710

327
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,750

328
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,350
This is crazy

329
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,780
We're so sorry
Sorry

330
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,720
Sorry for this

331
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,990
What is a "sorry" good for, I mean-

332
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,980
YOU CAN ONLY PAY ME FOR THIS!

333

337
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,130
Because of the boobie traps
Today's shooting has ended
Way before we planned

338
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,900
