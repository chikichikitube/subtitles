1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
Today, for all you viewers at home...

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,650
I have some sad news to deliver.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,160
A part of our Gaki no Tsukai team,
ever since the second episode...

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,300
Yamazaki has decided that he will be
leaving the show, as of today.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,510
- Well, he said this was "THE END".
- Ah, I see.

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,390
Well, let's bring the honored guess out.
I would like to introduce Housei Yamazaki.

7
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,550
Today is your last day, correct?
- Right. This is the end for me.

8
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:06,340
But, there's a really gloomy atmosphere.

9
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,550
- That's true, because what ever you did, there was always a joking air about it.

10
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:18,260
In actuality, something like this has a
sad part to it as well.

11
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,660
Like when we did the "5 Rangers" skits, you always had to be the Yellow Ranger.

12
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:30,170
- Hmm? This was his choice.
- It was his choice, I guess.

13
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,040
But neither Endo nor myself have heard any
reasoning behind you leaving.

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,010
Like, what kinds of things
made you decide to leave.
- I don't understand the reasoning behind it either.

15
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,420
- Well, I managed to get a girlfriend.

16
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,550
I just listened to her opinions some...

17
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,330
She watches the show all the time.
We're pretty deep in love.

18
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,530
- But still, you wouldn't have
to leave, would you?

19
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,550
- When you watch the way
I appear on shows...

20
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,810
I'm always a talk show guest or something.

21
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,420
I told that to the producers.
"I'd like to appear on a few
other shows", I said.

22
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,530
He basically said, "That
might be impossible."

23
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,530
"Might be impossible?"

24
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,500
Why would he say "impossible"
so plainly, Yama-chan?

25
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,500
- At that time, he probably wasn't thinking
about the best way to put it.

26
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,280
- Maybe you should have said
you weren't leaving...

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,370
- Right. Maybe if he'd added
"I'm okay here, but..."

28
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,490
"No, it's okay. You can
do all sorts of shows."

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,330
Then you could go all sorts of places.
- Because the "Yamazaki flower"
hasn't stopped growing.

30
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:21,050
Today, our own Hosei Yamazaki
has chosen some
famous clips from his time on Gaki no Tsukai.

31
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,450
It seems he's chosen five of them.
- Best Five.

32
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,350
Please watch the clips which Yamazaki's chosen.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,170
Housei Yamazaki. Age: 33 years old.

34
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,510
Ever since the second episode of Gaki No Tsukai, he's appeared as a regular on the show.

35
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,320
Over his 11 years on the show, he's made several memorable clips.

36
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:08,760
This March, he graduates from Gaki No Tsukai.
He'll leave several bright marks on Gaki's history.

37
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,730
Number 5:
Yamazaki attempts to be a "Super Yogore" entertainer

38
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,610
After reaching the status of a shock entertainer, Yamazaki looks to improve to "Super Yogore" rank.

39
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:29,080
Yamazaki and a dresser that we took to a love hotel, bathe and share a moving love story.

40
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,370
Really? You're collecting a lot of water here.!

41
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,010
Wow. You're butt's exposed.

42
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,240
That's dangerous!

43
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,440
Cum!

44
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,940
Number 4:
Yamazaki and Jimmy Onishi's Feud

45
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,110
What the hell is wrong with you?!

46
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,180
While they were both employed by the Yoshimoto talent agency, Yamazaki and Jimmy did nothing but fight.

47
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,750
They wild fighting soon turned into a dogfight.

48
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,060
This is yours, Yamazaki?
- Yeah.  - It's nice.
This is nothing to get excited about.
- Be quiet.

49
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,840
*Note: This car is really Yamazaki's*

50
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,370
Why did you kick your own car?!

51
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,950
Why'd you kick my car?
- Don't get all defensive about something like this.

52
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,050
A natural idiot like you deserves crap like this.
- You're the "Natural Idiot" around here.

53
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,360
*Yamazaki and Jimmy call each other natural idiots*

54
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,980
What the hell are you doing?
- I was about to ask you the same thing, asshole.

55
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,200
Number 3:
"Yamazaki flirted with a scary man's girl" prank

56
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,630
Eh! Say something asshole.

57
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:04,770
Yamazaki finds himself in trouble with the older brother of a girl writer Takasou introduced him to.

58
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,810
This prank will go down in Gaki No Tsukai history.

59
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,210
It should be fine.  - He sounds really scary.

60
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,720
He's here.

61
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,030
Who is it?
- Open up.

62
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,870
*Yamazaki tries to escape through the kitchen window*

63
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,140
*Somehow, Takasou opens the door*

64
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,450
I'm the wrong guy.
- What the hell?! Which of you is Yamazaki?  -Him!

65
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,650
I'm sorry. So sorry.
- What the hell is wrong with you?!

66
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,550
I'm different. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

67
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,730
*Yamazaki is quaking in fear*

68
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:12,170
Sorry. Sorry.
- Come on outside. I'll be waiting for you.

69
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,200
Sorry.
- You aren't getting out of it.  - Sorry.

70
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,950
- Good afternoon!

71
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,870
I was scared for my life!

72
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,340
Number 2:
Late-night Piano Concert in the Abandoned School

73
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,910
After being found guilty in a small-scale trial, the penalty Yamazaki got his guilty verdict...

74
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,890
was to give a piano concert in a dark, abandoned school.

75
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,550
Hold on... Komu!!! (One of the directors)

76
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,290
*He suddenly calls the directors name*

77
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,510
Next up is... a song by Beethoven.

78
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,750
* A loitering old man appears *

79
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,300
* A sound shakes the glass in: 3 *

80
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
* A sound shakes the glass in: 3 *

81
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
* A sound shakes the glass in: 2 *

82
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,470
* A sound shakes the glass in: 1 *

83
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,170
* The doorknob is covered in lotion *

84
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,360
* There's a whoopee cushion on the seat *

85
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,480
"Hoshi ni Negai wo" (When you wish upon a star) by Leigh Harline

86
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,260
*From underneath the piano appears a mountain hag*

87
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,730
*The loitering old man`s locked the door!*

88
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,780
Number 1:
Yamazaki vs Moriman: Blazing Battle

89
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:16,090
Yamazaki and Moriman put their pride on the line in a battle of the sexes in this signature series.

90
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,900
For more than 1000 guests who gathered in Korakuen Hall, they battles in a moving fashion.

91
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,980
Out of all of them, this battle became a struggle:

92
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,060
It's got to be this one: Hot, hot ankake battle!

93
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:52,080
For Gaki No Tsukai's sake, you would go naked or in disguise as lots of different things.

94
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,710
You came to perform for us, and all for Gaki's sake.

95
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,530
Surely you have treasured memories of your youth here on Gaki No Tsukai.

96
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:16,170
Even though you leave us today, you've given us numerous moving moments that will remain in our hearts.

97
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:22,350
Goodbye...
and thank you for the memories.

98
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,830
- Looking at all those moments...
Now it's starting to feel like you're leaving.

99
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,300
... Because of the older clips of you were funny.

100
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:50,940
The show's producer, Mr. Suga, would like to give a parting message to you.

101
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,150
Yama-chan, thank you for these 12 years.

102
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:01,910
In 12 years, a lot of things can happen.
Things like aiming to be better than Downtown...

103
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,730
Back in Nihon TV's "Golden Days", I was choking on a pin.
I talked on and on about lots of different things, and was a pain in the neck for lots of people.

104
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:19,140
From now on at Nihon TV, my new producer and I will work as hard as we can. Thank you.

105
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:38,620
- And now we'll have a few last words from Yamazaki's show business juniors, Cocorico.

106
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,730
- Mr. Housei, thanks for all your hard work.

107
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:54,640
Before we came, it was you and Downtown here.

108
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,710
You make it comfortable by being talkative with us.
For that, we'd like to thank you.

109
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:07,060
Even places outside of here...
- Right. There's no reason that we can't meet up.

110
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:14,890
We'd just like to say "Thanks for your hard work".

111
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,260
- Well, we can go last.

112
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:43,050
- I was actually pretty happy to hear the news.
It was the person's decision to leave.

113
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:51,220
In order to move himself on to bigger things, he decided that it was time to leave Gaki No Tsukai.

114
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:58,440
This is sad, but I think you'll do well after this.

115
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,370
- At least it didn't come from the company.

116
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:11,980
It's different than being fired or told to leave.

117
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:19,060
- As for Yoshimoto ( their talent agency), we'll keep bringing in more and more new talent.

118
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,680
- Because we've got that kind of appeal.
- That's right.

119
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,730
- Maybe, if you hadn't said you were leaving...

120
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,600
I would have thought about leaving.
- Ah. You thought about it.

121
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,150
Well, Yamazaki... thank you.

122
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,880
Thanks for your hard work.

123
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,860
Lastly, we'll have a message from Yamazaki...

124
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:12,460
To all your viewers at home.

125
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:23,570
- Lastly, a message from Yamazaki to the viewers watching from home.

126
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,620
- Getting flowers on a night like this...

127
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,240
Who granted my biggest wish?

128
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:21,180
Those who've cheered for me over my 12 years on Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahende...

129
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:29,440
From now on, even though I'm saying goodbye to Gaki No Tsukai...

130
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,110
I just want to appear on some different shows.

131
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,020
- Do your best. Thanks for your work.

132
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,930
- Well, if you think about it...
A five-person group is hard to work with.

133
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:14,470
- For just doing everyday stuff, right?
- And it's easy to split up.

134
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,750
- And easy to work as a team.

135
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:27,910
I think out of the viewers, there's about 7 or 8 people that are sad, but...

136
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,380
But this is something that couldn't be helped.

137
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,620
No matter what we said, he still would be leaving.

138
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,190
- Yama-chan...!

139
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,460
ain't leaving Gaki No Tsukai!

140
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:55,210
Hey! All you young ones!
Did I surprise you?!
This is something I asked Downtown and Cocorico to do.

141
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,540
I ain't leaving Gaki No Tsukai!

142
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,950
Today was just a big prank!

143
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,880
I'm not leaving! Not leaving! Not leaving!!

144
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:12,260
*Livin' La Vida Loca*
("Yama-chan Isn't Leaving" version)

145
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,240
Yama-chan isn't leavin'!

146
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,540
Yama-chan isn't leavin'!

147
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,910
Yama-chan isn't leavin'!

148
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,490
Yama-chan isn't leavin'!

149
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,220
*TORA TORA TORA*
("Yama-chan Isn't Leaving" version)

150
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,290
YamaYamaYama Yama-chan isn't leavin'!

151
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,430
YamaYamaYama Not leavin'!

152
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,700
YamaYamaYama Yama-chan isn't leavin'!

153
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,670
YamaYamaYama Not leavin'!

154
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:53,460
- We've met our part of the deal and did the prank.

155
00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:03,060
Pranks have a part that surprises people.
I really wonder if this surprised anyone.

156
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,060
It's got an "unfortunate" feeling to it all.

157
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,800
It's a little more "social" than you'd think.

158
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,910
