WDT Project

4
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,340
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown everybody!

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,760
Let's go ! Here is our first presenter, please come in

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,840
It's Giraffe's Kawashima Akira

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,100
Pleased to meet you

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,400
What a nice boy

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,300
I'm a giraffe thanks for having me

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,020
My theory concerns dogs

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,780
How many of you own a dog?

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,360
I own one but I keep him at my parent's home

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,520
What breed is it?

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,520
A mixed breed from a Chihuahua and a Papillon.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,160
It's a small dog right

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,160
Indeed

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,860
What is his name?

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,860
Seimei

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,420
Wow such a "Japanese" name

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,740
Seimei as in "life"...?

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,740
Yes

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,870
So, the Japanese word for "life"

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,870
Indeed

24
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,340
It wasn't me who gave it

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,010
But, everyone is alive though right?

26
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,240
Don't say such things

27
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,820
Here is my theory concerning dogs

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,590
Theory: "Could you recognize your own dog, even if other people are walking him"

29
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,960
Oh I see !

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,180
It's not like you're looking for your dog

31
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,080
Outside, other people will be walking them

32
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,080
You could immediately recognize Peru, right

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,200
Because he had no more fur

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Yeah he had no fur because he smelled so bad

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,060
I would instantly recognize him

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,980
In the end, he died wearing my sweater

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,660
After this, will entertainers recognize their own dogs?

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,780
He looks like him !

39
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,500
Moreover,

40
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,630
If you introduce the strangest person from your acquaintance, you finally reach a hoarders house

41
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,600
Current hits you once per minute : Current Domino

42
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,600
And then,

43
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,620
Avoid five kinds of punishments, Rhythm Challenge

44
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,820
Memorize the order of punishments and aim for efficiency

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,900
Theory: "Could you recognize your own dog, even if other people are walking him"

46
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,020
With that said,

47
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,360
Entertainers, who are dogs lovers, are called out to a fake program

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,160
I wonder.. It seems difficult to notice

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,160
In the middle of the film location, look at the 3 situations where they encounter their pet dogs:

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:44,280
1) Dogs passing by in front of them

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:44,280
2) Passing right by their sides

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:44,280
3) Contact between the dog and the owner

53
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,920
If not noticed by the end, the theory is off

54
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,820
I see

55
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,250
The first target is...

56
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,440
Will he get it?

57
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,620
Gusuman!

58
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,720
Gushiken Yoko

59
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,020
And the dog, a white Boxer called Gusuman

60
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,660
it's a breed of dog, which has quite a distinctive appearance

61
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,120
The fake show consists of a health check data

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,620
1) Measuring the heart rate
2) Walking 1km

63
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,760
First, the dog is passing by in front of them while they measure the heart rate

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,120
Let's relax a bit

65
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,480
Will he notice Gusuman ?

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,800
Here he is !

67
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,060
It's good right?

68
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,040
Perfect eye contact

69
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,820
This he noticed

70
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,320
This is perfect

71
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,320
Gusuman is also looking at him

72
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,080
Gusuman noticed him

73
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,460
He is watching him

74
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,780
Gusuman without a doubt noticed his owner

75
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,100
Although Gushiken...

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,330
I'm really curious about that dog

77
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,330
Eh? This one ?

78
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,790
I owned one like that

79
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,430
Is this a toy?

80
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,330
Isn't it a Miniature Pinscher ?

81
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,640
Unbelievable

82
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,330
It is.

83
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,200
Really?

84
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,840
Are you serious?

85
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,340
Miracle

86
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,560
He was curious about a dog that he owned in the past

87
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,580
Are you serious Gushiken ?

88
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:31,780
Then, while walking, the dog will pass by the side

89
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,290
Let's slowly walk 1 km

90
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,460
Alright, lets go!

91
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,580
The walking starts

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,760
and then...

93
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,770
The amount of food

94
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,240
in this way

95
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,600
He's so looking at dogs

96
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,010
It's bad to get overweight

97
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,440
A miniature ? Wasn't it a poodle?

98
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,000
As expected, he reacts at dogs

99
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,160
Finally, Gusuman's entrance

100
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, it's a boxer !

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,770
Amazing, it's a boxer

102
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,000
Are you serious?

103
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,740
He has a a boxer

104
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,900
Unbelievable

105
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,710
Amazing

106
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,010
Huh?

107
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,250
Right now, I just..

108
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,120
That was without a doubt a boxer

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,080
It's definitely Gusuman

110
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,390
There are people who have dogs around here huh

111
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,090
I want too see it one more time

112
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,180
It isn't good

113
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,740
Gushiken can't hide his excitement for the rare breed of boxers, but

114
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,080
Eeh he didn't get it

115
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,720
He didn't notice

116
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,420
he doesn't recognize his own dog

117
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,560
What about when they make direct contact

118
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,640
This he has to understand

119
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,260
Gushiken is left alone

120
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,020
Sorry, Gushiken-san

121
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,020
Yes

122
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,090
Is it ok if I shake your hand?

123
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,100
This is a boxer

124
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,800
You know boxer dogs?

125
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,070
You know what

126
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,940
Do you know mine?

127
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,370
Eh

128
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,480
Amazing, why?

129
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,210
Hose, do you like him?

130
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,450
Do you know mine?

131
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,650
They're the same

132
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,520
Wait a moment

133
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,520
Did he notice?

134
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,630
He looks like Gusuman

135
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,390
It's the real one

136
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,460
You're saying Gusuman

137
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,900
He looks like him

138
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,300
Wait a bit

139
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,500
Maybe this is my Gusuman?

140
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,210
He noticed !

141
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:07,970
He is similar ?

142
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,910
What the hell is this?

143
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,810
Isn't it Gusuman

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,020
As expected, he noticed

145
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,740
"What the hell is this"

146
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,240
Revealing the prank

147
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,020
How did you notice?

148
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,960
The size of the ears

149
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,830
There aren't many like that

150
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,220
He got it after all

151
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,330
This morning I took a walk around 7am

152
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,720
With Gusuman?

153
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,970
We separated with good feelings

154
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,860
What is this?

155
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,710
Because of the location, I had a good feeling

156
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,100
What the heck is with good feelings

157
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,280
If he makes contact, he notices

158
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,880
The following dog lover entertainer is...

159
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,620
We're happy to have you here Sugi-chan

160
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,620
Absolutely, happy to be here

161
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,140
Sugi-chan

162
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,120
His dog is a toy poodle called Puchi (3 years old)

163
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,080
Even this time, while visibly walking by

164
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,440
He doesn't notice at all

165
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,600
Even in the next part,

166
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,560
That's fast !

167
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Yeah it was all over

168
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,220
Hm, Huh?

169
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,590
He's so similar to mine

170
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,560
Puchi

171
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,330
That didn't do, I'm just a stranger

172
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,090
Puchi !

173
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,100
He isn't looking, I'm mistaken then

174
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,400
He really looks like mine

175
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,170
But as an owner, I can't pass by without stopping

176
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,100
Cause it's Chiba

177
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,670
It's just like... mine

178
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,740
Even the size

179
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,610
But mine might be prettier after all

180
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,580
he's more cute

181
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,780
He was suspicious, but

182
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,440
he thought it couldn't be possible

183
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,380
Which means, once again with the last confrontation

184
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,830
Sugi-chan ?

185
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,830
Yes

186
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,870
Are you the person from before?

187
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,200
This gotta be puchi, he looks so much like him

188
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,640
Is it ok if I shake your hand?

189
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,640
Yeah no problem

190
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,040
Thank you

191
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,040
Thank you very much

192
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,980
Puchi Puchi Puchi ?

193
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,210
He looks so much like him!

194
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,220
Do you have a toy poodle too?

195
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,220
Yes exactly

196
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,780
Eeh, what color is yours?

197
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,550
Same color

198
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,090
Furthermore,

199
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,790
and when I touch him he has the same tension as mine

200
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,460
Just now, he seemed tense when I touched him

201
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,260
How old is yours?

202
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,000
Puchi?

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,230
Look ! He's so angry

204
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,500
This isn't safe!

205
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,140
Puchi has the same way of being angry

206
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,610
when he looks at me,

207
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,160
Why?

208
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,770
THIS IS PUCHI !

209
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,680
What is he angry about?

210
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,980
He's not calming down at all

211
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,840
He looks at his owner and get angry

212
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,050
Puchi is so angry

213
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,200
Sugi-chan also noticed his dog

214
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,600
Why?

215
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:13,400
As expected, if they make direct contact, they immediately recognize their own dog

216
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,800
Then, our last target is this person

217
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Welcome Ikko

218
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,800
Hello

219
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,600
Ikko

220
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,710
It's this type of Ikko huh

221
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,100
And his dog is a 5 year old Chihuahua, Peko

222
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,650
It'll be easy to notice

223
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,600
Indeed

224
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:33,580
This time, he also doesn't notice with the "passing by" pattern.

225
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,210
How cute

226
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,650
Furthermore, even the "Passing right by" is failed

227
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,650
So cute~

228
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,600
Isn't it the one from before?

229
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,600
He doesn't get it

230
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,350
As expected, he didn't notice his own dog, however...

231
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,000
Sorry,

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,300
I didn't say it earlier, but is it ok if I shake your hand?

233
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,450
You like it

234
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,450
So cuuute

235
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,550
For real?

236
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,610
Do you like poko?

237
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,500
He's called poko?

238
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,750
Yes

239
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,750
Poko~

240
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,750
He's happy

241
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,250
Why is it doing that? Going "Gnnn~"

242
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,600
He always does that sound

243
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,100
Poko~~

244
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,600
You like Chihuahuas?

245
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,000
Until now, I have owned many generations of Chihuahuas

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,400
So, now you have a chihuahua too?

247
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,410
But, the way of barking is exactly the same

248
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,750
Like yours?

249
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,120
Eh, what color is he?

250
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,450
It's this exact...

251
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,050
He's happy~

252
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,350
What did he notice?

253
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,900
Something...

254
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,600
The odor

255
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,650
The odor?

256
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,900
He said Woo Woo

257
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,600
It's just like mine

258
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,500
Yes

259
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,200
Also quite doubtful about the unique purring

260
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,900
Come on

261
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,950
Cheese~

262
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,850
Until the very end he didn't ask : "isn't it mine?"

263
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,800
We don't need to say it, it's a perfect proof of our theory

264
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,350
really...

265
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,000
As a matter of fact, this dog is Peko

266
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,300
Oooooh, no way

267
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,850
He didn't notice

268
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,500
Which proves,

269
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,810
Ikko didn't notice

270
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,650
What was that, at the end

271
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,650
What the hell

272
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,100
The way Sugi-chan raises his dog is..

273
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,600
Is that alright?

274
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,420
That's a problem isn't it

275
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,000
If you put a camera in his house, he might do a bunch of stuff

276
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,200
It was unbelievable

277
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,700
What was that?

278
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,040
The way he said "He has the same way of being angry" was scary

279
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,900
Next presenter is this person, please come out!

280
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Hello!

281
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,450
Jinnai Tomonori

282
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,600
Long time no see

283
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,300
So this time, my theory concerns "linking groups together"

284
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,800
We have done this 2 times in the past

285
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,130
Theory: "with a 6 people chain, you can finally get anyone's phone number"

286
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,970
And the second one: If you keep introducing the most interesting person

287
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:52,440
from your acquaintances, you will end up at Matsumoto Hitoshi"

288
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,150
This second time, they finally reached Matsumoto

289
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,150
It was super scary

290
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:02,200
Indeed, also this time, I thought about this

291
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,700
Theory: "If you introduce the strangest person from your acquaintances,

292
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,860
you finally reach a hoarders house"

293
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,850
No way!

294
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,500
It'd be quite a thing if it did!

295
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,050
How this will go?

296
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,850
It's possible

297
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,850
Until now, we've tried to reach Matsumoto, but this time it's a hoarder's house

298
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,350
but there's also a possibility we might reach Matsumoto again

299
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,510
It would be amazing if I lived in a garbage house

300
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,250
Eeeh this is amazing

301
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,850
But maybe...

302
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,950
On that subject, someone living in a hoarder's house is not necessarily strange,

303
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,850
he might have reasons for it

304
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,850
but indeed, they seem to be quite a lot of strange people

305
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,500
In the previous tour of that show, when I was looking for locations of garbage houses

306
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,700
I became quite close to those people

307
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,500
But the first impression was... It was all over the place!

308
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,410
That's the house, but what about the person?

309
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,210
Those people were also untidy

310
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,150
Talking about garbage houses, what do you think Seiji-san?

311
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,250
What are ya saying!?

312
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,350
Whose face is all over the place?

313
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,700
Everything is where it should be you idiot!

314
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,060
There isn't even space for stepping

315
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,550
There's plenty!

316
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:23,670
Theory: "If you introduce the strangest person from your acquaintances, you finally reach a hoarder's house"

317
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,800
With that said, from the people waiting around

318
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,550
In Shibuya?

319
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,850
we look for the first strange person

320
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,450
Then immediately

321
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,050
He doesn't have an umbrella

322
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,100
There are plenty of people like this in Shibuya

323
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,400
In the heavy rain, a man with strange movements

324
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,700
No umbrella...

325
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,450
Then, let's try to talk to him

326
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,400
Because you were walking in the rain without umbrella

327
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,850
I wonder why

328
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,000
It's because I really like Shibuya's rain

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,800
You like the rain in Shibuya?

330
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,800
Yeah

331
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,100
I like urban rain

332
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,800
This guy...

333
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,850
As expected, seems like a strange person

334
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,300
have you ever been called strange?

335
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,320
Strange? Mmh indeed

336
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,320
Gross

337
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,150
His laugh is so irritating

338
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,100
Kind of gross yeah

339
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,500
The first person of the link is

340
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,600
Oshima Kan (20 years old)

341
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,940
Could you introduce us to the strangest person from your acquaintances?

342
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,360
Alright, so cause I'm into dancing

343
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:46,180
I have a lot of gay acquaintances, they are people who really bring attention to themselves

344
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,050
Quite far gone people

345
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,750
Immediately getting an appointment with this person

346
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,900
Later, heading to the meeting place

347
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,450
Good evening

348
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,450
Good evening

349
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,150
Are you Fujimoto?

350
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,150
Yes

351
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,350
Here is the "quite far gone gay", Fujimoto Kota (19 years old)

352
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,100
Do you recognize yourself as being strange?

353
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,100
No I think I'm quite normal

354
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,050
I often get called strange though

355
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,180
I don't think I really have anything weird

356
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,350
if I wouldn't dance I probably would be a normal person

357
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
What the hell is he doing?

358
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,650
Weird

359
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,700
In appearance, he doesn't have much self-awareness

360
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,050
Eeeh

361
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,050
He's weird

362
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,400
Oooh Ryou

363
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,750
Terrible

364
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,250
What are you doing?

365
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,550
His friends are amazing

366
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,750
What is this

367
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,650
What in the world

368
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:50,650
Unexpectedly, hugs and kisses from friends in the street

369
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,120
Is this what they call "Shibuya people"?

370
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,500
As expected, he wasn't normal

371
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,450
I see

372
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,150
Who is the strangest person from Fujimoto's acquaintances?

373
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,230
The person I'm thinking about when you say strange is a dancer called Rechiko

374
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,800
Again a dancer?

375
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,100
It's not that she drinks alcohol but

376
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,300
Although there are people around, she goes like " Yiaaah"

377
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,770
Do you mean an excited person?

378
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,850
She's really an idiot

379
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,050
This time once again, a dancer

380
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,350
I don't get a "hoarder" vibe from this

381
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,350
With that, we head to Rechiko's location

382
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,250
Excuse me, are you Rechiko?

383
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,250
Yes

384
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,850
Incredible

385
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,650
It's Wednesday Downtown

386
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,150
I'm Rechiko, nice to meet you

387
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Unbelievable

388
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:59,050
The third person of the link, Esaka Reiko (19 years old)

389
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,100
Wow

390
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,400
Rechiko

391
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,200
Esaka Reiko

392
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm Rechiko, Poi poi pi

393
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,300
Macchan, Hamachan I'm watching you

394
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,250
Poi poi poi~

395
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,000
Do you think you're considered strange?

396
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,950
I wonder, I think I'm a frank human being

397
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,550
Once again, not much self-awareness, but

398
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,300
when asked what her latest strange behavior was...

399
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,380
When I was at an event in Tokyo, I was standing in the back

400
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,450
I was really frustrated

401
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,050
I bought biscuits and was thinking of eating them

402
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,890
I wanted to eat them but,

403
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,860
Somehow felt I wanted to throw them at something

404
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,200
Without permission, I went 'Waaah" and then

405
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,030
with all my might I threw them "WHAM". It's the kind of story that spins your head

406
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,450
Rechiko who was supposed to be dancing in the background

407
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,500
she jumps to the center as she pleases and it resulted in her throwing biscuits

408
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,440
She gets forcefully pushed to the backstage

409
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,500
She's talking about that?

410
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,040
So who is the weirdest person this...

411
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,000
...rebel Rechiko knows?

412
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,420
Rechiko is amazing

413
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,570
There's this drag queen that's probably the most extreme ever...

414
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,010
...and his name is Katoken

415
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,030
Another drag queen dancer

416
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,740
with the name Katoken

417
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,190
He is

418
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,170
He really is too much

419
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,170
Too loud

420
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,740
We go on to the next person

421
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,120
Since it's Katoken (name means lot of health)

422
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,610
Hellooo~

423
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:43,450
This is Katoken : Katou Kenta, 19 years old

424
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,560
However

425
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,620
I really love doing weird movements

426
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,720
Like this...

427
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,970
and "NAANII~". I always do these

428
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,970
Oh I get it

429
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,530
His name he was positive but...

430
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,840
He's skilled

431
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,390
...he wasn't that loud as aforementioned

432
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,140
The next person we were introduced to was...

433
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,780
Saitou Tsukiho, 17 y.o

434
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,980
Oh she's young

435
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,350
It's really weird though, is it okay?

436
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,990
She was gonna do her trademark funny face but...

437
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,020
3-2-1

438
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:24,040
It's not much is it

439
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,040
I've been told it's scary

440
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,690
However...

441
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,180
3-2-1-Go!

442
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:33,590
...Rechiko's was much stronger

443
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,620
This girl is weird as hell

444
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,630
There's this person called Daisuke...

445
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,450
...who wears makeup everyday, he's in drag

446
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,580
There are alot of drag queens

447
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,580
It's only drag queens

448
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,020
Now, on to the next drag queen dancer

449
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,130
That's strong

450
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,580
He's kinda cool though

451
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,890
This is Fujiwara Daisuke, 21 y.o

452
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,970
I liked being called "creep" but also...

453
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,210
...there are mothers who tell their kids "don't look"

454
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,240
But one of the reasons I do it is that that makes me feel good

455
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,430
Who is the weirdest person this Daisuke knows?

456
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,670
He's a DJ

457
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,700
Is he a man?

458
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,070
He's male yes, he has one...

459
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,010
We're not going towards a hoarder house at all

460
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,340
We finally leave the dancer zone to a DJ

461
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,730
But unfortunately, even though we tried reaching this man

462
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,750
We couldn't set up a meeting cause of lack of communication

463
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,290
That means we start once more from the first person

464
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,920
Oh you went to Kitasenju! It's a good place for this

465
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,830
I get cold if this part (of my hair) is missing

466
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,840
No way that's true

467
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,320
If there is (hair), my neck gets warm

468
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,950
There aren't really weirder people than my cute self, yeah

469
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,800
Since my cute self is pretty extreme

470
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,010
I'm the best, at the top, the king

471
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,090
I really want to see this guys house

472
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:56,390
We couldn't really get to the second person

473
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,970
Will he act like that if you ask him about his house?

474
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,360
However...

475
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,800
Yeah if we can't get to the second person it won't work

476
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,640
This is a program called Wednesday Downtown...

477
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,740
...we were looking for a weird person

478
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,740
A weird person...

479
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,170
We kind of decided from your appearance...

480
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,560
Ones from 20+ years ago

481
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:13,310
We talked with this man with a unique appearance

482
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,920
I've been doing work as an extra

483
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,280
So having an outfit that was a bit out there could work...

484
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,440
You're an extra though

485
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,320
With that, this extra who wants to stand out is...

486
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,580
Sakamoto, 47 y.o, is the person we'll do our restart with.

487
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,160
Why do you have earphones on?

488
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,280
It's completely fine don't worry

489
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,440
Amongst this Sakamoto's acquaintances...

490
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,410
I feel like we're on to something here

491
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,800
...the one who's the weirdest is...

492
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,360
I wonder where we'll go

493
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,740
The street musician Yamaguchi Motochika, 30 y.o

494
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,760
And the person Yamaguchi is introducing us to is...

495
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,450
This girl called The Fullbody-Tights Singer Chaki

496
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,690
She's is Osaka

497
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,690
Osaka?

498
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,070
Yes

499
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,280
That means, to Osaka...

500
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,070
But,

501
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,190
The Fullbody-Tights Singer Chaki was...

502
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,430
...a common sensed person with an over the top expression

503
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,910
With that we understand that the real weird people are...

504
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:19,990
...the ones who look completely normal on the outside

505
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,830
The next person we got introduced to was Yamamoto

506
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,080
At first, he looks quite normal, however...

507
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,000
He looks really normal

508
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,100
In the future, I want to get assassinated

509
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,960
I want to die by assassination

510
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,710
Really?

511
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,680
My friends dream is to get a demonstration going because of that

512
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,190
One person...

513
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,530
One person told me "Ok then I'll kill you"

514
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,230
We have an agreement with that person

515
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,330
I'm serious

516
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,430
This guy is crazy af

517
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,740
That's insane

518
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,200
The person Yamamoto introduced us to is...

519
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,280
They scream about love in front of HEP

520
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,200
Always

521
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,580
They're only yelling out stuff like "I love everybody!"

522
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,440
What is this person's job?

523
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,210
A monk

524
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,210
Oh he's a monk?

525
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,070
Yeah

526
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,170
But, we couldn't get a hold of that monk

527
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,970
Since they're weird

528
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:23,060
Our second chain got cut off at 4 people

529
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,480
Since everyone's weird you can't reach them normally

530
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:25,030
We're not really going anywhere

531
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,770
So it won't work...

532
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:28,680
At this rate, we won't reach a hoarder's house, so...

533
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,330
Ah we came back to Kitasenju

534
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,690
...We've decided to start from a person of higher age

535
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,450
I'm a first class architect

536
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,450
Oh really

537
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,840
It's in the fine details

538
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,590
Oh is it

539
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,590
No, if you don't do it properly

540
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,160
You don't need a close up!

541
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,010
Your small mistakes will become huge

542
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,670
This person who doesn't allow small mishaps

543
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:52,370
Ooi Takashi, 71 y.o, introduced us to...

544
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,980
This cyropractor with a strong first impression, Tanaka

545
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,400
Haven't we come close?

546
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,390
Then, with Tanaka's introduction,

547
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,250
The hairdresser Ookuma's weirdest acquaintance,

548
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,900
Ah it got better a bit...

549
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,580
Oh he's stylish

550
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,410
Takeda from Takeda Motor Vehicles

551
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,370
Lots of car parts hanging around everywhere

552
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,720
It's quite a sight

553
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,590
It's so dirty

554
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,040
Wait, it's dirty?

555
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,040
It's dirty as hell

556
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,980
From a normal person point of view, it could be considered as trash

557
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,110
He's really stylish

558
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,980
Yep

559
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,400
He is isn't he?

560
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,690
Trash

561
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,940
We've finally come to a place that smells of trash

562
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,920
Getting closer to a hoarder palace very suddenly

563
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,590
That means, we go to Takeda Motor Vehicles quickly

564
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,990
Hello

565
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,790
Yo

566
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,590
This is the owner of the said hoarder palace

567
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,130
Takeda Hifumi, 64 y.o

568
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,260
We get a closer look at his place of work

569
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,880
We come to a place that you wouldn't think was open for business...

570
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,180
...full of random car parts scattered everywhere

571
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,690
Most of it has been here for many years

572
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,290
These are products?

573
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,290
Yes

574
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,010
They're products to me

575
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,440
They can be used so I keep'em

576
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,960
It can all be sold so I have'em

577
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,940
It's the one from before

578
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,170
Yes it's the one I did

579
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,380
I look at all of it and choose

580
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,160
A line we've heard somewhere else

581
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:24,160
It's a pinch if you say those things

582
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,410
Also, when we get a look at the offices...

583
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,240
No space to walk or stand,

584
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,800
The state of hoarder's palace

585
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,580
I think of myself as fond of cleanliness but...

586
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,010
With that,

587
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,340
It's quite easy to reach a hoarder's den of a small scale

588
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,720
A small scale right?

589
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,720
Yes on the light side, we reached it on the 4th person

590
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,390
There were really weird ones like "I want to get assassinated"

591
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,750
"I have an agreement"

592
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,750
What's wrong with that person?

593
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,660
In Osaka...

594
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,660
The "crazy af" guy

595
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,670
The really crazy...

596
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,670
He was serious too

597
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:00,900
The dancers strong hug and kiss...

598
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,960
...was like the one Jenkins* got

599
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:07,530
*It's a reference to a meeting between an abductee and his Japanese wife

600
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,180
After he got off the plane

601
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,180
Yeah after he got off

602
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,120
Nobody got it...

603
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,820
It's nostalgic

604
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,020
Nobody in the audience got it

605
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,020
Nobody knows what you're talking about

606
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,000
It's an old reference

607
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,000
It's like this please watch

608
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,040
Next up is the corner that verifies various theories from around the world

609
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,610
"Viewer's theory corner"

610
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,870
Tonight's presenters are

611
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,460
It's Chidori!

612
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,580
We're Chidori! We'll be in your care

613
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,420
Okay let's start "Everybody's theories"

614
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,470
We've done various mixed rule games

615
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,610
Yeah you have haven't you

616
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,610
This time...

617
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,520
...we've come with a new mix. You know batsu games right?

618
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,950
Variety TV's classic

619
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:53,700
It's the theory that if you mixed those batsu games with something else it'd be quite interesting to watch

620
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,280
We've come with a new suggestion to variety Tv

621
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,190
What do you mean?

622
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,190
Let's just look at the title, here it is

623
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,920
Batsu x Rhythm Game

624
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,060
A game like the Yamanote line* game

625
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:10,030
*It's a rhythm game inspired by the Yamanote metro line in Tokyo

626
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,530
Rhythm games like that exist right?

627
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,470
If various punishments would come at that rhythm...

628
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,540
...would you be able to get away from them in time

629
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,760
You know the Yamanote line right?

630
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,380
It's quite simple isn't it?

631
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,870
You say the thing that was th... glast person said that before

632
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,170
You're harsh

633
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:30,180
The Hamada Police is real harsh!

634
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,180
thglast?

635
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,530
Thglast??

636
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,950
There's no way I would be saying stuff like that at this moment

637
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,180
Yeah he said it

638
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,180
You said thglast..

639
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,760
You're really damn harsh!

640
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,750
You won't go easy on me huh?

641
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,100
I can't, can't, I don't like that no

642
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,460
You will not?

643
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,460
I will not!

644
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,600
You say the thing that the person before you said...

645
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,600
The person before you...

646
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,410
...and add your own.

647
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,920
It's the one where you have to memorize it all

648
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,530
Will you not do it once everybody?

649
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,850
Can you do it? We'll test it out

650
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,370
It's from here to there right?

651
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,010
Let's start with Daigo, and go all the way to Hamada, If you guys can

652
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,980
There's no way Hamada gets to play...

653
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,980
I'd like you to try though

654
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,620
He has the toughest part

655
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,620
Yes yes..

656
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,390
Let's start with vegetables

657
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,390
Alright, vegetables.

658
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,360
The topic is vegetables. From Daigo, let's start the Yamanote Line Game

659
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,460
Pan-pan

660
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,330
Cabbage

661
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,330
Cabbage - Lettuce

662
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,000
Cabbage - Lettuce - Carrots

663
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,600
Cabbage - Lettuce - Carrots - Bok Choy

664
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,170
Cabbage - Lettuce - Carrots - Bok Choy - Komatsuna

665
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,880
Cabbage - Lettuce - Carrots - Bok Choy - Komatsuna - Lettuce

666
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,080
Hey!!

667
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,080
Hold on!

668
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,950
WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?

669
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,550
You wrapped it with lettuce!

670
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,190
Bok Choy!

671
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,560
He wrapped it!

672
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,060
Bok Choy!

673
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,090
You made Chinese food!!

674
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,830
He sure did wrap it.

675
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,130
Punishment x Rhythm Game

676
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,040
In this game, the player stands in this box

677
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,480
And tries to avoid 5 types of punishments dealt in time with the music.

678
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,480
Oh that's amazing!

679
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:12,180
Moreover, each punishment is chosen by lottery, and is added up one by one

680
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,990
so that the players must memorize each punishment in order.

681
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,990
Oh noo

682
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,920
The participants taking on the challenge are these three

683
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,660
It's a dodging game.

684
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,660
I see...

685
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,160
Let's try... 15 punishments.

686
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,160
Eh?

687
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,160
That's impossible...

688
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,300
15?

689
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,770
15 is impossible.

690
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,170
There's no way.

691
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,770
If you fail mid-way you have to start again.

692
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,470
Wooow

693
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,770
Woooow

694
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,710
It's always this bullshit with them

695
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,780
Always

696
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,420
With that, let's have Kasuga choose the first punishment

697
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,250
A bamboo sword

698
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,550
What's with that

699
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,090
Bamboo sword

700
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,290
Hold on, if it comes here...

701
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,190
That machine looks scary..

702
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,190
Hold on

703
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,790
Uh, well if you come here you'll understand but

704
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,460
I can see the whole machine

705
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,300
That does seem scary

706
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,770
The harisen... it's scary over here

707
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,930
That's terrifying!

708
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,200
and I can hear the noises from the Harisen and the volleyball machine

709
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,170
Ok, I'm ready

710
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,770
Start anytime

711
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,880
Maru?

712
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,280
Quick

713
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,250
Was there only one beat?

714
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,920
That was faster than I expected

715
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,150
Isn't this dangerous?

716
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,790
You should be ready by the second 'thump'

717
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,390
I see...

718
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,500
Volleyball

719
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,470
Ohhhh

720
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,870
Oooh nice

721
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,670
Ok ok perfect perfect

722
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,440
Ready set go

723
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,480
Washbowl

724
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,650
So, down

725
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,650
Go down once, back up, and then down again.

726
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,650
The washbowl isn't a separate item

727
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,850
Just remembering "down down" is ok.

728
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,490
Ah that's right, "down down", that works

729
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,120
Oh, that's interesting

730
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,760
Let's remember by commands

731
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,790
Just remember the commands

732
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,960
That's right, by movement commands

733
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,500
Too early!

734
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,200
Oh amazing!

735
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,410
This looks fun!

736
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,340
Did you make it? Barely?

737
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,380
I did it right

738
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,540
I stood up right?

739
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,210
He had to stand up once

740
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,410
Mhmm

741
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,380
Bamboo stick

742
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,380
Jump

743
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,020
Down-down-jump

744
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,320
The commands

745
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,160
So early!

746
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,630
You're too early

747
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,900
Sorry

748
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,900
So early!

749
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,470
Ahh... my heart is pumping

750
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,370
Way too early

751
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,600
Yes, you need a good memory

752
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,540
but if you don't have a good sense of rhythm, you can't clear this game

753
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,620
Net

754
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,120
It hit me a bit

755
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,890
Nothing you can do about that

756
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,190
He's safe right?

757
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,190
Yeah yeah

758
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,930
That's hot...

759
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,370
He did it He did it

760
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,370
He's got it

761
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,570
Noo!

762
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,270
Why did you jump there?

763
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,510
What are you doing?

764
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,080
What are you even doing?

765
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,510
And after that

766
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,850
Ouch!

767
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,890
Slow!

768
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,900
You bastard!

769
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,800
The opposite!

770
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,570
Nakaoka keeps dragging the team

771
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,170
He went for it!

772
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,770
Already 1 hour has passed since the start

773
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,280
You really have to memorize them all

774
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,450
Down down, then jump

775
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,780
Nice

776
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,920
Komiya clears 6 in a row! A new record!

777
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,030
Next, Kasuga also...

778
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,300
He's not looking at anything!

779
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,270
A bit suspicious, but he still clears.

780
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,640
But Nakaoka...

781
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:35,040
Next, Nakaoka challenges 8 punishment in a row

782
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,080
He's pretty bad

783
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,980
Down-Side-Down

784
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,190
Down-Jump-Down-Down-Jump

785
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,930
This is hard...

786
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,630
He's in unknown territory

787
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,560
Alright, let's do this

788
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,510
He's still not jumping when supposed to

789
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,580
Oh god

790
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,780
I can't bear to watch

791
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,320
Ahh please

792
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,780
No more

793
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,850
This guy is really pissing me off

794
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,550
His glasses!

795
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,460
2 hours since the start, the 16th game

796
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,430
Oh, they've gone all the way to 12!

797
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,430
Amazing!

798
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,470
Kasuga, amazing!

799
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,540
Wow

800
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,640
Wow

801
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,340
Wow!

802
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
Woooow!

803
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,220
Kasuga finally passes the 12 punishment barrier

804
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,350
Well he does have good stamina

805
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:55,230
Afterwards, Nakaoka has to clear 13 punishments

806
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:59,560
Will he be able to connect to Komiya

807
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,770
I hope he doesn't jump at the washbowl again

808
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,940
No way!

809
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,080
No way!

810
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,140
What what what

811
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,480
The volleyball...

812
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,480
Shocking...

813
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,220
Are you ok?

814
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,120
This guy's really pissing me off

815
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:26,560
Once again the streak is stopped by Nakaoka

816
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,960
He really can't do this

817
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,690
Ayyyy

818
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,400
Slowly, he seems to be getting the hang of it

819
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:42,540
Still, there seems to be a barrier at 11 penalties, and the record has not been improved

820
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,240
It's been 3 hours and 50 minutes since the beginning

821
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,540
They've done it for 4 hours?

822
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,150
But next...

823
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,790
Kasuga clears 12 punishments

824
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,960
Amazing

825
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,390
As expected

826
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,090
Wasn't the volleyball too close?

827
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,860
That first volleyball almost hit me!

828
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,700
And then, Nakaoka challenges the fated 13 punishments!

829
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,630
Let's go!

830
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,200
Oh he took off his glasses

831
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,380
Ok ok

832
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,280
Oh no!

833
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,090
Good work

834
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,920
Ohhh close

835
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,160
Keep it up

836
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,900
He did it!

837
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,130
Safe safe safe

838
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,330
He's awakened!

839
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,860
Ok ok ok

840
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,470
It's over it's over

841
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,000
I never want to do that again

842
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,470
You're the best

843
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:53,540
Komiya also clears 14 punishments

844
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:04,850
In the end, complete victory is entrusted to this man

845
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,190
The result is...

846
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,230
You're ok!

847
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,630
So fast

848
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,070
Nice nice

849
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,470
Nice

850
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,850
No way!

851
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,550
Kasuga!

852
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,480
Aaaaahh

853
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,150
Noo!

854
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:41,120
With that, our participants were able to clear 14 punishments in a 4-hour battle

855
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,430
Ah that was...

856
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,190
They couldn't succeed?

857
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,030
Mhmm

858
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,630
But it was pretty interesting

859
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,630
It was a good try

860
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,100
What did you think Matsumoto?

861
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,530
I think there's no way I couldn't do this

862
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,540
He said it!

863
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,240
He really said it!

864
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,440
Yeah, well even now...

865
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Now?

866
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,170
I've already memorized it

867
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,170
No way

868
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,940
You memorized it while watching, right?

869
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,940
Right, right!

870
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,350
That's impossible

871
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,350
Let's do it, Matsumoto san

872
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:08,150
Of course! You can even set a blowtorch up

873
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,720
Yoshimoto won't allow that!

874
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,020
Well, there's one more mix!

875
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,190
And here comes the next one.

876
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,830
Punishment X domino show

877
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,070
Now this is interesting

878
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,070
What?

879
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:28,840
And here come our two clueless challengers

880
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,810
Viking

881
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,810
They appear every week

882
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,750
Nishimura san, what's wrong with your eyes?

883
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,250
That's right, his eyes...

884
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,080
They were swollen when I woke up

885
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,350
Sorry

886
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,720
What the hell happened?

887
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,750
So intriguing

888
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:48,220
As always, Nishimura being a weird guy

889
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,150
He's so creepy

890
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,090
Where did he sleep?

891
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:54,230
They will have to face a 1000 dominoes challenge

892
00:40:54,530 --> 00:41:00,740
However, there's a special rule: an electric current will flow once a minute

893
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,270
EH?

894
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,270
EH??

895
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,540
An electric current?

896
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,240
Every minute, right?

897
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,510
Whaaat

898
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,510
Whaaat

899
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,350
Don't be stupid...

900
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,740
Similar to last week's

901
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,250
Aaah, I don't like this

902
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,250
No way, no way, no...

903
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,550
Kotoge san, do you feel confident about this?

904
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,120
Well, I...

905
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,190
Some time ago, I set up a domino show in another TV program

906
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,190
I see

907
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,830
So I'm sure I'm better than this guy over here

908
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,070
But I'm pretty good at electricity so...

909
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,300
So when it comes to that...

910
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,100
What the hell do you mean?

911
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,970
There's no such thing as "good at electricity"

912
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,640
How did you know?

913
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,340
So if I manage to endure...

914
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,540
How did you know you were "good at electricity"?

915
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,480
And that's my only...

916
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,510
...chance of winning

917
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,510
Aaaaah

918
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,880
Wait a sec

919
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,690
They can't see the timer

920
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,050
The first shock...

921
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:49,690
Is that so?

922
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,190
So these two don't know

923
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,190
Oh, I see

924
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,720
Hey

925
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,790
How much distance

926
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,360
I'm really scared of the first shock

927
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,160
The distance...

928
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,300
The distance...

929
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,600
Between dominoes

930
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,970
Well, you should separate them a little bit more

931
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,040
Ah, they can't topple?.....Oh, they can.

932
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,640
Wow, the "once per minute" rule...

933
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,810
It's scary, huh?

934
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,810
It is indeed

935
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,680
is really freaking me out

936
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
He wants to know how's the shock

937
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,550
Right, so as to test its strength

938
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,180
What should I do?

939
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,550
He can't stand shocks, right?

940
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,620
It's coming, isn't it? In a minute

941
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,620
Is it coming?

942
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,080
He's waiting for the first one

943
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,720
How strong will it be?

944
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,920
So scary...

945
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,160
But the other guy's totally fine

946
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,290
I think I can't do this

947
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,790
Well, after all, it's Nishimura

948
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:34,360
If I don't know how strong it will be...

949
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,400
Nishimura is totally oblivious

950
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,430
Wow, this is something. I...

951
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,700
I'm scared

952
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,970
Ah, it's coming

953
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,510
He's laughing

954
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,610
Are you waiting for the first one?

955
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,110
AAAH

956
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,980
That was strong!

957
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,880
This is impossible!

958
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,720
No way I can do this!

959
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,720
No way!

960
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,090
This is impossible!

961
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,960
This is scary!

962
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,760
I think I can't do this...

963
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,890
You were setting them!

964
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,530
Keeping track of the time on your own

965
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:07,360
and predicting the coming shocks.

966
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,200
That's the key to success

967
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,200
Yeah, but...

968
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,100
I'm too scared to set the pieces

969
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,410
Nishimura didn't even flinch

970
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,340
I can't...

971
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,210
I just...

972
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,450
It's just impossible!

973
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,720
I can't do this

974
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,290
This is so tough...

975
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,160
Why, you're setting the pieces just fine!

976
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,090
Leaving "Good at electricity" Nishimura aside,

977
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:43,970
Kotoge can't even set the pieces properly

978
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,670
Out of all the WDT challenges, this is the craziest

979
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,970
That depends on who you ask right?

980
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,940
Why don't you shut the hell up

981
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,050
However, after enduring several shocks...

982
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,250
Oh, isn't he getting used to it?

983
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,200
Instead of predicting the next shocks...

984
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,600
They've just grown used to them

985
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,940
A mastered technique!

986
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,590
It has been one and a half hour since the start

987
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,600
They have grown used to the electricity, but...

988
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,070
...this happens

989
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,600
AaAAAA

990
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,670
Wow this is bad

991
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:55,970
That can happen, huh?

992
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,110
He lost the progress...

993
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,080
What a fool

994
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,880
Surprisingly, Nishimura rebuilt it quickly

995
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,520
and caught up again with Kotoge. But then...

996
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,320
Wait! Wait!

997
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,110
Didn't even get a shock!

998
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,460
Oh, it stopped there

999
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,230
Might be the difference in experience

1000
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:27,240
After all the progress, he ends up toppling them without even getting shocked

1001
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,340
On the other hand, Kotoge...

1002
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:36,980
It usually comes after setting 10-15 pieces

1003
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,820
Each minute

1004
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,820
No way

1005
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:40,940
Yes

1006
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:45,420
So when the time comes, I'm ready

1007
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,900
They seem to finally be able to time the shocks

1008
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,160
However...

1009
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,630
Ah, it's coming

1010
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,640
Careful!

1011
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,140
Wow!

1012
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,340
AAAH

1013
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,940
WOoow!

1014
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,940
It hurts!!

1015
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,110
All the progress gone!

1016
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,880
Noooo

1017
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,650
NO NO NO NO

1018
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,380
NO NO NO NO

1019
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,620
That sucks!!

1020
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,220
That's the worst!

1021
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,920
That is terrible

1022
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,920
That's the worst

1023
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,390
So depressing

1024
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,260
They toppled, huh?

1025
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,090
"They toppled, huh?"

1026
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,730
That's awful

1027
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,130
They toppled so beautifully

1028
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,670
Since you're good at this...

1029
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:36,210
..they toppled so beautifully, no?

1030
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:36,870
I see

1031
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,740
He's something

1032
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:42,380
They spend a total of 5 hours and 30 minutes

1033
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,410
5 hours and 30 minutes!!

1034
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,410
but they couldn't clear the domino challenge

1035
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,020
I see...

1036
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,020
Wow

1037
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,420
They were so close though

1038
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,420
Yeah, they were!

1039
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,390
They couldn't clear it...

1040
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,320
That was something

1041
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,660
What about this one, Matsumoto san?

1042
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,390
Piece of cake, I'd say

1043
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,390
What a liar

1044
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,460
He must be kidding

1045
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,460
So you can do it, right?

1046
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,500
I think so, yeah

1047
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,300
No, you only have the power to refuse it

1048
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,770
If we were to begin right now

1049
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,770
I see, huh

1050
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:06,440
I see

1051
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,800
If the staff prepared the challenge right now...

1052
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:07,600
That's right

1053
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,800
If they brought it now

1054
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,880
He'd be like: "You really thought I meant it?"

1055
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:39,870

Next week: If professionals did teacher impressions, students would die of laughter "theory"

1058
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,250
And also!

1059
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:25,420
"The stronger the tsukkomi is, the funnier it gets" theory

1060
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:35,430
"People won't notice if a famous song with changed lyrics is played in a store" theory

1061
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,870
And finally, "When you're holding a urine sample, you become powerless" theory
