00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,200
So everyone, we're finally starting!

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Yeah! Let's do this!

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,040
Amazingly, this is now the 7th installment.

50
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,070
Well, the previous 6th installment was a really ground-breaking compilation episode.

51
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,240
We had to retell some of our funny stories again here.

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,740
Some people were even retelling another person's story!

53
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,130
What a fresh, new idea!

54
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,840
We had a blast of a time, and after that

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,460
we were inundated by comedians

56
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,940
saying they wanted to appear too

57
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,640
and so we have 5 comedians debuting, all at once today!

58
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,660
Everyone on this side is a newcomer.

59
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,550
First of all, is Football Hour's Goto!

60
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,760
Thank you.

61
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,690
And next is Toshi, from Taka and Toshi.

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,030
Thank you.

63
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,640
And then Tsukaji from Drunk Dragon.

64
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,640
It's great to be with you! Thank you!

65
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,080
And Hachimitsu Jiro from Tokyo Dynamite!

66
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,820
And finally, Chad Mullane from Jipang Jouriku Sakusen!

67
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,350
Thank you very much.

68
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,010
There's an intense sense of anxiety, isn't there?

69
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,010
Maybe I shouldn't say this but, this show is now on DVD

70
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,360
and it has surprisingly sold pretty well and...

71
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,420
it isn't the reason I do this, but, my bank savings have increased somewhat.

72
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,170
Surely you don't need anymore money!

73
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,370
It's not the aim of this show. but if you do well on this show

74
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,820
you will reap the rewards afterwards.

75
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,100
So 50 billion and how much did you say you have?

76
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,440
50 billion!?

77
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,050
I don't!

78
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,390
Rules are simple.

79
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,780
They toss an 8-sided die with all of their names on it

80
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,030
and the person faced up will tell a funny story.

81
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,640
As long as it's funny, they are allowed to repeat the story as many times as they want.

82
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,960
It's a very simple show, where they spend one hour only using a die!

83
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,910
Well then, let's get to it!

84
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,680
Well here I go! We're starting!

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,600
TOSHI

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,490
Toshi

87
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,940
Heck yeah....

88
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,540
So, it's me? Ok.

89
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,840
There's a junior comedy duo to me called

90
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,840
Zabungle from a different agency,

91
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,400
but anyway, they were writing jokes

92
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,450
at a family restaurant late at night.

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,670
Their skits usually consists of the fool being unreasonable

94
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,390
and the two end up arguing.

95
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,640
Anyway, they then began to rehearse it together

96
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,400
but after a while they got a bit too into it

97
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,420
and their voices became a bit loud.

98
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,480
And suddenly, a gentleman wearing a suit

99
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,550
and a hat slammed his table and said

100
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,040
"You guys are being really noisy there!"

101
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,560
"Why are you fighting at a place like this!?"

102
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,110
"Go outside if you're gonna fight!"

103
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,300
He thought it was a fight.

104
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,650
"There are other customers here, you know!"

105
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,650
The two didn't know what to do, so apologised.

106
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,590
he yelled "Get your act together!",

107
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,840
then stood up and told them to step outside.

108
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,130
Then on the way out he turned and said

109
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,220
"I've been listening this whole time..." and he looked at the fool

110
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,120
and goes "You're the one at fault!"

111
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,940
Of course it is!

112
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,330
He would've been saying stupid stuff a lot.

113
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,960
Of course it is.

114
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,760
Because he only says unreasonable stuff.

115
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,120
Okay, let's go.

116
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,980
Miyagawa

117
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,080
Please wait a second.

118
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,120
Wait, what? You've got 3 books?!

119
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,120
You've written heaps!

120
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,120
I've decided, this is it.

121
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,710
When I was in middle school, I was part of the boys scout

122
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,760
and once you're in middle school,

123
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,630
you become a leader of some cub scouts.

124
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,010
Since cub scouts aren't yet in primary school

125
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,500
they can't sleep in the tents at the campsite

126
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,320
and have to sleep at a ryokan or something, no matter what.

127
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,500
A ryokan is a traditional Japanese inn

128
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,080
So anyway, we hiked for the day, and they stayed at the ryokan.

129
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,300
And at around 9:30pm, I was told to go and patrol the area.

130
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,960
So, I went to patrol, and looked around

131
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,630
where they were sleeping with a torch

132
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,440
when I saw one of them crying in the corner.

133
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,350
I thought, "He must be homesick"

134
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,800
"Homesick on the very first night, huh? I've gotta cheer him up."

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,010
So, I crept up to him, and saw it was a kid called Takeuchi-kun.

136
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,720
Takeuchi-kun was all sniveling so...

137
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,460
I asked, "Takeuchi-kun, are you ok?"

138
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,900
"Why're you crying? Are you Homesick?"

139
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,330
and he goes "Nooo".

140
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,210
So I asked, "Huh? Then what's wrong?".

141
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,330
He slowly took his hand from under the blanket

142
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,970
and there was a female stag beetle clamped on his thumb.

143
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,940
Clamped really tight....

144
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,820
Takeuchi's thumb was getting all white.

145
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,530
When I asked "What happened, Takeuchi-kun?"

146
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,670
he said, "I found it while hiking, and put it in my pocket."

147
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,170
"I just remembered about it so put my hand in to check and it....

148
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,800
...OW OW OW OWWWCH!"

149
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,800
As he was speaking the beetle clamped even harder.

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,420
Right at that instant?

151
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,400
Right at that instant it clamped harder.

152
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,040
I said, "Are you ok"?

153
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,430
"No, I just cau...OWWWOWW!!"

154
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,920
Poor Takeuchi-kun.

155
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,350
I felt really sorry for him.

156
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,690
Well, very funny stories aren't they?

157
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,780
It's already funny.

158
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,460
Amazing.

159
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,230
GOTO

160
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,490
Errr, this is a story about my mum.

161
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,450
My mum is a bit strange....

162
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,720
...for example, she's 50+ years and used money that I sent her

163
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,920
for plastic surgery to get double eye-lids.

164
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,840
At that age?

165
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,190
She's that kind of unusual parent.

166
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,640
Anyway, when I was in senior high, I brought a girlfriend home for the first time.

167
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,330
My mum seemed a bit agitated.

168
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,040
She was thinking like, "Who the heck is this girl?"

169
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,110
and she said, "Have a seat. I'll cook you some pizza toast."

170
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,110
How stylish.

171
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,110
She was showing off a bit, huh?

172
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,750
Yeah, she wouldn't usually make that stuff.

173
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,540
She said "Eat", so we were just eating, when...

174
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,470
....she asked the girlfriend, "What does your dad do?"

175
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,770
"Oh, my dad is just an ordinary office worker".

176
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,200
Then my mum goes, "Stop talking, and quickly eat".

177
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,790
She was totally agitated.

178
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,670
So I said "Let's go to my room"

179
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,080
and took my girlfriend to my room.

180
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,610
But my mum yells, "Wait! You can't close your door though".

181
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,380
"Ain't ya gonna get up to mischief?"

182
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,270
"Leave your door open!".

183
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,730
So I'm like "Fine, fine...." and leaved it open.

184
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,340
Then my mum says "I'm going shopping".

185
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,530
"But keep your door open!".

186
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,550
Wow!

187
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,720
She wouldn't shut up about it.

188
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,870
So anyway, she went.

189
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,380
But since she went, I wanted to close the door...

190
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,590
...and, you know, do some cheeky stuff.

191
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,480
So I closed the door but, I was a bit scared

192
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,350
since mum told me not to, so I kept it open just ajar.

193
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,320
I couldn't bring myself to shut it completely.

194
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,830
So I was talking with my girlfriend for a bit and...

195
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,560
...the mood became good so I put my arms around her

196
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,040
and was just about to kiss her, when I felt a presence.

197
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,660
I turned to the gap beween the door,

198
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,190
and my mum was peeking in.

199
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,520
Usually when you peek, you peek like this, right?

200
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,360
My mum was like this.

201
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,460
She wanted to see it properly or something!

202
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,240
I got pretty pissed off about that and

203
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,070
yelled "What're you doing mum!?"

204
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,290
and she jerked her head away,

205
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,430
but her glasses were still stuck in the gap.

206
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,580
After a short pause, she grabbed it out.

207
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,170
It was only her glasses for a bit?

208
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,670
It was just her glasses for a bit

209
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,200
Wow! What a powerful mum!

210
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,680
She is powerful.

211
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,270
Well then, here we go.

212
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,110
TSUKAJI

213
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,230
Oh wow, it's going to the newcomers a lot today.

214
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,110
Yes it is.

215
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,210
This is about when I was in 1st year of senior high.

216
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,960
My Japanese history teacher was

217
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
very against boys and girls socialising.

218
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,140
Even if a boy and girl were just talking he'd ask, "What are you talking about?"

219
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,180
If a boy and girl were walking home, he'd pull them apart too.

220
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,040
It was so extreme that some students asked  him,

221
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,200
"Aren't you taking it too far?"

222
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,170
and he said "I'm not against relationships".

223
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,840
"I don't care what you do after school

224
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,210
but I want you to concentrate on school while at school".

225
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,680
So I thought "Oh, how admirable".

226
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,820
but the teacher was almost 50 and not married,

227
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,920
so we asked if he had a partner

228
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,160
and he said "I don't have one, and don't need one".

229
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,300
"If I had the time for that, I'd rather

230
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,260
learn more about Japanese history".

231
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,850
We were impressed but, he's still a man and...

232
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,350
...so we asked if he gets frustrated at all

233
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,280
and he said, "If you're passionate enough about one thing,

234
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,660
you don't think at all about dirty things".

235
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,630
So he's like, "I guess you could kinda say,

236
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,540
Japanese history is my partner".

237
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,150
It's pretty lame now that I think about it,

238
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,690
but I thought it was cool at the time.

239
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,480
Anyway, there was a person called Kurisu Yoshihiko

240
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,760
in my Japanese history class

241
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,240
The "kuri" as in chestnut, and "su" as in nest.

242
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,470
Ohh, so he wasn't half Japanese?

243
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,910
Kurisu is how Japanese pronounce Chris.

244
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Yeah, it was his surname.

245
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,080
Yeah some people have that name.

246
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,010
So when the teacher tried to get him to answer a question

247
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,440
he said "Okay, you answer, Toris".

248
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,840
Obviously he was thinking of something dirty!

249
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,990
*Kurisu-torisu, sounds like Clitoris.

250
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,160
He imagined that just from the sound of the name!

251
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
He was thinking of the later half.

252
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,140
He must've thought it sounded like something!

253
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,200
It was totally inspired by that!

254
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,290
Yeah kinda sounds like another word

255
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,480
Man, that's horrible. Everyone's faces would've turned red.

256
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,320
The teacher was the reddest, so no doubt it's what he was thinking about.

257
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,040
Oh nice. Nice stories, hey?

258
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
Yeah.

259
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
MIYAGAWA

260
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,630
Can't you do something about that?

261
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,600
Nope.

262
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,190
Please hurry up!

263
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,190
Stop complaining!

264
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,190
But he does it every time.

265
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,320
Yeah, I know.

266
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,210
It says "Funny Story #7".

267
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,530
You don't need a title!

268
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,840
Just so you don't mistake it with #8.

269
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,920
I'll go with this one.

270
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,060
This is about when I was in 1st Grade of middle school.

271
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,430
My math teacher was a man called Mr. Terao.

272
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,890
He was such a strange teacher, we nicknamed him "Monsieur Terao".

273
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,960
His hair was naturally curly, but had an undercut and....

274
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,820
...he had on coke bottle glasses, while wearing track pants

275
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:45,260
So, anyway, when he's writing on the board, his ass pops out.

276
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,040
'Cuz he writes like this.

277
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,200
We can't help chuckling when we see that.

278
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,800
And when we laugh, he goes, *clap, clap*, "You there, no laughing!"

279
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,840
He's like, "You there, no laughing".

280
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,760
And we'd see that, and laugh again. So that's what he was like.

281
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,910
I liked that teacher, and enjoyed seeing him.

282
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,920
Anyway, around the end of the first semester

283
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,590
the teacher came to class with a broken arm, cracked front teeth and scrape marks.

284
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,630
And he's casually like, "Okay, let's get started".

285
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,370
But a student asked "Um, err, what happened to you, sir?"

286
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:28,270
and he said, "Well actually, I stayed at school until quite late last night and....

287
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,930
...it was hot so I decided to swim in the pool before going home".

288
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,680
"So, I went to the pool, but the lights were off and it was pitch black".

289
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,760
"Anyway, I took off my glasses and jumped in".

290
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,320
"I jumped in but, there was no water inside".

291
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,420
What an utter fail!

292
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,410
His eyes are so bad he needs coke bottle glasses so...

293
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,710
...he couldn't anything, so when he jumped in he crashed

294
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,760
What a massive fail!

295
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,760
It was an utter fail!

296
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,330
He dived straight in?

297
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,030
Everyone who heard that, started laughing....

298
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,940
...and he goes, "No laughing!".

299
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,080
It was the day when they changed the water.

300
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,850
Funny stuff.... Here I go.

301
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,850
GOTO

302
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,670
Hooooh, I see.

303
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,400
In addition to my mother....

304
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,400
...my dad is also quite a weird person.

305
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,670
Or rather than weird, should I say, he has no aspirations.

306
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,230
He doesn't give kids things to aspire about.

307
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,300
I was in the lower grades of primary school and...

308
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,610
...on the night of Christmas Eve...

309
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,840
...I was waiting impatiently in bed for Santa to bring presents.

310
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:00,190
I was thinking, "Surely he'll bring presents, even next to my pillow!".

311
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,170
So, it was midnight, and I had fallen asleep.

312
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,940
The front door slams open and someone yells

313
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,220
"HEEEEY!! SANTA'S BACK HOME!"

314
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,240
and it was dad returning home.

315
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,590
How obvious.

316
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,310
I was like, "Well this sucks".

317
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,540
He screams, "I BOUGHT YA'LL A PRESENT!".

318
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,640
He even gives away that he bought it.

319
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,230
He's saying everything.

320
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,370
And he goes "Oh, sleepin' soundly eh? I'll leave your present here!".

321
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,900
I pretended to be asleep...

322
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,500
...thinking, "Oh well, he got me a present, it's okay I guess."

323
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,850
The next morning I woke up excited to open it up

324
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,820
so I looked next to my pillow, and the present was a library book.

325
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,780
A library book!

326
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
He borrowed it!

327
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,680
Yes, and I had to go return it 2 days later!

328
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,640
And the book was also called, "New Years Around The World".

329
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,640
It has nothing to do with Christmas!

330
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,920
He's already thinking of something 1 week later!

331
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,390
It's hard to tell if he has aspirations or not.

332
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,980
It's starting to be a bit one-sided today.

333
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,480
TSUKAJI

334
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,880
This is about my comedy partner, Suzuki.

335
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,210
Urgent announcement!!

336
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,420
Due to rave reviews of Hitoshi Matsymoto's Suberanai Hanashi Episode 1

337
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,080
we've decided to release a 2nd installment!

338
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,860
For more information, visit the show's homepage address!

339
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,560
The DVD this time will again be...!?

340
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,110
Funny stuff!

341
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,420
This is about my comedy partner, Suzuki.

342
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,020
I'm sure many have noticed already but.....

343
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,960
....he's quite unbelievably stupid.

344
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,740
For example, he'd endlessly blow on noodles that are served cold.

345
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,360
And that wasn't only once.

346
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,270
I even told him, "That's cold so you don't have to blow it".

347
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,590
and he's like "Oh yeah!", but it seems like he can't eat it without blowing.

348
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,020
That's how weird he is.

349
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,610
We were with Ogi-Yahagi and ordered some food to be delivered to our agency.

350
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,080
We wanted lunch, but couldn't be bothered going out for it, so go it delivered.

351
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,920
We got Suzuki to call them, and told him to order the curry and whatnot that Ogi and Yahagi wanted.

352
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,390
So Suzuki went off and called a place and said,

353
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,630
"Hello. Mr. Ogi wants curry, and Mr. Yahagi wants a katsu lunch box and..."

354
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,910
Even though the other guy wouldn't know who they are!

355
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,040
How embarrassing.

356
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,680
Also, the thing that shocked me the most happened when we did a show with animals.

357
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:02,780
We've done work with giraffes several times...

358
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,240
...and at the time me and other staff are on site

359
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,360
but for some reason, Suzuki and the giraffe....

360
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,990
Well, let's say, Suzuki is standing here.

361
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,300
The giraffe would swing his head back and smash him away.

362
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,200
The giraffe does?

363
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,640
Yes. It happened to Suzuki twice and...

364
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,520
...even the zoo keeper was like "I've never seen that happen before".

365
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,430
Apparently, Giraffe's only do that when they perceive someone as an enemy.

366
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:34,220
For some reason giraffes think Suzuki's an enemy, and they all go and slam him away!

367
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,210
Something's wrong with him, if giraffes think of him that way.

368
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,480
Somethings different about his biological makeup.

369
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,410
That's funny, wow.

370
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,410
Hey Junior, can you toss it?

371
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,350
Chad and Hachimitsu haven't spoken yet?

372
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,710
Hopefully soon, or it'd get harder to speak.

373
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,450
Here I go then.

374
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,400
TSUKAJI

375
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,580
Maybe it's Tsukaji day today?

376
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,920
Well, let's see...this is a story of when I was in middle school.

377
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,880
At the time, Bebop Highschool was very popular and...

378
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,720
...it was a time when everyone looked up to delinquents.

379
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,600
There were incidences like people getting hunted for uniforms by kids from other schools.

380
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,780
Anyway, when I was in 3rd grade of middle school

381
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,140
there was like an uprising of the 2nd years.

382
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,250
Yes, there was a strange time like that.

383
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,020
Anyway, one day after school, I think in summer...

384
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,550
I was changing in the kendo club locker room when...

385
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:46,840
five of the 3rd year delinquent guys came in.

386
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,050
But they were all friends of mine from primary school...

387
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,710
and they said "We're going to go and brawl with the 2nd graders now".

388
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,170
This was because the 2nd graders wouldn't pay respect to the 3rd graders.

389
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,990
As they thought they were tougher than 3rd years.

390
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,820
They wanted all 3rd graders to greet 2nd graders, or something.

391
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,160
They wanted to gather as many fighters as they could, so they asked me to come.

392
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,930
I wasn't necessarily a fierce guy, but they were all my friends so....

393
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,720
I said "Ok, I'll go", and so I did.

394
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,200
And seriously, there was about thirty 3rd graders gathered near a lake

395
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
waiting for the 2nd graders.

396
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,040
Eventually the 2nd graders appeared and...

397
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:35,050
there were only about 20, but they all had wooden swords and kendo sticks.

398
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,070
The 3rd graders were yelling like, "Hey, those cheaters have wooden swords and stuff!".

399
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,440
When I looked closer, they were all from my club.

400
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,920
They were the wooden swords and bamboo sticks from my kendo clubroom

401
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,200
and since I was kendo captain I was worried about getting in trouble

402
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,750
and peoples' kendo stick getting wrecked.

403
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,130
When I looked at their leader, the stick that he held

404
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,800
was the stick that I use for official bouts, and take extremely good care of!

405
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,330
I used to repair the leather on it...

406
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,900
...and even the tsuba, I went all the way from Osaka to a shop in Wakayama to get it!

407
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,900
The tsuba is the hand guard on the sword.

408
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,870
I knew for sure it was mine!

409
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,840
Anyway, a junior from the kendo club looking sorry over there.

410
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,080
He was my junior, so I was like "What the heck are ya doin'!?"

411
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,650
"I've got a fight in one month, and I was planning to use that stick so....

412
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,970
...I'm gonna be pissed if it breaks!"

413
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,630
But then everyone was going "Let's gooooo!".

414
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,640
and the 3rd and 2nd graders were all out brawling

415
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,660
while I found that junior, and was yelling "Why did ya give it to him!?"

416
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,450
"Why did ya give everyone kendo sticks!!"

417
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,680
While everyone was arguing about who's gonna greet who,

418
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,380
I just kept banging on about the kendo sticks.

419
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,210
Well, that's quite an incident.

420
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
MATSUMOTO

421
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,590
So now's, the time?

422
00:22:54,590 --> 00:23:02,600
Well I think you've begun to sense that my mum is also quite strange.

423
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,080
This happened today. Seriously, today.

424
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,100
A certain tv program showed me doing the opening baseball pitch at a game

425
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,800
and my mum called me saying, "That was nice....." and stuff.

426
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,850
She often lies a lot. She said, "It was nice....

427
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,780
EVERYONE in Amagasaki is saying so."

428
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,830
Amagasaki: Matsumoto's home town.

429
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,840
As if they would be.

430
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,570
That's definitely a lie!

431
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:32,170
She's a strange mother, but when I was about 20 years old...

432
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,920
Well, actually, I'm the youngest out of three children and...

433
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,290
...I had turned 20, so she said that she was lonely.

434
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,150
And she said "You've all become adults, so I want another child."

435
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,330
But it's kinda impossible for her to bear a child at her age.

436
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,770
Anyway, I don't know what she was thinking but

437
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:56,110
when I came home one day, she was holding a toy baby...

438
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:00,520
...and said, "From today, this is my child".

439
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,200
She even named it Akira!

440
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,910
She's like "Ain't that right, Akira? Ain't that riiight?"

441
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,750
That's creepy!

442
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,630
And when I come home at night she'd wander out while holding Akira.

443
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:23,640
She's say "Just heat up that curry for dinner! Heat up the curry!"

444
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,040
"Ain't that right, Akira? Ain't that riiight?"

445
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,880
Scary, right?

446
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeahhh.

447
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,180
But 2 months later, Akira was abandoned and lying like this.

448
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,440
She's a really creepy mother.

449
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Here we go then.

450
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,890
CHIHARA

451
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,890
Ummm....

452
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,610
This just happened the other day.

453
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:57,130
Currently, the Yoshimoto Shinkigeki is visiting all around the country for their national tour.

454
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:01,930
So people like Imada, Itao, Kimu-nii and others do various stuff

455
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:07,470
but the practice for that occurs in the Lumine at midnight after all other shows end.

456
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,800
Anyway, I love Shishaku Shisho and always listen

457
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,930
to his rakugo tapes while driving to practice.

458
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:17,480
Lumine has an underground car park so I parked there and went up in the elevator

459
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,160
to practice with them at night.

460
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,660
Then my manager says "Excuse me, can I please borrow your car keys?"

461
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,230
so I asked why,

462
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:30,990
and he said that there was nighttime construction going on, and the cars had to be moved outside for a bit.

463
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,480
So they had to take out everyone's cars, including Imada and Kimu-Nii.

464
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,850
I was like, "Okay, go ahead then".

465
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,080
but my managaer, Inagaki, is a paper driver, and has never driven once since getting his license.

466
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,590
So, I assumed he'd pass the key to one of the many other Yoshimoto managers and get them to move my car.

467
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,710
So he went off to do that, and practice finished around 3:30am.

468
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:56,010
We began to leave, and they announced that Imada's car had been returned to the car park.

469
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:01,050
So Imada leaved, and then next Kimu-nii's car came, so he leaved.

470
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:05,960
But mine wouldn't come at all! Even after waiting 30 minutes!

471
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,250
It was strange so I went downstairs, but it wouldn't come

472
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:15,360
so I walked to the car park where they said they moved it to

473
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,050
when some other guy's manager came and said

474
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,080
"I'm sorry, Inagaki crashed your car".

475
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,150
"Whaaat!? Why did you let Inagaki drive it?!"

476
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:30,670
But you know how Yoshimoto is like.

477
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,720
Inagaki probably said he can't drive

478
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,860
but his seniors were probably like "I don't give a damn! We're low on help!!"

479
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,300
So he probably was forced to drive for the first time since being licensed.

480
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,980
When I went to the car park, the head lights were off

481
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,280
and it was slightly ahead of the park space, and the doors were wide open.

482
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,240
I look at the front and there's a massive dent.

483
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,930
Quite a huge dent.

484
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:58,540
I was like, "How did you hit it there!?", it was right down the middle!

485
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
Yeah just from parking?

486
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,920
I looked up and Inagaki was there with a horribly sorry face

487
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,500
saying, "I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!"

488
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,480
but from the car I can hear Shishaku Shishou's comedy routine.

489
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,570
Also, he was telling a story was about winning the lottery

490
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,150
and was yelling "I hit it! I hit it! I hit the jackpot!"

491
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,060
I'd never seen people laughing at Shishaku Shishou as much as that time.

492
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,810
Wowww.

493
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,680
Woow, that's amazing.

494
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,960
Maan.

495
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,950
Sure is funny.

496
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,950
When will it not be funny?

497
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,180
I'd like to see when someone's story fails.

498
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,760
TOSHI

499
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:51,500
Back when I just debuted, I had a senior who was a rakugoka.

500
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:56,500
A rakugoka is someone who practices rakugo, a type of solo comedic storytelling.

501
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,040
He said that once a month he borrows a tatami room at an

502
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,210
izakaya ands hold a practice show, so he invited us to attend.

503
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,450
So we said, "Oh yes we'll go".

504
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,640
At the time, it was us, that rakugoka, and also one magician.

505
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:12,490
And we were all changing clothes in a small room before the show.

506
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,140
But you know how magicians have all kinds of secrets tricks?

507
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,240
And since we just debuted, we hadn't seen any of that stuff

508
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,750
and so we were watching in awe when

509
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,010
he put a small umbrella into his sleeve

510
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:28,940
which shoots out when he thrusts his hands out, like this.

511
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,630
And we were quite impressed with that.

512
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,140
So anyway, it was about 30 minutes until the show starts

513
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,360
and my group, were told to open with manzai for 10 minutes,

514
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,020
after which it was the magician's turn and then the rakugoka.

515
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,280
We were fine with that but the magician said "I'm sorry I've got work after this

516
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,100
so please let me go first".

517
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,230
And our senior was like "Oh what? But we're about to start...?"

518
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,940
but said "Oh...ok then", and hesitantly accepted.

519
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,920
But apparently he wasn't really happy about that so

520
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,850
he said "Hey, why would you tell me that now?"

521
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:07,100
"Usually you'd say that the day before or,

522
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,280
when you come in, tell us that you're busy so you would like to start first".

523
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,830
"It's common sense!".

524
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,330
We were like "That's right", but the magician was quite strong-hearted and said

525
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,600
"Well, I didn't know either. I got told about it just then!".

526
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,180
and sort of talked back at him.

527
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:28,120
But the seniors said, "Yeah, so what? You still should have told me earlier!".

528
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,720
"Don't you have any common sense!?"

529
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,100
They began arguing and we didn't know what to do.

530
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,840
Then the rakugoka said "Get your act together!" and shoved the magician.

531
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,960
That made the magician man really angry

532
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,130
and he went to punch, but the umbrella came out.

533
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:47,070
He then tried to put it back and the other umbrella came out.

534
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,480
It was just a huge mess.

535
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,020
He was trying to shove two umbrellas back in.

536
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,020
Since he had them shoved up there...

537
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,400
What a fine line between nervous tension and hilarity.

538
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,870
He was like "Ahh-ahh..".

539
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,810
HACHIMITSU

540
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,150
I actually go on trips overseas quite often.

541
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,580
Even from back when I had no work and no money.

542
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,790
Once I went to Canada with 4 other people

543
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,140
and they were Japanese, but could speak English

544
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,570
and had traveled around a lot themselves before.

545
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,860
But buying presents is hard right? You can't just keep getting chocolates for people.

546
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:34,480
Anyway, Canada's got some pretty good drugstores, so I was suggested to buy medicine.

547
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,550
For example, their cold medicine makes you sleep easily, because it's made for Western people's bodies.

548
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:44,000
The pain killers are also good, and the boxes are quite cute and interesting so

549
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,610
I bought heaps of stuff at this drugstore.

550
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:52,270
But when I brought all of it to the register, the guy there went ballistic.

551
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:56,720
He was like "Why are ya buying so much? You can't take all this back to Japan!".

552
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,280
Or that's what I thought he was saying, and I got scared

553
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,560
so I backed off and got a guy that understands English

554
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:09,260
and told him about the situation, and asked him to interpret for me

555
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,520
and turns out that he was asking if I have a point card.

556
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,720
"If you buy this much, you'll get 3 or 4 free!".

557
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,080
That's such a tiny incident!

558
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,050
He was totally going off at me though.

559
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,010
He turned out to be a really nice guy though, huh?

560
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,490
He must be a really kind guy.

561
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,800
That was a slightly heartwarming story.

562
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,700
MATSUMOTO

563
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,650
I'll tell you a short one then.

564
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,120
Even now I have a column in Playboy...

565
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:05,230
Even now I have a column in Playboy.

566
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:09,020
Well it's not like I write anything but

567
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,250
they interview me and they write down whatever I say.

568
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,460
So, this happened to the person in charge of that job at the time. Not anymore.

569
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,710
Anyway, when I was talking in the interview, suddenly.....

570
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,780
His nose started bleeding.

571
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,070
Blood suddenly dribbled out of his nose.

572
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,600
Not snot, but blood?

573
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,240
Yeah it suddenly came out so I was like, "Are you ok!?"

574
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
"Maybe we should stop for today?"

575
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,950
"No, no, there's no way we can stop".

576
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:39,500
"Let's continue. Please let me continue".

577
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,140
"But please allow me a tissue"

578
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,270
and he rolled one up in there.

579
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,400
It was soaked with blood up to half way.

580
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,910
And even while talking more, it was still coming out so

581
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,910
I said "Shouldn't we just stop this?"

582
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,960
"Sorry, let's continue. I would like to continue".

583
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,160
"But please let me lie down".

584
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,890
All the while I'm talking, and he's just lying down.

585
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,520
Why doesn't he just stop!?

586
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,810
Just stop!

587
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,220
That was a shock.

588
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,290
It's going around pretty evenly aside from Chad.

589
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,730
It's about time.

590
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,500
HACHIMITSU

591
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,560
When I was in middle school, my generation totally loved Bebop Highschool.

592
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,870
I grew up in a place called Kurashiki in Okayama, and we were total bad ass delinquents

593
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,830
Now I'm 100 kg, but I used to be 120kg

594
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,640
and my hair was standing up way out here and...

595
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,850
...I rode a bicycle like this.

596
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,470
A bicycle?

597
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,740
Yeah, a bicycle.

598
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,360
And on the back I had those pegs so people could stand on it...

599
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,770
and we used to roam the streets a lot like that.

600
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:04,840
Anyway, during summer, bats fly past quite low around the residential areas.

601
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,210
You look and think they might be sparrows or swallows, but they're often actually bats.

602
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,240
So one day, we were roaming around in a line of 7-8 people, chatting.

603
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,200
There was a guy that's the best looking, and most popular, called Ishida...

604
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,340
...and a bat flew into his mouth.

605
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,070
But only I managed to see that happened.

606
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,440
So I stopped everyone and said "Hey! A bat just flew into Ishida's mouth!".

607
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,540
But everyone heard that and was just like "Yeah right. As if".

608
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,970
and Ishida likes to seem like a cool dude

609
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,160
so even when I asked him if it went in, he said "No it didn't".

610
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,900
So I was then called a liar.

611
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,410
But it definitely went into Ishida's mouth and...

612
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:50,140
...when he closed his mouth, the wings flapped out, and it flew away.

613
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,760
I definitely saw it!

614
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,710
But I was called a liar, and no one believed me.

615
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,310
"Bats use sonar and stuff, so no way that'd happen".

616
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,460
It was like I was a big fat liar.

617
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,580
4 years after that, everyone started getting car licenses

618
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,760
and around 5am, on the highway

619
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,760
there's about 4 lanes and nobody is using them.

620
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,360
So we'd fill our cars with bucket loads of water bombs

621
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,030
and we'd throw them at each other while laughing our asses off.

622
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,030
Having water bomb wars and stuff.

623
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,870
We'd close the windows to defend, and when attacking we'd throw again....

624
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,560
...and a water bomb went straight into Ishida's mouth.

625
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,960
Without bursting too!

626
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,650
A water balloon that usually bursts so easily, went into his mouth unbroken.

627
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,000
And from then, everyone's like "Oh that story from 4 years ago about

628
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,360
a bat flying into his mouth must be true!".

629
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,270
Finally after 4 years.

630
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,020
Nice.

631
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,650
Here I go.

632
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,230
CHAD

633
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,720
Finally my turn, huh.

634
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,850
Err, well this is something I've noticed recently.

635
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,440
Something you noticed?

636
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,760
Yes.

637
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
So you're announcing something you noticed?

638
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,980
I had always wanted to be a comedian since I was a little kid

639
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,960
and I just happened to come to Japan as a highschooler

640
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,020
when I found Japanese comedy, and was astounded that such a world existed.

641
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:37,520
I knew I had to be a comedian in Japan, so went back, graduated high school

642
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,350
and then went to Yoshimoto's NSC in Osaka

643
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:45,630
and without even knowing left from right I....

644
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,500
...I tried and tried my best, but, even after a year, it wasn't enough so...

645
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
...I became an apprentice.

646
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,230
So I became an apprentice to Bonchi Osamu from Za Bonchi, who I considered to be the funniest at the time.

647
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,930
Everyday, all day for 2 years I followed him around, learned many things

648
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:06,750
and basically.....I just tried my best.

649
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,440
I read lots of different books.

650
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,410
I tried lots of different things to try and make Japanese people laugh.

651
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,560
Even working as a dog walker.

652
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,510
I did horrible things like that and...

653
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:25,870
together with my comedy partner, we'd make just 520 yen each month

654
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:29,400
which, after tax was 225 yen each.. We had a harsh life like that.

655
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,270
I also had problems, like, not being able to get my visa.

656
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,940
My group's name is Jipangu Jouriku Sakusen,

657
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,880
Means: Japan Disembarkation Strategy

658
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,960
but it almost became Japan Disembarkation Failure.

659
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,510
But I tried, and tried, and finally got the embassy to accept me

660
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,570
and I also finally became able to speak a lot but I recently realised..

661
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,440
...that I used to get more laughs when I spoke more broken Japanese.

662
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,030
I see.

663
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,030
You're too fluent now?

664
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,030
I seee.

665
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,930
My jokes got heaps of laughs back then.

666
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,970
He's saying stuff like "Not knowing right from left"!

667
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,040
Do you know what we call situations like this in Australia?

668
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,320
Nooo we don't.

669
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,690
What?

670
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,440
"It's like, have a look at yourself under the table

671
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,080
you can find some jellybeans there".

672
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,220
And what does that mean?

673
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,180
Have a look at the jellybeans under the table.

674
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,400
Right now, you're a bit like that.

675
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,200
The heck does that mean!?

676
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,230
What does even that mean?

677
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,420
It means you're a useless person.

678
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,140
That's an Australian saying?

679
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,870
Well okay, that was good though.

680
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,910
Well, I don't know if the situation is good but...umm....

681
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,140
Go!

682
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,760
CHIHARA

683
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,090
This is about 10 years or so ago but....

684
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:05,230
in Osaka there's a downtown nightlife area called Soemoncho and

685
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,560
I went there with a group after work for a meal

686
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,800
and we were walking around there at about 4:00 am

687
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,150
when we heard a lady scream "You freakin' bitch!"

688
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,960
We went to see what it was, and two hostesses were

689
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,520
having a massive fight, but, both of them had

690
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,840
taken off a high heel and....

691
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,530
was yelling, "F**k you bitch!" and attacking each other.

692
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:32,140
"Sneaky bitch! You stole my customer!"

693
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:37,310
But since one leg is higher than the other, they both keep spinning around.

694
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,460
I found that sooo funny!

695
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,690
Physics in action, huh.

696
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,550
Ok, here I go.

697
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,550
MATSUMOTO

698
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,000
Ahhh what should I talk about? Ahhh....

699
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,370
I was driving in a car with Imada...

700
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:05,450
...you know how he likes porn dvd's?

701
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,150
Anyway, he was like "Wanna go to this shop?"

702
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:13,230
so I said "Yeah, alright", and the outside of the shop was small

703
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,870
but inside, it stretched extremely far out...

704
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:20,910
...and I was saying "Woaah, the collection here is amazing!".

705
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,400
But I got a huge shock when I went into one of the aisles...

706
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,970
...because there was a corner called "Macchan's Recommendation Corner".

707
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,600
Your first time right?

708
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,740
That was the first time I'd been there!

709
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,480
And they had like a cut out of me stuck there...

710
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,950
...on a spring and it was bobbling from the cooler's breeze!

711
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,610
You've gotta be kidding me!

712
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,320
I totally complained to the shop owner though.

713
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,540
But the products in the corner were some seriously good stuff.

714
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,630
After all.

715
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,630
After all.

716
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,520
How dare they just do that though!

717
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,830
MIYAGAWA

718
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,770
Errrr....

719
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,990
This happened when I was in 1st grade of middle school.

720
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,500
I just desperately wanted to touch some breasts.

721
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,770
Well it happens.

722
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,510
I just had to touch breasts no matter what.

723
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,550
And so I came up with an idea...

724
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:31,520
I have a sister who is 2 years older than me.

725
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,700
So I was like "Fuck it, I'mma touch my sister's boobs".

726
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:43,100
Maaan, they're all funny, hey?

727
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,650
Urgent announcement!!

728
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,890
Due to rave reviews of Hitoshi Matsumoto's Suberanai Hanashi Episode 1...

729
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,460
we've released the 2nd installment!

730
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,380
For more information, access the shows homepage!

731
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,300
This happened when I was in 1st grade of middle school.

732
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,780
I just desperately wanted to touch some breasts.

733
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,070
Well, it happens.

734
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,740
I really wanted to touch some breasts.

735
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,730
And so, I came up with an idea.

736
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,700
I have a sister who is 2 years older than me.

737
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,460
So I was like "Fuck it, I'mma touch my sister's boobs".

738
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,240
That's desperate.

739
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,560
That's pretty messed up.

740
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,210
So that's what I decided, but...

741
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,800
I can't just go up to her and say "Hey sis, can I touch your boobs?"

742
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,110
There's no choice but to touch them when she's asleep.

743
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,640
Right? And so....

744
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,410
...anyway, my sister went off to have a bath

745
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,010
and it was my chance because mum and dad weren't home that night.

746
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,010
It was just her, me and grandma...

747
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,630
and grandma was in her room, so it was my chance!

748
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:57,870
After thinking what to do, I decided to lie and wait under my sister's bed.

749
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,290
Eventually, I heard my sister getting out of the bath

750
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:08,510
and thought "Now's the time!", so

751
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,840
I quickly went over, and slipped under her bed

752
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,760
and breathed quietly as I waited.

753
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,100
Then my sister came up the stairs and...

754
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,480
...was changing into her pajamas or something above me.

755
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,740
But at that point, I had killed my presence.

756
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,890
And was breathing quietly so I don't get caught.

757
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:34,490
But even though she changed clothes, it takes time before you actually sleep, right?

758
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,680
Reading books and whatnot.

759
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,480
All during that, I was waiting the whole time underneath.

760
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,480
That's amazing, huh?

761
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,050
Then after about 1 hour later...

762
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:51,500
...I heard some clicking noises, and it became dark.

763
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,710
It might have been a chance, but her sleep wasn't deep enough yet.

764
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:59,420
So I waited for about 20 minutes more.

765
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,180
After that I decided it was time to get out but

766
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,620
if I made a noise and she heard me, it'd be a disaster so

767
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,640
very slowly.....VERY slowly I....

768
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,080
...spent about 30 minutes to creep out.

769
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,740
How desperately do you wanna touch'em!?

770
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,280
So I got my whole body from underneath the bed...

771
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,800
and then I spent about another 5 minutes to stand.

772
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,660
So my sister was sleeping, and I crept over.

773
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,660
Pretend that's my sister's head.

774
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,290
and I was here hiding and breathing quietly.

775
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,380
But if I just grabbed it suddenly, she'd wake up, right?

776
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,560
So I had to take this slowly, especially since I came this far.

777
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,990
I was wondering what to do but

778
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:52,810
my sister would breath, and her chest would move as well as her breasts.

779
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:56,380
Firstly, I realised that I shouldn't disrupt that movement.

780
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:02,400
If I pressed against the flow and my sister woke up

781
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,250
I'd be in trouble so I first moved in sync with her breath

782
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,150
and went in like this....

783
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,020
My sister didn't wake up. She didn't notice.

784
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,600
I rode that flow for about a minute...

785
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,160
...before I finally went against it.

786
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,720
I went against it.

787
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,340
I was like, "Woah, boobs are so soft!"

788
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,370
But as I thought that, my sister jumped up

789
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,820
and shouted, so I thought "Oh crap"

790
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,120
and there'd be no point making an excuse so I just went straight to my room.

791
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,030
So I went back to my room and was like "Ohhh crap!".

792
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,550
But anyway, I went to sleep thinking "Maybe it'll be ok. Please God, help me!".

793
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:51,560
The next morning, my mum was home making me breakfast

794
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,820
so I was just eating some bread.

795
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,870
while thinking, "I wonder if mum knows about it yet?"

796
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,920
when my sister suddenly screamed "Waaaahhhh!!".

797
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,840
She came running down from upstairs.

798
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,910
I was thinking "Oh shit, I'm gonna be busted" when she said

799
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:10,300
"Daisuke! Mum! A ghost appeared yesterday!!".

800
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,930
And my hand holding the bread was just shaking so hard.

801
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,250
"Oh a ghost appeared?"

802
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,350
"Woaah, that's scary"

803
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,350
"That's scary"

804
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,570
and I chucked my bread down

805
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:27,850
and went to school two buses earlier than usual.

806
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,370
CHAD

807
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,920
My great great great grandfather...

808
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,840
CHAD

809
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,510
My great great great grandfather was a sheep thief.
