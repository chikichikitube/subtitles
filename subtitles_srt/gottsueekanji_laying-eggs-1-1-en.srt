What are you doing in my room?!

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,540
Let me give birth

31
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,820

00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,100
What happened last Fall?

34
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,260
I don't know

35
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,220

My stomach hurts!

45
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,700
It hurts!

46
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,500
I don't care, just get out!

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,980
You're being rude!

48
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,140

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,060
Give me a hug

53
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,500
No

54
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,740
What are you doing in someone's home

55
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,780
Let me cry like last time

56
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,020
When is the last time?

57
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,060
He's an idiot

58
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,900
I don't know

59
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,220
Hey, what are you touching?

60
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,780
Leave!

61
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,780
Where does she take off her clothes?

62
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,740
Huh?

63
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,500
Why do you keep treating me like this?

64
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,060
I'm just telling you to get out

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,140
Forgive me

66
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:13,860
Huh?

67
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,020
What the hell?

68
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,980
Forgive me

69
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,620
What's wrong with you?!

70
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,060
Forgive me like last time

71
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,260
When was last time?

72
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,500
I don't know

73
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,660
Just go, hurry up!

74
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,660
This is a mess

75
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,700
Your grammar is a mess

76
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,420
You're a mess

77
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,340
I said to clean up your mess and get out of here!

78
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,740
Let me die

79
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,980
If you want to die, die

80
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,700
Get out of here!

81
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,780
Let me die like 3 years ago

82
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,020
What about 3 years ago?

83
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,900
I don't know, just get out!
