1
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,580
Oyakoukou tte nani? tte kangaeru

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,580
What is devotion to parents? I wonder

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,910
But trying to think about it

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,910
Demo sore wo kangaeyou to suru koto ga mou

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,150
Could be devotion itself

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,150
Oyakoukou nano ka mo shirenai

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,310
Kodomo no goro tama ni kazoku de gaishoku

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,310
When I was a child,
my family would sometimes eat out

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,880
I always ordered Chicken Rice

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,880
Itsumo tanonde ita no wa CHIKIN RAISU

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,280
Gouka na mono tanomeba nido to tsurete kite wa

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,280
I thought that if I ordered the expensive one

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,780
Moraenai you na ki ga shite

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,780
They wouldn't take me out anymore

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,250
Oya ni ki wo tsukatte ita anna kimochi

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,250
The way I considered the feelings of my parents

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,780
Could kids these days understand?

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,780
Ima no kodomo ni rikai dekiru kana?

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,510
Kyou wa KURISUMASU

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,510
Today is Christmas

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:09,280
Machi wa nigiyaka omatsuri sawagi

22
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:09,280
The town is lively with festivities

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,780
Shichimenchou wa yappari tereru

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,780
Turkey feels too awkward

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,510
I am just fine with Chicken Rice

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,510
Ore wa mada mada CHIKIN RAISU de ii ya

27
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,180
Binbou tte nani? tte kangaeru

28
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,180
What does being poor mean? I wonder

29
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,480
Hekonda toko hekonda bun dake warai de

30
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,480
With depression upon depression, laughter

31
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,850
Mitasu shika nakatta ano koro

32
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,850
Was the only way to fulfill those times

33
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,210
Mukashibanashi o kataridasu to kimatte

34
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,210
Whenever I start talking about my past,

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,510
Binbou jiman desu ka to iu kao suru yatsu

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,510
They say "Bragging about how poor you were?"

37
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,780
But I was that poor

38
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,780
Demo are dake binbou dattan da

39
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,350
Let me at least have some pride about this!

40
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,350
Semete jiman gurai sasete kure!

41
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,850
Eventually, I will laugh about it

42
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,850
Saigo wa warai ni kaeru kara

43
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:17,350
But will kids these days dislike it?

44
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:17,350
Ima no kodomo ni iyagarareru kana?

45
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,210
Kyou wa KURISUMASU

46
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,210
Today is Christmas

47
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,780
Machi wa nigiyaka omatsuri sawagi

48
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,780
The town is lively with festivities

49
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,580
Bring me a big cake

50
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,580
Dekai KEEKI motte koi

51
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:40,610
But make sure it's small enough to finish it

52
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:40,610
Demo maa zenbu tabekireru SAIZU no na

53
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,180
Akasaka PURINSU o osae toke

54
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,180
Forget the Akasaka Prince

55
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,510
I am not calling for a suite

56
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,510
SUIITO to made wa iwanai ga

57
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,580
Bring the turkey, is this it?

58
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,580
Shichimenchou motte koi kore ga shichimenchou ka

59
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:02,780
It's bigger than I thought

60
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:02,780
Omotteta yori dekai na

61
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:11,280
I am still alright with just Chicken Rice

62
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:11,280
Yappari ore wa CHIKIN RAISU ga ii ya
