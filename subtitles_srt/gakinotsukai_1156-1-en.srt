Original French translation by Razuberii - English subs by Joel Ratman!

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:08,340
Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahande, 1st ever "Let's play retro games on the FAMICOM! (NES)"

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,620
Did you ever play Famicom when you were young?

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,660
Yeah, I played it before - Yamasaki played a lot too

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,740
Yeah, I played it a lot

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,300
We've brought in the old games today.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,740
Playing them will bring back memories.

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,740
What do you think?

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,740
What game would you absolutely want to play again?

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,460
For me I think Mario Bros

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,580
I think Mario as well....

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,260
And also Donkey Kong.

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,260
I'd love to play Donkey Kong again too.

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,340
I confess, today's theme doesn't excite me that much..

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,980
A kid with a 7.3* haircut would not be motivated to play

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,300
Yeah, not motivated by games.

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:53,540
*The most perfect an trendy haircut, it had to have a quiff at the front with a ratio of 7:3 (?) Endo's hair would have taken priority over video games.

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,540
At the time everyone was like "Games, games", but I was always out playing baseball with my Dad.

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,020
You played baseball with your dad?

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,380
Yeah, playing baseball with dad...

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,660
What about Downtown-san?

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,820
Playing the shooting game, Space Invaders

23
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,220
Downtown playing on the table        game at GAME CENTER

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,180
It's scary to remember how poor it made us.

25
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,740
Seriously, at 100 yen per game, for us that was...

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,900
For us this was the "sum of death..."

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,940
A "lethal dose" at 100 yen!

28
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,460
Then we just watched others playing.

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,940
People spending money like it grew on trees...

30
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,780
I thought  this is  not  even  possible  -  "THESE guys are the extra-terrestrials!"

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,060
They arrive at the studio

32
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,580
Follow me, it's in here!

33
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,260
I feel really excited all of a sudden!

34
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,300
UWAH! LOOK AT ALL THE GAMES, THIS IS CRAZY!

35
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,980
In the studio there is a mountain of old game cartridges for the nostalgic Famicom.

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,340
In total there are...

37
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,860
743 GAMES!!!!

38
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,820
Hello and welcome everyone!

39
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,620
You waste no time!!

40
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,620
Already he's right here before us...

41
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,060
And this is?

42
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,300
This is Fujita-kun.

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,420
All these games belong to him.

44
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,580
EEH? ALL these are yours?

45
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,580
Yes, sir.

46
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,380
Fujita

47
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,780
The celebrity specialist in video games, Fujita.

48
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,580
I'll show you a photograph of my room.

49
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,620
-Yes, it's mine.

50
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,620
This is yours?

51
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,500
I live in this 2LDK* so I can store all my games.

52
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,500
*A standard apartment type in Japan with 2 bedrooms, lounge, dining and kitchen.

53
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,740
I collected all these games one by one, especially for this day.

54
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,780
What we see behind us here are all your games?

55
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,780
-Yes.

56
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,500
Fujita-kun, what were you doing when you were a kid?

57
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,700
What did I do? Uh, games...

58
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,740
He's asking what got you into it!

59
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,340
BagOOOOON!

60
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,340
Sorry, I was focused on my presentation, I misunderstood you...

61
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,420
No matter how many games you played, you have no strategy against this guy...

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,700
You have no defense against this "BOSS"

63
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,780
First they go to admire and rediscover the games.

64
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,700
UWAH, brings back memories!!!

65
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Ah, I know these games!

66
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,100
There's Donkey Kong...

67
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,940
I didn't know there were so many versions of DK.

68
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,420
Ah, have you seen these before?

69
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,940
There's PAC-MAN!

70
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,580
And XEVIOUS as well!

71
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,780
And here it shows month by month the events he went to that year...

72
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,980
"In August 1983, I went to Koshien* for the final which pitted PL gakuen and IKEDA"

73
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,980
*A famous baseball stadium in Nishinomiya (Kobe pref) which hosted the annual championships.

74
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,260
You were there too?

75
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,300
Yes, I was sitting in the "Alps"*

76
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,260
*The name given to the benches surrounding the field

77
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:32,220
*Japan's Prime Minister from '72-'74 - In Oct '83 he was convicted of taking million dollar bribes from Lockheed.

78
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,060
Hamada wept when Tanaka Kakuei* was convicted at his trial.

79
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,980
As if I would cry for that!

80
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,100
I have no idea!

81
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,100
Why was he crying?

82
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,420
He must have admired him.

83
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,260
WTF!!!

84
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,140
Finally he cries bitterly...

85
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,300
Finally he...OW!

86
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,020
GOOON!!

87
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,060
What did I say??

88
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,180
Wow, there's even ELEVATOR ACTION!

89
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,380
AAAAHHH!

90
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,300
You had to use a lot of lifts and doors...

91
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,380
Yeah, that was a great game!

92
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,660
There were many TABLE machines with this game.

93
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,900
And there's also YOSHI'S COOKIE!

94
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,540
It was a very cute game.

95
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,100
I played it lots with my girlfriend at the time but could never beat it...

96
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,100
...In the end I got so tired of it I threw it out.

97
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,100
Anyway, it's time we should start!

98
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,500
Now the members will compete through the games on the Famicom!

99
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,780
Each member will choose a game. Then they will take turns to play.

100
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,500
The highest score will be declared "King of Famicom"

101
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,060
The battle will commence with Housei's game choice

102
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,220
I chose a cartridge.

103
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,180
I picked ARKANOID

104
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,060
Maybe Matsumoto-san will be good at this game.

105
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,060
Oh, Arkanoid...

106
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,380
-Year of release 1986-

107
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,340
ARKANOID

108
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,500
The game involves clearing bricks and objects with the aid of a ball

109
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,940
The objective is to clear every brick to complete each level

110
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:05,420
The essential skill is use of the control lever to move.

111
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,060
We will start with Hamada-san.

112
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,420
EEH with ME?

113
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,980
Hamada-san, we're counting on you!

114
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,900
The graphics shouldn't confuse you too much.

115
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,540
WAH, it's nostalgic!

116
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,980
Be careful!

117
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,580
What are you looking at???

118
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,300
What are you even doing, GO HOME!

119
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:39,220
Do your best! If you can take a capsule get it!

120
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,420
You want to die for a capsule!

121
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,180
Seriously, what are you doing?

122
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,180
I'm not telling!

123
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,660
Get that green capsule!

124
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,940
WAAAH!

125
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,820
It's scary to watch...

126
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,180
Result: 3100 points

127
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,860
tsukai ya arahende

128
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,860
Downtown no

129
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,860
gaki no

130
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,420
Famicom Battle: Tanaka challenges Arkanoid!

131
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,740
I'm sure Tanaka will be bad at this game.

132
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,380
I beg to differ - I think he will be gifted at this.

133
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,620
Focus on the bricks, you're not obliged to get capsules

134
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:38,900
Nice one! You're playing really well!

135
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,140
Wah, I would have done that too...

136
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,420
Why don't you take that capsule Tanaka?

137
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,460
If he takes a new capsule it will be a new item...

138
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,500
...And he prefers the long paddle as his item

139
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,060
This one has the most success right?

140
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,300
Gon!

141
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,780
GON!!!

142
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,700
In the end Tanaka does not succeed.

143
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,380
Result: 9940 points

144
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,220
Though we kept complimenting you.

145
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,980
It's Endo's turn to play.

146
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,860
From playing baseball, your reflexes must be good.

147
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,820
I should not have said that, it disrupted you.

148
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Result: 1830 points

149
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,500
The joystick is harder than I thought it would be.

150
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,980
They struggle to master the controls

151
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,980
Next in the ARKANOID challenge is Matsumoto!

152
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,780
I see it's necessary to press hard on the joystick.

153
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,140
Wah, but I don't know what strength I need to move with

154
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,900
OYYYY!!!

155
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,420
BOGOON!

156
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,900
WHAT are you doing?!?

157
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,180
YOU can talk!!!

158
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,820
Wait, wait, I just need to find my timing...

159
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,420
GOGOOOOOON!!!

160
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,500
WTF are you doing???

161
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,860
What is this? That was horrible!

162
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,900
If you score less than me that's scary.

163
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,300
EEH! Watch out now!

164
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,900
Be careful!

165
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,060
He was good then

166
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,100
AAAGGGHH!!!

167
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,980
I didn't expect that at all, you got over 3000 points!

168
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,020
Results: 3540 points

169
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,180
It's not that though... I didn't think the joystick would be so sensitive

170
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,540
Yamasaki got us with this controller!

171
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,660
Now it lies with Yamasaki to show his ability with the game he has chosen...

172
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,580
He's good at holding it stable.

173
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,380
Ah, he's really keeping the paddle stable.

174
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,820
You're almost there! Keep it up!

175
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,380
Wah, it's going fast!

176
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,740
You're gifted! You're going to succeed!

177
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,380
Bravo! Just keep it going!!!!

178
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,860
Housei-san, hang in there!

179
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,460
Waaah, what just happened?

180
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,900
It's okay, there's no problem

181
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,340
He actually said something...

182
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,100
Nice! There's just one left!!!

183
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,140
OH! BRAVO!

184
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,020
Well played, bravo!

185
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,020
Youre good!

186
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,100
It's stability that is needed to succeed

187
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,380
Geez, you love saying that!

188
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,180
STABILITY-GUY!

189
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,940
He has mega "Stability-ability!!!"

190
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,900
Super! He succeeds with "stability shot"

191
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,020
All done...

192
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,900
Results for ARKANOID

193
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,900
You totally won.

194
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,260
Year of release: 1985

195
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,420
Dig dug

196
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,260
Next is Tanaka's game choice: DIG DUG

197
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,700
In this game, it is possible to kill an enemy by dropping a rock onto them

198
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,500
...or by bursting them with the aid of the air pump.

199
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,580
By eliminating all enemies, the level is clear. ACTION GAME!

200
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,100
First we will see how Tanaka performs!

201
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,180
So this is DIG DUG?

202
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,180
Yes, it's DIG DUG.

203
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,140
UWAH, how nostalgic!

204
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,100
Brings back memories!!!

205
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,980
If you go right to them it's a bad move

206
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,780
Ah you did it purposely to attract it?

207
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,180
No, not at all...

208
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,500
Use your pump against them!

209
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,780
AAAAAGGGH!

210
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,860
Uwaaaah!

211
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,860
What do you press?

212
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,340
We're not telling you that!

213
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,380
Glitch!

214
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,060
It went buggy...

215
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,380
PFF! What's going on! This ain't the time for glitches!

216
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,500
What's going on Fujita-kun?

217
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,660
Next is Matsumoto - will he give a good performance?

218
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,380
I feel like he's gonna win.

219
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,660
Are they allies on the side?

220
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,780
They're here! Right behind you!

221
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,620
I'm telling you they'll get you!

222
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,940
No way, I'm gonna run away.

223
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,860
Ah, I see, that's how to do it.

224
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,020
I get it, we can use the rocks against them.

225
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,500
What, you're kidding me!

226
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,100
That's bullshit!

227
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,660
These things are annoying!

228
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,700
You have to press 4 times to explode him.

229
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,340
Oh yeah, I totally forgot!

230
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,460
That's it...

231
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,740
EEEEEH?

232
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,500
Finally - you just need the right technique.

233
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,420
You're really good anyway.

234
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,140
Matsumoto fumbled a bit on his first level. Now let's see the second

235
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,300
Ah no no no! AAAAAGH!

236
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,220
Oh no!!!!!

237
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,580
Results: 9940 points

238
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,580
Housei is faring moderately.

239
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,340
While Endo's turn is very bad.

240
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,260
Finally we come to Hamada's turn!!

241
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Here they come! They're right behind you!

242
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,700
What am I supposed to do?

243
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,620
Just try to kill one of them first!

244
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,900
Are you SERIOUS?

245
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,460
- I really tried to do it!

246
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,180
You got surrounded there!

247
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,180
Can I get some help?

248
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,900
You need to press the button 4 times to kill it.

249
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,100
Oh good, so I press 4 times?

250
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,100
Yes, not once but 4 times.

251
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,700
OK, gonna press 4 times...

252
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,220
What are you doing?

253
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,780
What are you DOING!!!!!

254
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,500
WTF ARE YOU DOING!!!!

255
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,500
You can get the carrot!

256
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,740
WHAT THE HELL - I can't believe you could get that carrot...

257
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,540
What are you doing?

258
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,540
AAAAARRRGHHHH!

259
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,700
That is too hard!

260
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,140
Too difficult for old man...

261
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,460
Are you friggin' serious?

262
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,660
You still managed to get 2410 points.

263
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,980
Results for DIG DUG

264
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,660
Hell yeah, I won!

265
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,740
Donkey kong

266
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,780
Endo may have a chance with a game he played before - DONKEY KONG'S HIS CHOICE!

267
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,700
With Mario's first appearance, this game became the centrepiece of the Famicom.

268
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,340
Mario must save the princess who was abducted by Donkey Kong in this ACTION GAME!

269
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,020
Hamada is the first one to take the challenge!

270
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,460
So far we can say Hamada hasn't exactly shined.

271
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,420
It's possible he could even die before it starts.

272
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,220
This is how you jump?

273
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,820
I was just checking that this button is jump.

274
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,740
That was such a stupid end, I can't even comment.

275
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,140
It's not even funny.

276
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:13,820
After the unthinkable but true, Hamada doesn't even get past the first level.

277
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,780
What did he score?

278
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,540
Hamada-san scored ZERO POINTS?

279
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,860
EEEEH? ZERO POINTS!??

280
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,180
ZERO POINTS!!!!????

281
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,700
EEEH? ZERO? NO POINTS!

282
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Among the next 3 players, Housei gets the best score.

283
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,700
Now comes Matsumoto's turn!

284
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,620
Unlike Hamada, he seems to have the skill to bring Mario to rescue the princess.

285
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,820
I wanted to get that one.

286
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,180
How long will the hammer last?

287
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,140
He can't go up with the hammer.

288
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,900
You're good!

289
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,940
He already has 2200 points!

290
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,940
WHAT?

291
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,980
This is annoying, he's still only on his first life...

292
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,260
He totally says nothing...

293
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,020
YYYEEESSSS!!!!

294
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,420
WAH, this part brings back memories!

295
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,340
I remember this...

296
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,500
Hamada-san, do you remember this too?

297
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,500
Yeah, I remember too...

298
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,340
He's gifted!

299
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,180
That's so fast!

300
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
You made it!! That's awesome!

301
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,740
It's no real surprise that I'm so good.

302
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,020
It's because I remember how.

303
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,060
WAH, this level is evil...

304
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,660
It's hard to get past.

305
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,700
EEEH? Wait, what?

306
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,980
He can't jump when he is holding the hammer

307
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,660
He can't jump with the hammer?

308
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,340
You should have said it earlier Fujita-kun!

309
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,020
I couldn't jump with the hammer!

310
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,980
Matsumoto wins this round!

311
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,900
Released in 1985

312
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,940
10 yard fight

313
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,020
The next game is Hamada's choice: 10 YARD FIGHT

314
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,220
The first American football game for FAMICOM.

315
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,860
Using your team and collecting items to get past the opposing team...

316
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,420
Hamada is the first to try the game.

317
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,380
Let's party!

318
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,820
Wah, again it brings memories!

319
00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:00,500
OK - I receive the ball and the team runs together...

320
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,380
Which is Hamada-san?

321
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,380
He's the team in the blue uniforms...

322
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,900
In blue?

323
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,700
Yeah, he's the team running up the field.

324
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,580
So he is running up the field?

325
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,540
That's right.

326
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,580
That's it, go go run faster...

327
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,980
I stopped to tackle so I can advance!

328
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,340
Hurry up you can still pass the ball!

329
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,060
It doesn't help to shake the controller.

330
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,820
Just press the buttons, the controller is old.

331
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,340
Yeah, ok I understand.

332
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,820
Don't be shaking the controller just to get laughs.

333
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,020
It's not even your role to be BOKE!*

334
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:43,700
*The classic Japanese comedy duo consists of "Boke" (fool) and Tsukkomi (derisive partner) - Matsumoto suggests that Hamada is reversing their roles

335
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,340
That wasn't my intention!

336
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,100
Stick to your own role!!!

337
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:51,340
So far, there is no sign of improvement from picking up items or that the game will ever end.

338
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,620
How do you know when this will finish?

339
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,660
True, how do we know?

340
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,540
Haha WTF there's still more!

341
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,220
It says "High School 2nd half"

342
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,380
This still isn't finished?

343
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,300
We can't show this shit on TV...

344
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,660
We seriously can't broadcast this.

345
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,180
You can just show his "first half"...

346
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,700
Your "party" is too long.

347
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,660
We have to be honest about your choice.

348
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,300
This is simply embarrassing!

349
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,260
Release Date: 1985

350
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,300
Famicom Battle! - Next up is Matsumoto's choice - 1942

351
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,820
This game involves destroying as many enemies as you can while avoiding their shots.

352
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,540
The first challenger will be Housei.

353
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,420
So which buttons do I need to press?

354
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,460
I don't know, I haven't played this game very much

355
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,860
So I just fire with the A button?

356
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,860
Yeah, that's what Fujita-kun said.

357
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,780
I'm firing with "A", but there was also something that allowed a "dodge" in critical moments.

358
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,140
UWAH! You're good Housei-san!

359
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,660
But you know, I haven't played this for ages so I don't remember the buttons.

360
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,060
The same for me...

361
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:12,460
Despite this, Housei displays a beautiful performance!

362
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,980
Whoa nice! Now you have 4-way shots!

363
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,900
Geez, I'd love to play like him...

364
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,780
WAAAH! Did you see what he just did?

365
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,780
What a dodge! WHAT A DODGE!

366
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,300
Yama-chan, what an epic dodge!

367
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,700
What a superb dodge!

368
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,380
Such a good dodge. Did I tell you it was a great dodge?

369
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,220
AAAH! OYYYYY!!!!

370
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,460
AAH! OYYYYYY!!!!!

371
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,060
What's up?

372
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,060
Results: 18950 points

373
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,100
He said "OY!" To Hamada!

374
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,820
Tanaka plays next.

375
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,020
C'mon man, you need to just press A

376
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,140
Not so hard like that...

377
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,060
That was a good dodge.

378
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,860
Hey BE CAREFUL!

379
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,940
DANGER!

380
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,420
BE CAREFUL!

381
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,460
Results: 4400 points

382
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,100
It's over.

383
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,780
Endo and Hamada didn't shine in previous games.

384
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,300
In this game Endo fought a good battle of courage.

385
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,820
The last player is Matsumoto - He's ready to take it to a whole different level!

386
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,900
Matsumoto challenges the game 1942!

387
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,260
The highest score is 18950 points.

388
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,580
He starts his game smoothly.

389
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,460
And his score increases bit by bit.

390
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,500
WAAAH!

391
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,500
WAAAH!

392
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,500
WAAAH!

393
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,500
WAAAH!

394
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,220
I can't believe my eyes!

395
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,740
That was scary!

396
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,140
WAAHH!!!

397
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,620
That pisses me off!

398
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,740
Such a close call...

399
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:29,340
Yes, c'mon, c'mon...

400
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,500
There's the aircraft carrier!

401
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,940
That just means the end of the level.

402
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,820
You made it! Nice, such a good job!

403
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,940
Look at his score!

404
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,420
What were WE doing?

405
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,020
He's too gifted!!

406
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,100
You're right - it's kinda weird.

407
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,340
Eh? The sea?

408
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,340
Fujita-san, is all that the sea?

409
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,380
Below him?

410
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,420
Ah sure, yes that's the sea.

411
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,660
AAAAAAHH---!!

412
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,580
Gotta keep going - I really want to get to the big plane.

413
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,620
I want to see that!

414
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,020
AAAAAAHHHH!!!!

415
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,980
Ah, I'm hurting my fingers!

416
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,060
Anyway, you totally smashed the high score.

417
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,500
Results: 35350 points

418
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,260
That was awesome!

419
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,500
He made 35350 points!

420
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,060
FYI, here is the boss Matsumoto mentioned.

421
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,180
The giant bomber plane from this game...

422
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,180
...when reaching the end of level 7.

423
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,300
Now all the games have finished.

424
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,580
Matsumoto has become the FAMICOM KING!

425
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,580
Just look at those scores.

426
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,860
Matsumoto has finished 1st in this battle.

427
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,860
Indeed...

428
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,420
Last is.... Hamada-san.

429
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,740
EEH? TOTAL 9560 points?

430
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,820
Even MY score was over double that!

431
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,260
It's clear you simply cannot operate a controller.

432
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,900
The worst was him scoring ZERO on Donkey Kong.

433
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,660
Yeah, obviously...
