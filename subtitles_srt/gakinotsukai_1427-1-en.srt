What's that?

Couldn't they made it less hot?

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,790
What does the seal say?

80
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,560
What does it say?!
- I can't read it

81
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,830
It says "chin" ("ago")

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,340
Enough with this...

83
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,210

00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,130
Theme: Athletics World Championships

196
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,690
What is "Athletics World Championships"...?

197
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:42,770
The punished will be for two people together

198
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:42,770
When using a pair of skull cards

199
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,030
You go, Shouzo    - Ok

200
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,770
Let's just go the way I pass them to you

201
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,400
He's still intact!

202
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,900
Who cares?

203
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,600
I mean, Hamada-san...

204
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,070
You sure you're ok with this?

205
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,610
This is risky

206
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,470
One, two...

207
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:02,830
Endo

208
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:02,830
Athletics World Championships

209
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,210
Shoot, this sounds bad...

210
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,480
I knew it...

211
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,560
Whatwhatwhatwhatwhat?

212
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,670
Ow ow ow

213
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,170
What..?

214
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,610
Ohh... I see

215
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,440
Woah, this hurts like hell

216
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,080
No way
- It hurts!

217
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,180
Damn, this is bad

218
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,720
World Championships...

219
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,890
This is gonna hurt

220
00:12:59,410 --> 00:12:59,770
Huh?

221
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,770
Shou-chan?

222
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,770
Shocchan?

223
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,350
You ok?

224
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,890
What are you doing?

225
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,750
Am I bleeding?

226
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,290
Yeah, feels like it

227
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,390
It's not
- You're fine

228
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,190
It was strong
- My mouth...

229
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,390
Sorry but, this guy...

230
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,770
Come on, it's not my fault!

231
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,080
Super Cooling Bazooka

232
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,810
Sounds like another experiment
- Enough...

233
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,700
Any volunteers?

234
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,650
Theme: Super Cooling Bazooka

235
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,410
No

236
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,670
Is that so?

237
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,110
"Cooling"...

238
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
I'm picking this

239
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,570
One, two...

240
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,450
Matsumoto

241
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,450
Super Cooling Bazooka

242
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,970
You just said it before

243
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,640
You said you won't do that again!

244
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,950
My shoulder...
- You said it before, man

245
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,710
Is this going to be ok?

246
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,920
Hey! Hey!

247
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,920
Are you sure I'm going to be ok?!

248
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,120
You sure about that?

249
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,560
What's going on?

250
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,560
Wait a sec---!

251
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,900
What's "cooling" supposed to mean?

252
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,030
Come on...
- That's scary

253
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,880
Coming up: a cold, cold punishment for Matsumoto

254
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:44,680
[from before]

255
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,730
Please, stand here

256
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,810
Wha- again?

257
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,580
This is really scary

258
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,480
Get over here

259
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,950
Goggles and helmet...
- You don't need those

260
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,590
Goggles and...

261
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,830
G-gogg--
- Stand here and stay still

262
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,130
I need someone to trust

263
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,360
Ok, here is fine

264
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
I need someone I could trust

265
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
The hell are you sayin'?

266
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,030
I need mutual trust and goggles

267
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,070
Mutual trust and goggles

268
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,910
Hands behind

269
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,270
I told ya my shoulders hurt

270
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,140
I just want mutual trust and goggl-

271
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,140
Oh, shut up

272
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,450
Scary!
- Right before him!

273
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,120
I have no idea what's goin' to happen!
I have no idea what's goin' to happen!

274
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,220
That's terrifying

275
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,950
Seriously I have no idea!!

276
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,220
You shouldn't draw back

277
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,790
This guy has been looking
at me like this from before

278
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,760
He chose me

279
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,760
Just face ahead

280
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,330
I'm gonna die here

281
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,870
Your hands!

282
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,430
This makes it ever scarier

283
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,950
I just want mutual trust and goggles

284
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,330
IT'S COLD

285
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,350
So freaking cold!!

286
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,350
Hamada got involved too

287
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,090
Hamada too

288
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:09,070
He froze up

289
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,700
It's frozen down here

290
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,400
It's getting worse

291
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,700
Aaaah! So cold!

292
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,500
Are you ok?

293
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,640
What's happening there?

294
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,740
Oh, it's actually frozen

295
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,010
It is, really

296
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,710
He looks fine

297
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,450
Holy crap

298
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,650
It also randomly got Hamada

299
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,750
That was something

300
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,460
It felt... good, for a moment

301
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,690
It did?     - Yes...

302
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,700
When did it?

303
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,930
Just for a sec

304
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,860
I swear I'm never touching those cards again

305
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,630
Well, that's what you said before

306
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,230
I had enough...

307
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,230
"Enough"? You didn't do anything!

308
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,010
No I mean like, it's going on for a while by now

309
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,220
There are still like... 2 or 3 I think

310
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,850
Man that was scary

311
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,600
Saliva Face Mask

312
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,160
This is no good

313

Theme: Saliva Face Mask

314
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,800
This is really nasty

315
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,460
I don't want this

316
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,670
I'm not touching em

317
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,770
Wait a sec!

318
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,670
You gotta pick one

319
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,710
I'm picking the remaining one

320
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,640
You ok with that?     - Yes...

321
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,540
Then pick one

322
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,710
Guests first

323
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,540
Can I?
- Yes

324
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,810
If so...

325
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,910
I see, the farthest one
- Yeah

326
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,910
Let's get over it

327
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,310
Man I really wanna survive this one...

328
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,790
Me too...
- I want to survive this too

329
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,830
This is really risky

330
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,010
Why is no one picking anything up?

331
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,010
Whatever, I'm taking this

332
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,240
I really hate this one...

333
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,380
One, two...

334
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,390
Saliva Face Mask

335
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,580
Alright!     - Nice

336
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,280
He was the first to pick one!

337
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,480
You're right

338
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,800
Coming up: HIKAKIN is going to be covered in saliva

339
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,120
It was him from the start     - Right

340
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,620
We were so worried too

341
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,840
Saliva Face Mask

342
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,020
Huh?

343
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,020
They brought us butter

344
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,470
Salt free butter

345
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,000
Close your eyes... and your mouth too

346
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,210
I see, so he's getting a lot of butter on his face

347
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,270
I'd hate this one
- Yeah me too, a lot

348
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,610
Hope his ears will be fine

349
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,950
Here he goes

350
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,850
Aw, that's cute

351
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,000
That's totally fine

352
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,160
Yeah he was lucky it picked this

353
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,390
What's goin' on?

354
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,760
Doesn't seem so bad

355
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,500
When it was me, the dog was freakin' huge

356
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,770
This is just cute, that's it

357
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,300
He got chosen by this

358
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,970
This isn't bad
- Shouldn't be that way

359
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,640
It's warm

360
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,340
He's really diggin' it

361
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,780
He cleaned him up

362
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,980
Real good too

363
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,650
Totally

364
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,950
He licked him clean

365
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,120
Good boy
- Licked him clean?

366
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
Now he's all clean

367
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,830
He's still going
- That's a good dog

368
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,340
Why the artificial grass, though?

369
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,640
He got inside my nose

370
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,370
Thank you

371
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,940
Wasn't that good?

372
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,380
His tongue in my nose...

373
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,890
He got a lot of skulls

374
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,430
Yeah, 4 times

375
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,890
Thank God...

376
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,550
Next one is the last

377
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,550
The last one...

378
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,830
What's that?

379
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,710
Cockveyor Belt

380
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,300
The hell is this?

381
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,300
What the-?

Theme: Cockveyor Belt

383
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,750
Alright

384
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,710
Here
- Hamada is still intact

385
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,110
Here, here

386
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,510
This one looks shady

387
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,380
Are we flipping them all at once?

388
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,010
How about we

389
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,310
Go in circle from here?

390
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,220
Please, please, please

391
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,600
HOUSEI

392
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,130
It may be Matsumoto,
so you should go first Tanaka

393
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,130
Should I go instead?

394
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,930
Yeah, go Tanaka

395
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,880
TANAKA

396
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,840
It can't be me, it just can't

397
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,920
ENDO

398
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,920
Yeah, that's what I meant!

399
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,670
Holy crap!

400
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,210
That's good, that's good

401
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,110
So it's either one of us or Hikakin...

402
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,710
Alright alright alright

403
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,180
How should we flip those?

404
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,180
The three of you all at once

405
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,520
All together?     - Yes

406
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,950
Should we count?

407
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,950
Man, I can't stand this anymore

408
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,760
Come on, we're almost done

409
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,560
Let's count it

410
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,460
Here goes nothing

411
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,430
One, two...!

412
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,980
Cockveyor Belt

413
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,070
Such a bad luck!

414
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,670
Yeah today was bad
- It was

415
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,670
Ohh, looks good

416
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,980
Such a beautiful finale

417
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,250
What's this about?

418
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,980
How does this work?

419
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
This will make them travel to him

420
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,180
I see now

421
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,480
Use the chair as a support

422
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,220
A bit closer

423
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,460
Ok, let's go

424
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,190
Yes

425
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,600
Three, two, one, start!

426
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,710
Well yeah, that hurts
- It does, really

427
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,210
That must hurt

428
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,210
Here comes a big one!

429
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,580
Don't move around

430
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,750
The last one

431
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,320
Here comes, here comes
- This is bad

432
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,690
That's our main dish

433
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,690
No doubt this will hurt     - Yes

434
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,670
What?

435
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,170
The hell?

436
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,440
I think it hurts more than I tought

437
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,240
Its juice came out!

438
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
For real

439
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,510
You ok? Is the juice a problem?
- It's fine

440
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,830
I was wondering whose juice was it

441
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,350
What the hell dude

442
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,720
Watermelon, of course

443
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,720
Hamada...

444
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Do you think it's fine this way?

445
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,490
Why?

446
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,860
You never got punished
- I think it's fine

447
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,660
The audience isn't satisfied

448
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,030
I think you have to do at least one of them

449
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,600
I told you it's fine this way

450
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,300
I won't let you escape

451
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:59,720
Coming up: one last big shriek from Hamada

452
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,300
Just one

453
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,470
You're free to pick one

454
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,140
Which number in order from the top?

455
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,030
There are 12 in total
- You don't have to be so desperate about it

456
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,130
Ehhh? Come on...

457
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,560
Which one do you choose?

458
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,560
The second one

459
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,750
The first one

460
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,420
Was this one, Cockveyor Belt

461
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
You managed to escape
the Cockveyor Belt

462
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,130
And here's the one you
wished for, number two

463
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,330
Endless vinegar rapid-fire

464
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,610
Hamada

465
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,610
Endless Vinegar Rapid-fire

466
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,330
This is a good one

467
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,610
You picked a good one!

468
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,610
Mouth open, eyes closed

469
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,310
Ok, let's go

470
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,770
Like this, smooth rapid-fire

471
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,010
Smoothly
- I see, it's nice

472
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,850
Don't open your eyes

473
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
