00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,830
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,520
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,650
Who is it?

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,560
Savannah's Takahashi!

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,640
It's Takahashi!

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,670
Looks in good spirits

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,120
It hasn't been that long, right?

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,550
So, today I bring you a regular segment

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,810
Hamada-san's favorite "someone" series

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,780
The scary one

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,800
Hamada, is it not your favorite?
-I do like it

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,950
This time, we bring you a new spin on it

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,840
Please take a look

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,820
Is it possible for a comedian to make the person hiding in the room laugh

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,480
I see

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,030
A reverse prank?

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,990
Indeed

18
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,120
This is a good plan

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,940
The rule is within thirty minutes

20
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,500
They can do anything

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:07,280
But if the person that is thinks "they're trying to make me laugh" then they're disqualified

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,680
Otherwise the project will be too tasteless

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,490
The person involved has to be cautious

24
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,750
Because they shouldn't laugh out loud
-Indeed

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,720
What do you think will happen, Matsumoto?

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,460
I think it'll be tough for the comedians

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,800
If there's not a question of whether it can be broadcast or not

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,770
They may do some twisted XXXX

29
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,980
If you watch it in VR you'd definitely laugh

30
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,040
Surely laugh

31
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:58,130
Is it possible for a comedian to make the person hiding in the room laugh

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,970
The first challenger is

33
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,790
Morishita

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,180
I've been in this situation before

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,670
Yeah

36
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,610
I don't think it'll be that easy to make the person laugh

37
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,530
Whoa...

38
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,380
Tough...

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,530
This time, we gathered ten extras of different ages and genders to be the "someone"

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,120
They select the target from the extras themselves

41
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,370
Done

42
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,770
A man in his 20s

43
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,500
Not bad

44
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,600
What do you think?

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,470
Should be OK?

46
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,810
The ideal choice is about 30 years old, more than 20 years old is almost in the target range, right?

47
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,350
Sounds like he's experienced

48
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,060
Ideal target is 30 years old

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,850
Morishita first leaves the room first and the house empty

50
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,860
This is when the extras are hidden in the closet

51
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,690
Preparation work completed

52
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:11,540
A surveillance monitor is set up in front of him on the pretext of "finding a time to scare him"

53
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,340
After waiting for 30 minutes

54
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,860
Morishita returns home pretending not to know anything

55
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,930
The challenge begins

56
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,110
The extras must be nervous

57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,850
Gonna laugh out loud, right?

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,630
To show authenticity, Morishita first rests in bed

59
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,960
Why do you need that pose?

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,660
3 minutes after starting

61
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,630
It's finally time to start the first round of combat

62
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:55,250
Hey, that...

63
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,620
Hatsase, you

64
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,780
Pretending to be on the phone with his partner

65
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,090
The segment to be performed tomorrow has not yet been decided, right?

66
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,640
Very realistic

67
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,560
What to do?

68
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,530
Do that one? Ok

69
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,070
The one with the big demon god balls

70
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,200
Attack 1 A Dumb routine

71
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,450
Laughing

72
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,570
The one with the big demon god balls

73
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,480
The first attempt caused a snicker

74
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,740
After that too

75
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,090
No, Slippery Beethoven is a bit old, right?

76
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,420
What is this name?

77
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,120
What about the one with the oyster pie girl?

78
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,660
It has to be a baby stag beetle, right?

79
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,100
So first the big demon balls

80
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,910
Balls appear to be able to elicit a response the easiest

81
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,470
But unfortunately the target did not laugh out loud

82
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,000
Morishita also doesn't know which he reacted to

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,830
I hope Morishita will realize that the target can't resist balls

84
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,320
Right at that moment

85
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,380
Wait a minute...Oh no!

86
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,020
I'm sorry, I'm overdue

87
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,580
This is bad...

88
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,190
Yes, right now

89
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,990
It's already 2:00

90
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,560
At 2:00 I must drink my medicine, sorry

91
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,130
Anyway, please, stag beetle diapers

92
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,360
Ok ok

93
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,070
This is bad

94
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,170
Unbearable, unbearable, unbearable

95
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,580
How can you laugh at this? It's scary!

96
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,300
Scary!

97
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,490
Meow Meow

98
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,540
Meow Meow Meow Meow

99
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,400
Meow Meow

100
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,330
Meow Meow

101
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,870
Failed in combat, right?

102
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,470
Meow Meow

103
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,870
Its like a horror film

104
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,480
Too far from funny, right?

105
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,640
Meow Meow

106
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,550
He's scared to death, isn't he?

107
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,010
What kind of battle plan is that?

108
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,350
Wow!

109
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,250
Satomi, don't come out again

110
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:27,630
Attack 2 Multiple personality

111
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,590
Enough, right?

112
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,920
It's too complicated, right?

113
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,890
It's morning, right? 5:00 in the morning, right?

114
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,360
It's 2:00 p.m. here. I'm sorry

115
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,630
I'm sorry I got mad at you

116
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,830
15 minutes left

117
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,450
Call

118
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,510
Thank you for your hard work

119
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,580
Yes

120
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,680
Eh?

121
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,650
It's late?

122
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,690
The funny video?

123
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,020
Sorry

124
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,430
Fine

125
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,190
Then I'll shoot now

126
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,630
Attack 3 Self-shooting

127
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,040
Nice
-Very natural

128
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,580
This does happen

129
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,340
It's me

130
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:17,380
Sasaki, who has traveled from a parallel world

131
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,460
A serious routine

132
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,050
Me

133
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,120
Frontal attack!

134
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:27,960
It's a special bowling ball

135
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,990
It's quite effective

136
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,200
And

137
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,060
I...

138
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:40,270
I'm Chiaki from another world

139
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:48,910
I am Inoue Kouzou from a parallel world

140
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,920
Inoue Kouzou

141
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,570
It worked. I saw the teeth

142
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,990
It took Morishita 24 minutes to complete the challenge with an imitation of Inoue Kouzou

143
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,590
Doesn't feel like a parallel world version

144
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,500
At this time the staff send the news of the successful challenge to Morishita

145
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,040
What? What? What?

146
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,850
Eh? Who is it? Who are you? Who is it?

147
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,180
Wait a minute...who are you?

148
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,540
He still pretends to be scared by the hidden performer

149
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,780
Is this needed?

150
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,990
The truth is revealed

151
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,630
Then

152
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,930
What is it? What is this?

153
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,020
Who is this acting for?

154
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,230
Morishita continues playing the role of the target

155
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,680
How did it feel to hide?

156
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,500
It was hard to hold in a smile all the time

157
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,210
The real content is then explained

158
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,170
Laughed?
-Yes

159
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,410
Yes!

160
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,050
Really happy

161
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:03,090
As happy as when I entered the third round of R-1

162
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,320
The next challenger is

163
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,260
Makino

164
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,530
The same lottery was conducted

165
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,260
To decide the target

166
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,940
The target is placed in the lower level of the closet

167
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,030
The challenge begins when Makino returns home

168
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,170
Upon entering

169
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,890
Sports underwear, waistband and men's underwear

170
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,600
She changes into a costume

171
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,560
This can be considered an attack

172
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,370
She suddenly starts to eat dango

173
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,910
You'd laugh at this

174
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,780
I think it's good!

175
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,190
Attack 1 Can't eat dango horizontally

176
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,190
It's hard to eat dango

177
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,090
Playing dumb doesn't work

178
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,820
Next

179
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,860
Hello?

180
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:26,240
Attack 2 Phone call

181
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,270
I have an old cracked hemorrhoid

182
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,240
From birth until now

183
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,510
But this doesn't work either

184
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,570
So

185
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,880
Practice time

186
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,880
Everyone does this

187
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:51,130
Attack 3Rehearsal

188
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,050
Discounted fish in supermarkets

189
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,890
With fat or without it?

190
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,920
I can tell!

191
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,990
Forty Party Forty Party

192
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,460
This won't tickle a 60 year old's funny bone

193
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,270
Wont work over 20 years old

194
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,240
When eating a good steak

195
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,340
Forgot about sushi

196
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,110
I spit, straight to the core!

197
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,750
This segment also fails

198
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,090
There are no more...

199
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,290
Empty... gone...

200
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,840
No more

201
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,230
There's nothing in the top of the fridge either, right?

202
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,600
So, in a last desperate attempt

203
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,970
Future, future

204
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:34,970
This is bad

205
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,800
No good
-No?

206
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,810
Super interesting though

207
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,420
At this point we force termination

208
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,220
This is a foul

209
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,690
Why completely naked?

210
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,320
There is nothing else to do but to take it all off

211
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,690
At the end of my tether

212
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,840
I've heard that if you take it off, you can get a laugh

213
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,970
I actually couldn't stop laughing

214
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,140
The next third challenger is

215
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,670
Morita

216
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:17,250
For Morita, a more difficult challenge is prepared

217
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,890
There are five people hiding in your house.
-5 people?

218
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,090
Please make all 5 of them laugh

219
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,460
Five people, it's quite difficult

220
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,930
This time, the five people are hidden as shown above

221
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,290
The challenge is to make all these people laugh

222
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,700
This challenge is called

223
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,880
*Spoofed of THE IROMONEA, a variety show

224
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,880
THE IEMONEA

225
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:52,250
Aim to make 5 people laugh!

226
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,120
Ah, I'm exhausted

227
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,950
Very natural feeling

228
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,280
Morita's initial battle plan is

229
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:43,000
Attack 1
Fart

230
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,320
The one in the middle is going to laugh
-Straight away

231
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,230
Laughing!

232
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:50,420
Successfully made a women in her fifties laugh with fart noises

233
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,580
Hello?

234
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,320
Is it convenient now?

235
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,090
*FRIDAY - Magazine which sometimes reports cheating celebrities

236
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,090
Something for FRIDAY

237
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,160
Well, I have some inforation

238
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,430
I want to sell it to you

239
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,140
It's about New York's Yashiki cheating

240
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:41,090
Attack 2 Selling comedian gossip

241
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,230
Everyone is listening with great interest!

242
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,680
Photos have been taken

243
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,250
Not a photo of the cheating scene

244
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,410
It is a photo of drinking with the cheating partner

245
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,000
Listening carefully!

246
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,580
How much can I get?

247
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,390
20…

248
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,090
Oh really

249
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:47,200
Well, 20...20 is a bit low, right?

250
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,930
When selling TKO Kimoto's news before

251
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,370
There was 60

252
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,260
So it was you!

253
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,710
No, a 60 percent negotiation

254
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:04,050
So, in comparison, the 20 for New York is a bit less, right?

255
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,940
Listening to it, listening to it

256
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,600
"It was you!" might make them laugh

257
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,120
Do you accept those kinds of things?

258
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,850
Do you also accept info about harassment?

259
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,820
It's about Rice

260
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Too weak?

261
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,300
4,000 yen? Eh?

262
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,760
Another laughed!

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,240
No, he is also the King of Conte champion

264
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,700
Later

265
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:36,750
Attack 3 Competitors on dartboard

266
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,660
By hanging his competitor's pictures on the dartboard

267
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,720
He made a man in his 40s laugh too

268
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,480
Throwing darts straight at New York

269
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,720
The pace is very good at this point as he has amused three

270
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,210
Coming

271
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,910
Morita doesn't know how many people are left

272
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,300
I'm sorry you had to come all the way out here

273
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,870
Come on in.
-Excuse me

274
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,650
Is that Hyouroku?

275
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,560
At this point he is joined by his junior Hyouroku who has been prepared in advance to elicit laughs

276
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,080
Morita finds an excuse to go out first

277
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,270
And lets the others watch Hyouroku alone in the house

278
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,050
Handed over to Hyouroku?

279
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,130
Morita's cigarette

280
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,010
Is Hyouroku a bad guy?

281
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,380
What kind of clothes are these?

282
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,710
Attack 4  Unauthorized smoking

283
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,590
What a unique smoking position

284
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,400
Very in synch with the bear behind him

285
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,810
Like a composite photo

286
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,320
What are we watching?

287
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,710
How old is Hyouroku?

288
00:16:52,330 --> 00:17:00,660
Morita's bag

289
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,040
Hyouroku's a bad guy!

290
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,080
Going through other peoples bags

291
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,200
How can you laugh at this?

292
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,910
This thin bald headed guy is too scary

293
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,740
Opening everything!

294
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,220
What brand of clothes are you wearing?

295
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,780
Wow, that's a lot of money

296
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,510
You can't laugh at this, right?

297
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:31,340
This thin bald headed guy counting money is so scary

298
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,140
Put it back first

299
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,360
Hyouroku stage

300
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,880
What is this plot?

301
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:57,290
Attack 5 Hyouroku steals 70,000 yen

302
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,510
So there are people that'd laugh

303
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,490
Now there's only one person left

304
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,040
This one is very tolerant

305
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,800
Morita gives Hyouroku 10,000 yen for the taxi upon returning

306
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,170
Take a taxi back

307
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,720
When graciously sending the thief Hyouroku out

308
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,940
The time ends

309
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,540
Very strong

310
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:24,750
The staff reports to Morita that he failed to make all five laugh

311
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,290
It's so annoying, really

312
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,660
Just like before, he pretends to be surprised

313
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,170
Eh?

314
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,710
Enough already

315
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,080
Ah!

316
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,660
What is this part?

317
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,840
The search is quite fast

318
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,650
Oi!

319
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,250
Unfortunately, that's it

320
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,990
There was one person left

321
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,590
Because the time ran out

322
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,830
It's as bad as failing at IROMONEA

323
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,790
Really

324
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:16,200
In summary
Now accepting challengers

325
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,000
What do you think, Matsumoto?

326
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,940
There was a pattern of doing their routines

327
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,480
Indeed, under the pretext of making a video

328
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,110
Came up with a reason to perform

329
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,760
Incidentally

330
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,220
After filming

331
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,990
She was scolded by her manager, who is much younger than her

332
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,160
What was she doing

333
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,360
"How can this be broadcast!?" she said

334
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,300
But it's actually on the air!

335
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,280
Indeed, when I look back on it now

336
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,570
Her shouting "future future" was pretty entertaining

337
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,800
No futuristic feeling at all

338
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,160
Let's welcome the next presenter

339
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,380
Who is it?

340
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,440
He's here!
-Its Fujiawara!

341
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,270
I remember.
-Yeah

342
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,640
What follows is not a theory

343
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,040
It is the continuation from last week

344
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,100
MONSTER LOVE

345
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,760
Here we go!

346
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,920
Last week Kuro-chan's new project began

347
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,030
Everyone has already seen the first episode

348
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,990
Of course

349
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,020
Here's a brief review

350
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:55,280
9 women claim to like Kuro-chan, who knows nothing

351
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Among these 9 are people just pretending to like him

352
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,740
Two were selected for elimination

353
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,680
And both were just pretending to like him

354
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,140
That's what happened

355
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,800
So now it's down to these 7

356
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,720
They are arranged in order of Kuro-chan's preference

357
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,780
Starting with Miku

358
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,320
We also don't know how many people are lying.
-That's interesting

359
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,600
Now, they are going to start living together in Okinawa

360
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,620
What will happen?

361
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,680
Let's watch

362
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,170
Getting wet!

363
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,320
Typhoon, hurry up!

364
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,630
A very exciting beginning

365
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,800
Here, here

366
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,650
Hurry up!

367
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,280
Trying to escape the weather

368
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,320
This place is awesome!

369
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,460
Awesome!

370
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,790
Amazing!

371
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,960
Its like an art museum!

372
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,060
The 2nd floor is also very luxurious

373
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,710
Absolutely luxurious

374
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,600
Except for one who could not attend due to the typhoon

375
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,010
The six women here will start living with Kuro-chan

376
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,380
By the way, the absent Nodoka is also a pretender

377
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,790
Cheers!

378
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,750
Since we've toasted

379
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,090
Are there any places you would like to visit?

380
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,090
Ah, I do. I want to go to the aquarium

381
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:29,760
Aquarium?

382
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,750
Not bad

383
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,390
Who wants to go to the aquarium?

384
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,160
Ah, everyone!

385
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,870
I want to go

386
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,680
It's suitable for a rainy day too

387
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,180
Then pack your bags first

388
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,440
To the aquarium yo~

389
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,910
Don't go swimming in there yo~

390
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,280
What are you talking about?

391
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,280
What a boring conversation.
-Yeah

392
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,860
Talking is boring

393
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,940
This opening

394
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,380
Very beautiful

395
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,550
What a shot!

396
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,520
So annoying

397
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,310
Do you need to make it so fashionable?

398
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,460
Annoying

399
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,530
Ah its the one that's just been completed

400
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,290
Awesome

401
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,400
Looks like Nemo

402
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
Isn't it?

403
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,170
So cute!

404
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,270
So annoying
-Boring as hell!

405
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,270
A little like Kuro-chan

406
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,700
So cute!

407
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,010
I have something to say to Kuro-chan

408
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,440
To me?
-Yeah

409
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,500
This approach of taking the initiative is suspicious

410
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,880
Can I?
-Sure

411
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,410
Let's go

412
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,500
Whoa

413
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,250
Crocodile

414
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,200
It's not moving

415
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,830
Look here. Crocodile

416
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,200
Its really not moving, but pretty cute

417
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,440
Isn't it impressive? It's big.
-Yes, it is

418
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,180
Eh? Two people talking alone

419
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,140
Is this happening?

420
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,680
You said you wanted to ask me something. What is it?

421
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,490
Before, you said I am the cutest

422
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,760
You said you liked me the most

423
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,890
That's what this guy says to everyone

424
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,780
Then the ranking is revealed

425
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,590
Yes, I said so

426
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,760
But when it was announced

427
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,700
I wasn't first, I was second

428
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,360
Yeah
-He said he likes her the most

429
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,430
Qualified

430
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,520
It's not the same as what he said

431
00:24:59,150 --> 00:24:59,740
Second

432
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,340
A little concerned, right?

433
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,440
Ah~

434
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,810
What "ah~"

435
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,680
Remember?

436
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,190
I'm not sure why

437
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,090
Are you concerned?
-Yeah

438
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,480
Well, that...

439
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,290
If you are the first to be called

440
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,630
People will know that I obviously like you

441
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,630
What does it matter?

442
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,140
The other girls may be jealous and annoyed at you

443
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,610
So I chose you second on purpose

444
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,910
Misdirection, misdirection

445
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,980
I want to be first

446
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,810
Is that a valid reason?

447
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:41,890
You know... for you

448
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,440
I want you to feel at ease

449
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,110
What are you talking about?
-So gross

450
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,130
I'm a bit worried
-Worried?

451
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,120
So annoying
-What a playboy

452
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,640
But feeling uneasy like this

453
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,530
You'll like me even more, right?

454
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,060
Yeah, but i've been kind of concerned since then

455
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,370
After coming to Okinawa I still think of you the first

456
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,790
Really? Really?
-Yeah

457
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,790
Must have said the same to others

458
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,110
Thank you

459
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,880
Pretty direct

460
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,050
So direct

461
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:17,290
You know, i'm not looking for a fun relationship

462
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,120
Such a cool face

463
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,460
I'm serious

464
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,010
So disgusting!

465
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,830
I can feel the tingling of fate

466
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,470
Tingling

467
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,160
Great, I'll remember those words

468
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:39,720
In turn, what you're saying to me now

469
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,610
You're not lying to me, are you?

470
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,650
It's not a trick

471
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,940
He's suspicious

472
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,950
Really

473
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,550
Can I trust you?
-Yeah

474
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,160
I believe in you

475
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,030
He believes
-Isn't it a little early to believe?

476
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,730
The weather is so bad

477
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,630
We whipped up some food

478
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,200
If you want to eat

479
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,840
Eh? Did you guys make this?

480
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,770
We did

481
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,800
Who made it?

482
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,210
Me and Naru

483
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,810
Ah, the 2 of you did it?

484
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,040
So impressive!

485
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,380
I better eat it while its still hot then!

486
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,400
Yes, please do

487
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,220
Great!

488
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,480
Yes, it's delicious

489
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,400
Is it good?

490
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,460
Great!

491
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,330
Mildly spicy

492
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,050
Huh?

493
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,470
An individual action

494
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,080
What's she doing?

495
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,280
Excuse me

496
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,080
Oh, Miku!

497
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,060
Can I sit next to you?

498
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,480
Oh, of course!

499
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,010
Excuse me

500
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,480
Please sit down

501
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,990
Eh? You're alone?

502
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,590
Everyone is resting

503
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,010
So close

504
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,620
So I came over

505
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,220
Definitely lying

506
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,360
You came over

507
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,290
Came over

508
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,130
Not sure yet, right?

509
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,760
1 person came

510
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,530
Eh? What will you do if I'm the big bad wolf?

511
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,270
Die!

512
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,770
Please don't say "die!"

513
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,070
I'm embarrassed

514
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,740
I have something to ask Kuro-chan

515
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,710
Want to ask me?

516
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,710
How can there be?

517
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:26,720
Last time I... was your first choice

518
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,820
Disgusting feet

519
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,720
You chose me first, right?

520
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,290
She was first

521
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,090
In Kuro-chan's mind

522
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,680
Am I number one?

523
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,430
Of course

524
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,530
You see!

525
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,600
Really?

526
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,480
Really. Why are you laughing?

527
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,410
It feels like...

528
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:53,440
At that time, I was very happy to be chosen

529
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,050
But today, at the aquarium

530
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:06,890
You and Richi were alone together for a long time

531
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,890
She cares about it

532
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,720
He's so popular!

533
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,330
So I feel a little uneasy

534
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,600
Exposed!

535
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,230
Why do you feel uneasy?

536
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:17,560
Because in the order of your choosing, you were first

537
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,910
Do I not have anything to worry about?

538
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,310
His lips are so annoying

539
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,790
Didn't I just say that?

540
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,500
So angry!

541
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,250
The ranking says it all

542
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:36,090
I've been watching you

543
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,420
Here we go

544
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,940
Calling me by my name like that is pretty embarrassing

545
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,050
Ah so cute!

546
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,060
So don't want me to say it?

547
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,270
No it's not that

548
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:48,030
If you call me "Miku", can I call you "Aki-kun"?

549
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,260
Oh surprisingly she knows his actual name

550
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,600
Aki-kun?

551
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:57,240
Then I'll call you "Aki-kun" from now on

552
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:03,190
I don't really want to go back

553
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,220
Can I kiss you?

554
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,220
No, right?

555
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,430
She's attacking!

556
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,090
He's in danger

557
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,090
(Ok)

558
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,120
I'm shy, can you close your eyes?

559
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,220
Seriously, this is bad

560
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,720
Oh, there?

561
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,780
This guy!

562
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,140
You're very bold

563
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,310
So gross!

564
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:38,650
I can't do this kind of thing normally but I want to because it's with Aki-kun

565
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,650
"Very bold"

566
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,400
Miku, you're not lying to me, right?

567
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:44,880
He said it!

568
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,390
I'm not lying to you!

569
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,790
You really like me, right?

570
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,230
I like you the most

571
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,760
You don't trust me?

572
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,060
No, I believe you

573
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,510
Seriously, this is so tiring

574
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,040
Saying something like "this is so tiring"

575
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,880
I'm so tired of watching this

576
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,310
Before that, you said "die!"

577
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,810
It's an endurance test

578
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:14,740
So, what do we think? Miku is on the offensive!

579
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,880
She initiated a kiss!

580
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,190
Here, right?

581
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,390
Although it is the cheek

582
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,530
Although it was on the temple

583
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,700
I don't know what to think 'cause it was on the temple

584
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,130
Although it was there

585
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,100
How do women feel watching it?

586
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,670
Miku is very suspicious, as is Richi

587
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,940
Richi has been from the start

588
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,110
Yes, both are very suspicious

589
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,640
Really?
-Alone at the aquarium

590
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,380
Yeah

591
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:45,040
The weather has been bad the whole time, is that a problem?
-Don't worry about it

592
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,450
Will there be a sudden power failure and Kuro-chan will have been killed?

593
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,990
This is not a mystery drama

594
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,730
Will it clear up tomorrow?

595
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,450
The weather forecast says it will be sunny tomorrow?

596
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,300
Sorry I called you all here

597
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,460
It seems there is a place with a lion statue experience

598
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,500
Lion statue experience?

599
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,380
Experience "making a lion statue"

600
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,740
He means make a lion statue themselves

601
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,940
There are places where you can make your own lion statue

602
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,190
Idiot!

603
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,680
Well, it would be nice if we could go

604
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,280
Originally I wanted to have a barbecue in the evening

605
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,990
But looking at the weather, it can't be done

606
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,950
So, we'll do an octopus party instead

607
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,100
Great!

608
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,330
Takoyaki party

609
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:36,930
So lets divide into two groups: shopping and lion statue experience

610
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,490
I said its a lion statue making experience!

611
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,490
To make a lion statue!

612
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,640
Who wants to do the lion statue experience with me?
-I do!

613
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,740
Making experience!

614
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,170
Everyone?

615
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:48,850
The quickest to raise their hands were

616
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:54,780
Naru, Richi, and Risa, right?

617
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,060
Get some octopus

618
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,620
Super big!

619
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,970
They split up

620
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,770
Do we need that much?
-No, I don't think so

621
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,360
This one, right?
-There are also small ones

622
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,850
Super happy when there's just 3 people

623
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,670
Wow, this is awesome, huh? There are so many kinds!

624
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,280
Super cute~

625
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,050
Let me ask you

626
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,220
Lion statue experience
-Lion statue making experience

627
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,210
What kind of relationships have you been in before?

628
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:22,610
Only really one to speak of

629
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,750
And only for about 4 months

630
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,220
Never even held hands

631
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,150
No?
-Nope

632
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:36,590
So, I am very eager to be in a relationship

633
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,400
What about you, Ri?

634
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:44,710
I usually pursue people I like

635
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:51,140
Confess to them and then go out with them

636
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,720
Very good at talking

637
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,570
Even if the other person has other girlfriends

638
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,310
I always thought, "It's okay because I like him," so I went out with him anyway

639
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,420
You knew they were dating someone else?
-Yes

640
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,790
Even if it is the kind of person seems like a playboy, it's ok if I like them

641
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,800
Suitable for Kuro-chan

642
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,800
If we have time to be together

643
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,190
If you like them you're ok with it
-Yeah, if I like them

644
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,930
Eh? But that wouldn't end up happily though, right?

645
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,080
This is a trap, right?

646
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,670
I think i'll still feel happy

647
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,690
How is it possible?

648
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,610
For you to be treated so casually...

649
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,880
Although I haven't known you long

650
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,940
The thought of it annoys me

651
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,290
So cute

652
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,960
Isn't Kuro-chan really handsome?

653
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,790
Seeing him in real life he's even more cool
-Yes, really

654
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,040
When there are only 3 people...

655
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,930
He seems more handsome than I expected
-I know

656
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,740
They too...

657
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,800
No one knows who's sincere and who's lying

658
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,640
Maybe they are testing each other?

659
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,100
He's got a good physique and big hands

660
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,070
Super gentle
-Super gentle!

661
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,370
I really think he's much more handsome than on TV

662
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:01,050
The people who went shopping put in a lot of effort!

663
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,660
So lets hurry up and start the octopus party!

664
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,080
Cheers!

665
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,880
So happy!

666
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,400
Sorry

667
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,120
Awesome!

668
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,760
Delicious!

669
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,660
Kuro-chan, you made it super delicious!
-Is it good?

670
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,000
Looks very happy

671
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,000
Wait, this is wasabi, right?

672
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,210
Why is there wasabi?

673
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,360
I wanted to play Russian roulette

674
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,810
We're gonna eat it?
-Yeah

675
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,670
No, wait

676
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,190
Then close your eyes

677
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,660
Kuro-chan isn't participating

678
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,090
You're not allowed to look

679
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,110
Kuro-chan's not eating

680
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,070
The king's entertainment

681
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,060
What's up?

682
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,910
I feel a draft

683
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,590
Indeed the typhoon is very strong!

684
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,530
What, what? What's wrong?

685
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,690
Seems like a very strong typhoon

686
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,970
Typhoon

687
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,110
What the hell are you doing?

688
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,570
No. 12

689
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,850
Strange image

690
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,550
What is this guy doing?

691
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,180
Stinks!

692
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,040
She said it!

693
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,760
Exposed!

694
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,820
Seems so stinky

695
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,560
What a stinky typhoon

696
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,650
Finally said it

697
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,150
So smelly

698
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,700
Seems so smelly, so smelly

699
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,680
A large typhoon is approaching~

700
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,460
Keeps saying he stinks

701
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,940
What stinks?

702
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,210
Doesn't something stink?

703
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,840
She said you "stink", right?

704
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,100
Probably because of that? Although she said so

705
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,010
MONSTER IDOL and others often say I have bad breath

706
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,420
So she probably remembered from there

707
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,400
And though it'd be funny to say it because of that, so it actually made me happy

708
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,020
I think it was to make things more lively

709
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,460
It doesn't actually stink?

710
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,790
It doesn't stink!

711
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,130
Super non-smelly

712
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,840
It must stink

713
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,800
Everyone can open their eyes

714
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,030
Ah, I can't tell

715
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,200
3 2 1

716
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,500
Then please eat at the same time

717
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,520
Kuro-chan's not doing it

718
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,960
Ah, it's me

719
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,580
Eh? Wait...

720
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,570
No, no, it's me

721
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,640
What's going on?

722
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,490
It's everyone~

723
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,740
So stupid. What the hell?

724
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,770
Everyone yo-

725
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,230
Going to be hated

726
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,770
Going to be killed

727
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,300
My nose hurts

728
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,480
So bad

729
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,930
Ah, so happy~

730
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,960
He is the only one laughing

731
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,440
Wonderful, what a great life this is

732
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,590
Is it okay?

733
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,550
No replies from anyone

734
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,300
Thank you for your hospitality

735
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,030
Drinking alone at night

736
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,890
Kuro-chan

737
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,340
Ah, you're drinking?

738
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,460
I was wondering if we should go out for a drink

739
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,640
Now?
-Yeah

740
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,940
Okay!

741
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,620
This girl said he doesn't stink

742
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,640
Can you?

743
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,100
Finished it all in one gulp

744
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,410
Let's go！

745
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,900
There's no way he doesn't stink

746
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,910
Want to go~

747
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:30,650
Cheers to Risa and Kuro-chan drinking at a bar alone

748
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,080
A toast to the bar

749
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,190
Brain isn't working

750
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,000
Tasty
-Yeah tasty

751
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,530
That... you clean up nicely

752
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,530
You look like a beautiful actress

753
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,070
No, no, no, no

754
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,530
No, no, I'm just a chatterbox little girl

755
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,040
A chatterbox little girl?

756
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,240
We often see this expression

757
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,750
When we all go on a date together and go to dinner together

758
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,550
I don't really take the initiative

759
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:01,650
Not as straightforward as Miku or Richi

760
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,260
"I like you"... I can't say it on my own initiative

761
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,120
So i'm very envious of them

762
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,940
No, she's good

763
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,560
Oh, really?
-I really think so

764
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:15,830
It's only the first day, but I'm a little concerned

765
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:20,500
Like, how to say... where I am out of the 6?

766
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,850
First, of course.
-Really?

767
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,910
Is it true? No lies?

768
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,380
No lies

769
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,440
The usual routine

770
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,240
I wouldn't lie to you

771
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,850
You can lie to other people as long as you don't lie to me

772
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,480
Really?

773
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,750
Self-centered

774
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,790
Because I like Risa the most

775
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,890
I want to believe in you

776
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:48,330
Can you look me in the eye and say you're not lying to me?

777
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,600
I can

778
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,230
Can you say it?

779
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,240
Of course

780
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,010
I am not lying to you

781
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,770
Really?

782
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,400
Really

783
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:05,110
I'm not lying to you either

784
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,150
Obviously lying!

785
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,160
I am so happy

786
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,950
It's been a long time since my heart beat so fast

787
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,200
Clever. Very cleverly put

788
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:14,460
That shows that i'm really not lying

789
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:20,700
Can I kiss the back of your hand?

790
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,870
You can, I want you to kiss it

791
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,320
You want me to?
-Yes

792
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:29,070
I like you the most

793
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,180
I don't believe it!

794
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,680
So soft

795
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,010
Eh, but only a kiss there?

796
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,450
Only a kiss there?

797
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,080
Only a kiss there?

798
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,840
Terrible, terrible

799
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,090
Don't do that!

800
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,790
So warm

801
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,660
I've got goosebumps

802
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,440
An impactful image

803
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,580
Excited?

804
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,170
Disgusted

805
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,400
I got two

806
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,970
Ok ok, I believe you

807
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,450
Can you say this sort of stuff to others?

808
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,580
Ever said anything like this?

809
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,480
I can't say what Kuro-chan says

810
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,570
Not everyone can

811
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,920
He's really a playboy

812
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,650
A total playboy!

813
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,120
Its because he really wants to have a girlfriend

814
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,060
Thank you for waiting!

815
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:30,080
Next, I'll announce who I like

816
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,640
In order from 1st to 5th place

817
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,740
What'll he do?

818
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:43,570
The one whose name is not called at the end

819
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:47,550
Will have to say goodbye today

820
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,090
1st place is

821
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:57,230
There's gonna be trouble

822
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,790
Risa

823
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,680
She climbed the ranking!

824
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,670
Thank you

825
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,590
What excuse will be made this time?

826
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,140
Next in 2nd place is

827
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,110
Angry?

828
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,810
Miku

829
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,600
Last time she was 1st

830
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,720
Then

831
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,450
3rd place is

832
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,750
Mami

833
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,320
Thank you

834
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,320
4th place is

835
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,620
Mina

836
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,870
Whoa, a big change!

837
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,860
Thank you

838
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:32,230
These two remain

839
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:33,080
Richi looks like she's gonna cry

840
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,100
5th place is

841
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
Richi

842
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,960
Deliberately left to the end

843
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,960
He's used this tactic before, right?

844
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,700
Indeed he has

845
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,050
Today we are saying goodbye to Naru

846
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,950
The reason I didn't choose you

847
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,720
Is I see you more like a sister

848
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:03,430
I don't think its possible to be lovers

849
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,160
So I didn't choose you

850
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,170
Really?

851
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:13,560
One last time, do you really like me, Naru?

852
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,300
No I don't

853
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,960
Eh? You didn't you sign up because you like me?

854
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,050
Good good good

855
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,010
Eh? Why?

856
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:26,280
No... you seemed to like me so much, it's too strange for it to be fake, right?

857
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,320
No hesitation

858
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,790
I thought you really liked me, so I answered you with all my heart

859
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:34,810
I can only think of you as a sister, that's why I made my decision

860
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,690
Eh, why?

861
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,560
So you didn't sign up?

862
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,430
Why do you look so sad now when you didn't sign up? Why?

863
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,310
I don't get it at all

864
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,840
Because she was eliminated, right?

865
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,640
Eh? What's going on?

866
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,500
Reluctant to go, right?

867
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,810
No, no... didn't you lie to me?

868
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,440
Why this expression... Eh? What's going on?

869
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,310
I don't understand

870
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,980
Don't like me?

871
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,080
Not really

872
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,850
What's going on? What's going on?

873
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,090
Really?

874
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:06,460
Eh? How many girls are there that don't like me?

875
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:11,330
That's four out of nine people so far

876
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,820
Then there must be a lot of them

877
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,760
Is there really any that like me?

878
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,990
There are?

879
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,000
So I need to find them out of these 5?

880
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,870
I'll find them, i'm tired of being duped

881
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,220
I told you, didn't I?

882
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,180
I am here to find a girlfriend

883
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,840
Well, not just this time... I've tried every time

884
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,580
When I find the one this time, she'll become my girlfriend

885
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,650
And then?

886
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,390
Marriage!

887
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,720
You'll get married?

888
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,990
Yes!

889
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,160
Seriously?

890
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,090
I'm not playing around with love

891
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,450
Whoa so cool!

892
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,140
It's going well

893
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,070
Already overcome a lot of hurdles

894
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,530
Well, that's it for this time

895
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,910
She was so quick to answer

896
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,360
Because she was just pretending

897
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,280
No hesitation at all

898
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,380
"Do you like me?" "No."

899
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,310
She downplayed it

900
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,250
Like the speed of a street interview

901
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:13,490
And Richi said his mouth stinks

902
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,330
So what's going on?

903
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:20,160
I think Richi is pretending, and couldn't help but admit that he stinks

904
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,080
Reflexively, I said "it stinks".
-Indeed

905
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,170
But it can't always stink

906
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,400
Kuro-chan?
-Kuro-chan

907
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,010
Because at the lion statue experience

908
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,650
I told you its a "lion statue making experience"!

909
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,280
What the hell?

910
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,340
What does it mean?

911
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,130
Lion statue experience is to experience being the statue, surely

912
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,180
What is he talking about?

913
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,930
Does it matter?

914
00:45:42,930 --> 00:46:15,050
