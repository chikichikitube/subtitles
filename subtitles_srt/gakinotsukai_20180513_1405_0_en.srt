00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,510
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai
"Let's improvise a lame ass Shinkigeki!!"

00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,990
Downtown

Matsumoto Hitoshi

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,990
It's easy to misinterpret this title

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,100
We're not saying the Shinkigeki is lame
No of course

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,770
Without any meeting or anything,

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,440
Just adlibbing

9
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,890
This is a pretty difficult one

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,890
This is gonna be bad

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:39,890
A Yoshimito Shinkigeki without scripts or rehearsals
How lame will it turn out?

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:39,890
Tonight's Episode

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,730
This time, just like the Shinkigeki in Kansai, they'll perform on stage

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,820
Without any scripts, just pure improvising,

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,540
The purpose of this project is to see how lame this will turn out!

16
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,590
Despite how it seems, the Shinkigeki requires rehearsing properly

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,590
Yes yes indeed

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,070
Of course there's a proper script and everything

19
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,230
They rehearse properly and then perform
Yes exactly

20
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,230
Tsukitei Hosei

21
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,130

Tanaka Naoki

24
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,570
You're not allowed to use any of the gags they use on Shinkigeki

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,970
None of that?
They have to be your original ideas

26
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,840
Gags that have been used in Shinkigeki are prohibited

27
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,840
Rurle

28
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,840
Original...
Original...

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,110
And there's the tsukommi as well of course
Yes yes

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,110
Tsukommi: Like the retort to a dumb joke

31
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,350
We have to come up with the story too

32
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,350
NOTHING is decided Yes indeed

33
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,120
Should we do this?

34
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,450
Should we?

35
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,620
Who's the one that suggested this

Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!

38
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,490
This time it's not just us, we've invited a guest,

39
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,470
Come in!

40
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,040
Thank you, let's do this

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,770
(Slightly senior to DownTown)

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,770
Jimmy Onishi

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,770
You came huh?

44
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,770
Thank you

45
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,370
The idiot is here, the idiot

46
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,980
Please, don't call me an idiot

47
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,840
Look at this, just one side is sticking out

48
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,520
Such an idiot

49
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,730
C'mon Jimmy

50
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,240
It's supposed to be like this

51
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,590
Just this side?
Both sides should stick out, it's fashion

52
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,990
But both sides weren't sticking out

53
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,790
I'm very sorry!!

54
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,200
Let's get along please
Yes

55
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,620
If Jimmy-chan wasn't here, we would be scared actually

56
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,030
Cause he's used to this
He is

57
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,870
In all the Shinkigekis I've done,

58
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,510
I've only ever gotten a single line

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,900
Oh really?
Yes always,

60
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,450
Ah that makes sense

61
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,980
The rest is up to me

62
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,040
Oh that's great then
That's perfect

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,890
However!

64
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,590
We're gonna decide the roles right now

65
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,530
We could even have Jimmy-chan play the lead role

66
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,530
Oh really?
The owner role

67
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,760
Well let's take a look at the roles
Oh yes

68
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,040
What kind of roles are they?

69
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,570
There's the udon store owner, the owner's daughter,

70
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,540
You don't need to hold it

71
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,110
Why did you try to hold it now?
I was trying to help

72
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,300
Such an idiot, such an idiot, right?
The hippie son that comes back after a long time

73
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,580
A rich kid in love with the daughter

74
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,580
Gangster

75
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,580
Hippie son that returns all of a sudden

76
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,580
Owner's daughter

77
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,580
The master of the cafe across the street

78
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,580
The roles:

79
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,580
Udon store owner

80
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,580
m 0 0 l -30 0 l -30 30 l 30 30 l 30 0 l 0 0

81
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,580
setting: Udon Store

82
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,580
The setting is the Udon store common in Shinkigekis

83
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,520
What do you think text text

84
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,320
The lead role is the Udon store owner right?

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,540
Yeah I guess so
It does seem that way

86
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,760
He can retort too

87
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,290
The decide roles by lottery

88
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,780
And then the important role lottery

89
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,070
This is how it turns out huh?

90
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,020
It's Hamada-san
Wow!

91
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,040
Endo

92
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,040
Gangster

93
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,040

97
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,040

98
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,040

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,040

101
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,040
Rich boy in love with the daughter

102
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,040
Tanaka

103
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,500
But if Hamada-san is the lead role,

104
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,460
Yes, you're right...

105
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,040
He seems the best for it
He seems the best for it

106
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,510
Jimmy-chan, do you wanna try the owner role?

107
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,850
No, no way I can't do the owner, no way

108
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,710
I do wanna see that though

109
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,880
You've come as our guest after all

110
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,880
No way...

111
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,320
You're definitely into this sort of thing

112
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,910
I'm not!

113
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,830
I just think I shouldn't do it

114
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,900
Yeah, yeah that's fine, it's no big deal

115
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,400
You can take this role
I see

116
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:41,870
With that, the important lead role of the Udon store owner goes to Jimmy Onishi

117
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,870
Jimmy Onishi

118
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,870
Owner

119
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,440

Tsukitei Hosei

124
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,150
I definitely need to do some gags

125
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,190
There's gotta be gags about a  rich kid

126
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:06,200
Master of the cafe across

127
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:06,200

128
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,200

130
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:15,410
Hamada Masatoshi

131
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,640
Having Jimmy-chan do the lead role is better,

132
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,410
He's gonna be talking complete nonsense

133
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,110
I could just say "GIMME ME MONEY!"

134
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,880
Hippie son that came back

135
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,880
Matsumoto Hitoshi

136
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,570
And Matsumoto plays the hippie son that came back home

137
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,220
Anxiety is all I feel!

138
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,660
Of course!

139
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,720
You can't blame me for this OK?

140
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,160
Finally Begins!

141
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,160

143
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,750
We had like, 800 customers today after all

144
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,490
It was hard serving 800 customers in this small place

145
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,980
Well today, anytime now,

146
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,780
It's time for the lunch break soon

147
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,980
I'm gonna drink a lot of tea

148
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,540
I'm back!

149
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,450
Ah, Yoshiko!

150
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,230
Yoshiko? That's not it!

151
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,390
My name is Shoko!
Ah, Shoko

152
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,120
Why did you get it wrong?

153
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,050
Shoko you picked up the delivery?
Yeah, just over there

154
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,440
I just brought these back. How were the customers today?

155
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,490
Today, we had 800 customers
That many?!

156
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,320
That's amazing!

157
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,130
Cause, father you said this shop might be demolished soon

158
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,900
I'm the 8th generation owner after all

159
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,100
You're the 8th generation?
Yes, so, um,

160
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,630
So let's try to preserve this store

161
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,770
But 800 people? How did they even enter?

162
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,230
They were lining up Ma'am

163
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,330
Ma'am?

164
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,340
They were lining up
I'm your daughter!

165
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,460
Cause they were lined up
Eh no way

166
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,900
That's the first time people have lined up for this place

167
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,820
It must've spread through word of mouth
Wow how did you manage that?

Yes yes using that

That's the era we live in now I guess
Yeah

175
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,710
But like yesterday there weren't any customers at all

176
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,290
Will we really be alright?

177
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,030
We'll be fine

178

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,960
Someone correct him!

186
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,160
Say something like "You're not supposed to say welcome" !

187
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,320
I came to eat lunch

188
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,300
Ah, you're hungry?
Yes yes

189
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,810
What do you want to eat?
I think I'll have a curry udon

190
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,480
Hold the curry
A curry udon then?

191
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,240
...

192
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,370
Standing by

193
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,910
Respond to him!

194
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,370
Respond to his joke!

195
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,780
Hold the curry alright? Hold the curry

196
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,250
That's just normal Udon!
Oh right of course

197
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,580
Then I'll have a Kake Udon
Kake Udon?

198
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,380
I'll have a Kake Udon
Alright I'll go make it

199
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,990
I'll leave it to you!
OK

200
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,790
So, how're things?

201
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,030
We're doing sort of alright

202
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,620
Oh?

203
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,570
What about your shop Master?

204
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,470
We had a lot of customers today

205
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,810
Maybe they came to my store after yours?

206
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,820
The customers

207
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,810
Ahh

208
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,850
They might've come to my place after yours maybe

209
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,050
Umm

210
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,320
I think today, the flower watchers,

211
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,320
Umm

212
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,820
I think a lot of them came

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,820
Umm

214
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,920
Eh

215
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,090
Master you've been doing this for a long time right?

216
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,400
Yes

217
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,130
Yes, our store has been running for a long time

218
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,130
Right?
Yes

219
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,300
Ah
Yeah

220
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,200
Master, are you, what do you call it,

221
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,470
Your employee quit?

222
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,470
Yes, yes they really quit

223
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,610
It's the recession after all

224
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,380
Yeah I really thought "Damn this is a recession"

225
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:27,520
Standby

226
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,650
It's such a normal conversation

227
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,520
Make jokes!

228
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,930
Sorry for the wait!
Oh it's here

229
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,760
Making Udon was too annoying, is just tea alright?

230
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,530
Dig in, please dig in
You can at least make some Udon!

231
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,700
It was just too annoying

232
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,500
Annoying?! This is an Udon store!
I'm sorry

233
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,810
Dad, you help out too

234
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,270
Make some Udon at least!

235
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,620
Welcome back!

236
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,370
Rich boy!

237
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,030
Oh, master is here too

238
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:11,130
Standby

239
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,290
I started to crave Udon

240
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,120
Udon please! Burdock tempura

241
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,290
How much is it?

242
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,640
Eh?
Father, how much

243
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,900
Father, how much?

244
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,720
Sorry, but this is an Udon restaurant

245
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,420
Burdock Tempura Udon please. How much is it?

246
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,460
450 yen

247
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,700
Oh really
Yes

248
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,290
I thought it would be 4,500,000 yen!

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,430
Of course that's impossible!

250
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,370
It's 450 yen

251
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,270
I thought I wouldn't be able to pay 4500000 yen!

252
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,500
All you do is make jokes!

253
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,210
Can I pay with my card?

254
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,590
Standby

255
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,590
Enough already!

256
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,190
Just for today, you can pay by card

257
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,380
Oh really?
Yes

258
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,650
Alright, then with this please!

259
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,240
You can't pay with a T-Point card!

260
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,230
Ho-Hosei-kun, by the way, were you our kid?

261
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,030
Are you sure, Father?
Eh?

262
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,890
Thank you very much, I've been waiting for you to say that

263
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,260
Please, give me Shoko-san!

264
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,850
I really love her

265
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,770
Shoko-san, please, give her to me, please!

266
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,220
Please, it's too early for you two to be doing that

267
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:02,580
Standby

268
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,580
Retort! Strongly!

269
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,580
What the hell

270
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:10,850
Chaos as Hamada appears!

271
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,570
What is it?

272
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,850
When are you gonna pay your loan back?!

273
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,330
I apologize, Father
Father...

274
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,590
It was too soon for that right?

275
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,650
You still haven't gone to elementary school

276
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,420


277
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,460
I don't want that! It's my life!

278
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,820
Please

279
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,350
Shoko-chan,

280
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,440
Do you like Hosei-kun?
No way no way!

281
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,680
There's someone I've already decided on

282
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,420
Father...

283
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,270
Please give me Shoko-chan!

284
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,560
Cut it out!

285
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,100
You've always been like this. Ever since we were classmates!

286
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,200
And you're still my classmate aren't you!?

287
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,100
I dated Shoko-chan!

288
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,830
It's obvious for us to get married!

289
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,990
Do you know why Shoko-san broke up with you?

290
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,230
I don't know

291
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,310
Father, do you know why?

292
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,550
That's,

293
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,920
She was dating you?

294
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,370
She was dating you?

295
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,270
She was dating you and broke up with you you mean?

296
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,560
Standby

297
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,960
Do something!

298
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,670
You, you dated her?
No

299
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,400
In fact,

300
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,940
Tanaka Master,

301
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,090

302
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,090
Long lost brother!

303
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,580
How do you...

304
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,560
Everyone knows it

305
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,380
I didn't know that!

306
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,060
Which means...

307
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,610
Umm, umm

308
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,290
Mom's, you're a different mother's child?

309
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
What are you saying father?

310
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,900
You're mistaken Father!

311
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,560
Get it together Father

312
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,660
Is that true?
Hurry, just come!

313
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,270
Marry me!

314
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,090
No! no!

315
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,350
Hold on

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
I didn't take any loan though!

327
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,480
What the hell do you mean no loan?!
But I really didn't

328

Yes yes
Huh?

336
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,850
You're known for high interest-
You're the one who came to borrow money

337
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,630
Are you gonna pay me back? Huh asshole?!

00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,500
Are you their son?
Who are you? What are you doing here?

369
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,220
I'm here to get my money back from this guy

370
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,610
Your dad is in debt, are you gonna pay it?

371
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,980
Loan? What loan? I didn't hear anything about this

372
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,900
This store,
Yeah?

373
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,900
Is in the wed!
What?

374
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,550
It's in the wed!
What? What?

375
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,290
People stopped coming in-
In the what?

376
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,850
In the red!

377
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,020
Hold on, didn't he return after a long time?

378
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,200
Yeah a long time!

379
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,950
It's been a long time
Then say something about that!

380
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,900
It's-

381
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,080
Hitoshi

382
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,570
Dad

383
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,300
You've come back after 30 years,

384
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,140
Surely 30 years is too long...

385
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
That's really weird

386
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,700
You've come back after 3 years,
Yes

387
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,020
Since then
Yeah?

388
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,730
The store is in shambles

389
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,490
So I got into debt

390
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,540
Why did you go into debt?

391
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,030
Buying fridges and stuff

392
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,700
Fridges?

393
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,240
I'm sorry, I renovated the kitchen
You renovated the kitchen?

394
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,220
It's expensive
That does sound expensive

395
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,990
Cause your renovated the kitchen after all

396
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,680
I heard you were doing pretty good, that's why I came

397
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,730
No, that's all lies

398
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,830
In reality, no customers come

399
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,190
So,

400
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,360
I wanted to do something real,

401
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,360
I wanted to renovate the kitchen too

402
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,040
I wanted a new fridge too

403
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,930
That's just your selfishness

404
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,930
If you can't pay I'm taking your daughter
Hold on that's not happening

405
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,360
I can't allow that

406
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,010
Brother!
Yeah?

407
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,100
I'm asking you who's gonna pay for this?

408
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,900
Master, I think he can manage to take care of this

409
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,540
I don't care who as long as I get paid

410
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,020
If you're gonna do it, then hurry and pay up

411
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,370
How much?

412
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,780
Weren't you listening?

413
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,200
How much is the debt?
It's ten million!

414
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,980
Ten million?!

415
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,590
I can't pay ten million yen that's too much

416
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,450
Of course ten million is impossible!
Alright I got it, you come with me

417
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,620
No, not my-
No!

418
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,280
Who the goddamn hell are you?

419
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,680
I'm from that famous place over there

420
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,230
Please...
Please give more details What the hell?

421
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,280
Couldn't you please wait?

422
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,460
I've already waited a long time!
We will do our best to make it up!

423
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,060
Could you wait 8 years?

424
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,340
8 years...

425
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,440
8 years! Just wait 8 years please!

426
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,240
If I wait 8 years, you're gonna be able to pay me?

427
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,630
Yes!

428
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,020
Alright then

429
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,180
Yay!

430
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,900
Thank goodness!

431
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,900
This was awful. This was awful.
Thank goodness!

432
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,960
Yay it all worked out!
Thank goodness

433
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,630
This is awful!

434
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,630
This is awful!!

435
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,960
Let's watch it

436
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,670
This...

437
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,210
It was crap right?

438
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,450
This was crap right?

439
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,390
This guy pisses me off...

440
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:25,680
Time to watch the improvised play!!

441
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,480
Look at Matsumoto dragging his feet

442
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,680


443
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:33,060
Time to reflect on the improvised Shinkigeki

444
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,020
Ahhhh

445
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,480
Today was so busy...

446
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,000
What is this end of the day vibe you're giving out

447
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,670
Customers don't come to this shop at all normally
Exactly

448
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,100
And all of a sudden there were 800

449
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,580
Then the loan shouldn't really be a problem
Yeah

450
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,340
800 people all of a sudden...

451
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,870
Welcome

452
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,040
Oh?

453
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,950
This made no sense

454
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,580
Retort!
I thought they would retort

455
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,090
I tried to set it up for him
Yeah

456
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,120
You're supposed to retort!

457
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,060
I thought he would

458
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,060
Like "It's not your shop!"

459
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,640
How are things?

460
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,230
We are doing slightly well

461
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,270
This is where the hellish time starts

462
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,270
Just a normal conversation

463
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,600
Master, it's been a long time right?

464
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,680
This was terrible

465
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,420
Yes...

466
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,640
Yes our shop has been open a long time

467
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Yeah

468
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,680
Master, what do you call it,

469
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,950
Did you give up on that new employee?

470
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,950
I did, I gave up

471
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,560
What kind of conversation is this

472
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,120
It's the recession after all

473
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,790
Yeah I really thought, damn this is a recession

474
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,790
Nothing to say...

475
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,390
You can't come up with anything

476
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,900
Nothing, just nothing

477
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,300
Just a cliche calm conversation

478
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,300
So cliche

479
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,810
Welcome back!

480
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,560
Nobody said anything

481
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,000
No response

482
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,390
Rich boy!

483
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:07,420
Everyone ignored your very first line!

484
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,980
Hosei-kun,

485
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,780
By the way,

486
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,780
Hosei-kun?

487
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,580
Were you our kid?

488
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,060
"By the way"

489
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,620
What a turn of events

490
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,180
Are you sure, father?

491
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,180
This turn of events...

492
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,630
Thank you very much, I've been waiting for those words

493
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,970
Please give me Shoko-san!

494
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,810
Oh, right

495
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,820
I really love her!

496
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,430
Please give me Shoko-san!

497
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,750
I guess groping was the next move

498
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,950
Please!

499
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,670
Right here it is, the father

500
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,800
Please, it's too early for you to be doing that

501
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
So gentle

502
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,670
Such a gentle lecturing

503
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,150
He won't play along with the joke

504
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,490
Do you know why Shoko-san broke up with you?

505
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,780
I don't!

506
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,060
Father, do you know why?

507
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,130
That's...

508
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,500
You dated her?

509
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,750
You dated her right?

510
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,810
You dated her and then broke up, right?

511
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,690
What is with this guy
Seriously

512
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,880
This guy...

513
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,050
This guy pisses me off

514
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:17,550
Matsumoto and I were stomping our feet

515
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,750
The hippie is here

516
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,180
It's been so long!

517
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,180
I wonder if mom and dad are doing alright

518
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,030
Oi!

519
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,980
No!
Wait!

520
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,750
Dad!

521
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,210
Hitoshi!

522
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,740
2 Kitsune Udon please!

523
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,900
Uwah...

524
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,430
Uwah....

525
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,450
Master,

526
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,670
He can manage to pay it

527
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,700
I don't care as long as they pay

528
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,050
You passed it to me here

529
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,920
Hurry and pay up

530
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,160
How much is it?

531
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,010
Were you not listening?

532
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,460
He did say it
Yes

533
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,020
How much is the debt?
Ten million!

534
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,170
Ten million?!

535
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,150
I can't pay ten million!

536
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,880
Such a normal response

537
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,540
I'm sorry

538
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,930
Could you just wait 8 years?

539
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,480
If I wait 8 years, you're gonna pay up?

540
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,660
Yes

541
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,030
Alright then

542
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,480
Oh no

543
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,840
That's not good

544
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,170
We did it!

545
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,340
Thank goodness!

546
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,820
We did pretty well didn't we?

547
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,830
Oh really?

548
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,710
The ending was kinda funny. He's gonna wait after all..

549
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,770
Strange...

550
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,470
It turned into something strange

551
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,980
What did you think of it Jimmy-chan?

552
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,620
I thought it was a good play

553
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,750
