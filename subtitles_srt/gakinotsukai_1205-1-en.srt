1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,750
As the boke I'm worried for my job

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,420
Hamada Masatoshi Senility Trial

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,230
This king of comedy will turn 51 this year,

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,160
But his senility will not stop

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,840
His "old man-ness" will be exposed

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,540
Incident #1

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,400
It was an episode where they enjoyed nostalgic games

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,910
They have bang snaps too!!

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,750
Hamada found some bang snaps, that make a loud bang when you throw them

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,740
He hatched a plan to scare Endo,

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,730
He approached with the Bang Snaps

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,090
There's ice cream-

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,320
He tried to throw them to the ground,

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,910
But he misjudged the distance to the table

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,010
Indeed, an onset of senility

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,310
Incident #2

17
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,780
Broadcasted in April, TKO Kinoshita's Shichi Henge

18
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,070
Pay attention to Hamada's front teeth,

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,890
This was there the whole time

20
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,730
Right in the middle?

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,900
He did not notice,

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,490
There was some spring onion stuck between his front teeth

23
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,800
In the centre?!

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Spring onion is stuck in there,

25
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,610
And he didn't notice it,

26
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,880
It's GREEN!

27
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,880
Incident #3

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,140
A birthday gift to his junior,

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:52,560
The tangerine says "Otanbi Omedetou" instead of "OtanJOUbi Omedetou" (Happy Birthday)

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,520
I didn't notice at all

31
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,560
His senility caused him to forget the most important character

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,900
Don't you feel relieved after writing the "TAN"?

33
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,130
I mean that kanji-

34
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,830
That's a great proverb

35
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,440
"One feels relieved after writing OTAN"

36
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Incident #4

37
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:16,970
Hamada misunderstood the size and came in wearing a ladies T-shirt

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,090
Victim - Kimura Yuichi

39
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,090
The victim explains what happened,

40
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,290
In the end,

41
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,530
It was like a ballet dancer's practice outfit,

42
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,030
The shirt barely reached his belly button

43
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,130
It short and tight,

44
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,100
I was quite sad...

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,170
If that was a ladies,

46
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,340
It was just right

47
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,650
Another great proverb

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,660
And tonight, more senility incidents will be exposed!

49
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,260
We have a junior comedian here who looks up to Hamada,

50
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,370
We've collected testimonies,

51
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,420
and a representative is here,

52
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,580
What...

53
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,950
Is that alright?

54
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,830
Yes

55
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,960
Witness, enter please

56
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,370
Presiding Judge
NAKAMURA Yoshinobu   Producer

57
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,110
Hello,

58
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,110
Witness
Jinnai Tomonori

59
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,880
What the hell man

60
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,560
JInnai will be the representative,

61
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,100
That's correct
In order to present evidence against the defendant,

62
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,850
I have collected testimonies from various junior comedians

63
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,850
To provide a judgement,

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,890
Yes indeed,

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,560
Testimonies from junior comedians,

66
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,160
Jinnai will reveal some shocking senile moments!

67
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,600
In honesty, there are many young comedians who admire Hamada,

68
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,610
In fact, I WAS one of them,

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,970
WAS?

70
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,380
You say that in past tense?

71
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,010
I was dissapointed in a lot of his actions,

72
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,560
There's a lot there

73
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,010
So you've lost respect?

74
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,770
First off, "Incident #1 - A Meal Time Disaster"

75
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,590
Hamada has treated many of his juniors to dinner,

76
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,260
But there are many senile moments that occured at those meals

77
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,460
Ready? This is it,

78
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,600
Knocking over a transparent glass with water inside it

79
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,890
"Knocking over a transparent glass with water inside it"

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Transparent things are invisible to him

81
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,970
He can't see them

82
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,800
Just invisible

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,210
Transparent things are invisble,

84
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:27,010
When he knocked it over,

85
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,010
he went " WHAT WAS THAT?!"

86
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,350
He was surprised?

87
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,180
So, moving on,

88
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,180
"Satisfied after 3 pieces of meat"

89
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,180
This story,

90
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,760
Hamada and his juniors,

91
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,810
They had dinner at a Teppenyaki place,
Being considerate of Hamada,

92
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,100
"Should we reduce the size of our order?" they asked him

93
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,560
and Hamada said,

94
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,870
"Don't treat me like an old man! The standard is fine!"

95
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,710
He was a bit angry

96
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,440
So they ate the meat,

97
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,510
But after 3 pieces of meat; "Damn I'm so full"

98
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:05,150
and then he dozed off

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,230
I've been told this happened,

100
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,840
What do you mean "Dozed off"?!

101
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,320
That's what an actual old man would do

102
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,850
This is what I've been told

103
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,630
It's a shock indeed

104
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,830
I wish we saw his meat loving side more there

105
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,340
There's other dishes, before the meat. There's other courses,

106
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,470
So it's not like,

107
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,600
Dozing off, and such

108
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,930
That story is something a comedian made up to be funny

109
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,070
You're still only 50!

110
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,310
You've still got a long way to go

111
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,600
Moving on,
"Pranking Himself Instead of His Junior By Accident"

112
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,850
Hamada, with his junior from Osaka,

113
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,580
There's a bookstore he often goes to,

114
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,450
Leaving his room, Hamada,

115
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,330
He takes his junior's shoes, and throws them really far away,

116
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,360
This is a signature Hamada prank,

117
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,130
But recently, and he does this very often,

118
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,800
He throws his own shoes away

119
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,370
Don't be ridiculous!

120
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,140
HEY! Stop being ridiculous!

121
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,570
There's no way that's true!!

122
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,700
There's no way that's true

123
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,840
I've been told this

124
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,310
This is too terrible!

"Young Comedians Confess"

127
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,430
The senility stories continue

128
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,090
But really, Hamada,

129
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,660
He does care a lot about his juniors' birthdays

130
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,040
He's a kind senpai

131
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,370
Is that so?

132
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,840
First off,
"Forgetting a Birthday #1"

133
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,510
There's 1 and 2

134
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,480
There is a 1 and 2,

135
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,520
There a junior named Hirai, who's birthday Hamada went to,

136
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,360
And 2 days after, Hamada called him up,

137
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,390
"When is your birthday again?"

138
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,430
Piss off!

139
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,230
There's no way that happened

140
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,640
Is it possible to be that dumb?

141
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,500
It was a kind thing to ask, but yes after 2 days

142
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,500
After 2 days?

143
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,800
If it was Monday, he asked on Wednesday

144
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,920
And if it was Wednesday, he asked on Friday

145
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,210
"Forgetting a Birthday #2"

146
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,490
This story,

147
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,070
One day one of Hamada's juniors suddenly got a call from him,

148
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,240
Hamada called him up

149
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,480
"Did you know it was Taiki's birthday yesterday?"

150
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,360
"If we don't do something for him he's gonna be sad,"

151
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,560
"Let's have a party for him"

152
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Very kind

153
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,950
"I'll decide on a place and call you later"
Very kind senpai indeed

154
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:39,540
He hasn't called him back for 2 years

155
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,880
Terrifying!

156
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,740
Comedians are funny huh?

157
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,960
2 years, so close to 700 days?

158
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,450
700 days without a call back

159
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,590
A surprise?

160
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,280
Funny, very funny
As expected of comedians

161
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,980
So moving on,

162
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,260
"They're Senile As a Couple"

163
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:10,080
From one of his juniors,
At Nozowa Naoki's birthday,

164
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,010
When Hamada reached over to remove a rice grain stuck on his wife's face,

165
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,180
She thought he was gonna smack her and was very scared

166
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,990
You piss off!

167
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,460
She was like this

168
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,180
Knock it off I'm saying

169
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,430
Both of them are senile

170
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,300
Incidentally, Hamada is really into using LINE,

171
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,920
There's a stamp that Yoshimoto put out,

172
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,870
A stamp of himself farting, and apparently he really loves it,

173
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,280
Whenever he wants to reply "No" to his wife he sends it to her

174
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,620
Why, why does he do that?

175
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,250
He farts at home,

176
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,720
and farts on LINE,

177
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,090
And then his wife gets scared when she sees it

178
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,460
She thinks she's gonna get smacked

179
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,920
Next, an anti aging story

180
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,570
Another shocking revelation awaits

181
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,640
Hamada, well,

182
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,980
He wants to bring back the cute Hamada of the past

183
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,980
He wants to be cute?

184
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,680
Restoring his cuteness at this age?

185
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,790
He wants to bring back the cute Hama-chan

186
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,020
He's desperately trying different things, like this here,

187
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,860
"An Unwavering Faith In Garlic"

188
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,290
What the hell is that

189
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,900
He just straight up loves garlic

190
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,870
Sounds very stupid

191
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,870
He will order a dish with garlic in it wherever he goes

192
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,770
An unwavering faith

193
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,940
Absolutely

194
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,180
That is a bad way to say that

195
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,310
If you go out for BBQ and they have some garlic side of course you'll order it

196
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,520
An unwavering faith

197
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,450
That's all that means

198
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,320
That's why it says "Unwavering faith"

199
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,440
Stop using stuff like "Unwavering Faith"

200
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,520
Everyone orders garlic

201
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,830
I don't really believe in garlic that much

202
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,130
It makes you seem cute so it's OK

203
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,760
This is a nice thing

204
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,650
So the second thing,

205
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,600
"He Uses Face Masks for His Skin"

206
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,790
This one,

207
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,770
I get it,

208
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,480
This one is true

209
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,610
I admit this one

210
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,820
Have you done this anti-aging stuff recently?

211
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,580
If I go golfing, after I come back,

212
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,160
I will for sure do it then

213
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,880
A picture of that moment,

214
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,340
It's Jason

215
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:54,730
And you're sending a fart here

216
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,500
I don't know about that

217
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,370
Let's move on to the last bit,
A "Title" for Hamada

218
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,680
In order to cement his position,

219
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,400
He's asked his juniors to refer to him by a title

220
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,120
"Call me this"

221
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,780
Oh no

222
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,660
You're all familiar with these titles,

223
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,380
Yeah you guys know this

224
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,240
Hagimoto Kinichi is called "Colonel",

225
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,830
Takeshi-san is "Tono" (Lord)

226
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,830
Sanma-san is "Waka" (Young Lord)

227
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,690
So,

228
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,130
Hamada Masatoshi,

229
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,540
This is what he's told his juniors to call him,

230
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,160
Here we go,
"CEO"

231
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,210
Is he a CEO?

232
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,400
This is not a lie right?

233
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,520
This is true?!

234
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,280
Well, yeah,

235
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,550
We were talking about "Should we decide a title?"

236
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,490
And before that, on some TV show or something Matsumoto-san called me that

237
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,120
So using that I said "Call me CEO",

238
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,210
That's it

239
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,130
So this is not a lie then?

240
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,150
This is not a lie right?

241
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,570
What's with that desperate attitude?

242
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,170
Why is he mad?

243
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,810
I said "Hahaha Call me CEO!"
I said THAT!

244
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,050
Well you did tell us

245
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,530
Alright, alright,

246
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,320
We'll let that one go

247
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,790
And it makes you look cute so it's alright

248
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:33,200
Memory Related Incidents

249
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,270
Incident #1

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,740
An incident when Hamada and his juniors went out for Karaoke

251
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,080
"Mazinger, Mazinger,"

252
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,210
"Mazinger Z!"

253
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,500
"OK! I won't lose to anyone!"

254
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,230
"Tonight, I'm gonna drop you"

255
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,900
"I sang my heart out"

256
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,760
"As expected Hamada-san, you're good!"

257
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,890
"Right?"

258
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,500
"You guys sing your heart out too!"

259
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,670
"Yes, thank you very much!"

260
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,740
"Alright, I'll sing Mazinger-Z again and do better!"

261
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,610
"Okay!"

262
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,610
Right before the junior was about to sing,

263
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,260
"OI! YOU JUST SANG THAT SONG!"

264
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,690
"DON'T SING THE SAME SONG TWICE AT MY KARAOKE PARTY"

265
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,160
"SCUMBAG! I'LL KICK YOUR ASS!!"

266
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,460
"Sorry! I won't do it again!"

267
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,960
Hamada unleashed on the junior

268
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,770
So scary

269
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,670
"Whatever, can I sing now?"

270
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,270
"Yes, please!"

271
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,690
"What should I pick"

272
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,470
Please, please don't

273
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,110
"OK I got it"

274
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,310
Please stop

275
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,380
And then,

276
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,070
"Hmm, is this ..."

277
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,320
If it's not a joke, then this is unnerving

278
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:11,340
Hamada sang Hikigane once again in high spirits

279
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,660
Incident #2

280
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,190
This New Years,

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What kind of house is that?

282
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,310
Hamada's juniors went to his house to hang out

283
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,540
"Hamda-san, Happy New Years!"

284
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,820
"Oh, you guys are here! Come in"

285
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,080
"Your house is huge!"

286
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,320
It's nothing special!

287
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,850
And then,

288
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,790
Cause he's an idiot

289
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,770
"Happy New Years!"

290
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,000
"Ah Natsumi-san, Happy New Years!"

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,460
"Make yourselves at home today!"

292
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,940
"OK! Thank you!"

293
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,210
And then,

294
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,700
The Hamada household's lively puppies

295
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,280
"Hamada-san, you have dogs?!"

296
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,280
"Yup, they're so cute right?"

297
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,870
Hamada cared for his 3 dogs like they were his own family

298
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,330
"I really love dogs!"

299
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,400
"What are their names?"

300
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,760
"You asked a great question!"

301
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,340
"I'm only gonna say this once, so pay attention,"

302
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,230
This big one is Kiyonu,

303
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,040
This one is Ribbon,

304
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,650
and this little guy here is De Niro

305
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,080
"They're so cute right?"

306
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,480
"That's not it at all!"

307
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,680
"The biggest one is De Niro!"

308
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,570
"And this boy is Kiyonu!"

309
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,850
"And the small one is Ribbon, right?"

310
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,180
"Just when will you remember?!"

311
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:02,440
It seems Hamada doesn't know his beloved dogs' names

312
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,980
Incident #3

313
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:16,050
This incident happened when Hamada and his juniors went to play golf

314
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,290
Golf is awesome!

315
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,240
"Hamada-san, you're in high spirits today!"

316
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,510
"That's right,"

317
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,400
"The ball went really far too"

318
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,870
Hamada on that day was feeling his best

319
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,310
They went through the course in high spirits,

320
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,440
And then,

321
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,140
"Okay, starting from now, English is banned"

322
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,520
"You have to pay a 100 yen penalty for every English word"

323
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,370
"Ehh, that's so hard"

324
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,930
"By the way, Hamada-san,"

325
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,560
"What should we call the driver?"

326
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,390
That's easy! That's the pushy thing, or the "Eldest Son"

327
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,900
"Amazing, Hamada-san!"

328
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,500
"So then, what about the Iron?"

329
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,500
Well,

330
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,840
"The Second Son"

331
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,450
Even idiots like you guys understand right?

332
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:14,190
So they began playing with a ban on English

333
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,780
Alright let's do this!

334
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,880
"Yes!"

335
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,400
"Ok then ..."

336
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:32,630
Hamada's very first word was START

337
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,470
"Man, the Eldest Son really hits different!"

338
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,330
What should we do about this

339
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,750
Is it alright if prosecutor Tanaka takes the stand?

340
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,100
Well, well,

341
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,710
Witness
NAOKI Tanaka

342
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,710
That's correct

343
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,950
Those three eipisodes,

344
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,290
You wish it was on purpose,

345
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,490
You wish it was a joke

346
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,920
Yes, a joke

347
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,490
You wish that was the case

348
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,740
Do you have anything to say about those scenes?

349
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,200
The Karaoke?

350
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,050
Hikigane

351
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,800
I cannot recall

352
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,860
Surely it is

353
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,070
Do you remember that you got angry at your junior?

354
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,400
Mazinger-Z

355
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,030
I mean, making people to listen to the same song again,

356
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,540
I see what you mean,

357
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,420
I might have said something about that,

358
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,480
The English ban,

359
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:32,260
That one at least, that could've been a joke

360
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,930
Uh, yeah ...

361
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,240
Sorry, can you elaborate on this

362
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,050
When starting something,

363
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,080
You want to get the excited,

364
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,610
Of course

365
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,140
What did you say?

366
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,110
He said it with his chest

367
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,170
This one is,

368
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:00,420
It's not just me
I mean anyone could make a mistake like that, right?

369
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,690
Well, it was your challenge

370
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,690
The first word you said!

371
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,960
You could've said "Hajime!"

372
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,120
There's more,

373
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,600
Last year, the defendant Hamada released a golf lesson DVD

374
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,220
So with a DVD,

375
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,570
Only people who bought it, can watch it, right?

376
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,980
Whoever bought it, will watch it of course

377
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,020
But still, Hamada at the end of the video,

378
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,280
"Everyone, buy it please!" he said

379
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,610
They're already watching it!

380
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,850
Do you have objections?

381
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,060
Nope

382
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,200
Right

383
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,230
Acts of senility that have shocked the comedy world

384
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,320
It's time for his sentencing

385
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,200
Prosecutor Matsumoto,

386
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,020
Announce your judgement

387
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,610
Judgement

388
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:06,980
The defendant, Masatoshi Hamada, is so senile that we cannot refrain from remarking on it

389
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,900
This is an established fact

390
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:15,400
Now that society knows about his affliction, he must redeem himself

391
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,700
The sentence is; "Hamada Jizo: Steal The Manju" Part 2

392
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,270
"Restore Hamada's Image! Hamda Jizo Part 2"

393
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,270
What?

394
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,610
What Hamada Jizo means...

395
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,330
HOT BLOODED

396
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,810
HAMADA CLASSROOM

397
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:41,480
An episode where Hamada unleashed his Spartan teaching style

398
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,480
Go get it

399
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,220
This incident occurred

400
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,390
So next is "Steal The Manju from Hamada Jizo"

401
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,060
Alright?

402
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:56,700
In this game, players have to steal a Manju being protected by a blindfolded Hamada

403
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,530
Hamada has a paper fan in his right hand,

404
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:06,240
And a CO2 gas burst trigger in his left

405
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,080
He puts his blindfold on and gets ready

406
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:17,200
Principal, you forgot about the button
You need to take the blindfold off first

407
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,620
What're you laughing at?!

408
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,820
Very sorry

409
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,960
Then Koumoto tries to steal the Manju

410
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,990
He swings the fan to protect his manju, however,

411
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,310
You can do it!

412
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,910
He clears the challenge with ease

413
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,190
However Hamada doesn't realise this, and frantically swings the fan

414
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,620
ENOUGH! Enough

415
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,890
What are you doing Principal?

416
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,630
And just when exactly are you gonna use that switch?

417
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,570
A depressing senile moment

418
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,930
He will redeem himself in this moment

419
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,040
Is this necessary?

420
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:10,740
If you can do this, we will no longer doubt that you are not senile

421
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,540
But still, if I'm blindfolded,

422
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,280
I can't see

423
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,910
Yes?

424
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,950
You need to sense it

425
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,250
Sense it? Alright fine

426
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,870
Last time, we were outside

427
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,840
It was pretty blustery that day

428
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,660
Stay quiet, so I can hear

429
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,030
Focus on us then please

430
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
We want to help you as much as we can

431
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,130
We want you to succeed

432
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,100
Yes, I understand, OK

433
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,010
He forgot to pick it up again

434
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,760
Let's begin

435
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,540
You're ready?

436
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,620
Ready,

437
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,620
What, asshole?
