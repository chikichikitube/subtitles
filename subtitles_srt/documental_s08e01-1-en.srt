1
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,190
Alright Matsumoto-san.
Good luck!

2
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,090
Yeah, I'm counting on you guys!

3
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,970
"Matsumoto Hitoshi"
"Fourth year of Documental"

4
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,570
—So this is your fourth year already.
—Yeah, that's right.

5
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,640
The entire premise is that you can't smile.

6
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,540
And not being able to laugh

7
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,780
is probably fun entertainment

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,380
that I think anyone could watch.

9
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,150
To put it simply, it's a battle
But if I had to compare it to something else,

10
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,550
I'd say it's kind of like wrestling or martial arts.

11
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,260
That's probably the best way to put it.

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,920
Yeah...

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,390
You push like this...

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,270
Right now content has become very sensitive,

15
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,240
and people are looking for seriousness.

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,140
And I think this show definitely

17
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,240
goes against that altogether.

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,980
—2000 pieces!
—2000?!

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,180
Stop it! I'm feeling it!

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,780
And if you think we're not being honest,

21
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,790
you just have to make the offer to Sandwichman again.

22
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,790
I don't think he'd ever return to the show.

23
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,230
That's how it is.
It's just a fun idea.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,640
If that were me, I wouldn't go on the show.

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:49,840
But somehow, this show's... you know...
pretty vulgar.

26
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,880
But at the same time, the winners are always unexpectedly

27
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,180
kind of classy in their own way.

28
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,620
I did it!

29
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,390
I think our ten members

30
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,860
have a very documental-like

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,360
mental stability.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,180
"The unflinching theoretical specialist"

33
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,920
"The eternal extra"

34
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,230
"Unbelievably supersonic"

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,920
"The shrieking macho psychopath"

36
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,130
"The full-fledged Afro-dite"

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,310
"The immovable backstage king"

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,010
"The uncrowned emperor of deceit"

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,010
"The very very very very late bloomer"

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,920
"The performer that kills performers"

41
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,230
"The destructive bulldozer"

42
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,850
"Hell's arbiter"

43
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,530
Good work back there.

44
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,230
Today I really feel

45
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,460
kind of exhausted from laughing so much.

46
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,130
I was almost crying. It was insane.

47
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,940
I ended up feeling almost like

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,010
I wanted to see the world like they did.

49
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,980
I kind of ended up admiring them somehow.
How should I put this?

50
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,550
When they faced the challenge of laughing sincerely,

51
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,980
I feel that it turned out really well.

52
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,850
It sure did.

53
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,150
Well...

54
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,220
It was amazing.

55
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,120
This is a garden where dandelions blossom.
And white butterflies flutter around.

56
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,910
The bugs enjoy their exercise in the summer, too.

57
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,410
Alright then, allow me to give you some guidance.

58
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,410
Would you gather a million yen for it?

59
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,210
We're hosting a "Documental".

60
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,310
The winner takes ten million yen.

61
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,210
Of course, you're free to participate.

62
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,910
Anyone strong enough to participate,
will be informed of the date, place and time.

63
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,910
I'm waiting for your reply.

64
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,920
Here's hoping we'll get to spend many springs together.

65
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,820
Matsumoto Hitoshi

66
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,910
"Enter the contestants"

67
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,270
Okay, that's the first one.

68
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,570
Huh?!

69
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,710
So this is how we're going to do it?

70
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,750
I know about it. I've watched it.

71
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,450
You can calm down somewhat when you do it for the second time.

72
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,860
It sure was fun, yeah.

73
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
I don't think

74
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,430
that Junior is the kind of performer

75
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,730
that naturally fits in "Documental" to be honest.

76
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,200
I think I can say it now that it's over,

77
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,230
But I know my own weaknesses.

78
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,270
And I was thinking that maybe I shouldn't have called.

79
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,410
I think it could be fun

80
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,680
to see Junior actually winning it or something, though.

81
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,680
(EN: Titles of each contestant are the same as the ones announced before)

82
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,020
I wasn't expecting this.

83
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,790
Alright...

84
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,760
There are many instances in this show

85
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,630
where people don't laugh as others keep trying.

86
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,860
I wonder what kind of laughter

87
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,130
Junior will be going for after knowing that.

88
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,740
It's the same as the boxing ring.

89
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,510
Everyone participating is completely different.

90
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,410
I'll use whatever I can,

91
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,780
and put up a good show.

92
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,550
That's what I've been thinking.

93
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,550
I see.

94
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,760
Well, well, well.

95
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,830
I see.

96
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,730
Junior!

97
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
So that's how it is.

98
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,100
Look who's here!

99
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,270
—Kinoshita!
—Stop that!

100
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,010
Good work.

101
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,780
Alright, alright.

102
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,650
Guess I don't have to read this.

103
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,990
Make sure to watch this time again.

104
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,860
"Don't you think you have a soft spot for Fujimon, Mastumoto?"

105
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,690
is something I've been told several times.

106
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,600
It's not that I have a soft spot for him in particular,

107
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,740
but I probably like him more than Yukkina. (EN: Fujimoto's ex-wife)

108
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,240
You see

109
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,110
the timing is incredibly important.

110
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,980
I don't really know why, but...

111
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,480
but after seeing something funny,

112
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,680
sometimes you don't feel much like laughing.

113
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,650
And I think that happens to me a lot in "Documental".

114
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,920
Of course, Fujimon knows

115
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,590
that he has a particular power when he's in the background.

116
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,320
And I don't think he intends to change that.

117
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,460
So he's set on winning somehow.

118
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,830
Maybe he also needs the money.

119
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,500
Please make sure you watch again.

120
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,300
I don't think you've ever been teased this much

121
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,570
by anyone else before.

122
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,300
I'm number one in the show business.

123
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,040
So I'm going to grab it this time and counter attack!

124
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,650
Everyone will surely be thinking "ah, good to see Fujimon's doing well!"

125
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,680
And that's just what I'm here to show.

126
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,290
Hey, did you bring the 1.03 million?

127
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,460
Why 1.03? It's just one million, right?

128
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,660
No, that's 30,000 short.

129
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,730
When you called me to talk about your divorce,

130
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,630
I had to call you back.

131
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,570
My long distance call ended up costing over 30,000 yen.

132
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,670
That's not my problem. Not at all.

133
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,000
—Pay up.
—Let me tell you something.

134
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,110
I was just in New Caledonia, and I didn't know.

135
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,370
It's not my problem.

136
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Pay them up already.

137
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,540
What are you even talking about all of a sudden?

138
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,710
Hello there!

139
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,920
Oh come on. He came in through that door?

140
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
That was unexpected.

141
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,950
Yeah I guess.

142
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,960
We're not supposed to be using that one yet.

143
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,790
I think it's fine to make an entrance like that, though.

144
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,500
Hey.

145
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,900
Sheeesh! (EN: Might be "How much!". Not 100% sure)

146
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,540
Matsuo just...

147
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,480
keeps getting funnier and funnier.

148
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,710
So I'm really looking forward to his performance.

149
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,220
He might put up a good fight.

150
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,920
That's how I see it.

151
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,560
I'm feeling pretty confident

152
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
in participating in "Documental"

153
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,890
as Ikko-san this time. (EN: Ikko is a Japanese make-up artist)

154
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,100
Now people are laughing at his Ikko impression,

155
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,600
but it just makes me sick.

156
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,900
I just don't have a soft spot for it at all.

157
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,270
Even if I got the ten million,

158
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,080
I'd like to give at least seven million to Ikko-san.

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,880
Kind of like a deposit.
It'd be like a franchise.

160
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,850
No, you're not there yet.

161
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,120
Why?!

162
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,420
Come on, drop it.

163
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,430
I don't want it to be an impersonation making fun of her,

164
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,600
but rather a sign of respect.

165
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,440
Okay, do it once in front of us.

166
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,570
Okay.

167
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,880
Sheesh!

168
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,350
It hasn't even started yet.

169
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,880
You shouldn't do that anymore, though.

170
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,020
Why?

171
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,680
It's gonna get old.

172
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,220
—Yeah, maybe...

173
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,690
Wait... whoa!

174
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,490
Look, Junior-san.

175
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
Huh?

176
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,330
Who's that?

177
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,300
Shoji?!

178
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,800
—Good morning.
—Good morning.

179
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,940
I'm counting on you.

180
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,040
I don't really know what you're going to do, though.

181
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,010
It's his first time.

182
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,710
I can't imagine your strategy.

183
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,880
You said "Documental"?

184
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,950
I'm so happy!

185
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,880
Mikitty!!

186
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,190
I'm happy, but also scared.

187
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,090
I entered this world because I admired Downtown so much.

188
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,030
The reason this is Shoji's first time

189
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,630
is that I didn't think he'd be so good.

190
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,400
To be honest, I thought that when he went all out,

191
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,340
he was on about a fourth grader's level.

192
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,110
Mikitty!!

193
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,580
He's on top of the world at the moment.

194
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,650
And I think that happiness

195
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,620
may end up creating some kind of spark within him.

196
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
—I'm counting on you.
—Shoji?

197
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,290
The two successful lovebirds of the entertainment industry.

198
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,460
Which one of you is the loser?

199
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,960
I've been playing the role of dad

200
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,930
a lot of the time recently.

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,130
But now,

202
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,470
I kind of want to show them my pride as a comedian.

203
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,140
I don't want to crush them with technique, but with feelings.

204
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,610
I have a one track mind.

205
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,480
I'll do my best,

206
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,680
and pull off the unexpected,

207
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,450
with my soul.

208
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,320
I think that I'd like to push forward with my soul.

209
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,960
You'd have us all beat if we were cooking stew.

210
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,660
That commercial was just—

211
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,730
Not yet!

212
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,860
It's not the time to talk about that yet!

213
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
It doesn't matter, though does it?

214
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,330
Leave it!

215
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm telling you it's still too early!

216
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,840
—What are you getting so worked up for?
—He's totally lost it!

217
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,340
What are you so worked up for?

218
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,610
—He's too upset over nothing.
—I can't keep up with that.

219
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,580
So the commercial...

220
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,310
Stop it with the bullying already.

221
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:03,750
-Bullying?

222
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,250
-Someone's here. Look, look!
-Bullying?

223
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:05,680
-Someone's here. Look, look!

224
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,920
Who is it this time?

225
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,750
Fujita?!

226
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,990
Fujita!

227
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,090
This is looking bad!

228
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,600
You guys all look good!

229
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,470
What's that?

230
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,730
It's... it's that thing.

231
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
And here you were saying that you felt pretty confident

232
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,400
I didn't say anything, and I'm not confident!

233
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,770
I hope the other legends watch over him!

234
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Too soon!

235
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,510
I really like Fujita.

236
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,910
And I kind of think he's adorable.

237
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,050
I've heard that Matsumoto-san really likes me.

238
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,550
At least that's what people say.

239
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,550
Don't say that here.

240
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,790
Also, I think that physically speaking,

241
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,490
Matsumoto-san likes me a lot better.

242
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,660
Get outta here!

243
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,890
This is his strength.

244
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,460
He's funny,

245
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,530
and he can do some pretty solid Manzai.

246
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,170
So maybe he'll be able to pull off something good this time.

247
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,480
He tends to play the tsukkomi much more than me,

248
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,510
so he's not just going to sit around.

249
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,850
He's going to go on the offense.

250
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,450
I don't think they're expecting anything from me.

251
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,850
Nothing at all.

252
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,330
I've been watching the series.

253
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:28,800
And it's managed to make me laugh in a way nothing else had before.

254
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,330
So like...

255
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,240
Considering I hadn't really thought about being on it before,

256
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,970
I've decided to take a completely new approach.

257
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,710
Fujimoto-san, can you do this?

258
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,940
I can!

259
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
I don't like this.

260
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,880
I'm telling you I can.

261
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,480
I really don't want to do this.

262
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,290
I don't want to go like this.

263
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,620
Why don't we stretch or something?

264
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,000
Really?!

265
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,930
Should've stayed backstage at Lumine.

266
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
This is Yoshimoto all the way.

267
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,270
Cheers!

268
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
Stop that!

269
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,940
—Good morning.
—Good morning.

270
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,180
A red letter?

271
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,230
Lately,

272
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,730
we've been struggling

273
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,860
with several things.

274
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,530
I'd like this season

275
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,900
to be completely released

276
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,400
with Amazon, though.

277
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,300
Is it okay for you to be here?

278
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,370
Sure is!

279
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,970
Who are you...?

280
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,510
Who are you even talking to right now?

281
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,310
It's been eight years, huh?

282
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,540
Are you okay here?

283
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,180
Sure am. It's been eight years already.

284
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,480
I don't really remember.

285
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,450
I'd say his main attribute would be...

286
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,490
his high potential.

287
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,990
I think he'll be able to stand high levels of stress, too.

288
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,160
He can make things as chaotic as he wants.

289
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,830
So they want me to go there and make a mess, huh?

290
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,540
Even if you try to put up a show on your own, you have to make sure you're not doing it for the wrong opponent.

291
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,710
That's why comebacks have to...

292
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,000
hit them all at once.
Or you might end up bringing yourself down in the end.

293
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,550
Besides, counter-attacks seem to
be able to make people laugh, too.

294
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,680
I want to make them realize

295
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,150
that Koumoto's style is really unique.

296
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,050
I want to make them learn something new.

297
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,090
You heard them.

298
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,360
That doesn't matter.

299
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,530
I can't listen to what someone tells me eight years later.

300
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,500
I can see it already.

301
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,570
He does it in all his commercials and even on TV all the time.

302
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,200
—I think he'll be out right away.
—He just loves it.

303
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,640
—He loves those big smiles.
—I do.

304
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,840
—Speaking of which...
—Come on...

305
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,780
—The competition hasn't even started yet!
—The competition, yeah!

306
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,980
Hey, nice going.

307
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,820
For real?!

308
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,950
How many times are you gonna do this?!

309
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,890
Are you going to live here now?

310
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,090
Excuse me.

311
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,960
No one said anything, though!

312
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,090
It's here?
Okay, received!

313
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,410
I've been short on money lately.

314
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,230
And right now, business is going pretty bad,

315
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,470
and well I have to pay rent.

316
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,470
He's already well established.

317
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,680
At least I think he is.

318
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,380
This is something I heard at a certain massage place a while ago...

319
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,580
"You're..."

320
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,510
"...Japanese. No way. You're. American!"
Or something like that.

321
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,810
Those words gave me courage.

322
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,960
To be honest, I think Kobayashi is funnier

323
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,600
when he's kind of...

324
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,670
...surrounded by people more experienced than him.

325
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,140
It might be kind of difficult for him

326
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,480
to be surrounded by mostly people younger than him.

327
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,610
Every time I come here, I realize...

328
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,050
...just how complicated laughter is.

329
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,120
Everyone says

330
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,290
that time flies when you're having fun.

331
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,490
But frankly, I find it mostly exhausting.

332
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,090
You don't even see six hour shifts in the adult industry.

333
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,000
You're a regular now!

334
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,260
How many times has it been for you?

335
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,330
This is Junior-san's second.

336
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,100
—It's rough!
—I need the money.

337
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,970
Nine years... once in nine years!

338
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,310
Once in nine years!

339
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,440
In nine years?

340
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,950
No way!

341
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,550
There he is!

342
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,480
I'm sorry!
Good morning.

343
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,420
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

344
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,020
Someone good just showed up!

345
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,090
What's this?

346
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,390
Me?!

347
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,600
I'm a crackpot underground comedian!

348
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,070
This is from Matsumoto-san?

349
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,910
He's from the same generation as Fujimon.

350
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,580
He started performing at Yoshimoto 12 years ago.

351
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,310
When I was in middle school, I became part of the Yoshimoto's NSC 8th generation.

352
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,680
I got a little frustrated,

353
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,150
and my level kind of...

354
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,090
...started to lag behind.

355
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,650
8th generation!

356
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,860
He was part of the 8th but eventually became part of the 13th.

357
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,160
So we're coworkers too.

358
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,400
We had a lot of peers.

359
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,700
Yeah, lots of them.

360
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,300
I'm gonna do a coocoo clock now.

361
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,080
I guess he's more primitive.

362
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,510
I expect him to have a position

363
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,350
kind of similar to Jimmy-chan.

364
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,990
Great Kinnikuman.
"Kinnikuman!"

365
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,160
It may be a great chance for him.

366
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,330
If I end up going down,

367
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,400
I'm not going to live the life of the underground comedian anymore.

368
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,200
I'm carrying it all on my back.

369
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,410
We met at 14, 15 years old.

370
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,210
That's right.

371
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,610
—And Oshiro is...?
—One year younger.

372
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,010
At the NSC...

373
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,210
He's younger than Junior-san?

374
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,180
—He was 14, I was 15.
—When was that?

375
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,990
Second, third year of middle school.

376
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,920
Look at that.

377
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,220
I'm going to do a short skit.

378
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,490
It's been a while.

379
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,060
Skit: "Takeda-kun".

380
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,070
Takeda! Snap!
Oh! I got Yoshida!

381
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,770
O-hyo-hyo!

382
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,510
—This is...
—This is bad!

383
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,340
That must've been like 30 years ago.

384
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,580
30 years already?

385
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,720
What were you thinking 30 years ago?

386
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,180
The ninth one is here.

387
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,750
He did the same thing twice.

388
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,660
We could see you!

389
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,490
How many times has it been already?!

390
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,360
Give it a rest!

391
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,930
You've done it already!

392
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,800
It's been like six times already!

393
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,200
Excuse me.

394
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,910
I'm kind of used to it...
this red letter

395
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,940
Alright, let's do this.

396
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,720
I want to show them

397
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,750
that I'm going to be relentless and the best.

398
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,110
I'm kind of left wondering

399
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,490
why does he still show up?

400
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,790
He's a semi-regular at this point!

401
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,230
I'm thankful, though.

402
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
And my expectations have kept rising.

403
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:47,560
Quitting while you're ahead is really lame.
So I'll keep coming back until they tell me to stop.

404
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,240
I'd like to win it all, to be honest.

405
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,810
He's pretty good.

406
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,140
He's insanely good.

407
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,710
We have a hell of a lineup.

408
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,780
It's all Yoshimoto.

409
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,580
I don't want to see Kukky

410
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,820
try his absolute best and go for the win.

411
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,420
I want him to be out quickly,

412
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,220
and see him as a zombie.

413
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,430
If anything,

414
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,490
his zombie performance

415
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,560
might be pretty good.

416
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,530
Every time I put in my all from the beginning.

417
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,070
I have almost no defensive barriers after all.

418
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,070
I think playing offensively is the best defense.

419
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,970
It's just like boxing,

420
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,980
I want to at least create the opportunity to throw a jab.

421
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,580
Because you won't hit anything

422
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,080
if you don't throw the punch.

423
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,050
I never expected this lineup.

424
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,590
It's all Yoshimoto.

425
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,930
—You're in Yoshimoto, right?
—That's right!

426
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,560
The last one?

427
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,500
That's the last one, right?

428
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,170
For real?!

429
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,640
No, no, no, no!

430
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,480
Even the brothers didn't know about it.

431
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,120
It's here?
Thank you very much.

432
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,560
Ten million in front the family.
That's a lot of money.

433
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,230
Of course, thanks to our dad,

434
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,290
we saw a lot of scandalous things happen in private.

435
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,130
He looks happy to be on the show for the third time.

436
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,140
Most TV channels

437
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,140
have already banned us altogether.

438
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,170
And after a while,

439
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,340
we ended up on Amazon.

440
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,440
So we're two regulars down, huh?

441
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,150
Long time no see.

442
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,890
With two brothers here...

443
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,460
This is...

444
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,130
You have memories and everything together.

445
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,960
I may have some funny stories

446
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,530
to tell about this guy right here.

447
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,160
Just take each other out today, please.

448
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,400
Yeah, destroy each other.

449
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,010
How is it to record for six straight hours?

450
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,010
I've had to ride a bumpy bus in Africa for eight straight hours.

451
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,740
This is nothing!

452
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,810
We have toilets and running water, right?

453
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,150
We have food, right?
Even stuff to drink...

454
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,640
Seiji's here too?

455
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,540
Seems like he's watching the TV.

456
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,910
And Kukky too!

457
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,740
How nonchalant!

458
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,650
You sure look giddy today!

459
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,350
You jogging now?

460
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,250
I had enough with Sanma-san!

461
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,550
He's Sanma-san!

462
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,720
Okay everyone.
This is amazing!

463
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,790
You're all getting along!

464
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
This looks really fun!

465
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,700
This might be the first time we've had an atmosphere like this!

466
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,930
Really?

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,460
Right? Don't you think so?

468
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,530
Yeah, that's true.

469
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,070
We're testing each other.

470
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,370
—This is great.
—They usually walk in smoothly and...

471
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,370
It really feels like a dressing room.

472
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,970
That's right.

473
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,080
I guess it's because so many have been chased off the face of Earth.

474
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,210
Stop it!

475
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,910
I'm sure it's just your imagination when talking about me, though.

476
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,310
Imagination?

477
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,750
I think it's looking pretty grim for you.

478
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,050
Yeah, but we can't screw up again.

479
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,820
Sure.

480
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,560
I'm sure Amazon doesn't mind though.

481
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,420
Of course. Well... that's right.

482
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,360
About Amazon.

483
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,230
Uh... To be honest, I wasn't sure if I should say this.

484
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,370
This is Season 8, right?

485
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,970
And well, Season 7 got really good ratings,

486
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,310
And Amazon was very pleased.

487
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,840
They really want to keep "Documental" going,

488
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,380
which is a huge compliment.

489
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,750
So then we really got carried away and recorded.

490
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,180
The next season?

491
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,620
We recorded the next season...
And now it looks like it's not going to be released.

492
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Did something happen?

493
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,090
What happened?

494
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,260
Amazon's higher ups said

495
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,500
that it was way too vulgar.

496
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,000
That's fine! And I'm not trying to make a point or anything,

497
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,410
just that even Amazon does have a line that we can't cross.

498
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,810
-I see.
-A line?

499
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,680
We don't know that line!

500
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,050
So no vulgar jokes?

501
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,410
No, no. You can joke around as much as you like.

502
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,450
It's really no problem at all.
It's just that you can't do absolutely anything.

503
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
I see.

504
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,290
But season 7 was pretty good.

505
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,960
I see, so you guys went a bit too far.

506
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,930
I mean, I'm even wearing an Amazon hoodie,

507
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,930
to show how sorry I am.

508
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,330
That's worse than I imagined!

509
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,300
—So you're being polite?
—I am.

510
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,470
I'm really being extremely polite.

511
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,970
So that's why he walked in all jogging and everything?

512
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,140
All nonchalant!

513
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,910
As an apology?

514
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,680
Kind of.
Besides, a lot has been going on at Yoshimoto

515
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,780
especially since last year.

516
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,780
Ever since Chance joined Yoshimoto.

517
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,580
He started this all!

518
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,880
First I've heard of it.

519
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,990
It might be true, though.

520
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,250
For real.

521
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,020
I'm counting on you all!

522
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,160
And well, since everyone today is a Yoshimoto comedian.

523
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,530
That's right.

524
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,400
It's like a full-on Yoshimoto performance.

525
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,170
Stop it! It all comes down to that?

526
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,540
What?

527
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,570
You're all pretty self aware, huh?
Great intuition.

528
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,810
What does that T-shirt say if you read it vertically?

529
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,200
—What's written there?
—Why do you care? It doesn't make a difference?

530
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,810
What's wrong with you, man?

531
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,280
It's still too early for this!

532
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,720
It's not early!

533
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,550
If anything, doing this right now might be better.

534
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,320
You're right.

535
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,660
You sure love scandals, right?

536
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,090
What's the deal with your big brother?

537
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,130
For real.

538
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,970
Okay, everyone! Please give me the money!

539
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,540
For real...

540
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,510
Oh come on...

541
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,910
I want this!

542
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,210
—I know, right?
—I really want it!

543
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,610
I can't count everything in detail, but I trust you.

544
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
One million.
One million...

545
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,350
Okay, here we have 5 million.

546
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,280
That's amazing.

547
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,820
That's tight.

548
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,890
It's pretty flashy.
Kind of excessive.

549
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,560
By the way, Chance. That's a lot of money, huh?

550
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,460
First time I've seen something like it.

551
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,000
Okay, there it is.

552
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,270
So I work in construction, right?

553
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,130
Yeah, construction.

554
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,940
This is from getting 10,000 per day.

555
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,500
—That's your salary?
—So it's a hundred days.

556
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,940
It's a hundred days, yeah.

557
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,540
That's too real!

558
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,350
From digging all those holes, huh?

559
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,320
By the way, here's my million.

560
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,650
Thank you very much!

561
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,860
So we need to add this, which gets us to 11 million yen.

562
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,720
So this is my million.

563
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,060
There we go.

564
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,400
And we're gonna put this in here.

565
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,870
No way!

566
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,340
—That looks nice!
—Every time I see it...

567
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,500
It's just too much.

568
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,470
I'm really giving this to you guys.

569
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,180
Well, to the winner.
It's 10 million!

570
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,080
No way! 10 million!

571
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,810
I really want it!

572
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,180
It's really impressive.

573
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,850
It is impressive.
Alright, that's that.

574
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,360
I ended up talking a bit too much.
Okay, six hours!

575
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,360
Okay, so I've been thinking of getting more strict this time!

576
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,260
At least that's the point.

577
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,960
You can get a direct red now.

578
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,030
If you get too careless.

579
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,740
He's completely screwed.

580
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,510
You've been laughing all this time.

581
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,140
Junior too, yeah.

582
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,280
That's just how I look, you know?

583
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,250
—That's no good!
—Not at all!

584
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,910
This is pretty bad news!

585
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,080
Wasn't that a direct red?

586
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,450
Well, I think Junior in particular,

587
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,290
you have to watch out and make sure your mouth is always slanting downwards.

588
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,920
Junior's screwed, for real!

589
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,160
You'd be out already.

590
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,420
Alright, then...

591
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,690
So no matter what happens, you can laugh or cry,

592
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
we're doing the whole six hours.

593
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,100
Let it end at four hours today, come on.

594
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,230
I think it's about time!

595
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,070
Also, I told some staff to be on stand by around here, so...

596
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,640
Make sure to use them if you need to.

597
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,040
Sure, thank you.

598
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,110
Good luck!

599
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,350
Seiji's watch is a Louis Vuitton and that's hilarious for some reason.

600
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,000
Well, I guess Seiji just likes that kind of brand.

601
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
Luxury brands.

602
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,420
Alright then. Let's start "Documental"!

603
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,160
There it goes!

604
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,560
Oshiro has been pretty strict since 25 years ago already.

605
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,200
That's just Oshiro.

606
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,400
I'm sure people watching are now wondering

607
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,200
just what is funny about Oshiro being that way.

608
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,340
But for us laughing works

609
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,540
kind of like a Mobius strip.

610
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,380
What's that right there?

611
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,320
A hat.

612
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,490
Yeah, a hat.

613
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,320
I was wondering if there was something inside but didn't want to touch it.

614
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,720
No, it's just a hat.

615
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,290
It's a bontang made in Okayama.

616
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,160
It's kind of stylish.

617
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,300
—Huh? Where is this from?
—Okayama.

618
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,830
—That's a school uniform?
—Yeah.

619
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:15,240
I had it custom made to look like a uniform.

620
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,210
It looks like a letter "M"!

621
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,710
—For real.
—Are you trying to advertise here?

622
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,710
For McDonald's?

623
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,680
And these over here, too.

624
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,980
Like the McDonald's logo.

625
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,850
Are you going to start singing, too?

626
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,790
You should write "I'm lovin' it" right there.

627
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,520
As a decoration?

628
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,220
They're not coming?

629
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,390
Who?

630
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,300
You weren't listening. I told you already.

631
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,300
Of course we're not going to run any McDonald's commercials.

632
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,270
That's good.

633
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,400
If we wrote "I'm lovin' it" right there,

634
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,470
we could call it a commercial.

635
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,940
I guess you're right.

636
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,310
This is your first time, Shouji?

637
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,710
It's also my first time, and I'm kind of happy to be here.

638
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,810
You watched things like this, Seiji-san?

639
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,680
—Sure.
—He doesn't look like it.

640
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,750
At all.

641
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,590
Huh? Really? I sure do.

642
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,860
But I'm always drinking,

643
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,630
so I never get to know who wins.

644
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,260
Call Mikitty to raise the curtain.

645
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,500
You sure?

646
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,400
—Let's make an announcement.
—And also,

647
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,430
get Ikko-san to support you.

648
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,670
Going through.

649
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,100
Okay.

650
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,340
Here we go.

651
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,580
—Mikitty!
—Sheesh!

652
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,080
—Mikitty!
—Sheesh!

653
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,950
—Mikitty Mikitty!
—Shoulder throw!

654
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,190
—Mikitty!
—Sheesh!

655
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,020
—Mikitty!
—Sheesh!

656
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,200
Junior!

657
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,300
I told you!

658
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,800
I told you about it!

659
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,970
That was too fast!

660
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,300
Too early!

661
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,470
He's the worst among us!

662
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,040
No way!

663
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,140
That's too fast!

664
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,910
Okay, Junior.
You were smiling normally.

665
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,050
Isn't that the fastest in "Documental" history?

666
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,380
I think it's probably the fastest.

667
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,750
That's no good.

668
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,650
We couldn't let that slip by.

669
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,250
What just happened, really?

670
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,160
How disappointing!

671
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,630
—Mikitty Mikitty!
—Shoulder throw!

672
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,200
—Mikitty!
—Sheesh!

673
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,530
—Mikitty!
—Sheesh!

674
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,540
He was way out of line!

675
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,070
What a spoiled brat!

676
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,480
To be honest, I was waiting for it.

677
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,840
But you're supposed to be more strict this time.

678
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,580
That's a straight red.

679
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,620
I was waiting for it, but it was way too much, and I couldn't keep up.

680
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,820
It was the fastest ever, while we were just raising the curtain.

681
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,490
-So what now?
-Yeah, yeah, you're right.

682
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,490
Are you really okay with that?

683
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,690
It's a yellow for now.

684
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,930
That was a yellow.

685
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,300
Alright! Now we're getting into it!

686
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,960
Never imagined someone would laugh at that, though!

687
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,400
Not on the streets!

688
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,940
No way, yeah!

689
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,740
Alright, alright.

690
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,940
What have you been doing all this time?

691
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,220
Sukkera Kecchi!!
