00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,630

00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,760
Put your life on the line with one bite and win 100,000 yen

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,760
Kiki Melon Pan!!!

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,150
Alright

6
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,160
Yes

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,150
Matsumoto-san

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,760
Yes yes

9
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,630
I said that this is the 40th Kiki

10
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,630
Wow

11
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,860
We've eaten that much food, huh

12
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,230
The last one that Matsumoto got correct was 3 years ago

13
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,130
A couple years, huh

14
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,730
Huhhh

15
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,300
My last one was around 4 years ago

16
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,300
So it seems

17
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,130
Endo got one last year

18
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,920
I got one only a year ago

19
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,430
You got one a year ago, huh

20
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,460
Last year

21
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,030
The last time Yama-chan got one

22
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,030
Yes

23
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,360
12 and a half years ago

24
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,940
12 and a half years ago

25
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,460
The stakes have suddenly gotten higher, huh

26
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,000
The rules are simple

27
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Out of the ten different choices

28
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,120
They must find the one that they ate

29
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,730
If they're right, they'll get 100,000 yen

30
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,730
Will anyone get the prize?

31
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,730
Endo might

32
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
What happened, are you okay Endo?

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,230
I'm fine, it's just that

34
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,270
I haven't had any sugar in 3 months

35
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,270
That's amazing

36
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,340
So, this is...

37
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,340
You haven't had sugar in 3 months?

38
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,480
Then, you haven't seen any of these unwrapped before, have you?

39
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,950
I've only seen commercials

40
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,400
The first challenger

41
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,090
The physically improved Endo

42
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,600
Having not eaten sugar in 3 months

43
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,200
Gunichi's Melon Pan

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,030
If you eat it, a sweet taste will spread inside your mouth

45
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,100
He's smelling

46
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,630
A nostalgic smell

47
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,030
It's really sweet

48
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,330
The smell?

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,330
The smell

50
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,800
This is really sweet

51
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,880
Melon Pan was this sweet?

52
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,730
That's enough of that

53
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,760
Talk about something else quickly

54
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,760
Aren't you tired of it

55
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,350
Wowwww, it's delicious

56
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,560
3 months since, huh

57
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,460
Delicious

58
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,930
It's really delicious

59
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,770
It's been 3 months, huh

60
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,770
I don't have your experience, but

61
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,460
This is so delicious

62
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,730
This Yamazaki Pan

63
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,300
Melon Pan

64
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,300
Thisss one, I

65
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,750
Wow, it has 11 grams of sugar, that's a lot

66
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,000
That's enough, really

67
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,630
A buttery consistency

68
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,260
It's usually buttery

69
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,930
It certainly was very buttery, I'll try this one

70
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,270
Remember the taste

71
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,130
Remember how it was

72
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,000
It's delicious, huh

73
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,100
It's delicious

74
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,500
That's pretty delicious, huh

75
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,660
It was very delicious, but the

76
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,830
surface was rough

77
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,740
It's wrong?

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,630
It was rougher?

79
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,560
How did it taste?

80
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,860
This Yamazaki Melon Pan was a bit more

81
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,110
Well, the butter was a little

82
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,500
Was a bit stronger

83
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,860
That was a hint, huh

84
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:54,860
Yes

85
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,130
The butter's consistency

86
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,560
The butter, huh

87
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,130
Butter

88
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,430
Mine was weak at first then it got stronger

89
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,430
Melon Pan

90
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,360
The one I ate was not Yamazaki's Melon Pan

91
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,060
Try as a might, I couldn't see myself having eaten that one

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,110
The surface had a bit of a rough feeling... This one

93
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,860
Gunichi Pan

94
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,260
KariKari Melon Pan

95
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,200
Here I go

96
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,150
Gunichi Pan

97
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,630
Swee... Sweet , huh

98
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,860
Here I go

99
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,830
Gunichi Pan

100
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,500
Yes

101
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,560
From Gunma Ken

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,920
Huh, isn't it the number one bread, Gunichi Pan

103
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,300
This one's delicious too

104
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,140
They are all delicious, huh

105
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,500
You can't just keep saying it's delicious

106
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,340
Really

107
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,200
Sorry

108
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,500
That's, that's true but, ahh

109
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,960
Ahh, it's wrong, ahh

110
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,000
This one's wrong

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,600
It was sweeter

112
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,360
This one wasn't as sweet

113
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,360
That time was different

114
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,290
Yeah, the one I ate had a stronger taste

115
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,660
The one I ate

116
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,400
Was not Gunichi Pan

117
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,360
Idiot

118
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,900
What an idiot

119
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,900
What's with that?

120
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,560
You were totally bankrupt

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,640
He was

122
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,640
He really was

123
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,940
Right

124
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,430
He's really mad

125
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,360
He's bankrupt

126
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,360
Scary

127
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,760
How scary

128
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,760
Wow, be careful

129
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Your head's more hollow than bread

130
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,960
Gunichi

131
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,260
It was Gunichi, it was Gunichi

132
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,660
Yes

133
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,990
Did you know at all?

134
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,230
I had no clue, the first one I ate was too sweet

135
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,930
Since you haven't eaten sugar in 3 months, you wouldn't be able to tell

136
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,260
Wait a second, are you really....

137
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
Thank you very much!

138
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,630
If I said that the one I ate, is and isn't, for example

139
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,800
That's no good

140
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,500
No, no

141
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,700
Get 100,000 yen Kiki Melon Pan

142
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,030
Next up

143
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,560
4 and a half years since his last win

144
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,200
Is Hamada

145
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,000
Hamada's chosen bread

146
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,130
Pasco's

147
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,130
Sakufua Melon Pan

148
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,130
The exterior is soft

149
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,960
The inside is soft and strong

150
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,930
Will he be able to find this taste?

151
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,320
The mood is bad, huh

152
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,230
What are you doing now?

153
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,100
No

154
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,940
Sorry

155
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,560
Melon Pan is, uh...

156
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,760
The surface has different features on each sections

157
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,400
Yes

158
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
So what are you doing, then?

159
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll eat it now

160
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,000
How does it feel?

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,260
Yeah, well, really

162
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,760
Well, it tastes like Melon Pan

163
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,560
It's not terribly sweet

164
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,100
While I was pressing it on my lips, I was thinking

165
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,200
It wasn't like these smooth surfaced ones

166
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,560
I think that its surface was different

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,280
Is this the same pattern Endo had?

168
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,830
Do you remember which one was Endo's?

169
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,420
Yes, this one

170
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,500
Ah, Gunichi

171
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Well then, I'll start with Endo's Pan

172
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,300
It's soft

173
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,400
It's sweet

174
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,060
I wonder if Gunichi is sweeter?

175
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,260
Gunichi

176
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,960
I wonder if that's true

177
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,830
Ahh, this one's very sweet

178
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,630
It seems like it's sweeter

179
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,630
So it seems

180
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,130
This is completely different

181
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:33,960
I know that

182
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,730
This one's too sweet

183
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,460
The one that I ate

184
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,360
Was not Gunichi Melon Pan

185
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,060
It was different?

186
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,060
Yes

187
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,030
Huh, that's good

188
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,900
The one I just ate was way sweeter

189
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,260
I'll go with this one then, Fuji Pan

190
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,160
Fuji Pan

191
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Fuji Pan, huh

192
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,700
The one I ate wasn't that sweet, but

193
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,380
This type of surface that's crisp, I'm not sure about

194
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,860
No

195
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,230
It was a little

196
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,430
less crisp

197
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,430
The one I ate

198
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,400
Was not Fuji Pan Melon Pan

199
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,800
Yes

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,140
He's cleared two

201
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,660
I'll do the neighboring Pasco

202
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,100
Yes?

203
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,260
It was softer, so why is this one so crisp

204
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,030
It's because I feel like this is it

205
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,830
Ahh, but then, you don't feel like it's wrong?

206
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,860
Yes

207
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,530
If I feel worried, should I just go for it?

208
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,900
Hmm, I wonder, huh

209
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,460
Hmm

210
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,660
Well, that's the problem here

211
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,660
Huh, so it seems

212
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,660
Right?

213
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,530
It's like choosing between grey, white or black

214
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,530
Right

215
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,530
Right

216
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,500
They're all close

217
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,200
So it seems

218
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
So it seems

219
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,230
Alright, it's been a while so I'll just go

220
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,640
I always throw it out and get it wrong, but today I'll just go for it

221
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,020
Ehhh

222
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,530
You turned right in the middle of it

223
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,530
What's up with that?

224
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,060
What's with that?

225
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,360
Wow, that was surprising, you really got me

226
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,100
Really

227
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,800
What are you expecting when you make a face like that

228
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,000
The one I ate was

229
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Was Pasco Sakufua Melon Pan

230
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,260
Amazing

231
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,130
Seriously

232
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,700
Wow

233
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,500
Hasn't it been a while

234
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,600
Amazing, amazing

235
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,930
Thank you very much

236
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,930
Thank you

237
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,330
This is amazing

238
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,300
Wow, 4 years

239
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,060
Since it's been 4 and a half years since I got it right

240
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,730
Amazing

241
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,730
Amazing, that was amazing

242
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,930
4 years ago

243
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,930
Well, well, well

244
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,430
Wow, that's amazing

245
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,930
Yes

246
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,930
Yes

247
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,630
Can he follow up Hamada

248
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,760
Tanaka is the third to face the challenge

249
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,400
His choice is Okinawa Okiko Melon Pan

250
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,330
Will he be able to remember this taste?

251
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,100
Ahh, ahhh

252
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,400
Hmm?

253
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:48,930
What's up?

254
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,560
Well, it's pretty sweet

255
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,780
Of course it is

256
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,030
Wow, it's pretty sweet

257
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,900
Everyone said so, everyone said so Tanaka

258
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,140
It can't be helped

259
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,630
Everyone has been saying that

260
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,500
Everyone seems to be using their lips

261
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,880
But will he be able to remember it I wonder

262
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,660
Right

263
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,860
If he can, he'd be a master

264
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,860
Ohh, he's eaten it

265
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,900
Huh?

266
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,900
It's not like how it smells

267
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,200
Huh?

268
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,700
What is it?

269
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,500
It's sweetness

270
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,500
"Sweetness"

271
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,830
"Sweetness"

272
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,660
It's sweet, it's sweet

273
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,930
Ok, firstly, the one everyone had trouble with

274
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,930
Yes

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,860
Gunichi Pan

276
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,100
Ahh

277
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,160
From Gunma

278
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,860
Ahh

279
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,360
It's completely different

280
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,400
Maybe I can do this

281
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,060
Ehh, the one I ate

282
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,460
Was not Gunichi Melon Pan

283
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,590
How was it completely different?

284
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,930
Well... the one I ate

285
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,930
Was softer

286
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,460
So, Gunichi was more

287
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,030
Zaku Zaku

288
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,830
T.N. "Saku Saku" is soft

289
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,030
Huh?

290
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,560
Wait, wait, wait, how was it?

291
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,560
"Zaku Zaku?"

292
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,200
"Zaku Zaku"

293
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,200
What are you saying?

294
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,930
"Zaku Zaku"

295
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,930
It was crisper

296
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,400
It was extremely crisp

297
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,600
Which means

298
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,560
The one I ate wasn't crisp

299
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,330
Maybe

300
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,130
Mine was softer

301
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,100
Tanaka, with his heightened confidence, clears two more

302
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,030
Huh, Okiko I wonder, Okiko

303
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,200
I feel like it will be different

304
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,130
It's wrong

305
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,500
No matter how I think about it, the surface was softer

306
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,440
No matter which one I pick, it tastes crisper

307
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,930
This one is wrong

308
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,530
You can tell the softness and crispness, huh

309
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,530
Yes, I can tell

310
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,030
The one I ate

311
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:47,360
Was not Kokashi Butter Fumi Melon Pan

312
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,900
Whoa, that was quick

313
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,520
Yep, that's too bad

314
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,880
That was so bad

315
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,790
Yep, too bad

316
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,100
I didn't think it was that one at all

317
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,460
That was bad

318
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,010
This is scary

319
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,280
Think with more zip

320
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,430
That looks like it hurt

321
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,430
The right one was this

322
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,930
It was that one

323
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,200
Okiko

324
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,660
It really was Okiko

325
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,660
You didn't know at all?

326
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,660
I had no clue

327
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,630
I'm really counting on you guys, I haven't gotten one in 12 and a half years

328
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,160
Next up, with the biggest drought, is Hosei

329
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,930
Should we go with the same one as Tanaka?

330
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,930
Let's

331
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,030
Huh, wait, what, if you do that...

332
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,930
Let's do it

333
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,700
Thank you very much!!

334
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,830
As they said, the same one as Tanaka

335
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,030
Okiko Melon Pan

336
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,400
The one they said they would choose

337
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,160
Will he get it right?

338
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,200
Yes, Okiko Pan

339
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,710
Did you really choose Okiko Pan for me?

340
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,600
Really?

341
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
We really did

342
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,330
I got it!!!

343
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,760
What do you mean by I got it?

344
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,600
"I got it"

345
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,600
I'm so happy!!

346
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,760
I really thought for my turn

347
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,360
That you would pick this one

348
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,730
"Yamazaki"

349
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,730
"Yamazaki"

350
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,730
"Yamazaki"

351
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,870
Ahh, so since Yamasaki Hosei and Yamazaki are similar

352
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,700
Oh, I see

353
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,700
I see

354
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,160
Yes

355
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,400
Uh, actually, I'm "Yamazaki"

356
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,660
Isn't it fine as is?

357
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,000
Huh?

358
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,700
Isn't it fine?

359
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,380
"Yamazaki"

360
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,050
But it really is "Yamazaki" and  not "Yamasaki"

361
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,930
We've always been calling you that though

362
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,930
Yama-saki

363
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,630
Since I'm from the Yamasaki's

364
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,630
Stop calling me Zakisan

365
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,900
I'm a Sakisan

366
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,140
I don't want to say Sakisan

367
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,660
How many years have we been calling him that

368
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,660
Right

369
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,800
Everyone's been calling you Zaki-san

370
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,800
Saki-san, Zaki-san you say

371
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,560
Right!!

372
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,030
Right?

373
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,160
Right

374
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,400
Wait a second, you said Okiko

375
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,230
I said Okiko

376
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,200
You're saying you picked Okiko?

377
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,970
Yes

378
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,660
That's what you said

379
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,660
We said

380
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,660
We did

381
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,660
We did

382
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,600
We did say that

383
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,000
Stop joking around!!!

384
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,660
What's wrong?

385
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,530
He's emotionally unstable,huh

386
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,530
What's wrong with you?

387
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,350
That's wrong, isn't it!?!?

388
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,030
I don't know how he'd know either way

389
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,800
Right

390
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,160
You don't even know yet

391
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,700
Why don't you try eating it?

392
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,000
It's not Okiko is it?

393
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,360
The one you chose

394
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,610
I don't know about that

395
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,000
That's right, why not try eating it

396
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,030
What's with you

397
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,100
I don't know!!

398
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,400
Which one is it?'

399
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,360
From the soft ones

400
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,300
Huh? Okiko is soft isn't it?

401
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,860
Whoa, what do I do?

402
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,010
Wait a second

403
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,960
No, no, whichever one you eat, you'll know if we're lying

404
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,660
That's right

405
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,160
Thank you so much

406
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,230
I was really questioning your service

407
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,100
Whoa, this is my big chance

408
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,900
Which one is it, though?

409
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,160
Really

410
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,260
You really picked Okiko, didn't you?

411
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,030
He's done his weird switch again

412
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,000
He's all over the place

413
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,530
Is he ok?

414
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,700
Right

415
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,800
Is he O.K.?

416
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,260
This is a big problem

417
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,700
You said it was between these two

418
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,290
But did you really choose it for me?

419
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,260
Your head's messed up, it's messed up

420
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,660
It's this again, really

421
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,400
How many personalities are in your head?

422
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,330
How many?

423
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,330
How many do you have now?

424
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,630
How many, it seems like 3

425
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,400
How many are there

426
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,100
Right

427
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,360
But really, which one is it?

428
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,660
After all, there aren't any other soft ones

429
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,630
Did you really choose Okiko for me?

430
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,600
This soft

431
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,760
Did you choose a different type?

432
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,860
This is the only one

433
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,660
But...

434
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,560
I believe people are good

435
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,360
People aren't bad

436
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,360
Right

437
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,960
Okiko!!

438
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,660
Yes

439
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,660
So it seems

440
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,660
Did I pick the wrong one?

441
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,660
Again, yet again, yet again

442
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,340
It's this again

443
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,900
How many are there?

444
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,900
It's a different one, huh

445
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,160
How many are there?

446
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,860
Hey

447
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,750
Ahh, another

448
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,330
It's another one

449
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,000
He's good, huh

450
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,230
He hasn't done this one

451
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,280
It's the most foul mouthed one

452
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,280
The foul mouthed one's here

453
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,000
I picked the wrong one, huh

454
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,900
You almost had me, huh

455
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,900
T.N. Yamazaki's using Yakuza like grammar

456
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,960
You almost had me, huh?

457
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,430
Where did this... What is this?

458
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,230
How horrible

459
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,630
You almost really had me

460
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,660
What is this?

461
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,100
This did

462
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,730
That was close

463
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,100
You said you picked Okiko, but you picked a different one

464
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,560
This one's wrong

465
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,800
I believed, but

466
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,230
But you guys have betrayed me before

467
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,430
Therefore, you picked a different one

468
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,480
You can't betray me now

469
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,430
The one I ate

470
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,400
Okiko Pan

471
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,160
Was not it

472
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,100
Wow, it was Okiko, Okiko

473
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,200
We didn't betray you, it was Okiko

474
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,860
Okiko!!

475
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,830
Even though we really picked Okiko

476
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,500
We said we were picking Okiko

477
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,060
Even though we gave you the prize money

478
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,660
You picked Okiko for me?

479
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:31,660
Yes

480
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,990
Yes, we did

481
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:32,860
Yes

482
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,430
I'm so sorry

483
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,660
You said some hurtful things

484
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,030
Did I say hurtful things?

485
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,330
You said some bad things

486
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,330
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry

487
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,330
You made some comments

488
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,040
I wasn't being serious

489
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,540
I'm really sorry

490
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,210
You said we betrayed you

491
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,200
I'll receive my punishment now

492
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm sorry, huh

493
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,880
What would he have said if we picked a different one

494
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,900
Huh, I wonder

495
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,900
Yeah

496
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,500
Don't have normal expectations!!

497
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,130
Have some more bang!! "Pan Pan"

498
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,730
For us, this is also a sad conclusion

499
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,430
This is kind of sad

500
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,600
That's true, this is pretty upsetting

501
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,200
Well, I'm really sorry

502
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,600
What should we do, he might switch

503
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,630
That's right, what did I even say?

504
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,600
Don't you remember?

505
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,260
That wasn't me, that wasn't me

506
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,200
Really?

507
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,600
I like everyone, after all

508
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,300
I, you know, have my own way of testing

509
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,230
The last challenger

510
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,200
Is Matsumoto

511
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,630
His chosen bread

512
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,160
Let's go with Okiko

513
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,430
Hamada-san?

514
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,060
Hamada-san

515
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,060
For real, Hamada-san?

516
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,800
To the contrary of what Hamada claims

517
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,000
His choice is Yamazaki Melon Pan

518
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,200
With its distinct line surface

519
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
Will he be able to find the taste?

520
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,510
We're giving you this, like Yamasaki

521
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,130
Yeah, well...

522
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,810
For real?

523
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,720
So it seems

524
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,720
So it seems

525
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,560
This, what is this, what is this, I don't understand

526
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,560
You're the last one, huh

527
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,020
I really have no clue

528
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,300
It's kind of

529
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,530
Go ahead, Matsumoto-san

530
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,530
Please

531
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,430
This psychological warfare is cheap

532
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,960
It certainly is

533
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,430
What the hell is this

534
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,400
This has nothing to do with Melon Pan anymore

535
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,860
Wait, give me a second here

536
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,330
We gave you Okiko

537
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,400
Well, I don't know, huh

538
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,830
Wait, I have no clue

539
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,260
This is soft

540
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,830
Uhhhhhhhgh

541
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,630
I have no clue

542
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,700
Why did you pick Okiko again?

543
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,620
Why are you asking me?

544
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,730
This Okiko playing around

545
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,700
Is over

546
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,060
I think I understand...

547
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,830
You have no clue, do you?

548
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,600
Well, you know

549
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,060
Ahh....

550
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,900
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

551
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,250
You were betting that by showing me a soft one like Okiko

552
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,600
That I would think that it was another soft bread that wasn't Okiko

553
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,830
That's why when Hamada was saying it was Okiko

554
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,730
That Tanaka was saying "Ha-Hamada!"

555
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,460
Therefore

556
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,860
It's a soft bread that isn't Okiko

557
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,700
Therefore, the answer is

558
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,370
Is Dai-Ichi Sei Pan's Tezuzumi Melon Pan!!

559
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,630
This one, right?

560
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,630
This is the one

561
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,630
Right?

562
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,260
Ahh, well, wait a second

563
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,030
Wow, this is difficult!

564
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,300
You're so noisy

565
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,730
I'll try one that's completely different

566
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,330
Right, like this one

567
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,530
This one's definitely different

568
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,260
What's with you recently

569
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,510
It's not but it is

570
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,800
I don't know about the taste

571
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,160
It's not but it is

572
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,560
Wait a second, is it this one?

573
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,300
Wow

574
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,900
%^&*#$!!

575
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,850
It isn't but it is

576
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,930
It is but isn't

577
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,730
Is it okay to say that this time?

578
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,730
What?

579
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,260
What?

580
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,130
No, no, no

581
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,130
The one I ate

582
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,530
Is but isn't this one

583
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,260
No, you can't do that

584
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,260
That's bad

585
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,060
But it really is and isn't

586
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,060
This is and isn't

587
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,600
If I say it isn't and throw it out

588
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,700
And I end up getting it wrong

589
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,530
I will, absolutely

590
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,100
Start to hate Melon Pan

591
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,300
What's with this

592
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,300
I won't eat it anymore too

593
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,730
What's with this

594
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,730
I might say that it might be this

595
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,130
The one I ate

596
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,530
Was not Yamazaki Melon Pan

597
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,000
It actually was!

598
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm not stupid, I'm not stupid, I'm not stupid

599
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,060
You had it

600
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,660
You had it

601
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,030
That was amazing

602
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,300
Why aren't you going to the platform

603
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,300
You guys are dirty!!

604
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,490
You guys are dirty!!

605
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,530
That was really amazing though

606
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,700
You had it

607
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,140
The tape is coming off!

608
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,500
It's fine

609
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,160
It's coming off!!

610
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,440
Stop this, stop this!

611
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,860
Your punishment...

612
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,700
Stop this

613
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,730
You have to

614
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,730
You told me the wrong one!!

615
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,200
If you were so sure, why didn't you go for it?

616
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,960
Well, well, well, well

617
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,930
No, no, no

618
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,930
No

619
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,230
Please receive your punishment

620
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,230
It's still not over

621
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,730
It's not over

622
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,730
Please receive your punishment

623
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,560
All of

624
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,930
Melon Pan's

625
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,830
Sweetness

626
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,000
Is it that tiring

627
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,900
The point slid down
