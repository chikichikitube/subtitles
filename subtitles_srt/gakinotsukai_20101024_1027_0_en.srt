1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,150
Gaki no Tsukai recording day

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,500
An usual recording day

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,170
But on this day, things will be
settled with a certain character

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,110
We just... have to go, I guess

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:12,050
Downtown

6
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:12,050
Hamada Masatoshi

7
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:12,050
Matsumoto Hitoshi

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,750
I don't think we're wrong this time

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,480
Excuse us

10
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,790
As nervousness takes over their faces, they pay a visit to that certain character

11
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,150
Their faces became unusually stiff

12
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,130
The person they'll face...

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,140
Shoji Murakami

14
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,960
Is Shoji Murakami

15
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,160
The man in charge of the "class" series

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,830
Responsible for countless rating drops

17
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,530
For Shoji, who had a bad influence on this show,

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,280
He'll make a remonstrance about how he's going to move on from the show!

19
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,030
The time has come to move on!

20
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,080
So, what's goin' on today?

21
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,140
Well...

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,740
Sorry but I...

23
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,460
Cocorico

24
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,460
Endo Shozo

25
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,460
Tanaka Naoki

26
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,460
Yamazaki Housei

27
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,380
My hips aren't really ok lately, so...

28
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,330
How are you now?

29
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,550
I'm quite ok by now, I think

30
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,520
Isn't it good?

31
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,450
Oh, thank you

32
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,420
So, err...

33
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,870
About what we originally planned

34
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,460
I mean, about the "class" series you've been doing

35
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,300
We had to skip one episode of it

36
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,880
It's fine, 'cause this was, like,
you know, I mean it's just for once

37
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,110
Sorry but I have no idea what you just said

38
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,050
What was that?

39
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,410
I mean, that was one week ago, right?
- Yeah...

40
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,410
We always made em until they were good
- Yes

41
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,180
But now you're telling me this

42
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,080
Yeah, I'm sorry we had to
cancel it because of my condition

43
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,660
You want me to start a new one now?

44
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,490
'Cause we co%$&"#@!" a class %$£!§ !!

45
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,490
I mean, if we have time

46
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,240
What?

47
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,240
What?

48
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,670
I'm all in for the class series

49
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,610
We have no idea what you're sayin', big bro

50
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,810
Has your articulation always been that bad?

51
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,200
I can't really understand
what he's saying, today

52
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,070
Yeah, I have no idea

53
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,070
So, I'm really sorry, but...

54
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,020
You see...

55
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,150
We tried something about the class series...

56
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,090
We tried something about the class series...

57
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,090
We actually had one

58
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,760
Mh?

59
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,130
I mean, your series

60
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,790
We had our own episode of your class series

61
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,760
We had our own episode of your class series

62
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,420
Without me and just you guys?

63
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,030
No, it's...

64
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,900
We had a different teacher for that

65
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,140
With another teacher?

66
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,490
Yeah...

67
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,640
On the contrary, isn't it good? I mean

68
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,600
I mean, lessons could become more
interesting with another teacher

69
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,320
That's nice, 'cause it----

70
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,910
YOU FUCKING IDIOTS !!

71
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,690
YOU FUCKING IDIOTS !!

72
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,850
You know there can be only one teacher, right?

73
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,940
I know but...

74
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,130
A teacher does one thing, another does another one,
of course two teachers can't teach the same thing!

75
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,960
Of course we're aware of that

76
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,200
But why don't you at least take a look at what we did...?

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,100
But why don't you at least take a look at what we did...?

78
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,300
Well I guess that...

79
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,340
Not looking at it would been weird

80
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,500
Things will be settled tonight!

81
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,950
The person who will take Shoji Murakami's place

82
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,950
as their new teacher is going to be...

83
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,800
Who will be the one to take over Murakami's place?

84
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:04,960

CLEAR WEATHER

89
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,580
Appointed day of the class series

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,100
Weather,

91
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,100
temperature,

92
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,100
humidity level...

93
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,100
aren't they perfect?

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,090
It's the best, it feels nice

95
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,060
How is this even possible?

96
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,270
(the times with Shoji)

97
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,270
It was always cold as heck and nothing more

98
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,910
There were times when it rained, even thunders sometimes

99
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,010
There were times when it rained, even thunders sometimes

100
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,340
Look at this sign, it's so stylish!

101
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,170
It surely is!

102
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,650
note: on the sign: "the ninja class is here"

103
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,850
I'm getting excited for real!

104
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,080
Yeah you're right

105
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,690
Makes me really wanna pay the monthly fee

106
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,810
It's making us wanting to do this

107
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,980
Now we just have to wait for our teacher
- Yes

108
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,090
Ciao

109
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,090
Ciao!

110
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,730
So cool!!

111
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,700
So friggin' cool!

112
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,100
He's even wearing boots!

113
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,400
Looks like I made it in time

114
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
How do you like my chest hairs?

115
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,180
Girolamo Panzetta

116
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,180
The pioneer of wild-look

117
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,300
Pioneer of fashion

118
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,610
Girolamo the dandy will be their teacher!

119
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,180
So today, we're here...

120
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,960
We're here to have ourselves a ninja class

121
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,400
Thank you!

122
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,100
Thanks!

123
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,250
You know, there was another one
before me, but wasn't that popular...

124
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,660
pin pon pan pon

125
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,840
Isn't he italian?!
- Yes...................

126
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,030
I think that

127
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,030
We're first of all supposed to have fun here

128
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,030
After all we italians are all friendly

129
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
In Italy, the word for "friend" is "amico"

130
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,300
In Italy, the word for "friend" is "amico"

131
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,860
Amigo?   - Amigo...

132
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,310
It's amiCo!

133
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,360
Amico!

134
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,370
Say it again

135
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,440
Amico!

136
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,080
Yeah! I'll teach you lots of things today

137
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,210
His sunglasses are pretty cool, aren't they?

138
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,470
Are you ready? Shall we start?

139
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,450
Let's do this!

140
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,450
Yeah!!

141
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:46,460
Aim to be a wild-looking cool ninja

142
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:46,460
Training 1

143
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,960
The training will begin

144
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,210
By remodeling the old-fashioned ninjas

145
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,520
Sudden change: style change training!

146
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,550
Yeah!!

147
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,630
Change

148
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,630
Style

149
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,630
Sudden Change!

150
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,630
Training

151
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,590
What the f-?

152
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't you think the image of
ninjas is outdated by now?

153
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,960
I mean, just black

154
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,930
You're right

155
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,930
We'll try to make it more fashionable

156
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:12,520
Training: use the fashionable items and make your own wild-looking cool ninja

157
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,970
More fashionable...

158
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,970
You can see lots of items here

159
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,900
This is amazing!

160
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,360
So many fashionable items!

161
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Just pick some of them

162
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,520
And make it cooler

163
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,080
We'll start from Hamada

164
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,180
But ninjas aren't supposed
to be spotted by the enemy

165
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,510
Oh! Hamada    - Hamada-san!

166
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,550
Are we choosing them ourselves?

167
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,590
Next up is Abe-san

168
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,190
Next up is Abe-san

169
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm Endo by the way

170
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,620
Oh, sorry

171
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,500
It's ok

172
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,790
Amico, right? Amico!

173
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,090
That's amico

174
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,030
That's a weird mistake

175
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,270
ENDO'S CHALLENGE

176
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,760
Endo will be the first challenger

177
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,880
Tokyo Ninja Collection!

178
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,750
Yaaaaay!

179
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,270
So cool!

180
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,120
Amico!

181
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,710
Looking good, Endo!

182
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,110
Pretty cool, right?

183
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,910
As expected from Louis Vuitton sunglasses

184
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,460
Louis Vuitton Sunglasses

185
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,860
Thank you!

186
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,320
Maybe it's a bit too hot today for this

187
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,130
Even this scarf color is amazing

188
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,900
This is so popular

189
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,970
Silk Scarf

190
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,970
This is cool but

191
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,470
It's probably lacking something to be cooler

192
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,800
I don't know much about it

193
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,540
He does look incomplete

194
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,700
A black diamond

195
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,350
Black Diamond Ring

196
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,470
Woah, this raises the bar!

197
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,840
The hell is this!?

198
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,420
It will stand out when throwing shurikens

199
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,360
More than for battle, this is for being popular with girls

200
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,860
I'm giving them all to you

201
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,990
For real?!
- It's ok, leave it to me

202
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,760
Amico!!

203
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,870
Endo receives a (around) 700'000 yen worth set of items!

204
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:43,780
Hamada too changes into a wild-looking cool ninja

205
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,510
Rayban Sunglasses

206
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,670
The hell is this shit?!

207
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,240
This will make you look badass

208
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,650
Bottega Veneta Gloves

209
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,050
He's not gonna wear them

210
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,210
How is he supposed
to wield that?!

211
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,590
With sunglasses and gloves his style got upgraded

212
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,010
Amico!

213
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,110
Pretty good, huh?

214
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,810
What the fuck!!

215
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,960
These are all presents

216
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,830
Hamada receives a (around) 150'000 yen worth set of items!

217
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,830
THE TEACHER'S EXAMPLE

218
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,620
Lastly, here's the teacher's example

219
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,820
Is that a ninja?

220
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,280
Leather Coat & Belt by

221
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,800
This is just bad

222
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,350
Amico!!

223
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,350
I don't get the
meaning of this!!

224
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,510
As expected by our teacher!

225
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,910
Leave it to me

226
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,280
Amazing!
- Fashionable!

227
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,920
After the ninja are done with their job they go have fun, right?

228
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,990
Listen to me, what's our hobby?

229
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,790
Our hobby?

230
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,530
It's to make good use of women

231
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,990
The hell is he
talkin' about?!

232
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,990
Is he an idiot?!

233
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,320
Amicoooo~

234
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,360
He's cool, right?
- He's amazing

235
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,570
In a way, yeah...

236
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,940
His point is that ninjas are outdated by now

237
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,540
His point is that ninjas are outdated by now

238
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,080
But that's not the issue

239
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,910
Does he even know what "ninja" means?

240
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,650
Besides

241
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,910
Why are you guys like that?!

242
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,550
Acting as if your boss threw a dining party

243
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,190
And he's like "I'll pay your taxi home"

244
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,190
And you're like "Wow, thanks boss!!"

245
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,190
Are you idiots?

246
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,720
To be honest...

247
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,530
Aren't there plenty of dark affairs

248
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,530
Involving you directly, Shoji big bro? Let's talk about those

249
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,530
Like, a lot of stuff

250
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,900
I think he thought the same

251
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,900
As he was talking about it before

252
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,630
Wait a sec

253
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,660
That has nothing to do with the class!

254
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,000
That's true

255
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm talking about this class

256
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,010
You're right

257
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,250
Also

258
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,750
My daughter is attending college now, it'd be awful

259
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,150
My daughter is attending college now, it'd be awful

260
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,420
I see that

261
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,760
If you start talking about that thing,

262
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,760
I think this episode would just end right here

263
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,260
Back on our topic...

264
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,330
Our staff decided to do something about this situation...

265
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,760
Our staff decided to do something about this situation...

266
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,360
And so

267
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,900
And did a sort of street interview

268
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,690
That's right

269
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,100
You know, about the teacher from before (Girolamo)

270
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,100
And you, Shoji-sensei

271
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,770
A sort of comparison

272
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,840
Of course I'm better than him, I mean...

273
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,710
Is it a survey about who's the funniest, right?

274
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,400
To be honest, I don't really know it myself

275
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,080
Shall we take a look?

276
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,810
Gaki No Tsukai Image Survey

277
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,810
Who would you rather sleep with?

278
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,710
Girolamo or Shoji Murakami...

279
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,550
Girolamo Panzetta

280
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,550
Shoji Murakami

281
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,410
Who would you rather sleep with?

282
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:23,200
Gaki no Tsukai image survey

283
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:23,200
Girolamo

284
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:23,200
Girolamo vs Murakami:
Who will you choose?

285
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:23,200
Murakami

286
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,260
Girolamo

287
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,900
'cause he looks like a man who knows how to treat a woman

288
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,000
Girolamo

289
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,200
Isn't he a "ladies first" type of guy?

290
00:09:23,540 --> 00:10:16,350
Gaki no Tsukai image survey

291
00:09:23,540 --> 00:10:16,350
Girolamo

292
00:09:23,540 --> 00:10:16,350
Girolamo vs Murakami:
Who will you choose?

293
00:09:23,540 --> 00:10:16,350
Murakami

294
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,340
Of course

295
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,340
I'd pick Girolamo

296
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,270
Is there a reason for why

297
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,280
(staff)

298
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,280
You didn't choose Murakami?

299
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,930
He kinda...

300
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,820
It'd be creepy if he would touch me...

301
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,980
Girolamo

302
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,650
I guess

303
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,890
I'd go for Girolamo

304
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,630
Murakami

305
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,630
.

306
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,630
George

307
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,370
(staff)

308
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,370
Is there a reason why?

309
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,500
Let's see...

310
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,670
What does this person do?

311
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Girolamo

312
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,540
Girolamo Panzetta

313
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,150
No way I'm choosing him (Murakami)

314
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,170
(staff) Why is that?

315
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,350
No way! I don't like him

316
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,780
No way! I don't like him

317
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,620
Girolamo

318
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,350
Girolamo is ok

319
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,930
Girolamo Panzetta

320
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,930
What kind of survey was that?

321
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
That was something the staff always liked to do, so...

322
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,970
That was something the staff always liked to do, so...

323
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,370
Wait a sec, regardless of that

324
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,910
This is

325
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,880
The "class" series, you know

326
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,880
You're right

327
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,420
I got mad at 'em myself too

328
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,420
And told them like "this is unrelated to it"

329
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,350
"Who would you rather sleep with" - geez!

330
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,260
Also, there was one of them...

331
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,260
what the hell?

332
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:58,300
I mean, what's the deal

333
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,300
With that old lady?

334
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,220
She wants you     - You were chosen

335
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,300
They found her on the street, we don't know

336
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:06,710
Isn't it strange it was not a survey about something like

337
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,710
"who would be funnier in a ninja class episode?"

338
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,710
The staff probably got it wrong

339
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,330
A mistake

340
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,760
Yes. Hey, you guys.

341
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,900
What was that?
- That's no good!

342
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,670
Must be that
- It's our staff

343
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,250
Dontcha make this mistake again!

344
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,040
Got it!?

345
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,110
Don't be mad

346
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,520
Also, that was all about...

347
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,690
This whole "wild-looking dude" thing but

348
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,860
But I don't have any qualities like that

349
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,690
Eat and run away without paying or such

350
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,690
Even though back then I used to

351
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,960
But such things are bad!

352
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,960
They're not worth praising!

353
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,850
It's not our fault
you were like this!

354
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,940
Alright, whatever

355
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,590
Let's get over this
- Yes

356
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,110
Is there still some recording left?

357
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,260
Yeah it goes on

358
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,500
Yeah, there is

359
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,800
It's not so long, so, please...

360
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,600
Wiggling Kunoichi Twister Training!

361
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,600
note: kunoichi = female ninja

362
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:53,920
Kunoichi

363
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:53,920
NING

364
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:53,920
TRAI

365
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:53,920
Twister

366
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:53,920
Wiggling

367
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,490
So, don't you agree balance is important for a ninja?

368
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,490
Oh yes

369
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,060
But...

370
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,890
Do you like surfing?

371
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,630
I never did it before      - You did not?

372
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,260
Oh don't worry about it, ninjas don't do surf

373
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,500
It was just an italian joke

374
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,100
Amico!!

375
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,960
I've prepared Twister for you

376
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:19,210
Training: make good use of the Twister game to increase your balancing skills

377
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,370
But it's no fun if only dudes are playing

378
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,950
Here are some cuties!

379
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,350
Come, please

380
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,390
They're beautiful, right?

381
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,350
Kunoichi?

382
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:37,600
Their partners for Twister

383
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:37,600
Will be the sexy "Kunoichis from the World"

384
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,610
Their helpers for this training

385
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,990
Will be the sexy "Kunoichis from the World"!

386
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,790
"Kunoichis from the World?!"

387
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,600
MATSUMOTO'S CHALLENGE

388
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,220
Our first challenger will be Matsumoto

389
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,400
Ok, let's start!!
- Let's go

390
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,570
Roulette: Start!

391
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,570
Countin' on ya, Abe-chan

392
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,410
Ok, both of you

393
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,720
Right foot on

394
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,720
red

395
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,720
green

396
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,720
yellow

397
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,720
on the board, please

398
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,720
or blue spots

399
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,340
Right foot, huh      - What?

400
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,490
Abe-chan?

401
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,820
I think I didn't understand the rules

402
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,020
How can you not?!

403
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,850
I'm sorry
- Right foot yellow, right?

404
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,320
He can only
understand baseball

405
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,280
Here?     - Anywhere is fine

406
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
As long as it is yellow

407
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,950
Ok, moving on!

408
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,750
Go, Abe-chan

409
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,820
Right hand on blue!

410
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,330
Right hand blue
- Right hand blue?

411
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,990
You should aim to the closer one

412
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,330
Nice

413
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,130
Sorry for this

414
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,300
You've found a nice spot!

415
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,050
The training's toughness increases...

416
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,290
The balance of their bodies is steadily crumbling down...

417
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,790
And finally, a conclusion on the 8th round

418
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,390
Left foot red

419
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,160
Red

420
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,830
Alright, you did it!

421
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,380
MATSUMOTO: VICTORY

422
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,700
What the-?

423
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,970
This was good

424
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,700
Amico!

425
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:08,550
Following up, Yamazaki performs several tricky balancing techniques

426
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,820
Right foot yellow

427
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,750
YAMAZAKI: VICTORY

428
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,770
What the...

429
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,670
This is the best, isn't it?

430
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,000
It is

431
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,570
Let's move to the next one

432
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,860
Was it?

433
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,810
Yaaa~y!!

434
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,940
So, that was a balance training

435
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,650
So, that was a balance training

436
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,470
Right, balance

437
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,250
A balance training is fine
- Yes

438
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,250
But you didn't even know the rules

439
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,580
I mean, Twister's
- Well that...

440
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,020
Was my first...
- Even those who did it

441
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,990
Balance my ass, you didn't have any

442
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,330
All you showed me was bad balance

443
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,530
We're sorry

444
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,870
It was because of the kunoichi...

445
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,870
Do they have anything to do with this?

446
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,740
Well, they were the Kunoichi from the World, so...

447
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,740
He said it clearly

448
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:08,650
I didn't really get that thing about surfing

449
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,650
You know, that joke

450
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,650
Girolamo told us...

451
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,340
Where was the joke?

452
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,120
He's such an unfunny old dude!!

453
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,850
I'm 100% sure you would
have made fun of me if I said that

454
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,300
And yet you were all like "yay yay"

455
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,400
Sayin' "amico" and shit

456
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,890
The hell is wrong with you?

457
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,560
So, you know...

458
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,330
Our staff did something for this episode

459
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,270
Our staff did something for this episode

460
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,740
So it did another street interview, a survey

461
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,480
Or something like that, I don't know I haven't watched it

462
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,000
Of course not about which of you
to have sex with or nonsense like that

463
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,800
Not like that

464
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,110
I think it's different this time

465
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,640
So, shall we...?

466
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,690
Gaki no Tsukai image survey

467
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,690
Tell us your impression on this person

468
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,910
"Tell us your impression about this person"

469
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,190
Girolamo Panzetta

470
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,420
Let's start with Girolamo Panzetta

471
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,000
He's really cool and

472
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,230
He looks like he's really

473
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,230
good at dealing with women, he looks skilled

474
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:08,570
He seems a honest person

475
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,570
Like the type of person who never lies, kinda

476
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,010
I've seen him before on a cooking show

477
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,680
And he's pretty good at cooking, you know

478
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,480
It made me think how good it would be to have an husband like him

479
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,290
He really gives out this grown-adult image

480
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:28,560
I think that when I'll grow up I want

481
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,560
To become a refined man just like him

482
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,060
Shoji Murakami

483
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,750
What about Shoji Murakami's image?

484
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,240
I have no idea who this person is

485
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,540
I guess his image...

486
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,540
Is in the category of

487
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,540
"people I don't like or dislike"

488
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,210
He doesn't seem to be a knowledgeable guy

489
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,910
He doesn't seem to be a knowledgeable guy

490
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,650
Whenever I see this guy on tv, I always change channel

491
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,490
Whenever I see this guy on tv, I always change channel

492
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,720
He's the guy who does "doooing!"

493
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,320
He's the guy who does "doooing!"

494
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,320
note: a gag by Murakami

495
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,660
(staff)

496
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,660
Do you get any other image from him?

497
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,800
Mmhh...

498
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,630
"Doooing!"

499
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,440
I have no idea what this guy does because I've

500
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,440
never seen him before

501
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,810
His face kinda...

502
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,810
I've never seen him before, so I have no idea

503
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,880
(staff)

504
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,880
You really don't know him?

505
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,840
No, I don't

506
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,580
I think he focus his comedy on unfunny stuff

507
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,520
To be honest, I don't like him nor hate him

508
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,990
To be honest, I don't like him nor hate him

509
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,720
It's more of a "I don't care" for me

510
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,030
Bring those people here

511
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,530
What's with this "image" thing?

512
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,360
That's right, we're not dealing with this

513
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
- "Doooing"

514
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
- "I change channel"

515
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
- "I want to be like him"

516
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
- "Never seen him before"

517
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
- "Who cares"

518
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
- Not knowledgeable

519
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
- fashionable

520
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
- good at cooking

521
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
- honest

522
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
- kind to women

523
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
Girolamo Panzetta

524
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,170
Murakami Shoji

525
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,860
What's that?

526
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,760
Hey, what's this?!

527
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,810
This is new

528
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,810
Bad staff

529
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,350
I wonder if this stuff is going to be broadcasted on tv

530
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,520
I wonder if this stuff is going to be broadcasted on tv

531
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,190
Maybe it won't air, who cares, but there were

532
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,190
People sayin' "I don't care" talking about me

533
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,930
I mean, they even said "I never saw him before"

534
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,730
I think we're now about to look at the last VTR

535
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,730
for today's episode

536
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,640
Ninja class:

537
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,640
final act

538
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,420
Yes, it's our last one

539
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,390
Take a look, please

540
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,490
"Buono buono" training!

541
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,830
Yeeeeah!

542
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:29,280
BUONO BUONO TRAINING

543
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:29,280
BUONO BUONO TRAINING

544
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,770
Buono buono!

545
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,670
Buono?

546
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,200
Buono, it means "good"

547
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,800
Buono

548
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,650
And so

549
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,490
The image of a ninja

550
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,490
Is something really though, isn't it?

551
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,490
I mean, you have to endure even your hunger

552
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,490
Right

553
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,680
Let's get rid of this image

554
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:43,700
Training: satisfy your hunger by eating something delicious

555
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,650
Let's bring you something tasty, here

556
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,050
Today for all of you guys

557
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:41,500
Yes?

558
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,180
I've brought you a delicious pizza

559
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,020
Really?

560
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,630
But first, a quiz

561
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,390
What type of pizza is inside?

562
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,500
Girolamo's Quiz

563
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,500
Q. Try to guess which type of pizza is inside the tray

564
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,960
Woah... I really have no idea

565
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,870
Tanaka, give it a try

566
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,270
Maybe anchovies...

567
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,270
Anchovies

568
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,270
are stinky, aren't they?

569
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,080
If you eat them, then you can't kiss anyone, right?

570
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,710
Must be something easier

571
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,080
It's something lighter

572
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,110
How was that popular one called?

573
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,250
Margheri...?

574
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,250
Margherita!!

575
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,710
Urrà!!

576
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,710
note: italian for "hooray"

577
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,150
You got it in one guess!

578
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,150
I'm impressed

579
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:09,420
CORRECT ANSWER

580
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,610

CORRECT ANSWER

593
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,280
This has nothing
to do with ninjas

594
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,320
I'm impressed, as expected from ninjas!

595
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
It looks delicious

596
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,030
Feel free to dig in!

597
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,230
Can we eat it?!

598
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,440
Of course, of course

599
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,710
That's just... eating

600
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,180
We never were offered anything to eat before, I mean...

601
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,670
Tasty, right?

602
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,180
In our previous classes

603
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,180
Not even once

604
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,180
Those were just so shitty

605
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,070
So good!

606
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,150
Buo~no~!!

607
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,150
You know, I had a friend come from Italy to make this

608
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,930
You can tell, it's nothing like our
delivery pizza, this is buono!!

609
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:54,170
The "Kunoichis" join them for the training's gran finale

610
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,820
Remember the cuties from before?

611
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,820
Let's make em join our group!

612
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,090
Bambina!! (baby)

613
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,060
Bambina~

614
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,490
The hell is this?!

615
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,570
This is too much, I mean

616
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,200
Our previous teacher was pure shit!!

617
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,040
Our previous teacher was pure shit!!

618
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,040
Yeah I think so too

619
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,190
This is really good!

620
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,470
We never got to see this
type of ninja before, right?

621
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,500
Eat, eat, that's passion

622
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,820
So, how was it today? Did you have fun?

623
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,720
We had fun!

624
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,720
It was the best!

625
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,720
I had fun too, let's do this again one day

626
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,890
Yeah, let's do this again

627
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,450
Thank you guys!

628
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,420
Our previous teacher is a turd, isn't him?

629
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,690
Our previous teacher is a turd, isn't him?

630
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,920
Amico~!

631
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,830
Sorry for my late introduction,

632
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,830
my name is turd

633
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,330
The hell is that supposed to be, you morons?!

634
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,660
We all said that...

635
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,730
You think you can call
me that because of this?

636
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,740
Why should ninjas do that?

637
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,110
I mean havin' a banquet for no absolute reason?!

638
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,810
That's not the way you praise a ninja

639
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,510
You'll just spoil him this way

640
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,610
Ok, you could have been
enjoying the moment, I see that

641
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,810
But calling me "shitty teacher" or "turd"...

642
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,340
Yes...

643
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,590
Let it down

644
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,590
Let that panel down

645
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,330
So...

646
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,040
What do you think about it?

647
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,870
I think this class had a different feeling from the others

648
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,870
I think this class had a different feeling from the others

649
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,980
It felt like something new

650
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,800
See, I know by seeing you that you had fun

651
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,850
Cause you were part of it

652
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,520
So you had fun and everything, but what about

653
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,020
Our audience made of

654
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,020
big fans of my class series?

655
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,920
I mean, even the big ones from Lumine or Gap

656
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,280
They'd be like "Where's the class series?!
I'm about to go crazy!"

657
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,220
Don't laugh at me, it's true

658
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,790
They'd be like "What the hell is going on?!"

659
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,760
They would be like that?

660
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,960
It's true, I have to say them "just wait"

661
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,270
"It's cause Macchan is like that, he told me"

662
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,610
You know, that thing...

663
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,250
'Cause your crotch got weird lately

664
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,710
So I'm like "his crotch got weird, you have to wait"

665
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,510
Is that so? I see

666
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,510
Leaving that aside

667
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,720
Why did you take part on such thing, I mean

668
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,960
My intention was to train you, not to loiter around

669
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,690
Yes...

670
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,370
That was total crap

671
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,400
Anyway, I still think that

672
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,400
You took good care of us in all the previous classes, big bro

673
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,040
I mean, we can't just deny that

674
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,040
So, in order, starting from Cocorico, we...

675
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,030
Some presents...

676
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,040
You took care of us all the time

677
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,240
So I want you give you this

678
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,940
'Cause Tanaka loves animals

679
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,850
note: "children picture book: bizarre & surprising animals"

680
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,740
He really loves em

681
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,880
It's extensive

682
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,180
What's going on..?

683
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,090
Next up, Endo
- Yes

684
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,050
Those are coupons for gyoza

685
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,750
We got them for a Gaki shoot

686
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,500
We got quite a lot of em

687
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,520
That's a lot
- It is

688
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,760
You like em
- I do

689
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,170
You're not giving all of them?

690
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,020
Yes, those are enough

691
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:57,840
The members give their farewell gifts according to their tastes

692
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,070
Each of them gives him gifts full of memories

693
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,770
It's an headcover

694
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,540
That's nice

695
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,280
These are popular

696
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,640
I'm giving you this ticket case

697
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
You can use it for passes

698
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,000
Useful

699
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,360
Passes or Suica

700
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,990
Thank you for everything

701
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,460
Thanks for this long time

702
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,960
Are you idiots!?

703
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,590
Let's go

704
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,490
Hey!

705
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,490
Wait a second

706
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,740
Hey

707
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,330
Thanks for everything

708
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,960
"Thanks for everything" my ass!

709
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,460
Wait!

710
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,370
What was that?

711
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,540
Endo!!

722
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,410
quitting this yet!

723
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,070
That was very Yama-chan of him

724
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,470
You're right

725
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,440
Who is him, Yamazaki?

726
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,110
I thought so too
