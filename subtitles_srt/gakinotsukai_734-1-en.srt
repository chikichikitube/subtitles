1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,550
2nd time, Gaki no Tsukai Ya Arahende, Mixed rice

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,220
It's our 2nd time Matsumoto

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,280
Yama-san singing has crossed Japan rule

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,050
I understand how it feels

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,730
The song is stuck in my head and it's killing me

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,310
As we are talking I've forgot about it

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,770
Today is Mixed rice

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,010
Previous episode where we did Chawanmushi, Matsumoto's Montblanc got 10

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,480
I am grateful for that

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,670
I wanted to be success one more time, in this mix rice

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,000
There are more chances

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I think I can do it

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,350
There is a lot of divergence because they are raw materials

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,220
~There are ways to look at you~

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,010
You remember it

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,140
First is Tanaka, what is his mix rice?

17
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,490
First is

18
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,020
Is this

19
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,990
Lobster?

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,110
Lobster will give seafood flavor

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,120
This one make a good Miso soup

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,410
Lobster rice will be good

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,410
Absolutely tasty

24
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,700
Whote lobster

25
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,440
Whote?

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,770
It's Whole

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,770
Every time you do this

28
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,600
You didn't say it entirely

29
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,030
Whote or whole

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,300
This one is perfect size, see

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,480
The whisker is jutting out?

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,620
There are 2

33
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,660
Twin

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,290
We will trim it

35
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,200
Water

36
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,980
He is taking a bath

37
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,950
This it is

38
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,510
What the heck is this

39
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,990
Champagne and high class grape

40
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,960
It's like Beer + green bean episode 2

41
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,020
That's right

42
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,360
Why are you opening it like that

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,970
Heipo caught it

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,340
As expected

45
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,680
Heipo caught it

46
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,450
He is catching with his life on the line

47
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,370
The alcohol of the champagne will be cook away just like before

48
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,540
What kind of Mix rice he is making?

49
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,360
It's kelp flakes, I see

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,220
The entire thing

51
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,100
I've tried it many time, it's delicious

52
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,650
Stink

53
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,800
I am putting soy sauce

54
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,120
It will taste like soy sauce rice

55
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,450
It compliment rice

56
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,300
This is ..

57
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,830
This

58
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,670
This might be delicious

59
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,030
Next dish

60
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,680
Next is this

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,560
Childhood memory

62
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,460
I don't know if it's still available, Choco stick, a snack

63
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,220
You decided to stop your specialty?

64
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,450
Is it frisk?

65
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,820
I've done my research, in this episode it's entirely bad

66
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,960
It is bad

67
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,150
It's like stop

68
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,970
Will changing the moisture change the outcome?

69
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,970
Next is Yamazaki, what will he put in?

70
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,780
Genius IT boy

71
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,370
Genius IT boy bringing you this

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,190
Nandenkanden

73
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,050
This is absolutely delicious

74
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,170
They are good to begin with

75
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,220
Everyone ate this before

76
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,710
Ain't it look delicious?

77
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,910
You tried before right? I really wish the president will be here

78
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,910
I really like the president

79
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,030
Perverted

80
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,710
Are you comedian?

81
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,770
There is not much comedian like that

82
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,460
I am getting a watch

83
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,830
And it will be Rolex

84
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,210
I want to eat this

85
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,100
Yamazaki next dish is Macademia nuts + milk , a snack kind mix rice

86
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,890
Next is Hamada turn

87
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,880
First is easy to make and normal Curry rice

88
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,010
Next is this

89
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,390
What is this?

90
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,170
Gross

91
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,910
What the hell

92
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,040
What the.. this is bad

93
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,180
This is sort of gross

94
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,180
*Grated yam with tuna

95
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,180
Yamakake*

96
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,750
Amazing

97
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,010
No need for that

98
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,490
This is wrong

99
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,850
It must be included

100
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,160
Appearance is important

101
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,490
Come on

102
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,070
The energy is kinda

103
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,030
Rough

104
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,320
At this point, i will add soy sauce

105
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,440
This guy have no sense of volume

106
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,500
But every time you always say delicious

107
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,470
Last is Matsumoto, what is his mix rice?

108
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,940
Well, this is nothing

109
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,940
Duel between ingredient

110
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,940
*Exquisite ham from Aomori

111
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,940
Nama Ham

112
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,030
The texture is amazing

113
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,020
Loin

114
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,300
Running

115
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,190
Keep on running, that is why

116
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,610
Make haste

117
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,610
The producer is laughing

118
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
It's frontier splits

119
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,580
It's splits?

120
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,310
Why splits in a japanese dish

121
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,520
Goes in daze

122
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,760
The taste is strong for the Nama ham

123
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,480
I have not seen this

124
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,790
I heard someone saying, this is the first time ever

125
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,600
Scary!!

126
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,900
Scary!!!!!

127
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,910
What is this

128
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,660
Its bear paw

129
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,660
This should not be allowed

130
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,720
It's scary right? The bear's paw

131
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,550
It's big

132
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,430
It's really big

133
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,610
It's big

134
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,850
Why does it make me want to touch it

135
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,420
Heavy

136
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,760
It's the first time

137
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,280
It really is bear's paw

138
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,490
The way to eat is first shaving it,

139
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,240
You can't even chew this

140
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,220
Maybe it will hold the rice in the paw

141
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,200
I am putting it

142
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,300
Doesn't fit

143
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,950
The entire thing

144
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,880
It fits way too perfectly

145
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,490
Put in some water

146
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,090
Oh, it's wine

147
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:25,530
Why?

148
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:25,950
Wine?

149
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,950
There is smell?

150
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,950
Ah, the smell

151
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,440
This is expensive?

152
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,440
How much?

153
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,750
70000 yen

154
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,750
Please

155
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,850
Expensive ingredient

156
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,180
70000 yen just for paw

157
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,920
*Act of bargaining

158
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,920
That 70000 yen is the result of this*

159
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,920
Put your hand like this

160
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,370
After preparing comes the tasting part

161
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,350
First is Tanaka's

162
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,490
It's different

163
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,430
It has changed

164
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,970
IT changed

165
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,960
Tanaka's lobster rice, how about the taste

166
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,140
It has strong flavor

167
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,470
It's lobster rice

168
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,220
I am opening it

169
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,460
It looks good

170
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,750
Nothing wrong

171
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,020
You don't know anything before eating it

172
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
In this case, I will take out the meat

173
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,360
This one does take some time

174
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,080
Looking forward to it

175
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,620
If you put in some soy sauce, it will taste better

176
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,510
With nothing more than a lobster, it will taste bland

177
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,150
Is that so?

178
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,060
Some salt is good

179
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,720
Nice comment

180
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,470
Genius IT boy

181
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,470
Genius IT man

182
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,470
You just stuttered

183
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,470
Gunius?

184
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,970
With miso it will be good

185
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,990
It really is

186
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,570
This one, seriously

187
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,580
Done

188
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,990
This is kinda hard to get

189
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,120
Seriously?

190
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,900
Let's eat

191
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,400
It's not that good

192
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,270
Why?

193
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,130
Tasteless

194
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,690
Why tasteless

195
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,970
Why?

196
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,300
Why like this

197
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,710
I even put lobster

198
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,730
It's like you taste it with the back of your tongue

199
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,750
What do you rate this?

200
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,670
This is bad

201
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,670
2 or 3

202
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,760
Yeah, 2

203
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,620
It is

204
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,240
2?

205
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,000
It's 2

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,940
It's 2?

207
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,500
It's just rice

208
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:43,900
If this is what family eat for once a year, nobody will attend it

209
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,900
Reason is this

210
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,580
For betraying everyone's expectation, 2 point

211
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,580
2nd dish, Champagne and High class grape how will it taste

212
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,580
I think it will look bad at first

213
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,040
It doesn't change much

214
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,130
The beer is cooked completely

215
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,130
It's a strong sour smell

216
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,440
It has such a strong sourness smell

217
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,330
Tanaka, this is bad

218
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,080
It looks like red bean mixed rice though

219
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,910
It really is, without some ingredient though

220
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,770
It has some good feeling to it

221
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,800
Everyone

222
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,170
Let's eat

223
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,470
Not good

224
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,260
I am sorry, but this is not good

225
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,880
BAD

226
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,260
Not good

227
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,680
How many point?

228
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,460
This one

229
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,520
It is still edible

230
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,760
8

231
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,740
8?

232
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,760
Are you an idiot?

233
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,000
Just by the look of it the taste is not good at all

234
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,370
*Skull and crossbone, dangerous

235
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,370
It's Dokuro*

236
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,510
This is not good

237
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,360
Dokuro

238
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,410
Champagne and high class grape as expected, dokuro

239
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,370
Next is Endo's dish kelp flakes rice

240
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,640
Opening now, open!

241
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,460
What the heck is this? What is this?

242
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,020
This is kind of nice feeling

243
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,960
IT is this

244
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,550
It looks good

245
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,010
Ain't it good?

246
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,000
This is good

247
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,900
I have expectation for this

248
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,490
Let's eat

249
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,710
Please, i beg you

250
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,240
It's not bad

251
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,100
I don't hate this

252
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,840
Delicious

253
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,410
Not bad at all

254
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,340
This is delicious

255
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,180
Tasty

256
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,450
This texture

257
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,050
Hamada, how is it?

258
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,310
I'm not really,.. it's delicious

259
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,550
This is delicious

260
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,290
Yes

261
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,360
It's not bad, but it does not reach the surprising delicious level

262
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,060
I personally think 5

263
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,900
Is it 5?

264
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,090
No,no,no

265
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,030
3?

266
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,260
Not dokuro

267
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,410
The taste is barely there

268
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,670
It is barely 3

269
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,600
Barely 3?

270
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,430
3 then

271
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,620
At worst 4 please

272
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,600
It's 3

273
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,640
It is 3

274
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
I am feeling pretty bad now

275
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,700
Based on Hamada feeling, kelp flakes rice 3 point

276
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,050
Next is Chocolate bat rice, how will it taste?

277
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,540
Can you score a homerun?

278
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,210
Let's do this, Open!

279
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,820
Amazing, what the heck is this?

280
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,660
Wait, what is this?

281
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,750
Interesting

282
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,960
Although, it doesn't look that bad at all

283
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,750
It's true

284
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,130
This is irritating

285
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,040
It looks like sausage though

286
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,240
At first glance right?

287
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,550
Let's eat

288
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,000
Why like this?

289
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,690
Bad

290
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,920
It is really bad

291
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,310
I hate this

292
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:49,030
I am feeling a dangerous vibes coming from you guys

293
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,030
This is not good

294
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,580
This makes me feel sick

295
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,000
The looks and the taste makes people irritated, chocolate bat rice 1 point

296
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,440
Next is Yamazaki's ready-made dish, Nandenkanden rice

297
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,780
Cocorico bring something bad

298
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,010
That's true

299
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,010
Nandenkanden is HERE

300
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,490
Looks good

301
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,230
No good, this will be very good

302
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,380
This smells good, smell of nandenkanden

303
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,630
I've done it

304
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,930
You did it

305
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,020
I've finally made it

306
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,630
Nandenkanden president

307
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,630
The president will be happy

308
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,190
Don't speak of your love here

309
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,990
He can buy rolex now

310
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,250
How good

311
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,410
For my birthday

312
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,900
You can also buy Driver

313
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,610
How i wish for it

314
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,340
Christmas is close too

315
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,040
Seriously?

316
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,560
Let's eat

317
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,150
It's not that delicious at all

318
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,670
Why is it?

319
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,300
Exactly why?

320
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,370
It's a bit spicy

321
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:08,770
Spicy

322
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,070
This is very spicy

323
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,640
It's the spiciness of the pickle

324
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,470
I kinda like this though a lot of different texture in here

325
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,670
At first bite

326
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,700
Not that bad

327
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,460
The spiciness makes you want more

328
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,070
Even though I am full, i still want more

329
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:33,900
At first bite I think it's not good, but after that I want more

330
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,870
I hate the pickle because of the spiciness but I like the taste of the rice

331
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,740
Kinda like that though

332
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,740
Because of that I would like a second serving

333
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,380
Edible but didn't bring the taste 100%, 5 point

334
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,720
Next is Macademia nuts rice, how is the taste?

335
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,120
What the heck is this

336
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,750
I've done it

337
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,750
You didn't succeed at all

338
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,680
Let's eat

339
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,500
What kind of flavor is the macademia nuts

340
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,710
Sweet

341
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,880
Truly sweet

342
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,500
Sweet~~

343
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,830
This will bring a bad feeling

344
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,470
Seriously what point does this deserve

345
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,590
Seriously i am thinking 1.5

346
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,470
1.5

347
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,850
I know it does not deserve 2 so the point for this is 1.5!

348
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,380
Sakai Masaaki

349
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,260
1.5

350
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,850
The overly sweet macademia nuts rice, 1.5 point

351
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,900
Next is Hamada with his easy-made curry rice, however

352
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,950
My first dish, Curry rice

353
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,840
At first look it looks bad

354
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,440
I will do this, mix this up

355
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,650
It smells nice

356
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,750
The smell of regular curry

357
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,710
Let's eat

358
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,200
I think I've mixed it up properly

359
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,670
It's not bad

360
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,670
This is not bad at all

361
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,280
*Not enough to stir reaction

362
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,280
However this one does not pack punch* at all

363
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
There is none

364
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,280
Hospital food

365
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,050
It's true

366
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,270
The flavor is not that strong

367
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,710
India's hospital

368
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,310
India's hospital will serve this to the patient

369
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,060
Not much flavor curry rice, 2 point

370
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,270
Next is the dish matsumoto afraid of, Yamakake rice

371
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,880
At first I totally hate this thing

372
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,960
This is what?

373
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,060
The bottom part should be the soy sauce

374
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,890
The moment you put this you should know it's bad

375
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,650
What bad, i have not mix it yet

376
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,080
Not good

377
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,320
Why?

378
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,970
Let's eat

379
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,250
Delicious

380
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,610
Very delicious

381
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,130
This is seriously delicious

382
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,030
Delicious

383
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,570
Tasty

384
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,990
Should be around 7 or 8

385
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,840
You decided it so quickly

386
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,470
Frankly speaking the tuna is good

387
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,200
The yam taste very delicious

388
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,380
This is good

389
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,540
This can be made at home

390
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,210
Do you have some sickness

391
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,000
It's amazing

392
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,490
Are you trying to say "Bring the miso soup"

393
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,470
The current best dish, 8 point

394
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,810
Next is matsumoto, his trusted Nama ham rice how will it fare?

395
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,400
It's what you guys are waiting for, nama ham rice, Open!

396
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,490
This is good!

397
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,540
How about the smell? Is it good?

398
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,900
The smell is ..

399
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,610
It's a pile

400
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,240
You can't separate them

401
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,330
Like this

402
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,940
That might be good

403
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,280
This is good right?

404
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,680
This one only have nama ham, no salt or any spice

405
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,670
That's right

406
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,170
Let's eat

407
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,170
Let this be good please

408
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,080
Since no one want to speak, I will comment on it

409
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,470
It taste extremely bland

410
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,750
The lobster rice still have a hint of salty flavor

411
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,410
If this is the lobster taste then I will be confused

412
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,690
There is no hint of ham flavor

413
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,380
5

414
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,850
The point for being bland is 5 right?

415
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,080
It's certainly not 5

416
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,070
The grated yam is delicious

417
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,800
What point will it be if i am the one who save you

418
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,000
If you are my Saviour?

419
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,860
If you are my Saviour

420
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,430
I wonder..

421
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,800
Don't stop being blur

422
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,460
Not reaching the expectation, nama ham rice 2 point

423
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,560
Final is the exquisite ingredient bear's paw rice

424
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:30,040
Actually this is what you guys wanted, let's do this

425
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,470
I don't want to look

426
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,730
Don't say that you bastard

427
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,950
Let's stop

428
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,950
I am using polite tone

429
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,490
Matsumoto 2nd dish is the sparkling bear's paw rice

430
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,480
Open!

431
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,720
Please wait

432
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,790
Nothing changed at all

433
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,420
No changed at all

434
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,800
How about the smell?

435
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,530
The smell?

436
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
It's the smell of the sake

437
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,050
Smell of sake?

438
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,080
Let's eat it

439
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,700
Are you serious

440
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,950
I can't do it

441
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,240
Let's Janken then

442
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,760
Stick out your paw

443
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,710
Look at it properly

444
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,250
Wait, I am just being blur

445
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,870
First, we need someone to taste it

446
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:46,050
The bear's paw rice leave a strange feeling in the air

447
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,520
It's not mixed rice at all

448
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,450
There really is no change on the paw at all

449
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,030
We cook it for 10 hours right?

450
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,570
I don't get what the taste will be

451
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,350
HEIPO!

452
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,900
Get a whiff of the smell first

453
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,770
This is good

454
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,800
This is good

455
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,570
He can do it

456
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,280
Looks great

457
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,440
Let's eat

458
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,570

459
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,840

460
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,790
