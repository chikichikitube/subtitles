1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
On the night before the struggle..

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:25:55,550
Subs by FlondrapicaSubs (flondrapicasubs.tumblr.com)

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,220
the snowfall in an district of Kanto

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,590
From here on out, the challenge will be cruel

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,920
For the first time, this is Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arrahende

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,360
We have to be positive without any reason

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,800
No Negativity allowed in the middle of Winter Tour!!

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,680
Yeaaah!

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,670
So, this is the second time..

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,910
Well of course I knew, something was going on today

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,160
As soon as I saw these Boxes for changing I was really pissed off!

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,340
As soon as I saw the boxes I was soo pissed!

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,560
- I totally get that

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,180
On an extremly hot day the year before

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,920
The members of Gaku No Tsukai who are prone to making negative comments

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,440
had to put on winter clothes

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,140
and go on a sightseeing tour where they had to hide their real feelings

18
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,900
However..

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Couldn't they have parked the car somewhere closer?

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,940
- Look, there it is!

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,760
The road is freakin' packed

22
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,610
Because you idiots chose such a stupid time do this recording!

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,920
In the end, their negativity came out rapidly!!

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,280
On this day, they will pretend that they are in midsummer

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,090
The crazy temperature we have today is 6.4°C

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,100
Nice kick!  Nice punch!

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,340
Your negativity came really out there

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,670
Only your positivity today please!

29
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,480
And that idiot is taking a day off!

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,200
- Ah, that's right!

31
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,170
Hosei Tsuketei is missing due to a case of influenza

32
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,060
- Even though you had a box for him

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,960
He doesn't feel too well so he took the day off

34
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,720
If it's hot, you can't say that it's hot

35
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,090
but if it's cold you can't speak at all

36
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,280
One can just be silent

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,600
Yeah, but..

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,840
Ouch!

39
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,360
These two are in a really bad mood, so could you please stop?

40
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,530
We also say that to &$%§$

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:17,360
Absolutely no negativity allowed

42
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:17,420
During the tour many
negativity traps will be layed

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:17,480
The most negative person will be punished at the end

44
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:07,210
The rules:

45
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,080
Because it will be tiresome to be positive all the time

46
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
I brought a whistle with me

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,860
Only if I blow this whistle, the negativity ban will be lifted

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,520
So we can just complain normally then?

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
- Then, let's go

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,540
- It's pretty cold, right?

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,100
Please, wait a moment

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,300
Come on..

53
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,520
First, you need to change

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,480
From here on, the negativity ban starts!

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,000
But even now it's already really fucking cold

56
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:53,060
The ban just started so you already instantly collected one point there

57
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,120
- Wow, I don't like this game at all

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,780
With that being said, they will change into outfits that one would were in the midst of summer

59
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,540
You have to be kidding me...

60
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,800
This reminds me of New Year's ..

61
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,000
I really don't want to take my hat off

62
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,460
- We will count that as negativity as well!

63
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,570
After three minutes..

64
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,410
Ah, this is really good!

65
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,710
but it's colder than in the summer, right?

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,420
Wow, this is awesome! Are you for real?

67
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,460
While surpressing their inner feelings they behave positively but..

68
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,140
Aaa, this is bad, this is bad..

69
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,960
- Everybody, how are you doing with your change of clothes?

70
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,380
I'm still freakin' changing!!

71
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,180
I can't come out right now!

72
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,640
- What the hell? I'm still changiing!!

73
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,670
This is really harsh..

74
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,810
This is so harsh!

75
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,650
I don't want to say it again but we have already started!

76
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,280
The negativity flows out of their mouths, now Downtown already has a small lead!

77
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,260
Can we start?

78
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,860
Let's do this! Open the Boxes!

79
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,260
Oh yeaah!

80
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Oh yeaah

81
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,060
Awesome!

82
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,940
Those are Mouton Boots, right?

83
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,300
Huh, what do you mean?

84
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,470
The clothes are not distributed fairly

85
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,620
Trap

86
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,380
That's strange!

87
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,260
- Look at your ears!

88
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,980
Well,, everyone has something different

89
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,160
Well, I have the thinnest clothes of all

90
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,590
Trap

91
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,590
Only a tank top

92
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,960
and it's also very short

93
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,100
The clothing doesn't fit

94
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,180
Trap

95
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,920
I would have liked to wear them

96
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,620
- This is not warm at all

97
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,100
And my shorts.. Why this size?

98
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,840
The warmest part of my body right now is around here

99
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,020
Your microphone?

100
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,940
Except for this part, I'm feeling cold everywhere

101
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:31,100
Fully enjoying  attractions and marine sports

102
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:31,040
Odaiba Seaside Park

103
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:31,040
Odaiba Seaside Park

104
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:31,040
Tokyo Dome City

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,320
Even while on the move there is no negativity allowed

106
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,280
Will we be actually able to do this?

107
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,900
I don't want to catch a cold! I really don't

108
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,800
He said it

109
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,030
- If I catch a cold, what then?

110
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,430
I can't have a cold right now

111
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
- That's negativity as well

112
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,980
This baldy is still here, so it's fine!

113
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,170
Minuspoint for Hamada

114
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,170
Makes fun of unassuming staff

115
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,360
You just badmouthed him!

116
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,380
and he isn't even bald even one bit

117
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,360
- He's so bald!!

118
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,080
That's really positive, Matsumoto

119
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,860
- He's not bald at all

120
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Where exactly is he bald?

121
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,560
At last, the bus drives of!

122
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,780
And in order to improve their mood..

123
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,360
Since we are just normally on the move right now, we will do a positive Shirotori!

124
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,330
Shiritori: A Japanese word game where the players have to
come up with a new word starting with the last kana of the previous one

125
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
He's presenting it very poorly

126
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,070
Let's do with a "warm" theme

127
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,300
Let's do it!

128
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,240
Endo is also complaining a little bit now and then

129
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,100
- What do you mean?

130
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,960
Let's do it, Let's do it!

131
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,880
Let's start with "ri" from Shiritori

132
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
It itches..

133
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,460
That's also negative!

134
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,720
- What the hell!

135
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,090
He's like, if it's cold then it is okay to have an itch

136
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,990
He thought he was safe!

137
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,560
To complain about an itch is negative too

138
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,640
- Come on, what the hell

139
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,570
And when will you freaking come up with something?

140
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,960
It takes so long!

141
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,000
To completely bite into an apple

142
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,880
What's that?

143
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,000
Look look

144
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,610
Hey, I'm a tsukkomi!

145
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,680
He's so cruel, are you even paying attention to him?

146
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,780
That was cruel..

147
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,690
"To completely bite into an apple"
Okay Matsumoto, say something starting with "ri"

148
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,000
Ri .. Ri .. Uhh

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,230
Risa Stegmayer!

150
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,040
Because there is nothing negative you can say about Risa Stegmayer!

151
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,040
- There really is nothing negative

152
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,340
- Risa Stegmeyer!

153
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,410
So Hamada, something that starts with "ya"

154
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,220
Yahoooo~~~

155
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,950
Well, that was positive, wasn't it?

156
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,640
That was good!

157
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,460
That was unlike him!

158
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,880
Thank you very much

159
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,660
That was unlike him!

160
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
That has a good meaning, right?

161
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,800
Well Endo, say something with "ho"

162
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,070
Positive things, right?

163
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,880
Hop! Step! Jump!

164
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,680
Everything he said ended in a "p", though!

165
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,020
30 minutes after the tour start

166
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,760
Shut up!

167
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,720
Shut up!

168
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,130
Negativity ban is lifted

169
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,080
You just heard that, right?

170
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,940
Yeah, but it was after we blew the whistle

171
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,180
But you heard that, right? That was directed at the whistle

172
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,480
You don't have to say that every single time, you bastard

173
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,540
You heard that, right?

174
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,110
We can say anything we want right now

175
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,110
You idiot! You freakin' moron!!

176
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,340
Did you just hear that?

177
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,180
Can't you just fine him for that?

178
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,600
I was just cushed at so harshly

179
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,400
Some bad things about Gaki No Tsukai are showing today

180
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,970
Some harsh thing we are doing..

181
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,140
We couldn't do that on TV Asahi [a tv station]

182
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,060
But I haven't appeared on there even once

183
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,150
The bus arrives at the first part of the tour

184
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,750
Well our first station will be the attractions of Tokyo Dome City

185
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,200
They say it's especially fun there

186
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,880
Okay, what is it?

187
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,900
Hamada is looking like he's dead right now

188
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,170
I'm not dead! I was just looking at where we are going

189
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,370
I didn't want to interrupt

190
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,300
Negativity ban tour station #1

191
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,300
Tokyo Dome City Attractions

192
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,680
We will let them have fun with the different attractions!

193
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,060
(Staff) We will do some preparations

194
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,200
Please wait a little bit

195
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,620
Trap:

196
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,620
The staff member and License are leaving their seats

197
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,400
This is really harsh

198
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,130
Negativity is still being judged

199
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,130
This will be so bad

200
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,440
There are so many shadowy spots

201
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,600
I will catch a cold

202
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,570
We'll definitely catch a cold

203
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,080
They don't have any water here at all

204
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,020
No drink were prepared

205
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,020
Trap

206
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,560
When I'm so dehyrated, whatever you might tell me..

207
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,160
If you tell me that, it's definitely a loss

208
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,500
"Ah Matsumoto-San, we don't have any water"

209
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,900
There are a bunch of cameras rolling right now

210
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:07,420
Negativity ranking

211
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:07,480
45 minutes have passed and Downtown already has a big lead.
Is the winner already settled?

212
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:18,880
Temperature: 4°C

213
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,880
We have some cool attractions so please hurry

214
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,990
This is impossible, right?

215
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,420
Isn't this awful?

216
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,520
As soon as they go outside, the negativity rapidly increases

217
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,240
Hamada! Hamada

218
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,940
What the hell are you doing?

219
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,380
This is so spacious, I like it

220
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:49,320
Hamada dashes to a sunny spot the moment he sees it. This of course counts as negativity

221
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,460
The weather is good, right?

222
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,960
Yeah, this weather is awesome

223
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,400
Wonderful, wonderful

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,720
With some sprinkled positive remarks, they approach the attractions

225
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,680
Everybody, please take a look

226
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,000
First off, this is our first attraction:

227
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,380
Super Biking Sorabune

228
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:22,040
We will let them enjoy this trill where the swing even reaches a height of 15 meters

229
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,080
Well, everybody, let's go!

230
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,690
Well, shouldn't the senpai go first?

231
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,760
That is like a rule

232
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,120
A negativity point for Hamada

233
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,140
Strong punching

234
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,500
Cocorico said they want to ride it at any cost

235
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,480
Are you for real?

236
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,740
Cocorico said they want to ride it at any cost

237
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,500
- Ah sorry, my body height is not sufficient

238
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,380
It says you have to be at at least 110 cm tall.

239
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
You're not taller than 110 cm?

240
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,960
- I'm 109 cm

241
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,290
That's humour, just humour

242
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,060
Come on, let's go

243
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,840
To make it simple, rather than just saying something random:

244
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
This ride is really scary!

245
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,760
Right?

246
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,040
But this scariness is good, right?

247
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,710
Please, just go everybody

248
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,840
Negative point for Hamada:

249
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,840
Strong punching

250
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,940
Freakin go ride it!

251
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,220
He has just been so negative all the time

252
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
He just hit me!

253
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,220
Just surrender!!

254
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,860
I just want you to have some fun

255
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,600
FUCKING RIDE IT

256
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:52,640
While Downtown is grumbling about, they are  somehow approaching the riding platform

257
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,900
Everybody, please

258
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,920
I really don't want to

259
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,490
It's really unpleasant and it's so fucking cold

260
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,460
Downtown is really no good for this kind of thing

261
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,740
But some middle school students just rode this..

262
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,830
Well, let's just stop the camera

263
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,020
and just call Okamoto [creative director at Downtown's agency]

264
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,400
To see if it's okay to ride?

265
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,560
If Hamada rides I will ride too but

266
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,610
if Hamada is acting up so much, I just want to match him

267
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,400
So if Hamada rides..

268
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,320
Us being a duo, I really want to treasure that

269
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,340
I won't ride this!

270
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,200
With that, in the end only Cocorido rides the swing

271
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,100
Are you all set?

272
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,220
Then let's go!

273
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Do it for 20 minutes!

274
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
The attraction starts!

275
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,160
Facing strong wind, it becomes even colder

276
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,440
Trap

277
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,650
They don't even put up their hands..

278
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,980
They are putting so much force into their shoulder

279
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,330
They are not waving back at us at all..

280
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:27,540
Cocorico's negative point

281
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:27,540
Not waving their hands at all

282
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,710
They are not waving back at us at all..

283
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,880
Welcome back! How was it?

284
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,740
It was cold, really awesome!

285
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,800
You should have looked more happy riding it

286
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,620
- You didn't wave back at us!

287
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,540
If Matsumoto and me would have been on there,
we would have done it like this

288
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,440
- I want to see that

289
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,140
I reached out to Okamoto, he said we couldn't do it

290
00:15:50,260 --> 00:16:00,240
23 times

291
00:15:50,280 --> 00:16:00,240
15 times

292
00:15:50,320 --> 00:16:00,240
38 times

293
00:15:50,320 --> 00:16:00,240
41 times

294
00:15:50,320 --> 00:16:00,240
Negativity ranking

295
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:58,660
With this stop, Hamada remains at the top

296
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,340
1 hour since starting

297
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,600
Betting on a price, the two duos face of in a shooting game

298
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,140
Sure enough the result was..

299
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,060
Finish!

300
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,780
With 3050 points over 2830 points, Downtown wins!

301
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,200
Downtown triumphs!!

302
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,580
Watercannon fooooooou!

303
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,500
With this positivity appeal, Downtown attempts to come back

304
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,820
Hamada, how was the water cannon game?

305
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,290
- Yeah, it was fun

306
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,700
You just were silent and concentrated, right?

307
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,600
Well, the water cannon game itself was fun

308
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,320
And when I looked to to my side, there was my partner

309
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,930
and I thought: Man, this is such a splendid thing we're doing right now

310
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,170
And now a short break for their tired bodies

311
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,910
Well, these chairs..

312
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:21,220
The chairs are made out of cold aluminium

313
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:21,220
Trap

314
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,890
So cold!

315
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,740
You were splendid at the water cannons

316
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,440
so here is your reward

317
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:48,180
Trap

318
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:48,680
Their price is an extra portion of ice cream scoops

319
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,540
Congratulations!

320
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,680
Trap:

321
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,350
Only the winners receive a special scoop of blissful flavour

322
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,690
Strong wind

323
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,380
Ou, this is awesome

324
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,760
It's so freakin cold!

325
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,180
It's really so freakin' cold

326
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,580
I won't eat this

327
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,170
I hate chocolate chip icecream

328
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,780
My toes are about to tear off because it's so cold

329
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,120
They're about to tear off, it's so freakin' cold

330
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,800
Do you have a coat or something?

331
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,780
Oh, we have some

332
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,020
To anger Matsumoto, another trap awaits

333
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,520
Why can't you open it? NAKAMURA!

334
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:42,100
The buttons and the zipper are shut

335
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:42,100
Trap:

336
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,740
FUCKING HURRY UP

337
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,060
Enjoying attractions and marine sports

338
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,060
Odaiba Seaside Park

339
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,060
Tokye Dome City

340
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,300
Even when they allow me to put this on, it's still impossible to do

341
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,600
Before one knows it, the five put on some jackets. The next halt is...

342
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:13,080
This is our second attraction, the Sky Flower

343
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,380
No way, no way..

344
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,200
This is absolutely impossible

345
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,980
The Skyflower

346
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,000
We will let them enjoy a superb and unbroken view of the city

347
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,240
Let's have Cocorico take a little look

348
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,450
Take a peek so see what it is like

349
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,880
Meaning, you will ride after that, right?

350
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,020
- Yeah Yeah, exactly

351
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,080
We are already talking to Okamoto on the phone

352
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,460
Take off your coat Tanaka, take it off already!

353
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,640
- For the time being, let's just go

354
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,340
Now now now just wait a second, please wait

355
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,080
Please, let's ride with everyone at least one time

356
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:08,920
For some reason, this turbulent situation remains unstable

357
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,720
Attempting escape

358
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,720
Endo's negativity point:

359
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,780
Also escaping

360
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,220
Hamada's and Tanaka's negativity point:

361
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,340
A little bit too abrupt end to this tour

362
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,240
Come on, this skyflower thing is impossible for me to do

363
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,440
- But there's nobody left but you

364
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,680
- You're calling this sky flower, but there aren't any flowers here

365
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,040
Come on it's so cold, I can't handle this talk right now

366
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,650
and this holiday season is also unappealing

367
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,960
Talk with the 5 Member

368
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,800
Suddenly on New Year's..

369
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,500
Well Endo.. in Guam

370
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,460
Well in Guam I unexpectedly met Hamada

371
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:00,740
Well, I went there with my parents and my girlfriend

372
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,580
We stayed at this hotel which was located inside a golf course

373
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,680
And at 7 in the morning when hardly anyone was there

374
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,480
my girlfriend and I went out to get some breakfast

375
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,360
we saw some kind of staff and we thought something was going on

376
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,100
I thought I was wrong but as I was putting I saw Hamada sitting and smoking a cigarette

377
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,490
He was just like "Good morning"

378
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,830
I didn't know anything about it at all

379
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,780
- You'd be surprised, right?

380
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,940
- I was so surprised!

381
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,910
"I went to the golf course with my girlfriend, just the two of us!"

382
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,080
"While I'm doing Cocorico"

383
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,940
I remember something similar

384
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,510
I first met Endo when he came to a recording for Gaki No Tsukai

385
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,980
That time, he also brought his girlfriend with him

386
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,340
This is true, right?

387
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,540
There was a woman beside him all the time

388
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,000
So I couldn't get it off my mind asked him: "Who is that?"

389
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,560
"That's my girlfriend"

390
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,680
We then talked for a bit.

391
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,380
He told me he had liked Downtown for a very long time  and always wanted to see us in person and then he said:

392
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,220
"I just tried to pick up some girls"

393
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,810
You're the worst!

394
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,000
For real?

395
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,040
At our location?

396
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,750
You wouldn't even come up with that, right?

397
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,150
I was really troubled at the time so..

398
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,860
I don't think anyone of my juniors was troubled like that

399
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,430
For me, I also didn't have a good impression of them, when I met the two for the first time

400
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,020
Well Tanaka..

401
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,500
It was Tokyo Station, right?

402
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,170
So we two went to pick him up from the station, right?

403
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,780
A taxi was hard to find so I said to Yamazaki: "Sorry, we have to go pick him up"

404
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,200
So I told him this bean pole is my junior Tanaka

405
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,400
So me and Yamazaka where in the back and Tanaka sat next to the driver

406
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,780
and then for the whole journey

407
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,130
he didn't utter even one word

408
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,000
I thought he was on sleeping pills or something

409
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,330
You didn't say one word, right?

410
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,570
I was really nervous and stiff so

411
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,460
so we drove from Tokyo Station to Shibuya

412
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,880
And while we were driving through Aoyama..

413
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,910
Yamazaki said to Matsumoto: "Who is this clay doll-looking guy?"

414
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,950
That you had to ask while we were in Aoyama..

415
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,720
He had seen the taxi driver more often than Tanaka at that time

416
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,940
