00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,940
This is the cursed 4th dish

101
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,940

102
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,080

Middle-aged men's stomach killer:

106
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,630
The cursed fourth dish

It's time for the most feared enemy of
our old dudes' stomachs

108
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:06,900

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:06,900
Yamazaki and Tanaka were both fine

110
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,800
Even Yamazaki and Tanaka were fine
until this fourth serving came

111
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,290
It's the stumble no one has been expecting

112
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,000

He said "so what?" right at your face

133
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,670
I guess his usual pace slowed down a bit, huh

134
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,600
I guess his usual pace slowed down a bit, huh

135
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,700

Hamada is experiencing the nightmare of the 4th dish

140
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,150
His pace has slowed down significantly

141
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,680
He's not speaking as much as before

142
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,250
He's not speaking as much as before

143
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,250

155
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,730
Is he sleeping?

156
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,680
Hamada, don't forget there's a time limit for this...

157

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,300
Hamada is gonna come here, right?

165
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,470

As the other costumers cheer him on,
he moves to the next shop

170
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,410
Give it your best!

171

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,890
shop no.17

186
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,040
A destroyed Hamada arrives at his 5th shop

187
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,890
We're getting in

188
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,180
Welcome!

189
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,960
Good evening

190
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,200
Welcome!

191
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,200
Here?

192
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,730
Welcome

193
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,730
Thank you

194
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,870
How many dishes do you think I've eaten, huh?

195
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,870
Five with this

196
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,340
30 total gyoza!

197
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,740
You gotta do it

198
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,770
Hey, do you remember if I ever, like...

199
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,180
Hey, do you remember if I ever, like...

200
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,350
Wrote that gyoza are my favorite food in my profile?

201
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:30,810
Wrote that gyoza are my favorite food in my profile?

202
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,050
Wrote that gyoza are my favorite food in my profile?

203
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,350
I don't remember reading it before

204
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,350
- I don't think so

205
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,890
Let's go, Hamada

206
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,460
Oh boy, that's the spirit

207
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,150
Nice done

208
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,620
I don't need any more gyoza...

209
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,000
You don't need them?

210
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,700
You all have to give the best to pass that sash

211
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:59,740
Gyoza won't fall down his throat

212
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,640
He can't swallow any gyoza

213
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,740
Let's flush them down with some water

214
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,530
So he drinks to forcibly let them go down

215
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,440
Deli~cious!

216
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,490
A completely different Hamada
from what we've seen before

217
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,120
Hamada became a different person

218
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,680
Last one for this shop

219
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,820
Hamada

220
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,690
Yanaoka (staff), lend me the phone

221
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,990
The phone?

222
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,880
I wanna talk to Endo, pass me the phone

223
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,200
Ah, that-- I mean... you can do it, ok

224
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,500
97

225
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,500
Meal finished

226
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,500
total amount of eaten gyoza:

227
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,500
Oh, he's done here

228
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,460
Incredible

229
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,680
I'm calling

230
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,910
Do I have to?

231
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,910
Please

232
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,410
Hello?

233
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,090
Endo?

234
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,680
Akabane Station

235
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,680
Call

236
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,680
Endo Shozo

237
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,680
Hamada Masatoshi

238
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,680
South Ootsuka

239
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,490
Oh, good evening

240
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,490
Sure

241
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,680
Are you ok?

242
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,920
Come to Oji's shop

243
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,780
Come to Oji's shop

244
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,700
What?!

245
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,690
Endo's opinion didn't matter...

246
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,630
Endo's opinion didn't matter...

247
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,720
Eh?

248
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,050
Hello---

249
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,730
Let's go to Oji!

250
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,580
Got it

251
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,580
Let's just go, hurry up

252
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,740
I think

253
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,770
I smell trouble

254
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,250
Let's go to Oji

255
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,940
Hamada heads to Oji's shop (no.18) too

256
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,120
Moving on the next level

257
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,890
I'm the youngest one here, I have to be fast and resolute

258
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,260
That's right

259
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,860
I'm the youngest one here, I have to be fast and resolute

260
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,860
I agree

261
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,630
"Let's eat everything up!"

262
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,740
(7 hours 32min since start)

263
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,740
32 total shops

264
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,740
Ouji's shop (Kita Ward)

265
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,740
shop no.18

266
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,320
Should we just wait?

267
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,040
- Sure

268
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,040
Alright then, let's wait

269
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,190
This is Ouji's shop

270
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Where is he?

271
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,120
Welcome!

272
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,080
He's here

273
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,550
Sorry I'm late

274
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,500
'Evening

275
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,160
- 'Evening

276
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,160
Good evening

277
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
Are you ok? How are you?

278
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,080
What's up?

279
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,860
I mean, you told me to come here, so...

280
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,860
Yes, I know

281
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,060
I was at the next one...

282
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,110
Right, South Otsuka

283
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,110
I was waiting at South Otsuka's shop

284
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,240
I thought so

285
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,100
We figured so

286
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,100
Here

287
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:11,220
Endo Shozo

288
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:11,220
Fourth runner

289
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,900
And with this, you've received the sash
from our third runner Hamada

290
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,540
Are you done for?

291
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,340
Now you're the fourth runner

292
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,340
Alright I guess

293
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:15,980
Yes

294
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,680
Just so you know, we had a little problem at Takadanobaba's shop

295
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,540
And it's this thing here...

296
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,540
Ok

297
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,470
Oh, you have something?

298
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,470
That's right

299
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,420
This is--

300
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,690
It's a lil' take-out

301
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,690
We had a take-out

302
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,190
The gyoza Tanaka asked a take-out for

303
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,190
Tanaka asked a take-out for the gyoza he couldn't eat

304
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,110
But it's Yamazaki's fault, since he couldn't reach his quota

305
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,570
Yamazaki is responsible for this!!

306
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,600
You can just drag 'em along your way

307
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,640
We're giving them to Yamazaki at the end

308
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,970
We're giving them to Yamazaki at the end

309
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,240
I see, it makes sense to give him these

310
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,840
How many shops do you think you can go through?

311
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,710
How many shops do you think you can go through?

312
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,800
Well, we have our at-least-6-shops quote, right?

313
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,960
And there's Hamada's shop, so it's 7 now

314
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,290
I think I can aim for 8 or 9 shops

315
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,290
Really? That would be great

316
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,290
Really?!

317
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,220
I came to a Gyoza's King 3 days ago and practiced, you know

318
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,620
I came to a Gyoza's King 3 days ago and practiced, you know

319
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,560
I came to a Gyoza's King 3 days ago and practiced, you know

320
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,560
Now that's dumb

321
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,940
I swear, I'm serious

322
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,530
You think you can go through this?

323
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,530
Yeah

324
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,870
Will we see the results of his training?

325
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,220
How is Endo's performance going to be?!

326
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,260
Let's start

327
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm eating

328
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,300
Come on, dig in

329
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,260
Look, that's a double

330
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,210
- We can count on him

331
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,210
Completely different approach

332
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,840
His technique is completely different

333
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,940
His technique is completely different

334
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,940
I've never seen this before

335
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,050
So unique

336
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,300
Isn't this going to affect him later on?

337
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,560
Maybe this way his digestion is gonna be slower

338
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,640
What a wonderful performance

339
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,490
That was really good

340
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,330
103

341
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,330
Meal finished

342
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,330
total amount of eaten gyoza:

343
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,920
Wonderful

344
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,970
Alright then Hamada, we part ways here

345
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,030
Thanks for today

346
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,030
See ya

347
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,530
Countin' on you, Endo

348
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,940
Itabashi

349
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,940
Kita

350
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,940
Nakano

351
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,940
Nerima

352
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,940
Toshima

353
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:51,160
Ouji's shop

354
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:51,160
South Otsuka's shop

355
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:51,160
travel distance: 3.9km

356
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:51,160
travel time: 7min.

357
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,040
It's not recent but

358
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,940
I think it was like 10 years ago

359
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:46,940
Yes?

360
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,840
But I had this eating competition

361
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
You took part in it?

362
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,340
Yeah, I did

363
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,340
I see...

364
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,140
I know for sure you shouldn't rely on water

365
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,140
Oh, I see...

366
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,980
Have you noticed I didn't drink a single drop now?

367
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,410
Have you noticed I didn't drink a single drop now?

368
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,410
Have you noticed I didn't drink a single drop now?

369
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,220
You're right

370
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,180
Not a drop

371
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,950
I didn't drink

372
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,950
- Yeah...

373
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,550
Water is your enemy

374
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:09,620
Myogadani station

375
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:09,620

total amount of eaten gyoza

379
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,800
Fast-eater Endo easily clears 2 shops without touching water

380
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,620
We're done here

381
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,930
4 shops remains to reach his quota

382
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,920
He still has 4 shops to reach his quota

383
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,900
25th shop

384
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,900
Fifth runner

385
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,900
Matsumoto

386
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,900
arrives at Kameido's shop

387
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,380
At the same time, Matsumoto arrives at the 25th shop

388
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,810
You may think he's too early, but...

389
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,070
This one?

390
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,440
'Evening

391
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,040
(clerk) One person only?

392
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,040
Yes

393
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,830
They're 1 and a half hours late to their schedule

394
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,180
They're already 1 and a half hours late

395
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,380
Closing time for the remaining shops is drawing near...

396
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,430
And the closing time is drawing near

397
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,540
The 4th shop is hard

398
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,020
(9 hours 26min since start)

399
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,020

shop no.21

402
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,760
But Endo's pace is raising

403
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,020
Here we are

404
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,150
You can start

405
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,160
His pace is not changing at all, huh

406
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,220
His pace is not changing at all, huh

407
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,260
He gets rid of the cursed 4th dish as well

408
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,160
He gets rid of the cursed 4th dish with ease

409
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,210
And we're done

410
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,870

411
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,870

413
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,940
We're done with this shop too

414
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,520
Alright

415
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,870
Thank you

416
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,880
Suidobashi's shop (Chiyoda Ward)

417
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,880
The 5th dish too is not a problem for Endo

418
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,990
And his expression shows no signs of suffering

419
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,480
Let's just go, quick

420
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,880
127

421
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,880

423
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,730
He's so quick

424
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,890

425
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,890

shop no.23

428
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,060
For how long can he keep up this fast pace?

429
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,180
Here I go

430
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,490
I wonder how hot these are

431
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,720
They're hot

432
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,690
- I see

433
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,690
Are they?

434
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,560
Now he knows how to deal with them

435
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,330
Can you keep up the pace?

436
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,130
Huh? You forgot how to pick it up?

437
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Have you become unable to hold a gyoza?

438
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,940
Nope, I'm fine

439
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,650
It's coming, huh?

440
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,850
We can totally tell it's coming

441
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,220
Here it comes

442
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,220
We can totally tell it's coming

443
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,660
Endo's pace is finally slowing down

444
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,370
Huh?

445
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,660
What's wrong?

446
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,900
No way

447
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,180
I'm completely fine

448
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,780
You're almost ther--

449
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,700
Huh?!

450
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,700
Gulping down a lot of water

451
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,400
Here it is

452
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,260
No way

453
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:04,090
The reason for why he wants to keep on eating gyoza is...

454
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,880
But there's a reason for why he doesn't want to give up yet

455
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,940
I want to pass my sash onto Matsumoto with a good feeling

456
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,340
I want to pass my sash onto Matsumoto with a good feeling

457
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,880
I see

458
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm trying my best to do so

459
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,760
- Got it

460
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,550
Man, I'm so hungry...

All 36 gyoza are done

466
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,500
Do you have any stomach medicine?

467
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,600
He takes some stomach medicine to trick
his stomach and continue his battle

468
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,040
Gimme some

469
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,940

474
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,480
Endo will now face his 7th shop - an unprecedented resolution

475
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
Here we are

476
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,920

477
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,450
Down goes the first one

He's at his limit

479
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,080
Hang in there

480
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,220

00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,280
And it's down

483
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,490
He got 'em both!

484
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,680
He really made it

485
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,840
Meal finished

486

Alright

490
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,710
Thank god he got 'em both down

491
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,040
That was impressive

492
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,970
Oh shit I can't anymore... I've reached my limit

493
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,440
Oh shit I can't anymore... I've reached my limit

Oh shit I can't anymore... I've reached my limit

496
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,980
This is terrible

497
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,980
It is

498
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,110
This is impossible-- I thought I could go for like 10 dishes, but...

499
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,580
This is impossible-- I thought I could go for like 10 dishes, but...

500
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,120
This is impossible-- I thought I could go for like 10 dishes, but...

501
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,120
I think 7 shops is incredible enough

502
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,160

00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,160
And finally, Endo's efforts will be shared with Matsumoto

507
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,240
Welcome!

508
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,330
You're so late~

509
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,330
You're really late, man

510
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,330
I'm here

511
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,020
We don't have time left--

512
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,800
Here's your sash, take it

513
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,860

521
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,630
What?

522
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,970
take-out gyoza from Takadanobaba's shop (no.12)

523
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,500
How old are these?

524
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,800
Let's see...

525
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,120
It's from here, so it should be from 4 P.M.

526
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,850
This isn't "Gyoza's King" anymore, it's "Gyoza's Pawn" by now

527
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,020
This isn't "Gyoza's King" anymore, it's "Gyoza's Pawn" by now

528
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,640
Let's deal with the other shops first

529
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,530
So Tanaka is gonna eat those later?

530
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,530
Yes, I mean, it's Yamazaki actually

531
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,660
How did this happen?

532
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,360
They should have eaten more

533
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,040
They all tried their best here

534
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,470
'Scuse me

535
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,470
Excuse me?

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,210
I'll have some tenshinmen!

537
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,210
No--- it's gyoza!

538
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,080
I know you're hungry but please

539
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,080
I felt like eating that...

540
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,110
I wanted to try, you never know

541
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,100
Yeah but... yeah

542
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,110

543
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,020
One serving of gyoza, please

544
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,020
Please

545
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,900
I wanna go all the way through this

546
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,260
Let's do this

547
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,260
We're counting on you

548
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,450
Hang in there

549
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,450
I get what you're saying

550
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,440
Sorry to have kept you waiting

551
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,440
So fast!

552
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,660
Yeah, the King is pretty fast

553
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,640
Want some vinegar?

554
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,990
Yeah, fine, I'm gonna eat 'em all anyway

555
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,230
The hell? These are so good

556
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,570
Their taste is making me laugh

557
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,740
Their taste is making me laugh

558
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,740
So good they make you laugh?

559
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,420
It was the same for me too

560
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,840
I felt the same at first

561
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,110
I'm craving some white rice

562
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm fast, right? Right?

563
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,120
I think I was even quicker on my first dish

564
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,320
Alright! I'm done

565
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,300
Last one to go

566
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,140
I'm gonna pay, you get ready ok?

567
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,460
145

568
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,460
Meal finished

569
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,460
total amount of eaten gyoza:

570
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,460
Meal finished!

571
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,460
- Alright!

572
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,140
Give it your best, Matsumoto!

573
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,140
Let's move on

574
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,240
Here we go  Bye!

575
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,290
I'll wait for you at the goal

576
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,430
Adachi

577
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,430
Arakawa

578
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,430
Edogawa

579
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,430
Katsushika

580
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,430
Sumida

581
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,430
Taito

582
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,820
from Kameido

583
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,820
to Hirai station

584
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,820
travel distance: 2.5km

585
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,820
travel time: 5 min.

586
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,940
It was a piece of cake just now

587
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,940
Yes

588
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,430
I think I'm a big eater

589
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:20,920
Yes

590
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,420
Between Yoshimoto's comedians

591
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,370
A glutton?

592
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,370
Yes, that's right

593
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,270
Inside Yoshimoto I think I'm like the 400th in rank

594
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,210
Inside Yoshimoto I think I'm like the 400th in rank

595
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:27,610
Inside Yoshimoto I think I'm like the 400th in rank

596
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,650
Inside Yoshimoto I think I'm like the 400th in rank

597
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,650
- That sucks

598
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,650
- That's pretty low!

599
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,080
But the other guys are way worse than me

600
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,350
But the other guys are way worse than me

601
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,120
But the other guys are way worse than me

602
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,220
Don't you think it's strange they
can't eat up 6 gyoza servings?

603
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,690
Are they gay?

604
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,890
Even if you say so---

605
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,720
They're hermaphrodites

606
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,990
That's the way a hermaphrodite eats

607
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,360
Scrap that, a hermaphrodite would eat more than that

608
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,100
- What

609
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,360
- You're talking so much!

610
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,360
- Do they eat so much?

611
00:14:48,360 --> 00:15:03,080
(11 hours 11min since start)

612
00:14:48,360 --> 00:15:03,080
32 total shops

613
00:14:48,360 --> 00:15:03,080
Hirai station - North exit (Edogawa Ward)

614
00:14:48,360 --> 00:15:03,080
shop no.26

615
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,890
Matsumoto enters the 26th shop in a good shape

616
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,760
It took us forever

617
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,760
Let's get in

618
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,940
We expect a lot from you

619
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,520
Can I just get in?

620
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,520
Of course, let's go

621
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,280
'Evening

622
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,060
Welcome!

623
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,060
Good evening, thanks

624
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,080
Let's do this

625
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,080
We're ready

626
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,260
Place your order

627
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,980
Have you decided already?

628
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,980
Yes, I'll have...

629
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,800
Tenshinmen, please!

630
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,860
How was that? Lame?

631
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,920
One serving of gyoza, please

632
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,920
Coming right up

633
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,490
I'm completely fine

634
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:21,500
He easily finish up his 2nd dish of gyoza

635
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,860
His chopsticks movements are smooth,
and gyoza goes down one after another

636
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,980
I wanna eat even more of these

637
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,040
It's going to take you around 3 minutes per shop

638
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,260
You're fine, it's just half empty

639
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,400
I can do this

640
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,750
Counting on you

641
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,910
151

642
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,910
Meal finished

643
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,910
total amount of eaten gyoza

644
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,140
Alright!

645
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,540
Nicely done

646
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,910
Let's move on

647
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,020
I get it now!

648
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,020
Nice speed

649
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,850
Really good

650
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,850
- You're doing great

651
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,950
You're fast

652
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,790
That was fast

653
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:55,380
"I get it now..."

654
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:55,380
A sentence got us worried

655
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,650
Matsumoto uttered some words of worry without thinking

656
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,280
Do you think you can keep up your
fast pace from the 3rd shop?

657
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,080
Yeah, sure

658
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,180
Let's keep it then

659
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,900
I mean, yeah, sorry

660
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,900
- It's good

661
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,080
We'll pay while you eat

662
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,010
Of course

663
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,010
So we can go faster

664
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,510
But you know, if I'd stop now I'd be fine

665
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,520
But you know, if I'd stop now I'd be fine

666
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,520
Excuse me?

667
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,450
- What was that?

668
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,450
W-what was that just now?

669
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:17,450
(11 hours 28min since start)

670
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:17,450
32 total shops

shop no.27

673
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,250
Matsumoto is already showing weakness,
but it's now or never for the Gyoza's King

674
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,360
This is also a battle against heat

675
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,360
- That's right

676
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,290
He's keeping a good pace  - It's good

677
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,130
A nice fast pace, it's what we want

678
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:31,850
chewing gyoza without speaking

679
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,130
- He's fast

680
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,200
He's doing good, isn't he?

681
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,200
- He is

682
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,080
Want us to go pay?  - Should we go?

683
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,960
Matsumoto?

684
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,870
You're going?

685
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,990
Yeah, we're doing it now

686
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,210
Alright then

687
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,420
We're done here

688
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,450
157

689
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,450
Meal finished

690
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,450
total amount of eaten gyoza

691
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,920
Another meal finished

692
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,650
Just like before

693
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,060
Oh my

694
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,420
Uhhh...

695
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:55,960
This is tiresome

696
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,130
This is tiresome

697
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,700
Ohh～ now I get it...

698
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,400
- Well...

699
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,600
Ohh～ now I get it...

700
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,610
(11 hours 54min since start)

701
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,610

shop no.28

704
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,840
A nervous Matsumoto challenges the cursed 4th dish

705
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:18,580
How is it going to affect Matsumoto?

706
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,560
How is he going to overcome it?

707
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,240
We're happy to see such a good senpai eating all these gyoza

708
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,240
- It's so rare

709
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,020
Feast your eyes on this scene, folks

710
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,890
Next up is Koiwa's north exit shop

711
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,890
- That's right

712
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,540
Right

713
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,480
One after another

714
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,480
- Yeah

715
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,560
Matsumoto?

716
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,910
- Matsumoto?

717
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,910
Matsumoto...?

718
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,880
I don't wanna eat anymore

719
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,880
He's giving up!

720
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,510
What?! Giving up?!

721
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,960
A new tragedy awaits Matsumoto!!

722
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,960
coming up

723
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,470
Are you kidding me?

724
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,470
- What?!

725
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,370
3½ shops?!

726
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,220
Now I get it...

727
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,770
You ok?

728
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,770
- Just focus on their taste

729
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,320
It's the last one

730
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,460
- Come on

731
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,460
Let's do this

732
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,130
Let's get rid of the 4th dish

733
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,130
- Yes

734
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,460
- Oh crap!

735
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,460
Let's go, Matsumoto

736
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,140
He's starting to gulp down a lot of water

737
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,240
He's starting to gulp down a lot of water

738
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,020
This is the first sign of surrender

739
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,020
- That's an "I give up"

740
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,020
We know this by now

741
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,720
But man, I'm impressed I made it this far to be honest

742
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,050
But man, I'm impressed I made it this far to be honest

743
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,220
But man, I'm impressed I made it this far to be honest

744
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,070
This is the cursed 4th dish

745
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,400
And he's done, let's go pay for this

746
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,100
163

747
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,100
Meal finished

748
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,100
total amount of eaten gyoza

749
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,940
Let's go, Matsumoto

750
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,940
- Come on

751
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,500
We don't have time

752
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,820
We're running out of time

753
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,820
Let's go

754
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,290
Come on

755
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,150
Let's go

756
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,970
Hang in there, Matsumoto

757
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,380
Adachi

758
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,380
Arakawa

759
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,380
Edogawa

760
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,380
Katsushika

761
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,380

763
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,380
from Mizue station

764
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,380
to Koiwa station

765
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,380
travel distance: 5.8km

766
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,380
travel time: 12min.

767
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,710
Here we are

768
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,710
- Next shop

769
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,980
Until now as you can see...

770
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,340
For example, Hosei got help by Tanaka
when he couldn't make it

771
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,710
I see

772
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,710
In your case, everyone will help you

773
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,690
We thought you wouldn't need this,
you said they're all gay and stuff

774
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,230
Well, yeah, I still think they're all gay

775
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,400
Well, yeah, I still think they're all gay

776
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,400
- I see

777
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,370
But by now, I've become a full-fledged little girl

778
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:03,870
But by now, I've become a full-fledged little girl

779
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,870
But by now, I've become a full-fledged little girl

780
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,010
What?!

781
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,740
4 shops left to conquer

782
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,740
Everyone will take part on the last two

783
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,740
4 shops left - everyone will help for the last two

784
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,650
The other 4 believe in him and wait...

785
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,650
He has to do it for the other 4, waiting and trusting him...

786
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:22,320
Matsumoto is going to strain his stomach!!

787
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,700
He's going to strain his stomach for them

788
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,700
- Here we are

789
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,700
Koiwa's station, north exit

790
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,420
Yes

791
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,330
Oh boy

792
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,260
Huh?

793
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,580
- What the-

794
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,580
Oh!

795
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,670
Oh shit

796
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,940
We're fucked

797
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,940
They're closed

798
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,740
This sucks

799
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,410
current time:

800
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,410
Are we done now?

801
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,410
They're closed already  - It's over

802
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,640
Thank god...

803
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,640
Wait, what?!

804
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,180
No, I meant-- that's not it

805
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,180
Did you say "thank god"?

806
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,680
I mean, I'm sure it's on me too, it took me too long

807
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,510
I mean, I'm sure it's on me too, it took me too long

808
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,880
I mean, I'm sure it's on me too, it took me too long

809
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,180
I mean, I'm sure it's on me too, it took me too long

810
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,780
Ugh...

811
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,620
I don't like half-assed things like this...

812
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,720
I wanted to go all the way through to the end, man...

813
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,120
I wanted to go all the way through to the end, man...

814
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,120
This--

815
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,730
Really

816
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,730
So uncool～

817
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:08,650
Status report for the other 4

818
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,110
I can't believe this is the end

819
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,840
Is no one gonna answer?  Yeah?

820
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,330
Hello?

821
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,330

827
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,910
Koiwa's shop is closed

828
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,040
Closed?!

829
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,130
It's past business hours

830
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,600
The shop is?

831
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,610
It took you guys too long

832
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,950
He's scolding us sayin' we were slow

833
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,040
He's scolding us sayin' we were slow

834
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,040
You gotta be kidding me

835
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,920
I figured he would say that

836
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,920
Is he for real?

837
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,140
He says the shop is closed

838
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,190

How about you end this by yourself?

849
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,480
No way, that'd be awkward

850
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,270
Please come here, please

851
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,170
Did they tell you they're going home?

852
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,170

861
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,190
He says he'll wait at Koiwa's north exit

862
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,450
I can't--- I don't want to

863
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:01,850

Let's just gather here

870
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,140
It's like that, you know

871
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,140
Yes?

872
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,860
Just like the first time we went to a brothel, let's gather first

873
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,190
He says to gather like we did when we first hit a brothel

874
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,640

ends on their 28th shop out of a total of 32 shops

881
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,060
ends on their 28th shop out of a total of 32 shops

882
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,080
Start!!

883
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,400
He's so fast!

884
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,920
Alright!

885
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,420
DEAL WITH IT YOURSELF!!

886
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,850
No way

887
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,290

888
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,030
Deli~cious!

00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,700

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,340
Good!

891
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,170
I don't wanna eat anymore

892
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,930
I think I wanna go home

893
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,950
They'll meet up for the review meeting!!

894
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,950
coming up

895
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,600
Oh, they're here

896
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,220
It's really closed

897
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,080
He's right

898
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,080
Oh no

899
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,450
You're late

900
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,100
I've been waiting for minutes

901
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,100
What?

902
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,140
Well, it took us some time since the phone call to get here

903
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,270
Actually...

904
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,570
You haven't completed Takadanobaba's shop no.12 yet...

905
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,940
You haven't completed Takadanobaba's shop no.12 yet...

906
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,060
There's nothing there

907
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,060
- It's blank

908
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,310
What do you mean?

909
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,480
You haven't completed Takadanobaba's shop no.12 yet...

910
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,200
You're right

911
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,310
It's here

912
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,180
We have the five left gyoza here with us

913
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,150
We have the five left gyoza here with us

914
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,150
This is Yamazaki's part, right?

915
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,150
- It's Hamada's

916
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,260
It's yours

917
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,260
No

918
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,720
Endo took care of mine

919
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,620
You can eat those, right? It was morning back then

920
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,020
We're counting on you

921
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,020
You can eat those, right? It was morning back then

922
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,090
Well

923
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,230
I don't think I can eat those

924
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,840
What?!

925
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,060
I can't

926
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,060
You gotta do this

927
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,900
It's yours, man

928
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,730
How about we split this, Hamada?

929
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,460
Why am I getting involved in this? Endo took care of me

930
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,460
Me and Endo aren't involved

931
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,470
For crying out loud...

932
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,660
