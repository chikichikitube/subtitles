00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,460
President!

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,640
It's about time to begin

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,700
Sure

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,360
So, as I was saying,

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,880
I'm joined by our development team

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,700
We'd like to explain you
how our new product works

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,440
A new product?
- Yes

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,900
Can we?
- Sure

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,920
Alright, please, Imasaki
- Sure, let me do it

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,020
Here's our new product
- It's a pot!

13
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,680
He says it's a pot

14
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,560
He just said "pot"...

15
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,680
This is a new invention of our company,
the just-press-and-go-pot

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,440
Its most peculiar feature

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,040
Is the fact it can boil up water
with half the power of a normal pot

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,680
Only this one can, right?

19
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,160
That's right

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,460
It's an innovative pot, isn't it?
- Of course, it's the first of its kind

21
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,360
It's a complete new pot experience

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,480
By using this, you can save
a lot from your electric bill

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,640
You can say this pot...

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,200
- is the first one of its kind!
...is the first one of its kind!

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
It is, right?
- It is indeed!

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,900
It can halve down the electric bill
you'd pay by using another pot

27
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,320
And of course it works perfectly,
it has no flaws. What do you think?

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,620
Mr. President?

29
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,460
Does it hurt?

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,560
Come again?

31
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,000
Does it hurt?

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,460
Hurt?

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,380
Hurt, you say?

34
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,390
What should?
- That thing, does it?

35
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,160
Does it...

36
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,100
This...

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,520
It can hurt

38
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,320
Yes, it does hurt

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,030
Let me try it myself
- Sure, please

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,460
Please, President

41
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,620
Of course, it depends
on how you use it

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,980
Please, Imada, do it

43
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,060
Alright, mr. President,
place your finger over here

44
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,360
Should I put it inside this?
- Yes

45
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,840
It doesn't hurt

46
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,660
We're sorry to hear that

47
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,200
It doesn't hurt?
- Not at all

48
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,800
It didn't...
- Not even a bit

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,180
What are you doing?!
- Sorry, I wasn't expecting it...

50
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,310
Just do something about it

51
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,620
So, mr. President...

52
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,860
Come here, Kurano
- Yes

53
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,680
Do it
- Sure

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,320
Mr. President, your finger

55
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,420
Ah, do I have to place it here?
- Yes

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,620
Please, do it
- Here it goes

57
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,860
Ouch!
- Ah! You said it!

58
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,720
Does it hurt?!

59
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,500
Does it hurt?
- It does, but...

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,360
It's not pleasant

61
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,260
I'm sorry for that
- It lacks of stinging pain

62
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,960
Ah, I see... but it hurts, right?
- Of course it does

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
But it's not good?
- It's not!

64
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,640
Wasn't it?
- Yeah, 'cause... 'cause he pressed it

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,690
Sorry for that
- That one doesn't count

66
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,420
YOU, you're next
- Yes

67
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,720
Let's see...

68
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,080
Place your forehead here, President

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,280
Here? In this spot?
- Yes

70
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,480
It's kind of...

71
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,060
Too slow

72
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,080
Sorry
- That's not what I wanted

73
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,860
This product, this pot...
- What about it?

74
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,220
Is no good

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,260
Is it no good?
- Exactly

76
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,680
It took us 3 years to complete it...
- You gotta do more than that

77
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,980
Got it

78
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,580
Are you stealing your salary or what?

79
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,980
We're sorry to hear that
- I know

80
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,440
It's no good

81
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,080
We got that
- Not good at all

82
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,820
Yes...
- You know, now? What a pot needs

83
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,500
This can't do it

84
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,700
Yes, sorry, Mr. President.
Apologize, everyone!

85
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,580
We're terribly sorry

86
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,640
Alright then

87
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,100
Got it?
- Yes

88
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,560
The pot...
- Yes?

89
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,860
It's not good!

90
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,120
No good
- I understand...

91
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,180
Alright? I'll be waiting
- Sure

92
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,520
Do it
- Mr. President! How's this?

93
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,640
Ouch! Now this is good!

94
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,240
This pot is good!

95
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,880
Is it?!
- We can sell this!

96
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,080
Really?
- Let's launch it

97
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,740
Are you sure?
- Definitely

98
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,020
Can we?
- You bet

99
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,260
Go make more of this!
- This is great news!

100
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,020
There's no time to waste, let's go!

101
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,140
Ouch! This one's good to go too!

102
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,360
What's that?
- This one's good    - Is it?!

103
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,320
Let's bring this one too

104
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,300
We're going---

105
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,260
Ouch!

106
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,220
You're good too!

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,340
Come with us, then!

108
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,660
That's all good

109
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,160
This one's pretty good too

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,960
Take this thing too!
