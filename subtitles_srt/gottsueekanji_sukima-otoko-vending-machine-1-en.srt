TOMIYOSHI-SAN

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,830
Honey!

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,030
What's wrong?

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,870
Hey! What are you doing?

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,880
What are you doing

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,310
in my vending machine?

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,980
What's this?

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,450
What are you doing?

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,690
What?

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,060
This is my vending machine. Why are you in there?

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,660
Shut up. Leave me alone, stupid.

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,990
In this day and age, even Macaulay Culkin drinks alcohol!

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,930
What kind of reasoning is that?

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,760
What.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,030
You know what?
- What?

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,030
This machine contains

18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,040
the beer that our best customer buys every morning.

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,040
If you are in there, he can't buy it!

20
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,140
Hey master!

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,740
Hi. Good morning.

22
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,610
We were talking about you just now. Look at this.

23
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,140
I want to buy some beer.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,710
What are you doing old man?

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,180
What, Ham Hand.

26
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,380
Ham Hand!

27
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,290
Ham Hand?

28
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,350
What are you saying?

29
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,620
Who's Ham Hand!

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,930
I can't buy beer, get out from there!

31
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,130
Shut up, stupid.

32
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,100
He's rude.

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,200
Go and call the police.

34
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,130
Good idea.

35
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,130
You know what pops.

36
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:27,530
What?

37
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,030
Not pops, old man.

38
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,670
What?

39
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,740
We just called the police.

40
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,300
He wont come!

41
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,210
200% chance that he wont come! Stupid.

42
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,370
We just called him!

43
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,710
You idiot, he wont come. Stupid.

44
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,280
Idiot!

45
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,580
What's the problem?

46
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,850
Look at that.

47
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,680
He's in such a place.

48
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,690
What?

49
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,250
Pops.

50
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:48,850
What?

51
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,860
You're in such a place!

52
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,620
Shut up, Pro guide.

53
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,060
He's rude.

54
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,630
He was called "Ham Hand".

55
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,630
I'm Ham Hand.

56
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,630
Pops.
- What?

57
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,500
If you stay there, you'll be causing them trouble.

58
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,840
I don't care.

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,340
You should. You are causing us trouble.

60
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,840
Our customers can't buy beer.

61
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,840
I want to.

62
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,710
Can I tell you one thing?

63
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,140
What is it?

64
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,750
I have been listening quietly and
all I heard was complaints.

65
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,050
You guys don't understand anything. So don't talk.

66
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,490
What..

67
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,760
Hey you. The owner.

68
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,220
What?

69
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,390
You.

70
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,700
I'll tell you one thing since you don't remember.

71
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,070
When you were a kid,

72
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,970
you saved an animal, right?

73
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,340
Well..

74
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,570
No.

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
I have never.

76
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,280
I'm the puppy.

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
I said I have never.

78
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,550
Are you listening?

79
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,850
I have never done that.

80
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,890
You know what? Let me ask you this.

81
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:03,500
As an adult, why doesn't anyone ask me why I'm in here?

82
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,600
Oh, sorry about that.

83
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,630
Then, let's hear why you are in there.

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,110
In this world, there are all different kinds of people.

85
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,910
Every person is different.

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,650
Some are good, and some are bad.

87
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,590
Some are warm, and some are cold.

88
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,060
Some are so warm.

89
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,760
Some are so cold.

90
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,400
Think about it. It makes you want
to go into a vending machine.

91
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,800
I got it.

92
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,140
Vending machines have hot and cold drinks.

93
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,910
That's what he is talking about.

94
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,420
It does make sense!

95
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,850
But who asked you that!

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,190
It has nothing to do with this.

97
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,060
I'm asking why you are there.

98
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,230
You better cut it out. You are causing trouble.

99
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,330
You know what old man.

100
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,070
What.

101
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,600
You are causing a trouble. You
broke my vending machine.

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,810
Please pay for the damage.

103
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,810
Why should I? Are you stupid?

104
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,240
If you don't, you will be arrested.

105
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,250
I wont be arrested for something like that, stupid!

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,310
Isn't that right?

107
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,350
Listen pops.

108
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,810
What.

109
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,680
If you damage someone's property,

110
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,150
it is a crime.

111
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,350
You'll be arrested.

112
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,790
Serious?

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,090
That's how it is.

114
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,960
Will I be arrested?

115
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,740
If I get arrested, my wife and kids will cry!

116
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm afraid my kids will be bullied.

117
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,640
Maybe.

118
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,880
I did a bad thing.

119
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,250
Will I be arrested...

120
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,520
Excuse me.

121
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,890
Please.

122
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,690
Are you willing to overlook this?

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,530
Please Jyako Nezumi-san!

124
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,300
Who the hell is it?

125
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm the police officer.

126
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,800
Who is that?
