00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,770
Emergency Plan

3
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,430
Ok, Everybody

4
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:02,860
Yes!

5
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,430
Today we'll have an emergency plan

6
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,500
An emergency, is it?

7
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,270
It is an emergency, yes

8
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,370
We don't usually deal with emergencies in this show, uh?

9
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,040
Yeah!

10
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,670
Excuse me one second

11
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,270
Looks like you haven't left gaki after all!

12
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,270
＊This episode aired shortly after the "Yamazaki vs Moriman" show, Matsumoto is making fun of Yamazaki leaving gaki-no-tsukai after his humiliation on that show

13
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,210
I'm not leaving, what the hell are you talking about!

14
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,880
Cocorico Endo has been infected by a mysterious virus and is now resting.

15
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,140
So, the emergency plan

16
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,550
You know, there was the "Yamazaki vs Moriman" show recently

17
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,030
Yama-chan, do you remember there was a little match while you were resting?

18
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,560
Yeah, I remember

19
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,560
Of course you remember

20
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,120
That was the funniest moment of the whole show!

21
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,700
No, no, no, no way! Not true!

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,700
That one during my break, right?

23
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:40,970
Yes

24
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,670
Yeah, I remember

25
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,670
With Dynamite Shikkoku-san

26
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:42,900
Yes

27
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,670
Dynamite Shikkoku-san, uh...

28
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,570
Yes, yes, Shikkoku, Shikkoku, yes!

29
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,910
That was...

30
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,540
After that on my room a lot of people came

31
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,410
You know, asking some questions about him for the audience

32
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,780
Like "Who really is this guy?"..?

33
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,010
Unironically?

34
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,220
Yeah...

35
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,150
For real?

36
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:02,220
Dynamite Shikoku is a masked wrestler who appeared in "Yamazaki vs Moriman"

37
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,390
He fought with his rival, Escargot-man

38
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,260
But sadly he ended up being defeated due a muscle strain;

39
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,930
His popular "SHIKKOKU SHIKKOKU" performance had the audience go wild, though

40
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,240
Today we'll draw near Dynamite Shikkoku's true colors!

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,320
So, let's just call him here

42
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,150
Here's the superstar born from the raging waves of the Naruto strait, Dynamite Shikkoku! Please come!

43
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,150
＊The Naruto strait is a famous strait between the Awaji island and the Shikoku island, famous for its whirlwinds.

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,900
Good morning!

45
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,380
Pro Wrestler
Dynamite Shikoku

46
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,080
Do you usually dress up this way?

47
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,050
Normally yeah, I wear this...

48
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,350
With a suit?
A suit, uh...

49
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,190
He's pretty small, isn't him?

50
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,720
You think so?

51
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,790
But really you know... this...

52
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,890
Being called here to join "gaki no tsuKA" is really...

53
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,330
Uh?!

54
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,460
"Tsuka"? Is "gaki no tsuka-i", you know!

55
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,570
It's a pleasure to be here

56
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,370
The pleasure is ours

57
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,670
You weren't in the middle of a training, right? Is it ok for you to be here with us now?

58
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,540
Well, I already trained for about 40 minutes this morning at five

59
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,470
So short!

60
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,670
40 minutes?!

61
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,800
Yeah and I went back to sleep at 6 o'clock

62
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,510
Then why don't you wake up like at 10:00 and have your session until 10:40?

63
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,320
Yeah but you know, waking up at 5 A.M. it's like a rule for me, like a feeling I have to grant

64
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,650
So, I'm counting on you today

65
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,360
That "wake up" and "rule" made quite a messy sentence

66
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,820
＊Shikoku said "okite" (to wake up) and "okite" (a rule, a law) in the same sentence. Matsumoto remarks this.

67
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,820
Shikoku-san, excuse me but

68
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,020
How old are you?

69
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't really talk much about it but

70
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm 33 years old

71
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,170
Apparently Dynamite Shikoku is 33 years old

72
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,270
Excuse me, for how long have you been watching our "Gaki no Tsukai" show?

73
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,910
Uhmm...

74
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,810
Well it's a bit embarrassing but...

75
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,200
I've always been watching it since the third time it aired!

76
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,940
For real?

77
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,110
The third time he said...

78
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Yeah yeah

79
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,810
16 years ago!

80
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,810
Yamazaki started appearing after around the second time, right?

81
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,580
Am I right?

82
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,200
Yeah...

83
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,950
I was right huh?

84
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,290
Uh...

85
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,590
He just said he's 33!

86
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,920
Dynamite Shikoku refers to Yamazaki (37 years, older than him) without honorifics.

87
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,220
I started watching it shortly after you came in

88
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,020
You said you are 33 years old

89
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,020
But I'm 37 years old, you know so...

90
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,730
He's older...

91
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,400
Well, it's not a problem! Treat him nicely!

92
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,960
Well, yeah, ok, ok

93
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,100
It's completely fine to me

94
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,670
Excuse me Shikoku-san, but why are we here right now

95
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,740
Yeah, is this zone related to you somehow?

96
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,040
Yes, you see, actually...

97
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,410
There's also a training gym near this area...

98
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,310
Is that so?

99
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,310
It's a place where I enjoy go even by myself

100
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,110
I wanted to show it to you

101
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,950
Oh, I see, that's why!

102
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,620
Come on, let's go

103
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,150
Ok, let's go

104
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,820
Which place related to you are we going to see today first?

105
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,760
We're first going to a set meal restaurant I used to go a lot to

106
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,500
You know,

107
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,530
It's been a while since I've been there

108
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,460
Really?

109
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,100
Is that a place you used to go to when you just started being a wrestler?

110
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,570
Well, it was when I was 18 years old

111
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,540
When I first came here this was the zone I lived in

112
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,340
It brings back so many memories... this mansion is still here

113
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,850
That's impressive!

114
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,080
They don't builds things like that anymore

115
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,940
You know, back on the old days this was a gym

116
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,850
What was it?

117
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,110
You know, back on the old days this was a gym

118
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,750
A gym?

119
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,320
It disappeared!

120
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,250
Oh? Is this Dynamite-san's...?

121
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,020
There's no trace of it!

122
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,250
Is it your gy-

123
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,290
What a big discovery, no one would have guessed!

125
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,930
It's over there

126
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,230
"Sankou-en" uh
Looks nice!
"Sankou-en"...

127
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,650
Looks really nice

128
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,630
So it was this kind of place uh

129
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,670
That's the set meal restaurant which took care of Dynamite Shikoku-san since his arrival to Tokyo about ten years ago, the "sankou-en" restaurant

130
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,440
Good morning!

131
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,580
Welcome!!

132
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,440
Good morning

133
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,380
Are we eating there?
Is there a table for us?

134
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,750
Of course, please!

135
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,750
My~, Mite-kun, you grew up so splendidly!

136
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,390
They're the Downtown duo

137
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,620
Mite-kun?

138
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,150
Mite-kun.

139
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,460
Mite-kun...

140
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,600
Like, it's been a lot since I last saw you!

141
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,430
Yeah something like... 10 years I guess

142
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,530
I'm so happy to see you again!

143
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,530
Please take a seat

144
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,530
Please!

145
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Hey pops, where's Kyoko-chan (his daughter) today?

146
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
＊Not actually Shikoku's dad/mom. He calls them this way in a friendly / confidential way.

147
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,570
She got married!

148
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,950
So she got married uh...

149
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,950
Yes

150
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,970
There used to be their daughter with them in here

151
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,750
But she got married after all!

152
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,010
You were late!

153
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,440
You're right!

154
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,250
Uh, yeah, I wanted to ask a question to the owner

155
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,720
You do know Shikoku's unmasked face, right?

156
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,850
Have you ever seen it?

157
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,490
Actually no...

158
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,190
I was always like this

159
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,250
He was like this

160
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:53,990
Oh, is that so?

161
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,590
You've always been wearing that mask since your debut?

162
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,890
Mh, yeah, fundamentally

163
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,730
Damn, it's hot in here today

164
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,800
Excuse me a moment

165
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,100
What?

166
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,890
Is it really okay to do so?

167
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,900
We could barely see your face

168
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,270
Shikoku-san?

169
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,940
So bluntly...

170
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,100
Well, he said it was hot in here

171
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,810
Shikoku-san?

172
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,350
Why did you do that?

173
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,900
Dynamite Shikoku almost shows his face

174
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,380
Sorry, it was so hot I couldn't deal with it

175
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,880
I can endure anything else but not when it's hot

176
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,880
That way you'll eventually end up showing your face

177
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,130
Mama, you attached this for me?

178
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,990
Yes!

179
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,990
What is that?

180
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,460
Well, that's... wh-when was it? Five years?

181
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,530
Maybe five years?

182
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,290
Five or maybe six years ago...

183
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:40,540
Looks like Dynamite Shikoku released an LP 5 or 6 years ago

184
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,460
I was involved with this association...

185
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:34,700
Uh...

186
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,700
So like, so my popularity could gradually increase

187
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,140
And so they helped me release this LP

188
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,770
The B-side is friggin' long!

189
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,770
Side A is wrote there, title is:

190
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,500
"In such night, again, alone... will you get your sleep, scumbag?"

191
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,580
You used two pronouns with same meanings in the same sentence!

192
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,580
＊"kimi" and "omae" are both "you", "omae" can be a rude way to adress someone (thus I've translated it "scumbag")

193
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,220
[he points out something wrote on the CD cover, can't see due LQ]

194
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,150
What do you usually eat in here?

195
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,150
Well here I usually uh...

196
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,150
Usually, uh?

197
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,760
Can you see the menu over there?

198
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
There's a 450 Yen set meal

199
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,230
Amazing!
So cheap!

200
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,430
I'd like you to have a taste of this 450 Yen menu

201
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,900
Isn't it good!
Nice!

202
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,900
The usual!

203
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,900
A large serving of the usual?

204
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
A large serving is...

205
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,510
Make it a Mite-serving!

206
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,810
A Mite-serving, okay!

207
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,710
A Mite-serving for everyone!

208
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,410
Ok, Mite-servings

209
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,300
Thanks as always

210
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Dear, a Mite-serving of the 450 Yen set meal

211
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,200
Coming!

212
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,720
Mite-serving...

213
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
You know this restaurant

214
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,550
Is the best for my body

215
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,020
So a large serving alone

216
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,350
Is not enough

217
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,730
So a serving larger than the large one is the mite-serving, with the "mite" took from me, "Dynamite"

218
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,600
That's impressive!

219
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Sorry I kept you waiting!

220
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,300
It's so huge!
Is this the mite-serving?

221
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,100
All of this for just 450 Yen?
Amazing, so cheap!

222
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,140
That's really something!

223
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,010
Isn't it good to enjoy a meal this rich on a restaurant for a cheap price?

224
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:59,080
It's pretty unusual, don't you think so?
Yeah
Yeah, definitely seeing your point

225
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,680
Eh?

226
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Why are you doing this?

227
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Dynamite Shikoku doesn't show any sign of enjoyment.

228
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,790
Don't you like what you're eating?

229
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,790
It's delicious, really

230
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,590
Oh, yes, I wanted to ask you

231
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,160
That thing

232
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,600
What do you think of the current wrestling panorama? Don't hold back, speak to your heart's content!

233
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,340
Well, let's leave this talk to later, shall we?

234
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,600
Well, let's leave this talk to later, shall we?

235
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,210
Since you've all come here today

236
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,850
Dynamite Shikoku doesn't want to talk about wrestling at all.

237
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,710
You have the worst manners!

238
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,710
Let's take it easy for now    Wait, what have I done?

239
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,880
You're ruining the mood!

240
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,720
Let's just
Let's enjoy this atmosphere for now
Right, right, right

241
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,050
Now I...

242
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,400
You know...

243
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,150
Is something from the past, but...

244
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,430
What did you do when you were a kid?

245
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,300
Uhm, when I was little you say...

246
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,100
I want to know about it
Yeah

247
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,400
Well, you know

248
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,270
I was a pretty mischievous kid back then

249
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,000
Figures

250
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,900
Uh, it's like... like, there's someone that.. .what was it again...

251
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,000
Is there like a ex-teacher or someone like that who you hold dearly in your heart?

252
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,700
Uhm yeah, thinking about it probably there's someone

253
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,650
I think it's the homeroom teacher I had in elementary school

254
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,950
I think it's the homeroom teacher I had in elementary school

255
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,020
Really?
Elementary School...

256
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,020
His name was Mr. Narutogawa

257
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,950
Mr. Narutogawa?

258
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,860
It has a Shikoku-vibe to it
It's a pretty uncommon name, uh?
Definitely from Shikoku

259
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,020
It's been almost 20 years since I last met him

260
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,860
With Mr. Narutogawa, right?
From your elementary school period, so...

261
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh, it's been a while!

262
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,330
What? Isn't it Dynamite-kun!

263
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,600
M-mr. Narutagawa!

264
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,670
Yes!

265
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,670
It's been a while!

266
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,310
It's been a long time!

267
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,410
You've grown quite a lot!

268
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,450
Ex-teacher from his elementary school days:
Hideo Narutogawa

269
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,640
Wh-what are you doing in here?

270
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,680
Why are you..?

271
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,900
I just took the first bullet train from Shikoku this morning

272
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,190
Did someone told him to come here?

273
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,190
Y-yeah, probably

274
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,060
We didn't know either! We've been tricked!

275
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:53,590
Mr. Narutogawa secretly came all the way from Shikoku to meet Dynamite Shikoku

276
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,690
It was a surprise for us!   just like a prank!

277
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,760
It's like the set of a prank show!

278
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,500
So he was the homeroom teacher back when you were in sixth grade?

279
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,030
Exactly!

280
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,200
So he the teacher you were talking about...

281
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,770
Good to see you again and nice to meet you everyone

282
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,440
Nice to meet you

283
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,810
That's the first time you've seen these guys?

284
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,410
Oh, yes, I never met them before

285
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,250
Dynamite Shikoku's Yearbook

286
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,150
Let's all take a look at his Elementary School Yearbook

287
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,150
Can you tell who am I?

288
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,150
You can tell who I am, right?

289
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,150
He's this one

290
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,150
I can recognize his look

291
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,800
This brings back so many memories!

292
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,500
I wonder if it'll be visible in the camera?

293
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,460
This brings back so many memories!

294
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,530
Bottom Right: Around 6th grade of elementary school

295
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,130
His look's the same

296
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,530
Right
You can tell who he is at first glance

297
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,080
But, you already...

298
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,980
Wore a mask?

299
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,980
Well yes, of course

300
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,740
It's the same, right?

301
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,440
Yeah it is

302
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,170
Good you kept it

303
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,580
You know, he wore that all the time just like this

304
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,980
You have been doing such things since then?

305
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,490
Yeah I've had this passion since when I was a kid and I decided that "I want to be a wrestler!" so...

306
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,720
Oh, that's why

307
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Damn, this all brings back so many memories, Teacher!

308
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,690
Yes, you're right

309
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,060
Thanks for being here

310
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,830
What kind of...

311
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,630
Mr Narutogawa, what kind of kid was Shikoku-san back then?

312
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,030
Well...

313
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,030
He's not exactly the type of kid a teacher would remember

314
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,870
He's not exactly the type of kid a teacher would remember

315
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,200
Teacher please enough joking around!

316
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,440
You shouldn't say something like that!
But it's good you grew up this much!

317
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,100
But he doesn't remember?!

318
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,020
The Mr. Narutogawa of that period

319
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,020
A letter from his ex-teacher Narutogawa-sensei

320
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,920
Let's read a letter of encouragement from his teacher!

321
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,950
To Dynamite-kun

322
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:31,630
Because you weren't really a kid who stood out during the elementary school period

323
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,160
What

324
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:38,500
When you became a pro-wrestler I couldn't believe it was actually that Dynamite-kun I knew

325
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,810
But seeing your current great efforts made me think it was a great thing you became a wrestler

326
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:52,860
Me too, along with all your classmates, will always be secretly supporting you from Shikoku

327
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,700
So be careful about your physical condition and become a champion as soon as possible!

328
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,950
- Hideo Narutogawa

329
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,390
I'm sorry...

330
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,790
Again, Dynamite Shikoku almost ends up showing his face

331
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,460
Shikoku-san...

332
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,460
Shikoku-san, your face...

333
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:12,870
Everyone please, take care of him

334
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,500
Oh, of course
Thanks

335
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,500
I'm sorry...

336
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,270
Isn't it good?

337
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,540
Well, everybody, sorry for interrupting you! See you and thanks!

338
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,680
That was the Dynamite Shikoku showing tears of emotions from the emotional-reunion

339
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,750
The emotional reunion has ended, and now coming next...

340
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,900
Next one will be

341
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,430
Yes?

342
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,260
A place I've been going weekly since middle school at least 2-3 times

343
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,690
Oh, I see, something like that
I see, I see

344
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,400
Ah, excuse me a second

345
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,530
Mr Misawa!

346
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,300
Hi!

347
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,560
Hey Shikoku-san! Good morning!

348
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,460
It's been a while

349
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,600
Your hair grew quite a lot!

350
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,530
Guess you're right

351
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,370
Maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow I'll come here to cut them

352
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,070
I'll be waiting!

353
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,300
Sure

354
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,170
Keep on cleaning Misawa, won't ya?

355
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,870
Yes, yes

356
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,840
What a dick!

357
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,840
You're actually a moron, aren't you?

358
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,240
You speak a bit too much

359
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,110
That's because I'm a wrestler

360
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,110
I have to keep my image

361
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,110
Yeah but that just before...

362
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,450
Weren't you a bit harsh?

363
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,850
Well, you see...

364
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,120
We wrestler are stronger than others

365
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
Oh, it's right there!

366
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,420
What was that "wrestler are stronger" thing?

367
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,300
Yakitori Shop "Tori-Hana"

368
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,260
'morning!

369
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,620
Welcome!!
Hey!

370
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,390
Hey boss!

371
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,690
Welcome! I'll be waiting for you, Shikoku-san!

372
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,090
Good morning, excuse us

373
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,330
Take a seat!
Can we?  - Of course!

374
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,870
Ok then
Woah, that's amazing
That's really impressive!

375
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,470
Ah, this

376
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,170
A calendar!
Yeah

377
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
There's also a photo of him with the owner!

378
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,540
Oh, right!

379
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,340
We've been friends for a long time
Yeah it sure does look like it

380
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,340
The owner is doing the SHIKKOKU move too!

381
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,340
Hey!

382
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,340
You use to do it too, uh?

383
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,340
Yeah, a lot

384
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,340
Woah, that handprint's pretty huge!

385
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,340
I know right? It's quite large

386
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,900
Eh-! It's huge!

387
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,130
Uh?!

388
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,600
Yours is not that big!

389
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Please, take a seat, Matsumoto

390
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,170
Will you?

391
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,070
Is...

392
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,070
Is this yours?

393
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,140
Of course it's mine

394
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,320
Was it Christmas Eve? I just went and BAM

395
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,320
Shikoku-san, you sure go to Shikoku a lot I see...

396
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,780
Yeah...
Uh? What do you mean?

397
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,220
On the calendar: "Dynamite Shikoku's memo: Red circles mean I'm currently back home in Shikoku!

398
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,670
That's really a lot of times

399
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,150
Maybe too many

400
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,050
I thought you went back to Shikoku pretty rarely

401
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,140
It's full of circles!

402
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,720
Yeah there are a lot

403
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
Is that a period in which you go back home for a while?

404
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,830
Yeah, from the day before Christmas Eve until January the 10th

405
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,430
Ohh, I understand

406
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,700
So that's how it works in Shikoku uh...

407
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,970
He must really love Shikoku!

408
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,740
He gets to see a lot his beloved Shikoku throughout a whole year!

409
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,770
That's right

410
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,340
What is this?

411
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,080
That on September the 8th?

412
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,600
Yeah, around the 8th

413
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,810
Oh, that's my birthday!

414
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,680
No way! That's my birthday too!

415
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,680
Really?

416
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,650
You know, I actually knew that

417
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,280
I mean, our birthdays

418
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,460
Looks like Matsumoto and Dynamite Shikoku's birthdays are on the same day

419
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,550
Is that for real!?

420
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,000
Next time we'll go together at Misako's

421
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh yeah, so we're also both Virgo!

422
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,890
What a coincidence!
Really!
It's really a coincidence, don't you think so?

423
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,530
Woah!
Looks delicious!

424
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,230
Seems like that before his beloved Nabe, Dynamite Shikoku has something more to show us

425
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,470
Hey!

426
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,970
You kept us waiting, you know?

427
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,970
Hurry up and introduce yourself!

428
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,770
Yes!!

429
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,770
I'm Ibaraki

430
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,810
＊Just like "Shikoku" is the name of an Island, "Ibaraki" is the name of a prefecture

431
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,670
Add "Dynamite" to it, you idiot!
Sorry!

432
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,980
I'm Dynamite Ibaraki

433
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:17,450
＊There are two Ibarakis: One is a prefecture, one is a city in kansai. Dynamite Ibaraki is from Kansai. (the one with the kanji for "tree")

434
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,950
Which Ibaraki is it?

435
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,570
Are you from Ibaraki or Ibaraki?

436
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,410
Ibaraki.

437
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,150
Which one?

438
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,650
The one with the kanji for "tree"

439
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,350
So, IbaraKI, right?

440
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,670
Yes

441
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,950
The one in Osaka?
Yeah, the one in Osaka

442
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,550
Wait...

443
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,990
I was thinking about showing you guys a bit of my personal goods-like products

444
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,930
Like, there's this one...

445
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,660
A book?

446
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,570
Yeah I've recently managed to get to publish it

447
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,400
You did?
Is it for advertisement?

448
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,240
Well, about advertisement I wouldn't say that...

449
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,810
U-uh, wait, which (camera) is it? Oh, this, well...

450
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,850
I'll send this as a present to 5 lucky viewers

451
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:51,250
Dynamite Shikoku shamelessly self-promoting with presents
＊Not actually taking applications

452
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,850
I'll sign this in case you win it

453
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,080
Thanks for listening     This book, right?

454
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,620
Yeah, number's right there

455
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,750
You see this one's like... you know,

456
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,350
There's half of my life in it

457
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,930
You know, a sort of autobiography from when I was born

458
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,930
But uhh...

459
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,370
On the back side there's a 4-panel manga I've been drawing

460
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,430
Eh?

461
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,170
I didn't know you were into this

462
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,230
Yeah I've always enjoyed it

463
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,470
How much is that book?

464
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,570
This one is...

465
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,570
2900 Yen

466
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,000
＊Roughly 28 dollars / 25 euros

467
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,350
Expensive!

468
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,000
It's expensive though...

469
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,500
It's pretty expensive!

470
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,550
It's relatively high priced

471
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,310
Wouldn't it be better around 1000 yen or so?
Yeah, it's way too high priced!

472
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,310
So from this point on I thought "what else can I do?"

473
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,780
And so...

474
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,750
You know that "Yes & No" pillows, right?

475
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,750
Oh, those, yeah

476
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,390
They often appear as a sponsor to that program, right?

477
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,090
You know I kind of

478
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,600
Followed its example (of the Yes-no-pillow)

479
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,960
And so they made me this "SHI-KKOKU" pillow with the characters from "Shikoku"

480
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,960
＊Yes/No pillows has "yes" on one side and "no" on the other.
This one has "SHI" (四) and "KOKU" (国)

481
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah but what's it purpose?

482
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,050
I'm glad they made this but it's not like it has a meaning or such

483
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,050
It's just "Shikoku", there's no other meaning to it!

484
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,440
Right
I see...

485
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,710
This one I'll...

486
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,480
3 lucky viewers could get their hands on it as a present

487
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,380
Again, Dynamite Shikoku shamelessly self-promoting with presents
＊Not actually taking applications

488
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,010
Just call the number displayed here

489
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,910
It's the Shikkoku-pose!
Yeah, that's it

490
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:00,420
Dynamite Shikoku-san keeps on showing us with enthusiasm his most popular goods

491
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,520
I actually like this one

492
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,190
Yeah

493
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,280
How much is this shirt?

494
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,380
This is about 12800 Yen

495
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,930
＊Roughly 126 dollars / 112 euros

496
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,000
Is that really this expensive?

497
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,230
Yes

498
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,630
Boss! Can you bring here the usual thing?

499
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,740
Bring here the saké!

500
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,400
Uh? What's this?

501
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,900
WHAT?!

502
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,740
W-what is that?!

503
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
Guys this is like...

504
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,870
W-wait a second!

505
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,040
Like, my special way to have a toast

506
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,210
Wait what?

507
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,210
A bit different from putting the saké on the glass and drink it

508
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,150
Sorry I kept you waiting!

509
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,250
So, bottles after all

510
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,250
Yeah of course it's the same deal

511
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,190
So you actually drink a lot, uh!

512
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,420
No way!

513
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,420
"Naruto Zeyo", it's delicious!

514
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,400
Zeyo, uh!

515
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,230
Come on, let's have a drink

516
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,700
But isn't Zeyo in the Kouchi Prefecture?

517
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,700
＊Hamada remarks that the Naruto Zeyo saké isn't apparently made in Shikoku but in Kouchi.

518
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,070
Woah, woah, woah!
WOAH!!

519
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,280
It goes like this
That's really something!
He's pouring a lot!

520
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,280
Dynamite Shikoku pours saké in a pool for children to enjoy a drink to the fullest

521
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,090
Never seen something like that before

522
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,520
That's amazing!

523
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:01,880
Oh!

524
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,120
Ah so this is where your pose was born from?

525
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
I can see you doing it right now

526
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,780
Is this where it was born from?

527
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,700
That was so sudden
Using a pool for children...

528
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
How are you going to drink from it?

00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,130
Let's have a toast everybody, come on, raise your glasses

530
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,000
After this
Something unexpected happens to Dynamite Shikoku...

531
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,290
Thanks a lot!

532
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,000
Cheers!!

533
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,240
[previous segment]

534
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,840
Isn't his face going to be soaked in alcohol by doing so?

535
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,750
No traces of excitement too

536
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,000
We never got to feel not a single ounce of his liveliness today

537
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,550
Not even once since we met him!

538
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,550
Come to think about it...

539
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,590
It's like he doesn't have it to begin with

540
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,090
That's how he normally is

541
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,990
A boring person

542
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,700
Is it...?

543
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,000
He's the one from last time
Yeah...

544
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,570
He's Escargot-man, isn't him?

545
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,070
Are you kidding?

546
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,470
Yeah, it's him

547
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:05,750
Escargot-man came by chance to the same shop.

548
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,840
Hey!

549
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,050
Hey.

550
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,780
The hell are you doin' here?

551
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,120
Why you here?

552
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,750
It's Escargot-man...

553
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,090
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?

554
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,320
Huh?!

555
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Hey, Shikoku-san...
Wait, wait, wait! - Let's stop all of this
We're in a shop... - That's a bit too much

556
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,230
His microphone...

557
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,530
There's no need to go this far!
Plus, we're in a shop...

558
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,970
I'll get him right where he is

559
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,540
GOOOOOOONG!

560
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,440
Ouch!

561
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,010
W-wait...

562
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,910
Oh.  - Don't tell me...

563
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,080
Yet again, Dynamite Shikoku falls under a muscle strain.

564
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,320
H-he strained his muscle     - Strained, again

565
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,980
Another strain...

566
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,600
It hurts

567
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,550
Boss! Call the usual!

568
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,900
Quick, first aid!
Yes!

569
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,100
What happened?

570
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,000
Didn't last long!

571
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,490
Are you ok?

572
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,400
What?

573
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:15,020

574
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,140
He... walked towards it

575
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,340
They had it ready all along...

576
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,740
Shikoku-san!

577
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,740
Come on, Shikoku-san!

578
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,680
That was truly bullshit.
