00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,770
2nd Gaki no tsukai ya arahende!!
Let's go to a town we've never been to and ask for the 5 best places there!!

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,470
- That was so loud, wasn't it?
- Yes!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,880
- You always say my voice is too quiet or too loud.
- That was on purpose, wasn't it?

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,080
I was really surprised!

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,750
- It's serious.
- No way!

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,490
This is the 2nd segment in 10 months.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,890
You guys like this segment?

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,790
We had fun last time!

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,500
We like this kind of thing, but apparently Hamada-san doesn't.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,700
That's not true.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,270
Hamada-san looks down on ordinary people.
He doesn't like them very much, apparently.

12
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,340
Knock it off!

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,010
- What are we supposed to do?
- Just like last time, these have the town's name written on them, right?

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,420
Well, let's have Yamazaki-san, the scum of Yoshimoto, draw lots.

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,390
If you put it that way, I can't draw lots.
That would be admitting it.

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,560
- You must not admit that.
- Otherwise, you will become a scum.

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,330
May I draw a lot that has nothing to do with this once?
This has nothing to do with it!

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,290
Okay, this has nothing to do with it.

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,630
This has nothing to do with it.

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,830
This has really nothing to do with it.

21
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,900
This has nothing to do with it.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,430
I don't have any of this kind of luck, so it probably says a shabby place.

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,670
Shinano-machi.

24
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,410
- Shinano-machi is right there!
- It's right there!!

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,210
See, I have no luck, right?
I'm glad I did not draw lots.
Shinano-machi is right there.

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,580
This is like a jogging trail!!

27
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,090
So, after all, let's have Yamazaki-san, our scum, draw the lots.

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,660
- Please!
- Please draw a good one!

29
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,660
- I'm a scum after all.
- Speaking of scum, it's you.

30
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,860
I don't know what happens.

31
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,600
You might draw the one that we really don't all know about.

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,300
He has to draw a town we've never been to.

33
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, not if it's a town someone has been to.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,740
I don't want to call you a scum.

35
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,140
Where's that?

36
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,140
Iwai.

37
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,640
- Iwai?
- Iwai??

38
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,810
It's in Minami-Boso City, Chiba Prefecture.

39
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,510
Oh, it's far away there.

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,820
- It's really far away there.
- Minami-Boso is very far away.

41
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,320
Where is it?

42
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,020
- That's great. Have you found it yet?
- Here it's.

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,560
How far away it's!

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,160
It's just before Tateyama!

45
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,190
That's insane!

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,000
That's insane!

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,900
Let's go there!

48
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,400
We have decided the town we are going to is Iwai, Chiba Prefecture!

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,340
Let's all go to Iwai!

50
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,980
[Subbed by RAIDEN1017]

51
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,110
[One week later]

52
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:40,960
Well guys, we have arrived at Iwai Station on the JR Uchibo Line in Minami-Boso City, Chiba Prefecture.

53
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,190
Who drew the lots?

54
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,360
We had forgotten, but apparently it was Zaki-san.

55
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,730
And you kept quiet about it?

56
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,430
- Rather...
- He was trying to blame Endo.

57
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,200
I managed to blame this on him.

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,540
First of all, blaming someone else for our coming to Iwai station is a problem in itself.

59
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,410
That's right.

60
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,050
From the point of view of the residents of Iwai,
"Is this a town for punishment?"
They would think that.

61
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:06,810
That's right.

62
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,620
- This is not someone's blame.
- Of course!

63
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,390
By the way, it seems this is a shopping district.

64
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,420
Is that so?

65
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,690
I thought there would be something here since it's in front of the station, but there's nothing.

66
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,860
The rules are the same as last time.
Let's ask the residents of this town for their top five recommended places around Iwai station.

67
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,830
We will choose one of them and go to that place.

68
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,870
It can be any place.

69
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,370
We will get permission to shoot.

70
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,610
If we don't get permission, it's no good.

71
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,710
Sometimes it's not allowed to be shown on TV.

72
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,410
Let's ask them from the 5th place.

73
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,590
Immediately they started to ask them for the recommended 5th place around Iwai station.

74
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,860
Someone got off the train.

75
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,730
Yes, the train just stopped.
Some young people are there.

76
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,800
It depends on how many people get off here.

77
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,760
Oh, excuse me.

78
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,200
- Is it okay to film you for TV?
- Okay.

79
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,940
Hi!

80
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,040
We are looking for the 5th place on our list of the 5 best recommended places in Iwai.

81
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:15,580
Let's see, Takasaki Park is in the middle of the mountain.

82
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,120
Are we going to go to a place like that from the beginning?

83
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,560
But this is 5th place.

84
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,520
This is 5th in your mind, right?

85
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,460
Yes.

86
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,100
1st place is Mt. Tomi, after all.

87
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,930
You don't have to tell us the 1st place!

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,970
Okay, I understand your 1st place very well.

89
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,440
Your gold is wonderful!

90
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,900
There is gold in your mouth.

91
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,170
Are you okay without clothes?

92
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,910
What is your 5th recommended place by Kawana-san, who has lived in Iwai for 30 years and has shiny gold teeth?

93
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,620
Tell me again your 5th place.

94
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,480
The beach.

95
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,090
He changed it!

96
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,020
- He changed it!
- Isn't it a park?

97
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,360
He changed it from mountain to sea.

98
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,390
That's Iwai Beach.

99
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,960
It's his 5th.

100
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,960
I'll go there, thank you.

101
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,140
They immediately headed for the recommended Iwai Beach.

102
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,740
Everyone may answer that it's the Iwai Beach.
This might be the 1st place.

103
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,270
I'm a little worried about that.

104
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:21,420
This is only his 5th place, but it would be in line with other people's opinions.
That can't be helped.

105
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,290
That sign says Iwai Beach.

106
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,190
That place is definitely famous.

107
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,430
Ahhh...

108
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,330
It's so hot.

109
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,900
What an old poster.

110
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,630
Ah, Isee!

111
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,600
I didn't know what he was doing.

112
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,010
That one was tanned.

113
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:53,650
The temperature was over 30°C (86°F) that day.
They were heading to Iwai Beach in the heat.

114
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,290
It's hot.

115
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,090
It's quite a distance to the beach.

116
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,120
I heard it was right there.

117
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,290
There you go.
It's Gaki's famous.

118
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,030
"All we do is complain."

119
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,030
We really do complain a lot.

120
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,970
It's not good.

121
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:19,540
I watch other shows from time to time, but I have never seen any other show where the performers complain so much.

122
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,810
Yes, no one is saying that at outdoor shoots.

123
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,550
All we do is complain.

124
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,120
That's very negative, and you have a frown on your face.

125
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,020
Yes, I think that needs to change.

126
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,460
The dog is so loud!!

127
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,230
All you do is complain.

128
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,030
Why is there such a big bus parked here?

129
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,670
Oh, there are a lot of people here.

130
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,900
Maybe there are a lot of people here.

131
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,910
This is a training camp for students.

132
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,250
- The atmosphere has changed a lot.
- I don't know if this is good or bad.

133
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,220
He is Tsukitei Housei!

134
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,750
Hey everyone!
I'm Housei!

135
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,420
Look, he's Tsukitei Housei.

136
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,660
I'm Housei!!

137
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,360
Look, he's Tsukitei Housei!

138
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,560
No one's looking at you.

139
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,330
He's Tsukitei Housei.

140
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,970
I'm Housei!!

141
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,170
- Is this a training camp?
- Yes!

142
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,600
- What team are you guys on?
- We are a kendo team.

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,970
- Kendo team?
- Yes!

144
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,980
It's a kendo team training camp.

145
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,480
That's why they call me Housei.

146
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,110
Because I used to do kendo.

147
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,520
They don't know that.

148
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,320
10 minutes have passed since they started walking heading for Iwai Beach.

149
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,690
This is terrible.
It's very hot.

150
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,030
- We still haven't arrived there.
- We're not there yet?

151
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,430
We have not yet arrived at the Iwai Beach.

152
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,900
- I was sweating like a waterfall.
- Yeah.

153
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,780
I'm sure I'm going to collapse.

154
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,480
Finally, I could see the sea.

155
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Really?

156
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,950
There must be people there.

157
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,350
This is where it finally starts.

158
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,520
I want to decide soon from 4th to 1st place too.

159
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,230
This view isn't bad.

160
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,730
That's nice!

161
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,430
It's the sea!

162
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,300
But there aren't many people.

163
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,110
- Oh, but there are some people.
- There are some people!

164
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,450
The view is very nice.

165
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,050
That's good.

166
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,290
This must be the place for those in the know.

167
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:53,930
Iwai Beach is a 3 kilometer long arc of sandy beach.

168
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,840
it's a popular beach for students and parents and children who have come to a seaside school or training camp.

169
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,540
So they certified Iwai Coast as the 5th recommended place near Iwai Station!

170
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,480
They then asked people who come to play at the beach to tell them the 4th recommended place.

171
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,090
It's tough to walk on the beach.

172
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,790
I'm going to get my feet caught in the sand.

173
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Sand is also hot!

174
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,760
The temperature of the ground surface is high.

175
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,360
Matsumoto-san, you are at a disadvantage with those shoes.

176
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,900
Aren't they from Tokyo?

177
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,830
They might be.

178
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,740
- I don't think they know Iwai.
- They would be if they weren't locals.

179
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,080
They may have also checked out Iwai before coming here.

180
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,950
They're not bad boys, are they?

181
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,380
There are no such guys in such a place at such a time.

182
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,150
I'd be scared if there were such guys.

183
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,820
- You're 50 years old now, right?
- I might be robbed by that guys!!

184
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Yamazaki had an injury on his face.
I thought they did that to you.

185
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,790
You're hurt?

186
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,030
- I would hate to see that happen.
- This is a pimple.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,200
It would be sad if they did that to you.

188
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,500
You might get your hair pulled out by them too!

189
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,840
I absolutely hate that.

190
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,940
Which do you talk to?

191
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,580
若いのと1 The young guys or the parasol.

192
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,080
They're looking at us, so we'll ask them.

193
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,750
I don't think they know.

194
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,320
They don't seem to be Iwai locals.

195
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,660
Hi!

196
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,360
- Are you guys locals?
- No, we are here for a training camp.

197
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,930
Where are you guys from?

198
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,690
Tokyo.

199
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,160
I knew it.

200
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,630
- Are you guys in the kendo team?
- No, we play guitar and sing.

201
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,440
Are you guys going to a training camp at the beach too?

202
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,070
Yes.

203
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,140
Is that so?

204
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:51,210
Well then, do you know any good places around here?

205
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,010
We're looking for a good place in Iwai.

206
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,080
Is this the only place you guys know?

207
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,190
No wonder you guys don't know anything about Iwai.

208
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,090
Are they locals there?

209
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,790
- It may not be.
- Let's ask them.

210
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,830
Thank you!

211
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,930
Thank you!

212
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,100
The people under those parasols must be locals.

213
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,300
Are you locals?

214
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,640
No, we are not.

215
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,980
- Ah, you guys aren't?
- Oh, they are barbecuing.

216
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,750
We were going to ask you about good places in Iwai, but you guys are not locals, so you don't know, do you?

217
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,690
- But I have been coming to Iwai since I was a kid.
- Really?

218
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,550
He is very familiar with this place.

219
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:41,000
Matsuura-san has been coming to Iwai for more than 30 years. What is his 4th recommendation for a good place in Iwai?

220
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,400
What is your 4th best place in Iwai?

221
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,140
For example, there is a observatory on Mt. Tomi.

222
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,770
Observatory on Mt. Tomi?

223
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,440
If we go there on foot, won't we die?

224
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,280
- I think you can get there in 20 minutes by car.
- I see.

225
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,950
- Then I will go to that observatory.
- Thank you!

226
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,930
They headed to the Mt. Tomi observatory, which was recommended as the 4th best place around Iwai station.

227
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,470
- What was the name of that mountain?
- They said Mt. Tomi.

228
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,710
What kanji does that spell?

229
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,740
But is it okay that they are ranked 5th and 4th in the sea and observatory?

230
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,310
I wonder if I'll be able to find the last three spots.

231
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,850
Maybe these are the 1st or 2nd place.

232
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,290
These would be landmarks.

233
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,860
We could go back to Tokyo with Endo pretending to be an idiot.

234
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,090
- Are we going back already?
- "Huh?"

235
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,160
"I thought this was finished already..."

236
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,000
I also want gourmet food.

237
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,970
The town is close to the sea, so there should be.

238
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:06,710
He was eating clams and drinking whiskey with soda, which looked delicious.

239
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,050
I thought he would let me have some, but he didn't.

240
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,620
- This is a peaceful town.
- Yeah.

241
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,560
Yamazaki, you should live in a place like this all alone.

242
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,270
But I also have a 5 years old son.

243
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,370
He already thinks you're annoying, doesn't he?

244
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,640
That's not true at all.

245
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,140
I'm a big pillar of sup$#@*.. of my fami&*$#@*..
(I'm a big pillar of support of my family)

246
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,710
Huh!?

247
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,540
"I'm a big pill$#@*.. of sup$#@*.. of my fami&*$#@*.."

248
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,210
You didn't say it all.

249
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,780
The pillar was wobbly.

250
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,990
I almost collapsed on the beach.

251
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,390
When?

252
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,520
When was that?

253
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,520
Just a few minutes ago.

254
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Oh, really?

255
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,590
See, I have more clothes on than you guys.

256
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,230
Then take off your jacket!
That's disgusting.

257
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,670
Why are you wearing it?

258
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,930
Indeed.

259
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,070
Why are you wearing that?

260
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,370
This is my fashion, so I can't help it.

261
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,040
Your fashion?

262
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,510
Housei-san, it would be really dangerous if you wear this today.

263
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,610
It's much less fashionable to collapse on the beach.

264
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,110
That's lame.
There's nothing else that's that lame.

265
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,520
Why are you wearing it?

266
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,450
You're disgusting.

267
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,020
That patchwork thing is disgusting, right?

268
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,630
And the car went into the mountains.

269
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,800
The roadway seems to end here.

270
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,810
There is a sign over there.
It says "To the summit of Mt. Tomi"

271
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,410
It says "mountain trail."

272
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,310
Yes, we are here.

273
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,920
They walk to the observatory from here.

274
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:57,760
You didn't imagine Iwai to be a place like this, did you?

275
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,160
This one has shade compared to the sandy beach earlier, so it's better, right?

276
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,600
- It was hot on the beach.
- Yes, that one reflects the sunlight.

277
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,670
There was no place to escape from the sunlight there.

278
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,440
The other day I went back to my parents' house to visit a grave in Minou.

279
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,920
I drove past Master Kiyoshi's house, so I glanced at his house when I was waiting at a traffic light.

280
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,720
His house is so big.

281
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,150
The fence is also very high.

282
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,830
- Yamazaki, you don't live in that neighborhood anymore, do you?
- Yes, I don't live in that area anymore.

283
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,160
- You lived in Minou once, didn't you?
- Yes.

284
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,300
It's said that if you live in Minou, you will be popular.

285
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,740
- And you broke that superstition.
- That's not true.

286
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,670
Thanks to that superstition.

287
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,840
Thank you.

288
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,550
5 minutes have passed since they started to climb the mountain.

289
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,280
Are we almost there?

290
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,990
- Not yet.
- Aren't we about a third of the way up now?

291
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,530
Is this 4th place?

292
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,760
Yeah.

293
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,100
Mt. Tomi...

294
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,800
Oh, there's no shade from here!

295
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,840
Ah, the sunlight.

296
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,870
It's tough to be in the sunlight.

297
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,480
If that wasn't a good view, I'd shit in the field and go home!

298
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,250
They headed for the observatory in over 30°C.

299
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,430
This is 4th place...

300
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:48,770
- If this had been the 1st place spot, I would've tried a lot harder.
- That would have given them a sense of accomplishment and motivation.

301
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,270
- But this is 4th place.
- Yeah.

302
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,810
The road is so twisty I can't see ahead.

303
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,510
Seriously?

304
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,910
- How far have we climbed?
- I can't see ahead at all.

305
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,790
Yes, there are no signs telling us how much further we have to go.

306
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,150
It's hot.

307
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,560
This is tough.

308
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,470
15 minutes have passed since they started climbing.

309
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,880
This is tough.

310
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,380
This is pretty tough.

311
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,880
- As I keep saying, this is only 4th place.
- Yeah.

312
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,920
This is before we introduce 4th place.

313
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,590
My pants are soaked.

314
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,290
I don't want to go back to Osaka like this.

315
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,330
- Wearing soaking wet pants?
- I certainly don't like that.

316
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,700
Are you going home on the Kodama again today?

317
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,000
No, I'm going home on the Nozomi.

318
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,740
If it were a Kodama, it would take about 5 hours.

319
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,640
That one stops at every station.

320
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,780
But I heard he is told by Yoshimoto to take the Kodama to go home.

321
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,990
No one is going down the mountain.

322
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,420
No one would be stupid enough to climb up to the observatory in such a fucking hot weather.

323
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,720
Really so.

324
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,630
It's hot...

325
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,930
It's the sunlight again.

326
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,410
Endo, sing a song for us.

327
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,610
Sing a song?

328
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,640
Song...?

329
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,280
Let's climb

330
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,120
the mountain

331
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,090
together.

332
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,190
Sing an existing song.

333
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,730
- That's what I thought.
- Really?

334
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,100
Don't give me that fake shit.

335
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,300
Was that unexpected?

336
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,340
Blue Jean with the good figure and beauty I dreamed of.

337
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,470
It's not appropriate.

338
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,740
The tempo is not good.

339
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:27,360
20 minutes have passed since they started climbing Mt. Tomi.

340
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,530
Oh, you are sweating terribly.

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,300
Housei-san is sweating a lot.

342
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,240
You need to drink some water or you'll collapse.

343
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,110
It's probably because of your jacket.

344
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,010
I can't help it with the jacket.

345
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,210
You guys don't understand this because you're not fashionable!

346
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,850
You're not fashionable enough to understand what I'm feeling!

347
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,050
Were you fashionable?

348
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,190
Were you fashionable?

349
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,200
30 minutes have passed since they started climbing.

350
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,540
This is more than I imagined.

351
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,140
Are you seeing anything?

352
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,510
I don't know.

353
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,960
-  I can't see anything ahead.
- The road goes on and on.

354
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,890
We haven't even reached the entrance, have we?

355
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,660
This is intense hiking!!

356
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,960
That's really true.

357
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,200
This is intense hiking in the middle of summer.
And I'm wearing Crocs!!

358
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,770
I'm glad I wore shoes.

359
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,710
I'm so tired.

360
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,310
But I guess since we came to Iwai, we were destined to climb mountains.

361
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,080
I'm sure it will be.

362
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,220
But this one was ranked too early.

363
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,590
I wish this had ranked 1st.

364
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,020
But if it had ranked later, the sun would have set.

365
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,930
Yes, it would have been pitch black here.

366
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,500
And it had been 35 minutes since they started their climb.

367
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,540
It takes 45 minutes from here to the observatory.

368
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,410
Is that what it means?!

369
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,010
Ouch!

370
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,410
That's what it says.

371
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,680
But there's not a kilometer left.

372
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,550
Was the sign earlier, "1.1 km, 20 minutes," referring to just up to here?
- Yes.

373
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,660
- It took more than 20 minutes, right?
- Yes, it did.

374
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,300
- And if it takes 45 minutes even though it's not 1km, does that mean the road is really steep?
- Yes, I guess so.

375
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,300
Okay, we'll split up here.

376
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,800
If we all climb up, we will run out of time.

377
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,040
One of us should climb it.

378
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,710
Well, Hamada, please.

379
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,510
Please.

380
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,640
Wait, wait ,wait!

381
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,310
- Please!
- Please!

382
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,880
You've got to be kidding me!

383
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,350
Why me?!

384
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,420
Please.

385
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,590
Because you're the most spirited.

386
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,260
No way!

387
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,390
If we're going to pick one of us, let's play rock-paper-scissors.

388
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,030
Really?
Decide by rock-paper-scissors?

389
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,800
One game?

390
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,500
Alright!
One game!

391
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,970
Rock-paper-scissors!

392
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,240
Yeah!!

393
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,180
Yeah! That's good!

394
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,110
They all have different career lengths

395
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,980
Yes, this is a good balance.

396
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,120
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

397
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,620
Really?

398
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,120
It can't be helped.

399
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,620
Rock-paper-scissors!

400
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,230
It's a tie!

401
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,130
Rock-paper-scissors!

402
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,570
It's a tie!

403
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,630
Rock-paper-scissors!

404
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,880
You idiot!
You idiot!

405
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,610
- Okay, I'll go.
- Shozo Endo will go climb!

406
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,050
Well, I'll be going.

407
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,220
So, Endo is going to the observatory alone.

408
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,490
Next week!

409
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,860
The best 5 recommended places around Iwai station,
part 2.

410
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Endo heads up the grueling road to the observatory on Mt. Tomi.

411
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,870
In addition, he will appear again.

412
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,610
And they enjoy an exquisite gourmet meal.

413
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,790
Will the best 5 recommended places be completed?

414
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,120
Stay tuned!

415
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:54,730
