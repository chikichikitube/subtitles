00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,510
Welcome everyone to Wednesday Downtown.

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,080
Let's move on with the first presenter if you would please.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,070
Mr. Hakata Daikichi!

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,050
Teacher. Teach.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,220
Weren't the fan girl screams for Teach impressive?

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,660
Thank you.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,520
Okazoe-san, if I may ask suddenly, have you ever found money

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,440
you had forgotten about in your clothes?

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,600
Quite often actually.

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,480
- Often?
What, really?

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,610
You forget about it often?

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,640
It's natural, isn't it?

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,570
Huh?

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,370
Natural?

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,920
With money it's like second-nature to just stash it away when you find it.

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,810
I feel like she's not very good at holding this conversation.

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,020
Since that money is yours you can do that, right?

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,760
Exactly.

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,880
Right?

23
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,960
With that, this time I present you all this.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,420
When you find money that you don't know about in your pocket, you will most definitely stash it away.

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,370
When you find it in your own clothes of course you think,

26
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,040
"Isn't this my money?" and put it away.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,700
It would seem that's the case.

28
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,700
Right?

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,960
That's something you'd normally do, right?

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,800
Well, when it's like 1000 yen (~$10)...

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,470
It depends on how much.

32
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,470
It does depend on how much...

33
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,420
You definitely wouldn't find a large amount.

34
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,420
In terms of the amount, it does matter and that's why...

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,970
Yeah.

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,580
This time, it's 50,000 yen (~$500).

37
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,430
I see.

38
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,250
With $500 I'd definitely wonder if it's mine.

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,780
What do you think, Ebisu-san?

40
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,490
If it's from my pocket then it's mine, isn't it?

41
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,200
It's not about whether it's yours or not, just that you find $500.

42
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,600
Who would put money in my pocket?

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,190
That person can only be me (so it's mine).

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,960
Coming up, planting money into pockets secretly! An observation

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,410
Did I win it from the slots..?

46
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,930
After that, "Caricatures of scary customers will be greatly weakened for some features"

47
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,750
Then, "The rewards on a point card system become far more ridiculous towards the end" as well as

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,700
The first Ghost-Bicyclist Championship!

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,960
There he goes! He strikes a winning pose!

50
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:43,140
When you find money that you don't know about in your pocket, you will most definitely stash it away

51
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,350
The first target is Viking's Kotoge.

52
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,250
With cooperation from Television magazine,

53
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,720
a photo shoot featuring fashionable comedians will take place.

54
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,700
The magician playing as a cameraman will plant $500 in Kotoge's pocket.

55
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,360
How will this play
out, I wonder?

56
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,430
The accomplice Shoji waits for

57
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,790
Oooh! I see!

58
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,760
There he is.

59
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,470
the unsuspecting Kotoge to enter the studio

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,580
Immediately, the photo shoot featuring fashionable private clothes begins

61
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,830
They're wearing their own private clothes?

62
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,180
That's right.

63
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,350
Could you do something like this please?

64
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,860
Stand a little closer together.

65
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,030
It's better to have people standing close.

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,290
While Kotoge poses, the magician begins to make his move.

67
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,270
Yes, exactly. Bring your chin up-- perfect. Just like that.

68
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,780
First, he uses his finger to make the pocket accessible.

69
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,080
Whoa.

70
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,760
Turn a little this way, please.

71
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,650
Wow...

72
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,050
Then face the front, please. Angle your arms forward.

73
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,990
Whoa, really?!

74
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,720
He's fast. Really fast.

75
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,340
He's nimble.

76
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,440
He makes a blind spot using crossed arms

77
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,630
from which he easily plants all five $100 in one go.

78
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,720
And then...

79
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,890
Excuse me.

80
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,430
Could you please put your hands in your pockets?

81
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,930
If you have like a cellphone please take that out.

82
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,640
You put money in there?

83
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,640
No...

84
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,050
You the type to go without a wallet?

85
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,050
No, not at all..

86
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,680
That's a lot to keep in a pocket!

87
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,280
Huh? What's this?

88
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,290
Did you perhaps forget you had that there?

89
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,260
I would know about $500 though...

90
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,690
Huh...

91
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,590
I really don't know

92
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,630
You seem scared!

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,630
This doesn't feel right

94
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,000
Upon finding money he doesn't remember having,

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,950
Kotoge feels uneasy.

96
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,340
(Manager) What's wrong?

97
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,450
I don't know why but this is here..

98
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:06,080
To entice him, his manager brings him his wallet.

99
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,860
This feels bad...

100
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,630
This doesn't feel right at all!

101
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,300
He doesn't seem to be pocketing the money

102
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,890
Here we reveal ourselves

103
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,200
Good work today.

104
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,780
We're from Wednesday Downtown.

105
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,780
You've come.

106
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,010
Ah!

107
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,950
It's this, isn't it?

108
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,290
It seems you didn't put the money you found away. Why?

109
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,720
If it were $100...

110
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,030
I would think that MAYBE I left that in there.

111
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,370
But finding $500?? That's a little...

112
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,600
There's no such thing.

113
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,840
That kind of money is scary isn't it?

114
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,220
I see!

115
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,940
It just doesn't feel right at all.

116
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,710
Would you want to put dirty money in your wallet?

117
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,610
We kind of felt you would though.

118
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,880
He's great.

119
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,640
What, really?

120
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,140
Did you know about it, Shoji?

121
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,820
I did.

122
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,190
YOU KNEW!

123
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,760
Why the hell do YOU know!?

124
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,320
The next target is Sanshiro's Komiya

125
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,700
This time, disguised as a group of three fans,

126
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,040
one of them will place $500 in his pocket.

127
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,540
Manager

128
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,740
While waiting for his partner, some fans call out to him

129
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,020
Komiya's fan huh?

130
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,690
As they distract him, $500 is snuck into his clothes

131
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,950
That is something else.

132
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,280
Just like that?

133
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,280
That easily?

134
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,620
Without suspecting a thing,

135
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,030
Komiya moves to the next location

136
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,180
Please change your clothes first.

137
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,420
Put your valuables away in your bags.

138
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Here at that moment...

139
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,280
You would
be surprised!

140
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,740
Komiya finds the $500

141
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,930
He's putting it away
- Huh!?

142
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,440
He double checks the amount of money

143
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,880
There he goes!

144
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,200
He kept it, dude!

145
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,900
and stashes it away in his wallet!

146
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,280
With that, we now approach Komiya

147
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,410
Good work today.

148
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,410
Huh?

149
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,110
What is it?

150
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,930
We're from Wednesday Downtown

151
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,650
Huh? What happened? That you've come?

152
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,750
In your pocket, there was $500 wasn't there?

153
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,750
Right, my pocket--

154
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,920
Yeah.. Why do you know? How much?

155
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,250
It's just as you said..

156
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,720
Damn it...

157
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,790
You mean it really isn't mine?

158
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,530
Nope, not at all. We put it there.

159
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,390
Why did you do that?

160
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,150
No, see, 'cause it was there I felt it was mine.

161
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,200
I mean, of course it wouldn't happen. $500!?

162
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,200
Right? That's too large of an amount to find suddenly.

163
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,730
I mean, if it was like $10 or $20 maybe it'd make sense.

164
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,460
He's talking so
freaking much

165
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,620
Or even some coins. Yeah.

166
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,800
He totally is

167
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,010
You have a lot to say

168
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,010
Yeah... Sorry

169
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,880
How embarrassing!

170
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,220
With that said, the fact that Komiya stashes the money away

171
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,280
That's embarrassing.

172
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,940
That is SO embarrassing.

173
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,580
does not necessarily make Komiya a bad person

174
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,650
We leave that as a disclaimer

175
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,790
With that, our final target is Kuro-chan

176
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,570
He will TOTALLY
go for it.

177
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,790
Will Kuro-chan
do it I wonder?

178
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,440
Just like with Kotoge, we set up for a fake photo shoot

179
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,490
Yes, just like that. Great.

180
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,600
Could you raise your arms a bit? Perfect.

181
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,360
Using the same tactic with he blind spot, $500 is slipped into the pocket.

182
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,960
That's incredible.

183
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,600
Then...

184
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,480
Could you check your pockets? They're bulging out a little.

185
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,060
Manager

186
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,390
They're close.

187
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,440
Make sure your wallet or cell phone aren't in there.

188
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,790
Don't involve him!

189
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,280
Why is this money here?

190
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,960
Huh?

191
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,700
Is that from the slots?

192
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,070
Did I win?

193
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,170
Wait, wait

194
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,840
That's quite an amount.

195
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,840
Yeah.

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,070
Did I get it from the slots?

197
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,690
(End of the photo shoot)

198
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,510
If you would please, thanks.

199
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,580
Does it belong to the stylist?

200
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,340
Nope, it's mine

201
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,920
so I'm gonna put it away.

202
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,090
Into the wallet goes the $500

203
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,280
His image is
in danger.

204
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,200
Without a doubt, the money is stashed away

205
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:51,340
Unlike Kotoge and Komiya, he was
adamant about the money being his

206
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,780
This guy...

207
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,040
Before the experiment can end, there is one more thing to be verified

208
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:08,280
TBS has called him out for a fake DVD interview

209
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,090
During the photo shoot, the staff will infiltrate Kuro-chan's dressing room

210
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:23,100
There they will put 100,000 yen (~$1000) in his bag, twice the former amount.

211
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,210
How evil

212
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,020
And then...

213
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,720
Thanks for buying :3

214
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,630
Wa wa waaaaa!

215
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,020
Hmm, it's kind of weird without some confetti

216
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,760
I think adding the confetti would give us a solid ending.

217
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,290
It'll be smooth

218
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,290
Yeah

219
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,200
Then, could you go get some for us?

220
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,200
Ok

221
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,870
Kuro-chan is sent back to the dressing room to get him to look in his bag

222
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,720
Ah, he noticed...

223
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,600
He noticed the 100,000 yen, but just put it back...

224
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,240
and returned to the set

225
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,510
Thaaaaaank youuuu!!

226
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,920
Wa wa waaaaaah!

227
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,020
With that, the shooting ends...

228
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,480
...and Kuro-chan returns once again to the dressing room.

229
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,520
He takes out the money he placed earlier

230
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,920
He checks the amount

231
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,290
And then...

232
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,300
Without fail, he stashes the money in his wallet

233
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,660
and then...

234
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,620
Wooo

235
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,620
Ooo OooO

236
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,280
He starts humming a cheerful tune.

237
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,920
Suspect: Kurokawa Akihito, AKA Kuro-chan, Age 39

238
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,360
Of course, we must investigate further (2 days later)

239
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,800
This time, we are placing hidden camera's inside the target's home...

240
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,360
...And placing 1 million yen (~$10,000) in his doorstep.

241
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,340
Will Kuro-chan pocket this money as well?

242
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,280
That shit is wild.

243
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,090
2 hours later

244
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,020
Kuro-chan returns without knowing anything

245
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,850
The result is...

246
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,880
Oh you put it there.

247
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,080
Eh?

248
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,590
Eh?

249
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,480
Wait, is someone here?

250
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,950
Eh?

251
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,990
He must be scared thinking someone's there...

252
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,520
Hello?

253
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,470
Umm..

254
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,450
Uhh, what the hell? What the hell??

255
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,200
Eh??

256
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:22,970
More than the 1 million yen, Kuro-chan is more afraid that someone was in his home.

257
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,640
And then...

258
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,200
What's he doing?

259
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:35,390
For some reason, he eccentrically rings his own doorbell.

260
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,910
What is he doing

261
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,380
Someone is here right? Someone is here right??

262
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,020
That's pretty scary

263
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,020
Right? Right??

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,020
They wouldn't come out!(even if someone was there)

265
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,860
What's up

266
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,670
Someone is here right?

267
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,440
Right?

268
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,640
Right?

269
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,940
Right?

270
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,110
Right?

271
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,880
Right?

272
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,750
Right?

273
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,120
Answer me!

274
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,240
Hold up...

275
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,670
What is this, seriously!?

276
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,120
Am I being loud?

277
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,500
You gonna close it?!

278
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,850
H-Hello?

279
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,600
Hello?

280
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,560
Hey, someone is here right?

281
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,740
I won't do anything, I promise!

282
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,070
Ok!? Hello!?

283
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
"I wont do anything, I promise!"

284
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,320
No one!?

285
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,190
This is scary!

286
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,110
Super scary, what the hell!?

287
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,000
Right?? What??

288
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,650
Why didn't he just leave?

289
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,990
With that, it's time for the reveal

290
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,430
So scary

291
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,370
Eh?

292
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,010
It's scary but...

293
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,130
Ah, he covered it

294
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,200
Good work today.

295
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,770
Eh, for what?

296
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,100
We're from Wednesday Downtown.

297
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,040
Eh, what do you mean?

298
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,260
Eh, what do you mean? What?

299
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,920
Hold up hold up hold up

300
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,080
I don't get this at all, hold up, what? what?

301
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,400
Has anything strange happened to you lately?

302
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,320
Strange things...

303
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,790
Well, when I was in a meeting,

304
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,440
Umm...

305
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,790
...there was nothing but extremely sexy people there. Are you talking about that?

306
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,030
Uhh, no...

307
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:53,310
He doesn't notice what happened, so this time we have to explain it to him.

308
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,390
And then...

309
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,100
What's that you're hiding there?

310
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,100
No, you're mistaken...

311
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,210
Do you mind lifting up that bag for me?

312
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,130
No... you're mistaken...

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,010
No he's not

314
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,520
There's no way that I would pocket this money. Seriously

315
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,840
Damn I was super scared.

316
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,680
That was freaking terrifying.

317
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,800
There you have it, having 1 million yen placed in your house while you're away is super scary.

318
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,450
That was pretty interesting.

319
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,770
Downtown, what would you guys do in that situation

320
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,990
if you opened up a drawer and took out 1 million yen.

321
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,040
If I found it in my drawer then I would take it.

322
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,240
Hmm, a drawer...

323
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,080
Well, at their level, they would just say "Oh, just 1 million?"

324
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,660
First of all, the price of me versus Hamada is way different

325
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,650
About 8:2

326
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,200
Really?

327
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,200
8:2

328
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,940
You've done really well for yourself then.

329
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,210
You're pretty successful

330
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,700
Moving on, our next presenter, please come forward

331
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,880
It's Sanshirou!

332
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,880
Thanks for having us

333
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,430
You came as a combination?

334
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,430
Yes, this is my new consort.

335
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,190
We'll do our best as the main and sub of Sanshirou.

336
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,640
You have a dirty body don'tcha?

337
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,990
From the previous scene right?

338
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,090
Pretty sure you're both filthy actually.

339
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,880
Me too?

340
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,730
Of course you too, no matter how you look at it

341
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,730
You're pretty livid right now aren't you?

342
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,320
Do I get yelled at that much?

343
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,100
You must've thought "What a pitiful body" from looking at my back.

344
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Pretty shameful yeah.

345
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,740
Well then, this is sudden, but everyone please take a look at this.

346
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:51,160
This is from a manga called Gorillaman, "Ghostriding"

347
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,790
Did you guys know about this?

348
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,690
Yes

349
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,160
I learned about it from the manga.

350
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,600
While riding a bike, you first let go of the handlebars...

351
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,920
... and due to the momentum as you get off...

352
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,330
...it appears as if a ghost is riding the bike.

353
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,990
Just with bicycles though

354
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,220
So with that, our theory is this...

355
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,890
Theory: A Ghostriding Tournament will be reasonably exciting.

356
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,160
We've gathered some people who seem like they would be good at ghostriding.

357
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,640
Due to their image

358
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,640
And we were thinking "Won't this be interesting"

359
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
So we wanted to try this.

360
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:39,680
"Theory: A Ghostriding Tournament will be reasonably exciting" investigation.

361
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,650
We've gathered 4 challengers to take part in this tournament.

362
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,880
Our first contender...

363
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,210
BMX Pro Rider: Ikeda Takahiro

364
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,740
Oh, he seems really good

365
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,640
2016 BMX National Runner Up

366
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,600
Currently holding 4 Guinness World Records, he's a bike expert.

367
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,520
He's also performed in the Cirque du Soleil

368
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,780
I feel like there are a lot of people

369
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,290
who used to do this when they were kids.

370
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,880
I also did it when I was a kid

371
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,790
It ends up curving left or right.

372
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,580
It'll be important to try and make the bike go straight

373
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,560
Our next contender...

374
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,210
Former Women's Keirin Athlete, Shimano Reibin

375
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:37,450
She just retired from the sport 2 months ago, after winning the Girl's Championship 8 times.

376
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,520
Holding the weight of those accomplishments,

377
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,070
she suddenly decided to take part in this contest.

378
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,600
Moving on,

379
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,600
Wow, her ass is sticking out

380
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,760
Competing on behalf of the entertainment world, Yasuda's Big Circus's Danchou

381
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,600
That's not it

382
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,770
He's competed in numerous road races and triathlons.

383
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,830
He's also passed the corporate team's entry test.

384
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,880
For Wednesday Downtown

385
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,480
Basically all they use is Kuro-chan right?

386
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,710
He always gets super excited

387
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,140
and in the end he is always just being deceived

388
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,970
Kurokawa

389
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,970
You take a good look

390
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,400
Lastly

391
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,000
Gymnastics Athlete Ozeki Shingo

392
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,110
His power is in maintaining balance

393
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,600
When thinking about ghostriding ,the most critical point would be balance

394
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,200
Placing his faith in his balance, he joins the competition

395
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,940
In all, these four are the ones competing

396
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,420
Ghostriding Championship

397
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,080
Eh, that seems fun

398
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,850
The rules are simple: As soon as you throw the bicycle

399
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:50,000
The bicycle which goes the furthest shall be declared the winner

400
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,420
The recorded distance is not based on the path taken

401
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,680
but the straight line distance from the starting point

402
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,020
Unfortunately for us, the day begins with rain

403
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,570
We decided to hold the bicycle championship indoor instead

404
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,000
The contestants have three choices

405
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,050
Woah, amazing

406
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,050
Impressive

407
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,310
* A family bike

408
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,310
Mama-chari Bike*, Mountain Bike and Road Bike

409
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,850
By drawing lots, the first contestant is chosen

410
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,620
Yasuda Dai Circus : Danchou

411
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,770
So his choice is the mama-chari bike

412
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,020
We witness his first ghost bike try

413
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,850
He has begun

414
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,200
140,000 yen is the cost of his beloved bicycle

415
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,880
He is good enough to be employed by a business team

416
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,650
And so, Yasuda Danchou

417
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,970
How will his first throw turn out? It is rolling but..

418
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,200
It is making a large right turn

419
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,880
As expected of Danchou's bicycle

420
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,220
It makes a right turn and ends there

421
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,140
Distance: 14m 60 cm

422
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,540
Isn't this good?

423
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,510
Amazing

424
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,740
I won't be overshadowed by Kuro-chan

425
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,020
Up next, is Former girls track cycling team Shimano Riimin

426
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,140
As expected of a former

427
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,450
8 times Champion of women track cycling

428
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,650
She places her weight on the left side and throws the bicycle out

429
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,110
Its heading straight forward

430
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,540
But as feared, it veers towards the right

431
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,680
As expected, it does turn

432
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,540
Distance: 22m 50cm

433
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
She managed to break Danchou's record

434
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,200
A rare expression of self-pride

435
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,910
Amazing, it really took off

436
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,770
Following that is our 3rd contestant

437
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,510
Ozeki Shingo

438
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,280
Nihon Creed Gymnastics Team

439
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Director and athlete

440
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,480
He's got good speed and posture

441
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,000
He jumps off the back!

442
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,910
He jumps off the back!

443
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,570
His landing was decisive

444
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,110
Impressive..

445
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,570
It appeared to be straight for a while but

446
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,110
It went quite straight

447
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,880
It is still continuing on its path but

448
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,740
In the end, it has veered towards the right

449
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,910
His was the best out of the contestants

450
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,000
Distance: 31m

451
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,940
Wow, Amazing

452
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,650
As expected

453
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,770
The trick is in cleanly letting go

454
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,510
By cleanly letting go of the bike from the back

455
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,740
He managed to clinch the best record of 31 m

456
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,000
topping the previous record holder

457
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,110
Lastly, our fourth contestant is BMX pro rider: Ikeda Takahiro

458
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,050
Surprisingly, everyone else is quite serious about this

459
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,570
So I am a little nervous

460
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,110
In 2016 iBMXff BMX Flatland World Championships 2016, he finished 2nd place

461
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,710
He has also appeared in the Cirque du Soleil

462
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,850
and possesses the 4 Guinness BMX records

463
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,850
He lifts his left leg and attempts his 1st throw

464
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,850
If only he had thrown it more properly

465
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,540
Throws

466
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
Ohh, what a blunder

467
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,280
He is holding his head

468
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,940
So this type of things happen as well

469
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,340
That was really unexpected

470
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,170
That was damn embarrassing

471
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,250
Distance : 8m 10cm

472
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,970
It doesn't work just throwing your bicycle

473
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,110
After the 1st try, the highest record is Ozeki

474
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,110
Ikeda Takahiro, the one favored to win is in last

475
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,280
What an upsetting turn of events

476
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,710
And so begins the fateful 2nd round

477
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,680
There goes Danchou's 2nd throw

478
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Its still going

479
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,450
Amazing, its still going

480
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,800
Its looking good

481
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,740
Still Impressive

482
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,940
It makes a large turn but he managed to get good distance

483
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,600
RIGHT ON!

484
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,110
His record is 34m 30cm

485
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,740
Taking over Ozeki , he is now the top record holder

486
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,280
Following that, is Track cyclist Shimano's 2nd try

487
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,000
She wasn't able to improve her record

488
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,400
The result is 18m 40cm

489
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,050
It definitely turns towards the right

490
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,140
You can see everyone's record up to now

491
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,050
Everyone does seem to end at the right

492
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,850
The remaining two are Ozeki the gymnast and Ikeda the BMX Pro

493
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,880
Who will prevail in the end!?

494
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,310
Dark horse Gymnast Ozeki begins his 2nd try

495
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,770
Will he come out on top?

496
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,620
The crux lies in maintaining speed when you let go

497
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,220
Here he goes

498
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,310
How will it turn out?

499
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,620
Good,He did well

500
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,850
Its so good that it looks like a ghost is really riding the bicycle

501
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,570
Well done achieving such a distance

502
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,800
It isn't turning still

503
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,450
Ahh~ It hit the wall on the other side!

504
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,800
Splendid

505
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,400
Distance : 51m 80cm

506
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Once again, Ozeki achieves the top with an immeasurable big throw.

507
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,680
The last contestant BMX Ikeda takes the spotlight

508
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,540
With his pride which brought him to the World's BMX Championship

509
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,570
His 1st throw surprisingly turned out to be a failure

510
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,110
Even with his 1st throw,it looked like it was going to go well

511
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,450
He doesn't want to feel like a failure again

512
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,140
When he's cornered

513
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,200
Here goes Ikeda's 2nd try : how would it turn out?

514
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,710
It's going straight forward

515
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,940
Wow that's amazing!

516
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,080
BMX

517
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,310
Ikeda's 2nd try

518
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,310
How would it turn out?

519
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,310
It's properly rolling straight

520
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,940
This is truly

521
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,820
ghost cycling

522
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,200
It slid and crashed into the wall

523
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,220
Wow, this is truly the worst

524
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,820
Distance : 50m 40cm

525
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,480
Amazing

526
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,140
Can't we just call that a home run?

527
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,370
In this case where two contestants have hit the wall

528
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,080
We shall now conduct an extended round

529
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,370
Luckily for us, the rain has cleared and we have shifted to an empty parking lot

530
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:28,620
Gymnast Ozaki VS BMX Ikeda in the 1st round tiebreaker

531
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,140
How is the distance looking from here?

532
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,300
It looks interesting

533
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,310
We can throw however far we want to

534
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,820
The ground is bumpy

535
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,600
We have to "read" the line the bike is gonna follow

536
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,020
Into the extended round

537
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,480
By lot drawing again, Ozaki is to be the first

538
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,080
Okay, going for it

539
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,220
The Ghostriding Tournament's first throw in the outer field

540
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,480
In front of him, there are no longer any walls to stop him

541
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,850
In the end, what kind of record will he be able to show us

542
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,340
Ozaki's challenge

543
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,340
He has successfully fallen from the back and thrown out his bicycle

544
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,400
Ozaki's challenge

545
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
He has successfully fallen from the back and thrown out his bicycle

546
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
The ghost bicycle is moving but

547
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,800
it has ended up making a really large right turn

548
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,220
and it has stopped, the ghost has stopped

549
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,710
Distance :  37m 70cm

550
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,820
Ozaki was unable to extend his past record

551
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,170
Following that act is BMX Ikeda

552
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,450
If he manages to break Ozaki's record, his win would be set in stone

553
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,940
Who will be our 1st ghostriding champion?

554
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,940
Ozaki or Ikeda?

555
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,220
He's lifting his left leg and has let go

556
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,020
He made a winning pose

557
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,020
He lifted his left leg and has let go

558
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,970
Its heading straight forward

559
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,420
He made a winning pose

560
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,200
Its smoothly pulling ahead

561
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,480
It's truly a ghost riding the bicycle

562
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,480
It's still making distance

563
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,540
And finally it has fallen

564
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,110
How is his record?

565
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:00,200
Distance: 53m 30cm

566
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,710
And with that, the crowned champion for the 1st ever Ghostriding Tournament is:

567
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,080
BMX Pro Rider: Ikeda Takahiro

568
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,650
In conclusion:

569
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,650
Ghostriding competitions are somewhat exciting but

570
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,310
good kids should not follow in their example

571
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,710
I see

572
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,400
Yes yes

573
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,510
How was it?

574
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,380
It was interesting

575
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,380
That was underwhelmingly soft

576
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,380
Unbelievably softspoken

577
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,510
I can't believe this

578
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,510
When you were talking to me, you stared intensely

579
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,570
Therefore, when I replied, it became a half-hearted response

580
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,000
Surprisingly, the gymnast

581
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,940
performed better than anticipated

582
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,420
What he did: Jumping off the back of the bicycle

583
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,770
Why didn't the bicycle flip upwards?

584
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,850
Yeah, yeah

585
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,850
When he let go, it went smoothly

586
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,280
Please do your job properly

587
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,280
I think its due to the fact that he jumped off from the back

588
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,250
Wasn't there a moment where he needed to flip upwards from the handle?

589
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,600
Well...

590
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
He probably didn't flip it and just let go like this

591
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,450
Do you understand?

592
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,450
This is tragic

593
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,510
This situation is wretched

594
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,650
Hey Joker, he let go like this

595
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,680
Therefore it could go straight upon release

596
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,620
What's happening to you, ghost comedian

597
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,620
That's one hell of a nickname

598
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,480
Moving on, proving and disproving common theories from our audience

599
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,080
The viewer's theory corner

600
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,370
Tonight's presenter is:

601
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,340
Tamura Kenji

602
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,280
Nice to meet you

603
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,770
Everyone, this is kind of sudden but

604
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,710
All of you are celebrities in the show business

605
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,990
Have you been requested to have a portrait of you done?

606
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,910
Yes

607
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,910
Downtown-san right?

608
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,050
What about you, Degawa-san?

609
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,020
I have appeared a lot on magazines

610
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,850
which are mostly made from user submissions

611
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,850
Oh I see

612
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,850
There are a lot of types of portraits

613
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:57,400
There are those who specialize in exaggerating

614
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,400
Yes,Yes

615
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,420
So here's a exaggerated caricature of Hamada-san

616
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,760
Okay

617
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
Here is how it turned out

618
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,550
This is amazing by the way

619
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,210
You get it's him instantly

620
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,000
Isn't the caricature weak?

621
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,420
What do you mean weak! I don't have fat lips like that!

622
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,830
Yeah I wonder how it is

623
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,660
Is it really exaggerated?

624
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,700
Why did my lips become like that? Look look! They're normal!

625
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,260
But you...

626
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,640
They really are!

627
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,020
The eyes look like they've been pushed to the middle!

628
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,500
Yeah the eyes right? The parts on my face are gathered in the center so it's becomes that way

629
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,970
The eyes...

630
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,440
But if you're asked who this is, you definitely answer Hamada-san

631
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,960
Instantly

632
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,960
Ah maybe

633
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,480
This time right, I have brought with me a theory about this type of drawing

634
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,250
Here it is

635
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:49,280
Theory : A caricaturist's exaggeration will lessen if the client being drawn is scary

636
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,410
Yeah, right?

637
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,040
Being careful like "Will it be okay? His nose is kinda big but..."

638
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,380
Won't they be careful?

639
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,780
Yeah that's a tough situation as a professional isn't it?

640
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,910
Yeah...

641
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,780
A person who looks kinda scary...

642
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,480
It's because angry people will get angry

643
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,610
It's fine if you kill a person instantly but...

644
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,880
Uhm...if you just...break their precious right arm...

645
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,220
You mumbled your words so I didn't get what the hell you're trying to say

646
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,220
You can't mumble

647
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,490
Ah you're scary...You comedy-yakuza!

648
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,980
Even if its a little,won't you let up

649
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:27,980
We're testing the theory that a caricaturist's exaggeration will lessen if the client being drawn is scary

650
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,520
This time, with the help of an owner of a portrait shop

651
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,540
We will investigate with hidden cameras

652
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,440
Our first target is...

653
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,430
Waah, it looks like him

654
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,370
...a portrait artist...

655
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,770
Isn't the exaggeration too much?

656
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,780
...who has drawn these portraits

657
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,860
And our helper will be this man with a scary look

658
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,910
But this guy is kind of scary right?

659
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,670
His hair can be called a "bar code head"

660
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,730
I mean yeah...

661
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:00,130
Now we get our guy inside with an over the top yakuza feeling

662
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,820
Over the top!

663
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,250
Will he be able to draw an usual caricature with a scary man as his subject?

664
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,210
Will he? I want him to...

665
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,370
Hey don't fucking sit down

666
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,630
What kind of touch would you want?

667
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,650
Just draw me as I am

668
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,590
With a bar code head?

669
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,600
Now that we've shown the strong look, the portrait drawing starts

670
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:22,600
You really can't draw here

671
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,250
But it'd be weird if he drew thick hairs

672
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,020
And it's done

673
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,120
What kind of portrait has it turned out to be?

674
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,120
He's probably stressed out...

675
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,420
There is a little bit of exaggeration but...

676
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,740
...the hair should've been drawn even less however...

677
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,890
It's definitely like that

678
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,000
...in this portrait it has reversely gotten thicker

679
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,740
He put more hair on it

680
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,240
There is zero exaggeration of the bar code-head

681
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,030
As expected,

682
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:51,920
has the exaggeration gotten weaker? When we ask him...

683
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,830
It's a bit hmm...

684
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,120
How was the drawing process?

685
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,960
It was hard to draw him

686
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,300
Why is that?

687
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,010
Because he was a scary man

688
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,430
Was it scary?

689
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,430
Yes it was

690
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,440
So it WAS hard...

691
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,650
It was to test if when a scary person comes...

692
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,650
Oh what will happen?

693
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:05,230
...will you hold back a bit?

694
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,230
You definitely hold back!

695
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,390
The hardest ones to draw are the scary people

696
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,390
Oh really?

697
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,200
With that, here is the result when we make him draw holding nothing back

698
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,810
I wonder how different it'll be

699
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,290
He of course draws the receding hairline...

700
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,890
...but also a very round face and pronounced eyes

701
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,250
We can easily see that he was really holding back before

702
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,330
He almost looks like a foreigner

703
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,440
How about this scary man?

704
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,920
The features that stand out are...

705
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,870
...the big nose and his underbite

706
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,480
His chin sticks out

707
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,940
And our next artist is...

708
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,600
...this man

709
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,890
He already has drawn people with protruding chins...

710
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,900
...to an extreme, but what will happen?

711
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,190
It's about a person's characteristics so...

712
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:00,100
...it becomes a minus for the exaggeration

713
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,020
He's saying it!

714
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,100
The exaggeration?

715
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,020
He's pushing forward

716
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,870
We can display it as a good point of that person

717
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,850
That person is a person of his own so...

718
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,680
...if you ask which it is...

719
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,410
...we think of it as a plus

720
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,630
He's really freaking out

721
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,700
Quibbling along trying to insure his safety

722
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,580
What kind of drawing has it turned out to be?

723
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,380
In the end, how did the caricature turn out?

724
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,810
That's handsome!

725
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,300
Even though there was alot of material...

726
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,810
...it seems that he was holding back

727
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,930
I feel bad for Shohara-san

728
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,720
Asking him after we explain the prank...

729
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,840
You can't do that right?

730
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,180
We're from a program called "Wednesday Downtown"

731
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,840
Yes...

732
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,560
Was there anything odd that happened to you today?

733
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,620
One of the customers uhh...

734
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,360
He seemed to be in a special line of work

735
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Yeah I kinda thought of him like that...

736
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,730
What was all that guaranteeing safety

737
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,440
If it were for real, would you exaggerated a little bit more?

738
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,930
Honestly I would yeah...

739
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,710
He has quite a unique face

740
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:07,070
There are alot of high-potential parts but...

741
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:11,030
...they don't really stand out with what I've drawn

742
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,010
With that, when we have him draw no holds barred...

743
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,150
I wonder how it'll turn out

744
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,100
...here is the result!

745
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:21,310
Certainly when you compare them, the size of the nose, the look of his eyes...

746
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,060
Aahh...His nose and...

747
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,940
The teeth are showing

748
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,280
...and also the size of his chin makes it easy to see that he was holding back

749
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,330
The size is completely different

750
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,630
It is...

751
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,910
When we continue with our investigation...

752
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,530
We can't really find any caricaturists...

753
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,690
...that actually do their job when faced with a scary looking man

754
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,510
Lastly, we will use this man for our experiment

755
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,980
He isn't scary at all!

756
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,080
The comedian (Einstein's Inada)

757
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,410
Why is there a...

758
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,410
That's put on there isn't it?

759
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,190
This ugly ass comedian from Kansai...

760
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,510
If you made it that far...

761
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,200
...will be taking on the role of a yakuza underling

762
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,050
Impossible!

763
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,660
It's really made him scary

764
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,920
With an already extremely protruding chin...

765
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,070
...and a head with signs of a weird kind of balding.

766
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,600
It's amazing

767
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,180
But also with a giant fake mole

768
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,680
If they really made it like this what will happen?

769
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:13,010
What will happen when a person with a face completely full of exaggerated parts shows up?

770
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,350
Where are you from?

771
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,130
Do it fast I ain't got time

772
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,900
They're not letting him talk

773
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,130
Yes sir

774
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,080
We pushed his scary character

775
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,850
Scary! That kind of mole is definitely scaring him

776
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,450
What has that face been made into?

777
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,010
The fact that it's on the side is scary

778
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:36,010
Somehow his unique chin has been clearly drawn

779
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,420
Does that mean that the fear factor was not enough?

780
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,140
He's..scared..right

781
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,920
It was a bit scary yeah

782
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,980
A little bit scary?

783
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,980
Since he was a scary person...

784
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,380
...if you go all out...

785
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,380
...alot of things can go wrong

786
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,610
He's not gone full force

787
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,210
There are some points where I held back

788
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,610
He was holding back

789
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,910
This was actually held back

790
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:57,870
How will it become?

791
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:02,130
Actually when told, the balding, the nose and the chin are clearly visible but

792
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,860
It doesn't actually look that much different from the real thing

793
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,960
It is different!

794
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,640
The real man was too amazing

795
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,100
So there was an illusion of exaggeration

796
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,400
If it were a person who laughed a bit more...

797
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,960
...I could've probably gone all out

798
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,550
If I think to myself "This man is OK" I can go at it hard

799
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,800
He can tell that...

800
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:26,430
Here's the version we made him do afterwards...

801
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,620
Oh okay...

802
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,680
He's sticking out goddammit!

803
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,580
I'm not fitting in

804
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,010
You really held back didn't you?

805
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,480
His hair is also...

806
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,200
I'm sorry you had to be careful because of me

807
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,540
That means, even professional caricaturists

808
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,420
will hold back with their exaggeration

809
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:51,350
And also the exaggerated version looks more real

810
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,960
Yeah everybody...

811
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,800
The quality seems to disappear a bit

812
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,070
Ebisu-san, can you draw portraits?

813
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,300
It happens from time to time actually

814
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,880
The hardest parts are when a female customer comes...

815
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,820
...even when a weird woman comes...

816
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:18,370
...I try to draw them pretty

817
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,720
Do you actually want to draw them ugly?

818
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,610
Yeah...actually...yeah I want to

819
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,470
He's an honest guy isn't he?

820
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:36,340
Do any of you own any point cards?

821
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,010
I do own some

822
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,910
The bakery near me has one...

823
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,620
Really?

824
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,620
They don't do it do they?

825
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,490
Isn't she looking to up her popularity with that kind of move?

826
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,940
Please stop doing stuff like that...

827
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,170
Then, do you know how much you pay for a cabbage?

828
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,170
Cabbage?

829
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,120
I don't know

830
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,180
You should know a cabbage's price

831
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,080
That means you're not looking at how much it is when you're buying it right?

832
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,110
I DO look

833
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,310
I do look at the price but since I want cabbages I buy it

834
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,780
It wouldn't be 1000 yen for one cabbage would it?

835
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,400
She's really staring me down

836
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,170
You were smiling when talking to Matsumoto-san

837
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,670
She got excited and really stared me down

838
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:19,100
This time I have brought a theory about those point cards

839
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,410
Here it is:

840
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:26,100
Theory: There are plenty of point cards that set goals that are impossible to reach

841
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,300
Ones that make you think "Can you really save up from that?"

842
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,930
"How many times will I have to go there?"

843
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,680
There are plenty like that...

844
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,680
Oh really...

845
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,000
We will investigate some point cards that are hard to accomplish or are plain weird after this

846
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,990
We will investigate the theory that there are plenty of point cards that set goals that are impossible to reach

847
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:53,050
Now, when we search for them...

848
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,920
...we found a car parts shop that gives you 10000 yen discount if you spend 2 million yen at their shop

849
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,780
Spending 500,000 yen will get you a 5000 yen gift certificate

850
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,060
at this store specializing in bags

851
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,170
Oh it's that kind of package

852
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,170
That's pretty strict isn't it...

853
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,480
Of course, we found numerous ridiculous point cards here...

854
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,020
...but within that, this is the one that beats the rest

855
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,190
In Osaka, there's a maid cafe

856
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,250
called "Nadia"

857
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:24,240
They have a system where if you spend 500 yen, you earn one point

858
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,920
There's a option for 500 points

859
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,350
They have various prizes from 5 points to those with special privileges starting at 200 points

860
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,880
Basically, if you exchange 100,000 yen worth of points

861
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,670
You get a photoshoot with the maids

862
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,680
Furthermore, 150,000 yen will get you a lunch date with a maid.

863
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,630
250,000 yen and you can hang out with a maid for an entire day.

864
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,460
And the prices continue to rise.

865
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,400
That's pretty cool

866
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,830
There are still goals which require more points

867
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:51,890
Taking a maid on a vacation in a foreign country will require 3000 points.

868
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,070
Vacation to a foreign country?!

869
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:56,550
(14.000 USD or 10.000 Pounds)

870
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:56,550
In actuality, you need 1,500,000 yen in points.

871
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,870
So expensive!

872
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,610
However, you will not be able to go alone with a maid,

873
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,070
The store owner will tag along with you.

874
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,720
He comes along??

875
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,000
In addition, all travel expenses

876
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,950
and accommodation charges will be covered by the customer.

877
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,720
Who would wanna do this??

878
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,520
Even though these rules being so strict, is there anyone who would take this trip?

879
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,750
Has anyone ever saved up for the trip to a foreign country?

880
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,750
What is this...

881
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,670
Yeah, there have been a few

882
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:31,240
I've tagged along to places like Hong Kong, Hawaii, and Paris.

883
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:36,400
There have been 10 people so far that have earned this trip.

884
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,850
By the way, of the customers currently in the maid cafe today

885
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,970
How many points have they saved so far?

886
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,420
We asked them to let us see their cards

887
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,200
Noooo....

888
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,890
308 points

889
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,880
I see

890
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,730
With a cost of 150,000 yen

891
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,490
he's saved up over 300 points

892
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:00,740
What can you get now that you've saved 300 points?

893
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,910
I can go on a lunch date

894
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:06,740
together with a maid to a store I like.

895
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,470
What do you think? Are you gonna do it?

896
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:11,350
I was thinking about it before, but now I'm reconsidering

897
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:15,400
Because I can go to several places if I use 500 points.

898
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:14,300
He's so serious

899
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,890
I see, so these 300 points

900
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,520
If I use them once, they'll decrease

901
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,060
How much have you spent so far?

902
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,220
(9 350 USD or 6 650 Pounds)

903
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,220
Close to 1 million yen.

904
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,330
Do you feel satisfied with your purchases?

905
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,770
Very much so

906
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,760
Really?

907
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,680
The cost is high...

908
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,690
They are used to the high price point

909
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,680
but the customers seems satisfied with paying it.

910
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,630
Furthermore, as we continue our investigation,

911
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:47,040
We have discovered a number of genre specific point cards.

912
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,490
To begin with

913
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:54,590
at a West African traditional drumming practice course for "Djembe"

914
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,120
1000 yen is equal to 1 point

915
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,670
Their sensei sure is convincing

916
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,950
If you save 100,000 yen worth of points...

917
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:03,100
You receive a big Djembe drum

918
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,880
However, the course is only once a week

919
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,230
and one lesson is 2000 yen, so it will take 50 weeks to save the points.

920
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:15,970
Which means if you go to every class without skipping a week, it will take 350 days.

921
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,210
In addition, the expiration date on the offer is in 2 years.

922
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,600
A limit...

923
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,370
With this ridiculous setting...

924
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:28,340
...no one has been able to obtain the prize.

925
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,950
You should have the points...

926
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,080
by May of next year right? If you keep saving?

927
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,360
Yeah, if I keep at this rate.

928
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,140
Moving on, our next point card comes from this cemetery

929
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:44,440
Our point card is called "Mairi Point Card". If you go around the cemetery once...

930
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,080
You get 30 points.

931
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,260
"Mairi Point". Combining the names "Mairi" and "Mile"

932
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,260
(To pray)

933
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,690
(Pray mile points)

934
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,690
It comes together to form a hilarious name.

935
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,700
Don't bully them

936
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,760
If you go around the gravesite 40 times...

937
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,130
You can receive flowers worth 1200 yen.

938
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,790
A point card that will truly make your ancestors happy.

939
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:14,230
Others: A candy store which will give a 50 yen off coupon if you come 20 times.

940
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,800
A cycle track and bike store which

941
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,270
will give you a "beckoning cat" if you come 240 times.

942
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,620
Furthermore, a snake cafe

943
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,690
which will let you touch the snakes as much as you want if you come 20 times.

944
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,480
There are many special point cards indeed

945
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,520
And there is one within those that is even more special

946
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,150
Or rather, more like an insane point card

947
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,210
An everyday goods shop in Saitama prefecture, Cosucoji

948
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,210
C-cosu?

949
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,260
In this store, 1000 yen equals 1 point.

950
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,020
And 60,000 yen will allow you to

951
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,080
That's going to be quite difficult

952
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,660
exchange your points for various interesting choices

953
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,180
They've got a decent amount

954
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,480
I have a beard right now right...

955
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,570
There's an option where you can shave my beard

956
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:15,340
Oh really... is that it?

957
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,340
Yup, that's it.

958
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,800
There have been a few people who have done it.

959
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,270
Oh really?

960
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:20,270
Yeah, just a few people.

961
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,990
Ibaragi Dialect Lesson

962
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,960
Have people saved up for this one?

963
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,340
No, not at all

964
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:30,450
No one has exchanged for this option, but you keep it on there?

965
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,450
Yeah, I'm leaving it on there just in case someone does want it, I think it'll be interesting, you know?

966
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,560
Ahahaha

967
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:38,120
A store owner who naturally laughs at his own jokes.

968
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,900
I have a dad

969
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,290
One of the prizes is a life consulting session with my father.

970
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:48,000
He's really an amazing person. Very meticulous.

971
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,600
How many points is that?

972
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,600
Umm

973
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,640
120 points.

974
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,640
120..

975
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,260
Looking at it from the other side, would you take this prize?

976
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,420
Absolutely not.

977
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:03,820
Furthermore, there is the option to do "Ghost Calisthenics" with the owner's mother.

978
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:08,320
Or force the owner to cross dress for a day.

979
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,610
There are many options that make the owner incredibly nervous.

980
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,170
And lastly

981
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,590
An overnight tour of the Asahiyama Zoo.

982
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,750
(84.000 USD or 60.000 Pounds)

983
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,750
It costs 9 million yen

984
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,460
An inconceivable amount, this is a hellish privilege.

985
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,110
This is so stupid...

986
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,220
There you have it

987
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,550
There are plenty of ridiculous point cards,

988
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:33,600
as well as point cards that fall short of success.

989
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,660
That was pretty interesting don't you think?

990
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:38,660
You think so?

991
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,580
Is it ok for the maid cafe to be doing that?

992
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,730
What do you mean?

993
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,650
Legally speaking is that even allowed?

994
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,860
You mean them taking a trip with the customer?

995
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,050
Doesn't it feel like human trafficking?

996
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,650
Human trafficking..

997
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,650
No way...

998
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,930
I wouldn't go that far...

999
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,930
That was too much huh..

1000
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,950
Next week, an "Audience Theory" special!

1001
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:24,890
Check out our Facebook and Website for more Wednesday Downtown! This video was subbed by a community run project called the Wednesday Downtown project. Thanks for watching!

1002
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:24,890
m 0 0  l 1800 0  1800 158  0 158

1003
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:04,640
"Given a single bean every 10 seconds, you can continue eating forever".

1004
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,840
"Being the winner of a race show...

1005
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:09,280
people you don't know will contact you."

1006
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,360
"If you drag someone around with a blindfold, they won't notice that they've returned home"

1007
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,240
Furthermore, "It's better to wash a Panda "

1008
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,520
"Pa-ko is the weakest stare-down player",

1009
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,350
"Small Saving" Theory, and more to investigate next week.
