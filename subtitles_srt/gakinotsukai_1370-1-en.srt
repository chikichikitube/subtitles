1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,440
Appreciation meeting for "The Bus Hijacker Returns" starring Endo!

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,640
Thank you

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,310
Isn't it... a bit cold here?

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,310
I thought the coldness was from the AC

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,310
But it's coming from the screen...

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,510
It's the AC

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,210
The AC

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,580
Should come from here

10
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,630
No way it's from the screen

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,500
Fujiwara Kazuhiro, Imoto Takafumi, Endo Shozo, Tsukitei Hosei, Tanaka Naoki

12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,500
note: from left to right, up to down: Matsumoto Hitoshi, Hamada Masatoshi

13
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,550
The movie is not on yet

14
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,530
It hasn't even started yet!

15
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,550
There's nothing here

16
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,670
No way

17
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,130
After all it's not a lame movie, right?

18
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,630
note: "cold" and "lame" are both "samui" in japanese

19
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,400
Yeah, not lame at all

20
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,660
Oh, is that so

21
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,230
The movie "The Bus Hijacker Returns" starring Endo

22
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,230
Has been released this year (2017) in July!

23
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,630
But there's a certain reason for why this movie was made...

24
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,070
I actually felt like taking part on it

25
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,510
For real?

26
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,340
For real

27
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,270
You know

28
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,710
Before this movie I worked on

29
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,620
Right

30
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,140
A previous project (Busjack)

31
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,140
But it didn't really sell good at all

32
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,980
But we got to joke about it on No-Laughing Prison

33
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,980
Right

34
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:01,530
lower screen: The first solo-movie Endo starred in, "Busjack" was revealed to be the 40805th movie on Amazon DVD popularity ranking

35
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
And its popularity suddenly rose up

36
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,530
It was funny so it got popular, I see

37
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,250
And then the two of you told me

38
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,590
That it would be nice to have a sequel

39
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,590
So it felt like I had to make a "return"

40
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,830
We talked about this on a costume talk

41
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,030
Yes

42
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,030
Yeah, on September, last year

43
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:10,940
lower screen: The day after Downtown stated they would take part on a possible sequel, "The Bus Hijacker Return" 's production was decided

44
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,030
I really thought about taking part in it

45
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,030
On the other hand

46
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,030
Hamada-san was more like

47
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,510
"Enough of that crap"

48
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,540
He's so rude

49
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,270
I haven't said such things

50
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,570
He said something about it being pointless

51
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,240
After all if we are together we're Downtown

52
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,380
Even if we're attending a funeral, we want to act as Downtown

53
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,880
Anyway, it became a big topic on the internet

54
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,780
Just look at this

55
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,590
This is an article from Yahoo news

56
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,460
"Even though it's Endo's movie premiere, the theater seats are empty"

57
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,990
"A resentful complaint from Downtown"

58
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,990
What does it mean?

59
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,700
Now that you've seen this article, take a look

60
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,670
At what Matsumoto recently tweeted

61
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,670
"I'm sorry Endo, my stomach hurts"

62
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,440
What do you mean with that?

63
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,440
Well, first of all I'm feeling sorry for it

64
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,340
The fact is... it was too funny

65
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,840
I thought "why is it funny?" and felt sorry for him

66
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,520
There was also... that guy, Onigiri

67
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,280
Yes

68
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,080
That huge Yoshimoto comedian

69
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,130
He actually paid to go see your movie

70
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,320
And he was like "man, that was really hilarious!"

71
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,960
Really?

72
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,130
Yeah he said it

73
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000
And he was like "Matsumoto-san please go see it!"

74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,600
In the end I didn't go, though...

75
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,370
He invited you

76
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,370
That's weird

77
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,470
Lots of people liked it

78
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,470
Of course

79
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,070
By the way, here's the cast chart

80
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,070
It's just like that

81
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,280
Endo-san plays Noboru Komiya

82
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,280
That's the main role

83
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,710
His colleague is Kurosawa from Morisanchu

84
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,710
Yes

85
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,710
And his younger colleague is Iwao-san

86
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,710
There's also Honkon-san playing

87
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,500
A Yakuza boss

88
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,590
Actually the role

89
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,590
Ozawa-san is playing

90
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,960
Was planned for Matsumoto-san

91
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,460
Oh? Was it not Hamada?

92
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,890
No, it was you Matsumoto-san

93
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,750
The mysterious man is played by Jimmy-san

94
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,750
And this role was supposed to be Hamada's

95
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,750
Why is that?

96
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,140
You are similar comedians

97
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,140
I just agreed to him!

98
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,140
They are similar, yes

99
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,010
If you look it up on the GPS their field of activity

100
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,410
Is pretty much the same

101
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,350
Is it?

102
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,450
By the way, we also have the producer Ohta-san, today

103
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,750
Really!?

104
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,090
Thanks for having me

105
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,370
text: "The Bus Hijacker Returns" 's director: Ohta Masayuki

106
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,320
Nice to meet you

107
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,320
Thanks for coming

108
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
How dare you came here!?

109
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,320
Please don't mind him

110
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,530
It looks like the reviews aren't really praising it

111
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,170
Is that so?

112
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,250
Yeah, it was a flop

113
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,240
Really?

114
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,540
Even after all that motion?

115
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,240
What could the reason be?

116
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,630
I had this conversation with members of the staff too

117
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,830
And they agreed that Endo's acting is kind of...

118
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,620
Are you for real?

119
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,210
Yeah...

120
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,480
Was it my acting?

121
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,120
Was it that bad?

122
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,980
You should have know that from the first movie...

123
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,700
So for example what is it? The acting?

124
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,700
Yes they said it was kinda...

125
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,660
Unskilled

126
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,660
note: "kusai" means "smelly", but it also means "unskilled", "poor" figuratively

127
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,660
Unskilled?

128
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,660
Smelly?

129
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,190
His acting smelled?

130
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,850
I've talked about this

131
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,300
To Ohta-san too

132
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,630
Yes

133
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,730
As you watch the movie and you think Endo's acting is unskilled

134
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,870
You can press the "that smells!" button under your hand

135
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,870
You can press it every time

136
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,680
If they feel like Endo's performance is "smelly", they'll push the button

137
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,680
Screening Rules

138
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,680
When the movie ends, the number of "it smells" will be counted

139
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,480
You think his acting is poor

140
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,180
We're going to watch it that way?

141
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,410
I mean, the whole "it smells" thing

142
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,410
That's what the producer said!

143
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,800
You sure it's okay? It's not a good thing

144
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,800
Nah it's okay

145
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,520
Is it ok?

146
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,460
It's ok...?

147
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,820
It's fine, it's fine

148

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,440
This is something

153
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,570
Aren't we too close?     - Yeah

154
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,180
note: on their button / button sound "kusa-" ("it stinks" / "it sucks")

155
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
What's going on!?

156
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,330
Quick

157
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,080
He made someone angry

158
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,080
Nothing happened yet

159
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,250
How can there be a bus tour
guide who suffers car sickness?!

160
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,530
I'm terribly sorry

161
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,050
Which was your plan this time, huh?

162
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,990
It's Asakusa Mystery Tours

163
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,630
"Approaching Shitamachi's Mysteries"

164
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,360
What is that? Asakusa Mystery Tours?

165
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,560
You're part of the route

166
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,560
That's the problem!

167
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,670
That happened just before!

168
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,770
I'm sorry

169
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,440
You're too quick...

170
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,310
You're ruining everything, everything!

171
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,310
Is it that bad?

172
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,340
It sucks

173
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,570
It's really high-paced

174
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,570
Your acting as you're being scolded sucks

175
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,570
Aren't you exaggerating?

176
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,120
That...

177
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,020
You better get rid of that frown you're making!

178
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,590
No sorry it's that my tooth hurts

179
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,530
Go to a dentist then!!

180
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,530
[movie] I did but I---

181
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,390
This is actually linked to the first movie

182
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,390
His tooth hurts only here

183
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,560
[movie] I couldn't fix it!

184
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Komiya, I'm done with you

185
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,400
Komiya...

186
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,560
You're fired

187
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,900
No way!

188
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,170
No, president!

189
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,570
Can't you just give him one last chance?

190
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,910
He'd only make more mistakes

191
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,150
It's fine, I say!

192
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,710
You can show him, right Komiya-san?

193
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,750
...Mh-mh

194
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,350
Please, president Yamai!

195
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,120
Was it my "mh-mh" just now?

196
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,120
Alright

197
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,120
President!

198
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
But this really is your last chance

199
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,890
Fail this one and you're fired

200
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,890
Why that?

201
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,890
Kurosawa is pretty good!

202
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,460
Yeah she's good

203
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,530
Come on, Hanako-chan

204
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,270
It's fine, really

205
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,400
But you're always...

206
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Doing so much for me

207
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,370
If you weren't there I'd be fired everyday!

208
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,950
Damn guys... your pace for pressing the "it sucks" button sure is fast!

209
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,980
I think the next tour plan is perfect for you, Komiya-san

210
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,800
Which plan is it?

211
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,800
It's about having the passengers

212
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,930
Escape from an hijacked bus!

213
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,090
Huh? Is that...?

214
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,090
Yes... It's Busjack!!

215
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,900
"THE BUS HIJACKER RETURNS"

216
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,670
Right from the beginning...

217
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,480
Excuse me, this time--

218
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,480
By the way, that guy is Suga-san's son

219
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,480
Suga Kenji

220
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
They look alike!

221
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
You're right

222
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,750
It won't be a windy day

223
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,750
It's the transmitter

224
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,750
Man, it's him

225
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,750
Few days ago it started acting up

226
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,390
They look a lot alike

227
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,390
Yeah they really look the same

228
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,390
Oh, that seems like it

229
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,530
His nose is the exact same as Suga's

230
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:14,120
Isn't the bus just acting weird?

231
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,960
You can't be sure about it

232
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,270
Huh?

233
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,500
He doesn't suck at all

234
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,900
He's going to aim at the next bus with passengers

235
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,900
I'm talking about Sanada-san

236
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,640
...Sanada-san?

237
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Yes, this person

238
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,750
It's just a picture

239
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,250
He's an international terrorist

240
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,750
Isn't that helping too much?

241
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,750
So, it's a heat-induced bomb

242
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,790
Mainly made of RDX

243
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,360
Did that one really suck?

244
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,430
So... what I should do

245
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,100
Is to hijack... that bus!

246
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,430
It stinks (kusai) even with the air freshener

247
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,100
It's really there

248
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,100
The air freshener...

249
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,910
I'll hijack that bus

250
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,110
His smelly acting doesn't want to lose to the air freshener

251
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,110
But he's not really a bus hijacker, right?

252
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,780
Yes, it's just his role

253
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,380
Oh, I see--- oh, here he is

254
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,350
This guy was supposed to be Matsumoto-san

255
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,060
Would have been good

256
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,060
Ya have somethin' to say?

257
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,100
N-no, I don't, I-I'm sorry!

258
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,170
We all pressed it

259
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,400
This one should have been Hamada-san

260
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,400
We had a similar scene

261
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,670
Yes, I see

262
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,710
I'm sorry

263
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,140
My contacts--!

264
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,340
What's wrong?

265
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,140
My contacts!

266
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,380
Jimmy is 100% ad-lib on this

267
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:39,990
Is that so?

268
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,780
Yes     - Wow

269
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,780
You're too close

270
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,290
I'll take care of it

271
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,290
Sorry

272
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,820
Wait here!

273
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,160
Bro! Over there!

274
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,930
Huh?

275
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,490
Excuse me

276
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,630
Yes?

277
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,800
Are you Sanada-san?

278
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,330
Ohh... you're the guys from the job?

279
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,570
...Yes?

280
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,570
You've been employed

281
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,810
To help me, right?

282
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,810
Yeah, that's it

283
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,810
Alright, there's no time:

284
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,980
Let's hurry!

285
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,510
Got it!

286
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,950
Guys from the job...?

287
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,650
I'm just walking...

288
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,020
[movie] Sorry I'm late

289
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,020
I'm glad you made it in time

290
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,520
Huh?

291
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
I've never seen that tour guide before...

292
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,520
Komiya-san sure is late...

293
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,520
This bus is the one

294
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,900
This one?

295
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,470
I should have actually got in

296
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,800
Yes

297
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,040
This is a Hagihara bus

298
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,470
I see, misunderstandings

299
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,040
Yes

300
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,370
This is a Ogiwara bus ticket, right?

301
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,720
note: Hagihara (萩原) and Ogiwara (荻原) are written with 2 similar kanjis (萩 & 荻)

302
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,670
The other tour is the "Love Mystery Tour"

303
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,670
Lots of people usually get it wrong

304
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,110
Komiya, our protagonist,

305
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,610
Ends up boarding the wrong bus

306
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,610
I don't have the ticket, can I pay in cash?

307
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,890
The passengers board holding various expectations

308
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,890
And then the bus departs

309
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,890
Alright then, it's going to be a short time

310
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,830
But I'd like to have you share it by introducing yourselves

311
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,830
You over there, if you please

312
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,270
Uh... err... name's Kaneko--

313
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,940
W-woah! Look, bro!

314
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,810
What the-?

315
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,810
Sanada-san! It's Sanada-san!

316
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,010
What's wrong?

317
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,210
How is he looking?

318
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,210
His face-...

319
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,650
Shall we begin?

320
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,950
Huh?

321
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,650
I think he said we should begin

322
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,650
The hell is that, really

323
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,650
This really sucks

324
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,520
Don't move!

325
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,520
Oh, here we are! It's starting

326
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,400
We're here

327
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,400
Stay still

328
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Starting from now

329
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,830
I'm hijacking this bus!

330
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,600
What is-

331
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,700
Don't move!

332
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,700
This is bad

333
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
I'm gonna kill you if you move!

334
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,200
Busjack?!

335
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,930
He's acting accordingly to a memorized script, that's the setting

336
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,570
Yes

337
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,180
I see...

338
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,410
So it's like a play within the play

339
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,010
Exactly

340
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,780
If you move even an inch away from me...

341
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,620
I'll make the whole bus blow away!

342
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,190
Joichi...

343
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,190
Don't try to get

344
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,960
Maruo Sanada mad

345
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,530
You have no idea what he could be thinking

346
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,760
When the moment arrives...

347
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
He'll use the bomb you've made...

348
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,470
And boom

349
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,470
It's not supposed to be a funny scene

350
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,840
Seriously, it's not supposed to be funny

351
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
And just as we-

352
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,140
His expression is so unnatural!

353
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,470
It feels like he's putting that on for the occasion

354
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:26,210
Got it? Don't you dare provocate him

355
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,550
He became Joji Shimaki

356
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,550
note: actor & comedian

357
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,550
Don't ever try to

358
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,550
Excuse me

359
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,720
What?

360
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,160
Is it true you've placed a bomb on the bus?

361
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
It's true

362
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,160
Which type of bomb is it?

363
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,160
Type of bomb..?

364
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,160
Nishiyama-kun...

365
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,160
It has been bugging me since before...

366
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,710
But doesn't the face of that man seem familiar?

367
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,610
Huh?

368
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,540
I mean... doesn't he look like that terrorist named Sanada

369
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,150
Gono-san showed us before?

370
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,480
H-he's real! That man is a real terrorist!

371
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,250
Wha-!?

372
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,250
The one behind that incident in Kansai...

373
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,390
Are you for real?

374
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,660
A terrorist?

375
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,860
I never thought I'd meet the real deal

376
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,860
Come on, even there?

377
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,570
Komiya gets mistaken for a real bus hijacker from everyone

378
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,570
And the story moves on

379
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,430
Got it? You just have to do what you're told to

380
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,900
Your purpose? What is it?

381
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,210
You'll get to know it soon

382
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,110
He's balding up

383
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,450
Here comes!

384
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,120
Be sure to act like a policeman!

385
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,960
Hello?

386
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,960
Is this the police?

387
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,790
Is that you Sanada?

388
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,440
Itsyouisntit?

389
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,360
What?!

390
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,230
And you're...?

391
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,470
"Itsyouisntit"

392
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,800
I'm the police superintendent Yanagita

393
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,800
It should have been "It's you, isn't it?"

394
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,240
Itsyouisntit~

395
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,200
This time it's up to me

396
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,210
To deal with the negotiations

397
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,080
Is that so? Glad to hear that

398
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,410
Bro! It's the police!

399
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,950
What the hell is he thinking?!

400
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,950
Come on! I wasn't even facing the camera!

401
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,950
I've taken control of this bus as I planned

402
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,490
There's a bomb set on it

403
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,490
And I have all their lives

404
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,620
Come on

405
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,620
In my own hands

406
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,400
Stop with this foolish act! Release them at once!

407
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,200
I'm really hating this "it sucks" SFX!

408
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,930
Enough!

409
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,830
The passengers...

410
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,640
They're safe, aren't they?

411
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,640
They surely are

412
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,740
At least for now

413
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,070
Was that combo really necessary?

414
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,180
After the break, a rapid development! Repeating "it sucks"!

415
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,750
It really started to suck bad when ??? kicked in

416
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,090
Hey!!

417
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,790
What the-!

418
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,470
Piece of shit!

419
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,400
Don't move!

420
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,340
And keep on driving this thing!

421
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,710
What the...?

422
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,640
Bro!!

423
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,270
Are you ok?

424
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,000
It really started to suck bad when the tension kicked in

425
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,320
Yeah, that's the tension scene

426
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,320
I see that

427
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
That's a new level of smelliness

428
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
You got that wrong

429
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,490
I'm not a policeman

430
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,490
I'm the same as you

431
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,490
The same?

432
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,490
What's going on?

433
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,490
The same? You mean...

434
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,490
A bus hijacker?!

435
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,490
Sanada-san

436
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,490
Yes?

437
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,260
I never thought I'd be able to meet you

438
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,530
Huh?

439
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,620
You didn't check my body and I got away with it

440
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,470
You got away?

441
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,870
I'm talking about this

442
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,420
I-is that!?

443
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,450
There's another bus hijacker aboard!

444
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
The real bus hijacker appears

445
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,390
And the real trouble starts for Komiya

446
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,560
Just stop this, Gono-san

447
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,860
Whaddya want?

448
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,760
Why are you doing this?

449
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,640
You're not someone who'd do such things!

450
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,270
Come on, I'm just there

451
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,340
That sucks too?

452
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
What are you talking about?

453
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,810
What do you know about me?

454
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,810
I just do!

455
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,810
Matsumoto-san I'm just--

456
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,580
'Cause I've taken part in a bus tour

457
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,100
You've been doing before!

458
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,650
I'm just standing there! Does that suck too?

459
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,220
I...

460
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,590
I'm just popping out from the left background, how can that suck?

461
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,760
When I first took part on a tour like this

462
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,590
That's 'cause you're on screen

463
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,190
I wasn't the only one who was left alone

464
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,890
He has already given up

465
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,760
And I really felt so down

466
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,760
He's hiding behind her ribbon

467
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,060
But then you, the tour guide...

468
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,190
Thinking about it, I've heard it before...

469
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,340
Someone here got fired because he caused a problem...

470
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,340
A problem?

471
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,340
That's not like it

472
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,900
I was blamed for something I didn't do

473
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,000
And was forced to leave my job against my will!

474
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In the end it was all for nothing

475
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,920
There's no way you can possibly know how I feel!

476
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,920
I do

477
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,490
That felt weird even for me

478
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,490
I feel you

479
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,490
I know how it feels

480
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,860
When nothing goes well

481
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,860
No matter what you do

482
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,560
It's the same for me!

483
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,700
For you? Sanada-san?

484
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,410
But see...

485
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,640
What you're doing is wrong

486
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,340
Huh?

487
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,340
Things that don't go well...

488
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,340
Or things which don't make any sense...

489
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,480
I know they exist, but that's wrong!

490
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,480
I want to stop you

491
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
Before you commit a crime!

492
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,720
With Komiya's desperate persuasion

493
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,230
The bus hijacker gives up on his plan

494
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,330
What about you?

495
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,600
Huh?

496
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,400
Aren't there people grieving for you out there?

497
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,740
Huh? Wha-

498
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,680
She's the heroine

499
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,150
Is he in love?

500
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,010
She's the real heroine

501
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,980
Yeah she kinda likes him

502
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
I've always

503
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,980
#@"%!£$€*\=!

504
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,700
%§°#;&%!\)=

505
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,900
I can't hear anything at all!!

506
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,700
With all this button sounds

507
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,320
This is the good part!

508
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,320
Is that so? Ok ok

509
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,530
At least hear the lines

510
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,390
Look at his shoulders

511
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,390
Yes... more than anyone

512
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,390
Even my shoulders now?

513
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,390
How can my shoulders be a problem?

514
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,390
Komiya-kun...

515
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,040
I see, they're hearing him

516
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,390
Yes, that's right

517
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,510
These people

518
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,510
Gave me a chance

519
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,110
That's why

520
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,110
I had to do this hijack thing

521
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,780
Because I respect them

522
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,680
Is he judging them?

523
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,850
I have to do this!

524
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,850
No no, listen

525
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,920
We're almost there

526
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,130
Sit down

527
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:39,800
Alright

528
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,850
Drive us back from where we set off

529
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,850
Ok, count on me!

530
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,150
Isn't that...?

531
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,030
Huh?

532
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,570
Oh, he's here, he's here!

533
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,940
What is...?

534
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,340
Get away

535
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,710
Kashira!

536
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,810
Boss?

537
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,810
I got your call

538
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,810
What a great surprise

539
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,460
...Or is it?

540
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,110
Joichi...

541
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,530
This man is not Sanada

542
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,530
What?

543
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,530
I made a mistake

544
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,530
The current Sanada

545
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,370
Got a plastic surgery and changed his face

546
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,910
Here's a picture of him

547
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,350
I'm astonished

548
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,380
Who the hell are you?

549
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,050
I am... Sanada!

550
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:47,750
Don't fuck with me!

551
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,050
Don't fuck with me!

552
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,490
I am Sanada

553
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,830
I know you're not him!

554
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,330
I am...

555
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,330
Whatcha tryna say!?

556
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,600
Why are ya trying to act like one of us?

557
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,800
Stop! Please stop it

558
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,800
That's enough

559
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,150
Calm down

560
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,140
You-- are you trying to boss me around?

561
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,350
Shige!

562
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,350
Quit it

563
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,550
He's just a public safety employee

564
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,080
As long as there's a criminal

565
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
I can't just let it go by

566
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,750
That's just it

567
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,750
Shige...

568
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,690
#@&£%!=§

569
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,690
I can't hear a single line!

570
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,700
Coming after, it's finally time for the climax!

571
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,280
Man, that was my last chance...

572
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,280
And I've failed

573
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
We're almost there

574
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,280
Don't say that

575
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,280
Isn't that right guys?

576
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,390
It was the best thrilling tour

577
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,020
We've ever experienced!

578
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,320
But...

579
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
Well, I had fun!

580
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,560
We could experience something unusual!

581
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,400
And that's all thanks to Komiya-san

582
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,160
You guys...

583
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,400
It's not over yet

584
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,710
All of you... thank you!

585
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,610
Hey, no need to

586
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,830
That's not really yakuza!

587
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,050
Listen to me: I am Sanada

588
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,190
Come on

589
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,190
I'm about to change my plan

590
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,160
Which is now to release

591
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,340
All of my hostages!

592
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,640
You're free, everybody!

593
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,000
They're pressing it accordingly to the clapping

594
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,680
Your friends are here!

595
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,110
Eh?

596
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,250
Please go, Komiya-san

597
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,630
What the hell is this?

598
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,820
Man, this is amazing

599
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,300
So in the end Kurosawa..?

600
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Yeah, he can reach her

601
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
This is incredible

602
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,500
Hanako-chan!

603
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,450
How was it?

604
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,450
I did the bus hijacking tour

605
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,490
You did?

606
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,490
And I was able to save everyone

607
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,680
All thanks to you

608
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,720
You did it with your own strength

609
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,720
That's because you were there

610
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,450
Until the very end

611
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,170
@#%&)(\-

612
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,990
I can't hear a goddamn line

613
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,530
It's way too noisy in here

614
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,200
This is the last part, I promise, it's almost over

615
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Aaaaaaaah!!

616
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,600
What's wrong Yanagita-kun?

617
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,400
Is something wrong?

618
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,350
Look at that

619
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,350
...What does it mean?

620
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,060
It's over now, we're done

621
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,090
As long as you're on screen

622
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,400
You press it even if only my name is showing?

623
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,470
Come on!

624
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,500
Next: total of pressed buttons & a word from Endo!

625
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,470
Matsumoto-san, opinions?

626
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,700
I think that everyone around him

627
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,510
Seem to have given their best at it

628
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,510
I think that

629
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,900
Doesn't really apply to Endo or Honkon-san, though

630
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,050
To be honest I couldn't hear a single line from Honkon-san

631
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,050
He was on screen too much

632
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,990
Too much?

633
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,320
He sucked pretty hard

634
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,090
Now it's finally time to find out

635
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,230
How many times you've pressed the "it sucks" button

636
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,530
Let's show the results

637
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,260
Here

638
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,430
Your summed up total counts 2278 times

639
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,170
Housei-san pressed it the most

640
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,970
I really enjoyed this, to be honest

641
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,770
I'd love to have an "it sucks" button like that in theaters

642
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,080
It would be something new, I think so too

643
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,700
I agree, it's great

644
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,880
Have this, Endo

645
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,320
Sorry, and thanks

646
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,320
Is that..?

647
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
A promotion from our protagonist Endo

648
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,320
It will be nice if you promote it

649
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,960
Like, talking about why it's worth watching

650
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,790
Yeah, really... everybody, we gave our best to film this

651
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,790
And worked for three days straight

652
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Translation & Notes by Shion

653
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,530
And we got it screened on theaters too

654
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000

661
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,750
Which was this movie's signature phrase?

662
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,750
When I recognize my role as Sanada

663
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,910
Even though I'm Komiya and I've been mistaken

664
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,190
After everyone realizes that, I say "I'll lead this bus"

665
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,630
Was that part there?

666
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,600
Of course it was

667
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,700
You were just pressing too much

668
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,300
You didn't even notice

669
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,200
There was, I promise

670
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
We were too shocked
