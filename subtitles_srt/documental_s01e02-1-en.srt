1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,800
THIS PROGRAM IS THE RECORD
OF A "BATTLE" AMONGST COMEDIANS.

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,760
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE QUALITY,
IT IS MOSTLY UNEDITED.

3
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,430
AS SUCH, VIEWERS MAY ENCOUNTER
EXPLICIT CONTENT.

4
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,560
Comedians usually take turns at making an
audience laugh within a given time frame.

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,770
But on this show,
10 comedians are confined to one room.

6
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,270
They have to make the other nine laugh.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,640
But they have to do it
without laughing themselves.

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,930
This might actually be the simplest way

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,770
and the best way to decide who truly is

10
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,140
the funniest person.

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,330
I must admit,
this is sort of an experiment.

12
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,430
I brought 18 robot model kits.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,040
Another thing is,

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,700
I do the TV show You Mustn't Laugh
at the end of each year.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,900
It's become a highly entertaining show
for all ages.

16
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,030
That's great, but it can be limiting.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,600
This sucks!

18
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,000
I wanted to get rid of all the shackles.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,800
There are moments when you laugh,
even though nothing special has happened.

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,530
I've been wanting to create something
based on that for several years.

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,530
There is a six-hour time limit.

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,140
-One man wins.
-We won't need six hours.

23
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,840
No need for six hours, right?

24
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,160
THE ENTRY FEE IS ONE MILLION YEN

25
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,870
THEY MUST MAKE THE OTHERS LAUGH
FOR A 10 MILLION YEN REWARD

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,700
Is this for real?

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,340
You can do whatever you want.

28
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,030
The funniest person wins.

29
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,600
You have six hours.

30
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,040
-It may seem long, or the time may fly.
-I'm scared.

31
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,470
For the next six hours,
good luck to you all!

32
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,170
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Kyojin, from All Hanshin.

33
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,470
-No, you're not.
-I'm Kyojin.

34
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,040
Jimmy?

35
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,600
-You're Kyojin?
-Yes.

36
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,300
Pretty much everyone laughed.

37
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,340
I didn't laugh.

38
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,460
They're mother and child.

39
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,600
Are you hungry?

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,640
Yellow card.

41
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,500
-Yellow?
-You only get a yellow card for that?

42
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,600
I'm not sitting next to Daisuke.
He makes me laugh.

43
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,370
-You make me laugh, too.
-That's not fair.

44
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,640
-We're on.
-We are.

45
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,530
They're mother and child.

46
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,300
Are you hungry?

47
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,470
-That's for the parent.
-This one is the mommy.

48
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,700
-I thought so.
-Why is your pinky bent like that?

49
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,370
Mommy has the flu,
so she can't feed the baby.

50
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,430
He's crazy.

51
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,700
He's scary.

52
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,540
-Mommy has the flu--
-What?

53
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,330
Can you please be quiet?

54
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,330
It's tough not to laugh at this.

55
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,500
-He's crazy from the get-go.
-One, two...

56
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,940
Stop it.

57
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,360
Ouch!

58
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,530
What the hell are you doing?

59
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,670
I just wanted you to be quiet.

60
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,530
What did you use?

61
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,570
That hurt!

62
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,000
Did you throw fire at me?

63
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,970
That was really hot.

64
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,840
-He hit him with fire.
-Apparently so.

65
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,330
-It felt like fire.
-Show us your back.

66
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,600
Take a look.

67
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,370
Am I okay?

68
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,030
What's with those muscles?

69
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,400
Your back is gross.

70
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,470
Gross.

71
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,800
-He has old man skin.
-He's full of holes.

72
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,900
-The fire must have done it.
-The fire!

73
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,060
-Fire holes.
-Sorry.

74
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,430
Don't throw fire at me.

75
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,070
It wasn't fire. Sorry.

76
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,200
Anyway...

77
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,240
Look at my cans.

78
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,560
It's too early for that.

79
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,700
-Can I do my can thing first?
-We still have five hours to go.

80
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,200
Please wait.

81
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,470
-One can...
-Five hours?

82
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,870
Two cans.

83
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,560
Three cans.

84
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,000
Four cans.

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,270
Five cans.

86
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,700
Six cans.

87
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,770
-Watch him.
-Yeah, watch!

88
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,200
Damn, now I have to recount.

89
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,100
One can, two cans, three cans, four cans,

90
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,040
five cans, six cans, seven cans,

91
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,660
eight cans,

92
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,970
nine cans.

93
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,270
-There is nothing in this bag.
-Okay.

94
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,940
-Nine cans.
-Okay.

95
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,600
The ninth edition of The Shincho Weekly
has been canned.

96
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,370
I don't feel any pressure.

97
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,740
I don't have to worry whether my jokes
work or not, because this time,

98
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,670
nobody's supposed to laugh.

99
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,300
If they laugh, they lose.

100
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,800
With a rule like that,

101
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,000
I can do whatever I want,
with no pressure at all.

102
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm going to perform a bunch of new gags.

103
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,100
What was that just now?

104
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,500
They didn't print it. Nine was canned.

105
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,470
Number "nine" went in the "can"?
It was a pun.

106
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,670
It wasn't funny at all.

107
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,300
I thought it was pretty good.

108
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Pretty good? Thanks.

109
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,500
I still don't get it.

110
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,670
-Was it from the radio?
-What?

111
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,970
Was it played on the radio?

112
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,670
-Yeah. Um...
-On the radio? For The Shincho Weekly?

113
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,930
I threw in an impression
of The Shincho Weekly ad.

114
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,430
You can do impressions
of The Shincho Weekly?

115
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,200
Yeah.

116
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,200
The ninth edition of The Shincho Weekly
has been canned.

117
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,000
It should be higher.
The ad was spoken by a kid.

118
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,000
Try doing it at a higher pitch.

119
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,530
-The Shincho Weekly is...
-Pinch your nose.

120
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,930
The Shincho Squeaky is...

121
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,240
You said "Squeaky." It's "Weekly."

122
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,360
-He's good at it.
-You do it.

123
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,660
-The Shincho Weekly...
-It has to be higher.

124
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,070
Pinch your nose!

125
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,770
The Shincho Weekly...

126
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,200
Your voice is too low!

127
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,740
The Shincho Weekly...

128
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,700
-It's way too low!
-I've never even heard the original.

129
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,770
-Way too low!
-Why are you mad?

130
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,000
-I'm gonna kill him.
-Why?

131
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,270
Snuff him. Seriously.

132
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,600
But I'm scared. I think he knows capoeira.

133
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,730
Don't fight.

134
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,770
-Stop it.
-Know any moves?

135
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,500
Have some candy.

136
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,070
-Do I know any moves?
-Have some candy.

137
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,300
Shall I do one?

138
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,830
Can I do it to you?

139
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,000
Why? No. You're scaring me.

140
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,970
-Don't be violent.
-He's scary.

141
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,940
-I'm scared. Isn't he scary?
-I think you should do it.

142
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,100
-You said--
-Kubota, you do it.

143
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,000
-You said you'd kill me.
-Kubota, you do it.

144
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,930
You said you were gonna kill me.

145
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,930
I am seriously scared of him.

146
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,070
-That's what you said.
-You're turning this place into a slum.

147
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,260
-Then let me do my move.
-You are scary.

148
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,530
It's scary now.

149
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,600
-Just let me do one move.
-Let him.

150
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,770
-Let him do it.
-It won't hurt much--

151
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,940
-Of course it will!
-No, it won't hurt.

152
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,830
-Let's do it.
-Take it like a man.

153
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,730
No way.

154
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,570
-All you have to do is stand still.
-I said I'm scared.

155
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,300
Just let him do it once.

156
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,040
Let him do it to you!

157
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,530
-Well, that's it. Go for it.
-Why me?

158
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,530
Why me?

159
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,240
You take it!

160
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,130
-I guess you're the one.
-Let's decide by rock-paper-scissors.

161
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,600
-You and Jimmy do rock-paper-scissors.
-Why me?

162
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,340
-With Jimmy?
-It has nothing to do with me.

163
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,160
Jimmy, let's do rock-paper-scissors.

164
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,860
-That's not right.
-I know what you mean.

165
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,900
Do the "look that way" version.

166
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,970
-This isn't right.
-"Look that way."

167
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,270
This isn't right.

168
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,200
You don't need these.

169
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,240
They calm me down.

170
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,570
Who cares?

171
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,030
-No, no, no.
-Uh-oh.

172
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,400
-He's totally laughing.
-He self-destructed.

173
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,900
He's laughing hard.

174
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,570
-He can't stop laughing.
-Okay!

175
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,560
Saito was laughing, too.

176
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,500
Jimmy's out, but Saito is, too.

177
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,570
-You definitely laughed.
-Absolutely.

178
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,990
I want you guys to hide Daisuke's face.
His face makes me laugh.

179
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,000
-That's my line.
-Who's out?

180
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,100
Wait. It should be a yellow card.
Daisuke's face is...

181
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,400
This time,

182
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,930
it's not only one person.

183
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,470
The first person is...

184
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,670
Jimmy.

185
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,270
-No doubt about it.
-I admit it.

186
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,940
-He knows.
-I admit it.

187
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,140
And also,

188
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,830
-Saito.
-No way. I wasn't laughing.

189
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,330
-I didn't laugh.
-Saito laughed, too.

190
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,130
-I didn't.
-Saito, too?

191
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,300
I didn't laugh.

192
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,300
-And...
-What? There's more?

193
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,030
Fujimoto!

194
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,670
-These three laughed.
-They definitely laughed.

195
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,230
Let's check to make sure.

196
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,330
But I didn't laugh.

197
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,870
Firstly, we have Jimmy.

198
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,460
-I laughed.
-You know it, right?

199
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,700
Let's watch it.

200
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,630
But I didn't laugh.

201
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,200
But you were kind of smiling.

202
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,400
-Look.
-That's a smile.

203
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,000
-He's laughing.
-He is.

204
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,900
That's not laughing.

205
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,370
He's laughing!

206
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,540
He's laughing, right? Right there.

207
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,000
-And Saito.
-I really wasn't laughing.

208
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,830
Let's watch. Saito was laughing, too.

209
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,000
But it may have been after the buzzer.

210
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,560
No, no. Don't get me wrong!

211
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,930
I thought I could laugh,
because Jimmy had already laughed.

212
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,500
That's not the point.

213
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,400
-I only laughed because Jimmy laughed.
-That doesn't make it okay for you.

214
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,300
But...

215
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,600
Those three get a yellow card.

216
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,770
-But that's not fair.
-You're right.

217
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,860
Then how about Kukky?

218
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,230
I might have missed him.

219
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,430
It was before Jimmy pointed his finger.

220
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,270
If Mr. Matsumoto didn't see it,
then that's that.

221
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,130
Well, I guess so. I am the judge.

222
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,970
I want you to stop attacking me.

223
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,900
-We're not attacking you.
-You're attacking everyone.

224
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,940
Everyone.

225
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,300
He hadn't even finished the set up
to his gag.

226
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,930
-You guys attacked me first.
-No, we didn't.

227
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,640
And Daisuke, I think you're using
the water bottle to hide your laugh.

228
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
-No, I'm not.
-Who drinks that much water?

229
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,560
Watch him carefully!

230
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,930
I'm thirsty.

231
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,200
-Seriously.
-Okay. Then drink it all at once.

232
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,970
I can't. It's carbonated.
I won't be able to hold it in.

233
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,660
-He's a cheater.
-That's not good.

234
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,560
-I heard him chuckling.
-I didn't chuckle.

235
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,630
-You were.
-You kept cracking up.

236
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,500
What about him?

237
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,730
He's drinking wine all the time.
His mouth is always on the wine bottle.

238
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,160
-He's setting up a joke with that, right?
-No, I'm not.

239
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,100
You're not?

240
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,730
-Then stop it.
-He really does like wine.

241
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,640
Please watch everyone carefully,
Mr. Matsumoto!

242
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,460
I am, but it's hard to watch
all 10 of you.

243
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,330
But I promise I will keep an eye on Kukky.

244
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,900
-You should've got a yellow card, too.
-Sorry.

245
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,070
-Why don't you pick up where you left off?
-Fujimoto, can I?

246
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,530
-Oh, that's right.
-You should do it.

247
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,330
Fujimoto, don't run from it.

248
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,700
Seriously, no.

249
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,900
-I said no!
-What exactly will you do?

250
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,240
-A move...
-Are you crazy?

251
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,890
We don't need any moves!

252
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,830
He is so annoying.

253
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,530
-Let him do it once.
-That's a good idea.

254
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,940
-Will it hurt?
-It won't.

255
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,770
-Really?
-He said it won't hurt.

256
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,300
Then why do it?
I don't want to pretend it hurts.

257
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,700
How about someone else?

258
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,800
You talk too much. You do it.

259
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,970
I talk...

260
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,270
You talk too much. You do it.

261
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,200
-I wasn't talking.
-He wasn't.

262
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,600
He hasn't talked
since he got the yellow card.

263
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,370
-You're right.
-That's dirty.

264
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,740
-He's a coward.
-Do it, Ohchi.

265
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,130
-Anthony, try it on Ohchi.
-May I?

266
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,860
-No.
-Do it.

267
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,400
-Will it hurt?
-No, it won't.

268
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,500
Can I have you face the front?

269
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,800
-Put your right hand here.
-On his hip?

270
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,200
Spread your legs and look down.

271
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,200
I mean, stand up straight,
but point your head down.

272
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,370
Look forward...

273
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,400
-Jimmy, stop that.
-Seriously.

274
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,230
Watch them.

275
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,800
Hello.

276
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,200
Hello.

277
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,070
-He's laughing.
-Anthony, don't let up.

278
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,970
-Go all the way.
-He's laughing.

279
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,700
-Do more, Anthony.
-He's out.

280
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,600
-Attack more.
-I didn't laugh.

281
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,270
I did this. I just clenched my muscles.

282
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,570
-Can I do it to Fujimoto now?
-Fujimoto.

283
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,440
-Fujimoto.
-Fujimoto.

284
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,600
Can I do the same to you?

285
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,100
He is your junior colleague after all.

286
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,000
You do it.

287
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,030
-Poor guy.
-Let's not resort to violence.

288
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,530
-What was that for?
-Stop it.

289
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,000
-He shouldn't tell his senior what to do.
-But he doesn't have any hair.

290
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,000
-That hurt.
-I'll give you my hair.

291
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,970
-Jimmy's giving it to you.
-Thanks.

292
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,260
-This is yours.
-Lucky you.

293
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,130
You dropped your candy.

294
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,070
Oh, my candy, sorry.

295
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,730
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

296
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,300
His hair is so wet.

297
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,760
Put it on.

298
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,160
-What's up, Saito?
-Saito?

299
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,800
-Let's see Saito first.
-Okay.

300
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,840
Jimmy, look at Saito.

301
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,260
-Wait.
-Jimmy?

302
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,800
Wait a minute.

303
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,930
Oh, no. He's gone.

304
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,970
That's two players down.

305
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,690
Saito laughed.

306
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,130
But that means Saito is...

307
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,330
-Two of them laughed.
-Yeah, two down.

308
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,070
-He tried to hide in the sink.
-He has a yellow card.

309
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,660
Why did you wet your hair?

310
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,730
He tried to hide his laughter.

311
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,970
-That's not fair.
-I was just washing my eyes.

312
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,340
-Were you hiding your laugh?
-No, my eyes hurt.

313
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,560
Why did Saito laugh? What was it?

314
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,260
-He did it to himself.
-But I've only just started.

315
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,400
-He's gone.
-I'm out.

316
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,570
-That was pretty clear.
-They already have yellow cards.

317
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,630
Let's take a look at Saito.

318
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,660
-He laughed.
-But I was...

319
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,300
He laughed, but why?

320
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,870
Because of Jimmy...

321
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,140
I don't get why Saito laughed there.

322
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,860
Jimmy was making a funny face.

323
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,570
Let's take a look at Saito.

324
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,630
-Why did he wet his hair?
-I don't know.

325
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,960
Because Jimmy made a funny face!

326
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,160
Oh, no. He's gone.

327
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,370
No, I was crying.

328
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,630
I was crying!

329
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,400
And what about Ohchi?

330
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,560
I was just--

331
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,700
He definitely cheated.

332
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,270
-I was just clenching my muscles.
-Never do that again.

333
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,060
Hello.

334
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,900
Hello.

335
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
He's laughing.

336
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,400
-Anthony, don't let up. Go all the way.
-He's laughing.

337
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,670
I didn't laugh.

338
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,470
Everyone could tell
that I held it back, right?

339
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,100
-I clenched it in.
-Well, but...

340
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,530
-In Saito's case...
-Wait a minute.

341
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,430
I could tell he was being aggressive.

342
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,970
-He attempted to initiate something.
-I did.

343
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,660
-Because of that,
-Yes?

344
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,030
you get

345
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,030
an orange card.

346
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,140
Is it better than yellow?

347
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,830
He got a yellow card. Now he has this.
The next one means...

348
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,030
Yellow, orange, red is the way it goes?

349
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,800
-This is truly your last chance.
-Last chance.

350
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,640
-He's got bubbles now.
-What are you doing, Jimmy?

351
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,360
Just because you're not in the hot seat.

352
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,730
It's okay to laugh now?

353
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,840
-What are you doing?
-I'm shampooing my hair.

354
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,000
-He's crazy.
-You are really scaring me!

355
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,900
-Seriously, why are you doing that?
-Because my head started feeling hot.

356
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,870
-He was hiding his laughter.
-Really?

357
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,070
No, I didn't.

358
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,060
My head is so hot.

359
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,870
-Jimmy was totally laughing.
-Good luck, guys.

360
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,500
I only washed my head because
my eyes hurt.

361
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,530
I'll wash it off, then.

362
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,060
-No more shampoo, right?
-Do it in the bathroom.

363
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,160
I'll wash it off now.

364
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,170
-Not now.
-Not now, please.

365
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,740
-Don't wash your head in the kitchen.
-We cook food here.

366
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,060
Okay.

367
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,530
He's so dangerous.

368
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,730
Start.

369
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,470
Scary.

370
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,740
Jimmy, go wash your hair.

371
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,800
Daisuke's always drinking something.

372
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,160
Saito, what were you going to do?

373
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,070
Jimmy really is crazy.

374
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,470
Don't make me explain my jokes.

375
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,860
That wig looks good on everyone.
It's probably a good wig.

376
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,400
Do you look good in it?

377
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,230
That's way too high up.

378
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,800
-Yeah.
-Really?

379
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,960
You're scary.

380
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,570
What a lovely bath!

381
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,670
Lovely bath salts.

382
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,900
That iodine felt great.

383
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,860
What did he say?

384
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,260
-You're sopping wet. Dry yourself.
-I will.

385
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,870
Just a moment.

386
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,930
He can't untie the knot.

387
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,990
-I'm so refreshed.
-Your bald spot is showing again.

388
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,430
-That won't absorb any water.
-Not that material.

389
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,530
Not that thing.

390
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,300
-Use the sheep towel.
-This sheep's name is "Sheep."

391
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,060
-"Sheep."
-You're coming on strong.

392
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,300
Too strong.

393
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,160
What's wrong?

394
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,270
Why are you crying?

395
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,240
I got shampoo in my eyes.

396
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,930
Why do you keep walking around?

397
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,400
Where am I going bald?

398
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,840
-Everywhere.
-This bit is nasty.

399
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,070
It's nasty.

400
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,890
Okay, don't look at my bald spot.

401
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,360
And what's this?

402
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,170
-You have a completely bald patch.
-Actually, it's not a bald patch.

403
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,470
It's where I was electrocuted on my head.

404
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,130
-Electrocuted?
-Electrocuted.

405
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,230
Does electrocution cause baldness?
Does it just fall out?

406
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,640
You'll never understand...

407
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,970
I want a look.

408
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,130
Not the pain of electrocution.

409
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,770
Where is it?

410
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,670
It was electricity.

411
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,040
How scary!

412
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,390
I got electrocuted.

413
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,560
This might fix it.

414
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,530
Maybe this will fix your bald spot.

415
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,670
If he hits the exact same spot.

416
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,970
-Shall we try?
-I guess so.

417
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,330
-Everyone go over there.
-As long as it cures me.

418
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,360
-Over there.
-If it will help, sure.

419
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,630
Are you sure?
Consider it a medical treatment.

420
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,900
Medical treatment.

421
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,700
How nice of him to try and fix
your bald spot.

422
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,130
That was hot!

423
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,840
That was hot!

424
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,900
It was hot?

425
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,830
Did he get burned?

426
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,460
That's hot!

427
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,030
-Is my bald spot gone?
-Are you okay?

428
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,240
It's hot.

429
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,760
That can't be right.

430
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,860
It wasn't me. I just said it was hot.

431
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,970
-I didn't laugh.
-I'm sorry.

432
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,000
-I didn't laugh.
-Me, neither.

433
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,840
-Neither did I.
-I didn't laugh.

434
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,730
-What about that rubber band?
-I was just making a funny face.

435
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,130
-To make you guys laugh.
-You twisted your smile.

436
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,930
-That's a yellow card.
-He cheated.

437
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,300
All I did was this.
I thought it would be funny.

438
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,000
I didn't laugh.

439
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,760
Let him decide.

440
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,400
-Daisuke laughed.
-He did.

441
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,970
No, no, no.

442
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,200
-He used that rubber band.
-I didn't.

443
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,540
He used it to stop laughing.

444
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,930
The rubber band said,
"I'm holding back a smile."

445
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,860
No. I made a funny face. Like this.

446
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,670
To be funny.

447
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,640
Yellow card.

448
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,860
-You can't do that.
-That was wrong.

449
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,160
Let's watch it anyway.

450
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,540
That was hot!

451
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,460
He's smiling!

452
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,330
Don't ever try that again!

453
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,800
He was definitely laughing.

454
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,640
Never do that again!

455
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,360
I was trying to be funny.
It was a funny face.

456
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,370
-That should get a red card.
-Red card!

457
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,500
You were totally laughing.

458
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,860
-Never again, okay?
-That wasn't fair, Daisuke.

459
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,770
-It hasn't even been an hour.
-Was it really that funny?

460
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,740
And Ohchi's had a faint smile
the entire time.

461
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,200
Really?

462
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,500
You've had a faint smile the whole time.

463
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,500
-Get outta here.
-Wait.

464
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,130
Are faint smiles out, too?

465
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,570
-Did I have a faint smile?
-The whole time.

466
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,430
-I think we should skip Jimmy for a while.
-Good idea.

467
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,200
-There's sashimi in here.
-What?

468
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,900
-We have sashimi.
-We do.

469
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,300
-Want me to make sushi?
-No, thanks.

470
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,100
-Your hands are dirty.
-Right?

471
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,230
-Your hands are dirty.
-Why would they be dirty?

472
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,430
Stop it.

473
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,570
I just washed my hair.

474
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,170
-Why would they be dirty?
-That's what we mean.

475
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,700
Your head is dirty.

476
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,560
My head's not dirty.
It's been electrocuted.

477
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,530
The electricity disinfected it.

478
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,130
Please, I want you to be quiet.

479
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,270
Jimmy, stop drinking the water.

480
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,890
-Okay.
-You were hiding a smile with the bottle.

481
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,170
Don't drink that, either.

482
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,290
Stop that.

483
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,160
Of course they want him to stop.

484
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,370
You can't tell him too much.
But he really never stops.

485
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,740
Jimmy? That's a bit fishy...

486
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,260
I'm not doing anything.

487
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,600
Don't be short-tempered either.

488
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,500
Can I ask everyone to write
a message here?

489
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,190
It's for Master Daisuke.

490
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,700
Something short.

491
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,430
DEAR DAISUKE
"UFOS DO EXIST"

492
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,330
Saito was close.

493
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,800
-But he's not retiring.
-Apparently he is.

494
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,400
-Why are we writing this?
-Because he's retiring.

495
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,630
-Who is?
-You're lying.

496
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,160
-This dude.
-Master Daisuke?

497
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,070
Don't call the Master a "dude."

498
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,330
Wait, wait, wait.

499
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,870
-I'm not writing anything.
-Why not?

500
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,700
Because it's wrong.
We shouldn't write him a farewell message.

501
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,230
-But Master Daisuke is--
-He's not.

502
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,400
He's retiring.

503
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,770
Why?

504
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,030
You know Junichi Yaoi, the occult expert?
He's doing a special broadcast with him.

505
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,700
He's going to retire after that.

506
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,570
-About UFOs?
-Exactly.

507
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,690
-On a local TV channel?
-What?

508
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,000
Why would Master Daisuke be on local TV?

509
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,300
-It would be with a major network.
-Does that mean...

510
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,600
Will Hanako go solo?

511
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,700
Let's sit down.

512
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,230
-Will Hanako go solo?
-Sit down.

513
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,330
-Wasn't she arrested?
-We need to discuss this.

514
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,170
-She was, but the charges were false.
-They were dropped?

515
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,300
Pet theft, wasn't it?

516
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,200
What's he doing?

517
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,060
You catch, okay?

518
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,430
It's gonna fly.

519
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,630
You catch, okay?

520
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,630
Hanako is that serial killer
who dresses as a clown, isn't she?

521
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,230
That's John Wayne Gacy!

522
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,730
It's gonna fly. Catch it.

523
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,230
It's gonna fly--

524
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,570
Excuse me.

525
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,930
You're distracting us.

526
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,260
-Please.
-What?

527
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,030
What is it?

528
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,540
You want my autograph?

529
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,960
No, we're all writing a short message.

530
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,060
-Could you go first?
-One message each?

531
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,600
I already wrote "UFOs do exist,"
so anything other than that will do.

532
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,430
-We're writing a farewell message?
-We are.

533
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,200
Let me write something.

534
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,070
You made my shirt all dirty.

535
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,530
-I got your fuzz balls.
-You gave them to me.

536
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,330
You're just like Master Daisuke.

537
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,800
Master Daisuke isn't dirty.

538
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,170
Look at my sleeve.
It's like I've got ants.

539
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,340
-From the fuzz balls.
-Like Master Daisuke.

540
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,060
Master Daisuke's sleeves aren't dirty.

541
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,130
-Master Daisuke is...
-He has dirty sleeves.

542
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,700
-His sleeves aren't dirty.
-He had a ton of lint.

543
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,340
-His sleeves are clean.
-The lint's on his skin.

544
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,200
He's dirty around here,
but his sleeves are clean.

545
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,900
"Dai-bou."

546
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,770
That's his nickname.

547
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,540
Does the "bou" in "Dai-bou" mean "priest"?

548
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,030
-It means "gang."
-What a scary name!

549
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,430
-Jimmy, did you write your message?
-Yes.

550
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,930
"Everyone's on the boat."

551
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,300
What does that mean?

552
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,800
"Everyone's on the boat."

553
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,570
What does that mean?

554
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,700
-Did you get permission to do this?
-You'll get in trouble.

555
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,960
No, I didn't.

556
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,700
I'm sure he'll get upset.

557
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,130
I've heard rumors he's not happy
with you, too.

558
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,130
Well, it doesn't matter. He's old.
He doesn't scare me.

559
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,460
I'm going to tell you off on his behalf.

560
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,770
No, don't do that. It's not your business.

561
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,400
It's not your business!
Master Daisuke is powerless anyway!

562
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,360
-He's just got a big face.
-You should tell him off.

563
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,960
-He's like a loose stool.
-Seniors shouldn't fight.

564
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,470
Cut it out.

565
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,930
Let's stop this.

566
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,560
Shall I do one of my moves on him?

567
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,960
Come back.

568
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,700
He never gives up.

569
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,370
I have some moves...

570
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,100
When we reach a deadlock,

571
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,630
I don't want to get caught up in it.

572
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,300
As time passes, everyone will get
even more used to the situation.

573
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:26,340
So, I want to take advantage of that,
and be aggressive from the start.

574
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,700
I'll slip in a few light jokes,
and go on the offensive from the start.

575
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,530
You can't blame him.

576
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,040
You're scary.

577
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,400
I saw this on the Amazon commercial.

578
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,100
I had to get it.

579
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,470
-It's what the dog wears.
-Oh, that ad with the baby.

580
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,890
Because the baby cries at the dog.

581
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,100
So that's where it went.

582
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,230
Does this belong to somebody else?

583
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,900
It's mine!

584
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,790
I ordered one of these.

585
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,160
-But they ran out of stock.
-He got it instead?

586
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,770
-What were you thinking?
-Seriously?

587
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,300
Try it on.

588
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,960
You really want to try that on?

589
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,100
-Give me a hand.
-What's that?

590
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,570
I was given a big lucky flag.

591
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,600
I'll put this wig on.

592
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,900
-That's wonderful!
-Look at that!

593
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,100
-Take a look at that.
-Wow!

594
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,900
MASTER DAISUKE
GET WELL SOON

595
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,500
-You were given this?
-Yes, I was.

596
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,860
When he got sick,
his fans made it for him.

597
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,570
-He gave it to me.
-Awesome.

598
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,030
Way to go.

599
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,140
-Want to use it as a tablecloth?
-Sure.

600
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,000
-Move everything off the table, please.
-But I'm...

601
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,230
-Just a moment.
-Okay.

602
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,570
Daisuke, sit down.

603
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,700
-Where are you going?
-What's wrong?

604
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,590
Look. We have Daisuke and Daisuke.

605
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,330
It's not Daisuke and Daisuke.

606
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,230
There's pubic hair around his mouth.

607
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,330
Who put pubic hair on him?

608
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,470
This is not funny. Who did it?

609
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,730
This is beyond a joke.

610
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,100
Who put white pubic hair around
the veteran's mouth?

611
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,470
You can't do that. Anywhere but his mouth.

612
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,030
Where did Kubota go?

613
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,770
He's putting on the wig.

614
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,600
Can I come out?
I'm wearing that Amazon thing.

615
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,830
Is this on right?

616
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,130
Is this correct?

617
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,500
I look like Seiko Matsuda!

618
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,200
I look just like Seiko Matsuda!

619
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,670
Jimmy, right?

620
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,200
What were you trying to do?

621
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,630
-It wasn't that funny.
-What happened?

622
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,800
-What did you do with your eyes?
-You were just squeezing them?

623
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,060
I'm done for.

624
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,770
That wasn't fair.
His eyes were so bloodshot.

625
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,770
-Jimmy.
-You got me.

626
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,660
Let's watch it.

627
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,230
You're definitely out, Jimmy.

628
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,030
You suddenly exploded.

629
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,960
Fujimoto was close, too.

630
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,870
That one is tough to make a verdict on.

631
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,860
You're in danger now.

632
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,970
-This is your final chance.
-Okay.

633
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,630
That's so lenient.
It could've been a red card.

634
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,400
Exactly. I thought about it.

635
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,930
-Sorry.
-This is your last chance.

636
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,530
I know. But they keep on attacking me.

637
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,070
-No, we're not.
-We're all under attack.

638
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:00,130
I am the type of person
who laughs really easily.

639
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,430
When it hits the right spot,

640
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,700
I can't help but laugh.

641
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,700
When I used to watch
The Drifters' show, Hachijidayo,

642
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,230
I'd laugh a lot.

643
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,800
Start!

644
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,330
Can we play the game
"Who's Really Doing It?"

645
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,900
Let's play "Who's Really Doing It?"

646
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,170
-Was that the name?
-Yes.

647
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,270
No, it's not.

648
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,790
It's "Who's Really Doing It?"

649
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,700
-Really?
-Yeah.

650
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,400
What kind of game is it?
I've never heard of it.

651
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,930
Huh?

652
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,270
Anthony...

653
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,860
One of these sweet buns contains
spicy wasabi.

654
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,170
-It's sitting on the top.
-We can see it.

655
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,500
Guess which one has the wasabi inside.

656
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,040
We can see it!

657
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,390
You're gonna eat it?

658
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,100
You're eating it yourself?

659
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,730
He's cool.

660
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,830
I got the wasabi.

661
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,130
Of course.
You're the only one to choose from.

662
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,470
And we could see it.

663
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,800
There's still one left.

664
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,460
Give us another try. Eat up.

665
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,760
Is he okay?

666
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,970
-You spat it out.
-No, I didn't.

667
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,900
-That's a violation.
-It's still here.

668
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,540
There's one more.

669
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,460
That one looks safe.

670
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,960
It should be okay...

671
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,600
-I'm done for.
-You totally laughed.

672
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,690
That was definitely a laugh.

673
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,900
You laughed so normally.

674
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,830
-He laughed just like normal.
-He totally laughed.

675
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,100
Wait.

676
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,270
-You laughed like normal.
-Completely.

677
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,090
You forgot we're not just chatting.

678
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,660
He's here.

679
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,530
-He put his hand up.
-I'm sorry.

680
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,600
I'm sorry.
I don't need to check the video.

681
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,030
-Yellow!
-Just yellow?

682
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,400
Did you know Anthony
had his eyelids flipped?

683
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,400
-I had no idea.
-I noticed, but...

684
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,690
-He was giving a mean stare.
-Like Clint.

685
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,630
Like Clint Eastwood?

686
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,260
Why laugh?

687
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,530
But I can laugh now, right?

688
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,600
That didn't deserve a laugh.

689
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,490
-It wasn't that funny.
-Be quiet!

690
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,860
I can't keep all 10 of you alive
for much longer.

691
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,030
-Somebody will be eliminated soon.
-It's been an hour.

692
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,960
You're Clint Eyelid-wood.

693
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,030
I am.

694
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,800
You're Clint Eyelid-wood.

695
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,240
I am.

696
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,560
Start!

697
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,600
Wasabi is dangerous.

698
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,870
-Can you put this flag away?
-What do you think? Should we--

699
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,640
Stop it! It's mine.

700
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,390
Let's pack it up.

701
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,130
Fujimoto, you've been close to laughing.

702
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,700
But he keeps drinking!

703
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,540
You're close again.

704
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,030
Damn it!

705
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,270
Why?

706
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,030
Why?

707
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,060
Why?

708
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,000
Why can't I drink?

709
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,100
-Damn you!
-Don't blame him, Jimmy.

710
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,100
Damn you!

711
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,870
We all agreed not to hide behind bottles.

712
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,290
Damn you!

713
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,700
Damn!

714
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,960
Jimmy Onishi!

715
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,600
You're out!

716
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,170
Damn you!

717
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,870
What you did was wrong!

718
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,940
-That's wrong.
-Don't blame me.

719
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,300
We all agreed not to hide behind bottles.

720
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,730
I wasn't hiding!

721
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,900
I was only drinking because
the wasabi was still hot.

722
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,370
You are not nice!

723
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,030
You're out.
Leave your million yen and go home!

724
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,530
You make me mad.

725
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,370
What did I do?

726
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,140
You kept tricking me into laughing.

727
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,660
I only tried to stop you from drinking.
That's what we all agreed.

728
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,900
-Where's he going?
-To get his things.

729
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,030
Did he have any props left?

730
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,270
He brought quite a lot.

731
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,960
He had a lot.

732
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,660
I didn't get to use any of these.

733
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,800
-You should have used them.
-He's right.

734
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,100
This will change things.

735
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,860
It makes life easier.

736
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,800
It will be a lot easier now.

737
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,000
This is a big gain for us.

738
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,770
My million yen!

739
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,560
It's not easy to earn one million yen.

740
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,770
Sitting next to Daisuke was
my first big mistake.

741
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,330
Daisuke creates a subtle comic vibe.
You can feel it when you sit next to him.

742
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,060
That vibe was just too much for me.

743
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,600
It got to me.

744
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,300
Another thing was,

745
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:39,430
I went on the offensive too early.
That was another reason I lost.

746
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,860
I shouldn't have put on
this costume so early.

747
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,570
I had to go on the offensive.
If I just sat still,

748
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,290
they would have ganged up to attack me.

749
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,430
They were so sly.

750
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,730
Only one hour has passed?

751
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,600
-Only one hour?
-Only one-sixth.

752
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,100
Start.

753
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,460
Everyone cracked quite quickly.

754
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,430
Now that Jimmy is gone,
we'll see how things change.

755
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,600
-Pack this up.
-We've seen enough of it.

756
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,340
This is so...

757
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,860
It's like he really died.
He's dead on top of the big lucky flag.

758
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,670
Don't make your final farewells.

759
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,770
Say goodbye.

760
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,330
Ohchi.

761
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,360
Ohchi!

762
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,600
-Ohchi.
-Ohchi.

763
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,900
-Ohchi, Ohchi!
-Ohchi, Ohchi!

764
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,770
-He's not really dead.
-Touch him.

765
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,100
Just say goodbye.

766
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,200
-Touch him. He's super cold.
-I don't think we should touch him.

767
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,160
He's unbelievably cold. Touch him.

768
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,430
-Say goodbye.
-Then we can have sushi.

769
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,870
That's not a good idea.

770
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,830
Say goodbye, then have some sushi.

771
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,960
-This is not good.
-Ohchi, say goodbye!

772
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,100
This is your last chance!

773
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,500
Take a good look.

774
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,500
-Raise the cloth.
-Do it yourself.

775
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,100
Look. He's at peace now.

776
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,760
Look at this part, too.

777
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,200
There may be a message. Take a look.

778
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,930
Something may be written there.

779
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,770
Nothing there.

780
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,260
Good. Cover him up.

781
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,560
Next person.

782
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,730
I can't believe he's gone.

783
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,770
He really loved e-cigarettes.

784
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,490
-He loved baseball, too.
-He did.

785
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,500
Why is he smoking a bat?

786
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,030
That's sacrilege.

787
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,460
-You can't do that.
-Seriously.

788
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,000
That's going too far.

789
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,870
He'll become the undead.

790
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,770
-Stop it.
-You can't do that.

791
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,290
Master Daisuke hates the U.S.

792
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,460
-That's not funny.
-Make sure you never do that in America.

793
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,870
Play us a song.

794
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,970
Do, re, mi, fa...

795
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,770
Ohchi, look!

796
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,160
Ohchi, look.

797
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,560
Ohchi, look at him.

798
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,930
-Ohchi?
-Ohchi.

799
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,600
When you think about all the memories
we have...

800
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,860
-Take a look.
-Have some sushi, too.

801
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,500
-He played the melodeon.
-He smoked e-cigarettes.

802
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,900
-He loved smoking e-cigarettes.
-He loved smoking his melodeon, too.

803
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,660
Master Daisuke!

804
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,730
Hanako misses you.

805
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,660
Oh, my goodness.

806
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,300
Come here, shithead.

807
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,530
-War broke out.
-Don't hurt me.

808
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,860
Stop putting the U.S. on him!

809
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,600
This is so sad.

810
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,230
-Kukky!
-Yes?

811
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,000
-Where are you?
-I'm putting on a jacket. I'm cold.

812
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,400
-You ran away from us.
-Is it cold?

813
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,440
-Aren't you guys cold?
-No.

814
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,690
It's not that cold.

815
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,300
Is wearing a jacket too much?

816
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,070
I think you should take it off.

817
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,700
Really?

818
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,800
I'm so cold.

819
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,260
That was a separate piece?

820
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,330
-What's "separate" mean?
-Detachable.

821
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,130
-It's unusual.
-Yeah, that hood.

822
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,230
-Hood? Is "Separate" a car?
-Ohchi.

823
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,030
Look at him.

824
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,500
-Want to wear this?
-Ohchi, look at him.

825
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,390
Ohchi!

826
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,760
Look!

827
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,130
-Look at him properly.
-I did. I looked at him.

828
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,230
What should I do about Ohchi?

829
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,960
-I hate being followed.
-I just want to smoke.

830
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,070
His testicles are twisted.
See, they're all twisted.

831
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,600
Ohchi.

832
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,760
Ohchi's getting close.

833
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,730
Please stop following me.

834
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,060
I'm going to take a shower.

835
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,760
It's hot.

836
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,030
-How about we all sit down?
-Okay.

837
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,430
-Let's sit for now.
-Okay.

838
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,430
-Let's settle down.
-Calm down for once.

839
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,770
This is so tough.

840
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,060
Oh, it's a male and a female.

841
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,860
We're missing someone.

842
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,930
-Where's Anthony?
-Still next to you.

843
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,640
Ohchi and Kawahara aren't here.

844
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,930
Sit down, everyone.

845
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,330
What are you doing?

846
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,330
Oh, no!

847
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,800
Oh, crap!

848
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,800
Does the school uniform make this
less funny?

849
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,400
I don't think that's the issue.

850
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,870
Whatever you wore, it wouldn't be...

851
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,430
Just sit down.

852
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,230
Sit down.

853
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,470
Sit down.

854
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,340
Maybe it's less funny.

855
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,330
I passed a pro wrestling test
for the lucha libre in Mexico.

856
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,330
And today,

857
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,130
I brought a bunch of masks.

858
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,540
Would you mind looking at them?

859
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,360
I have some cool ones,
and some other ones.

860
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,470
-A whole variety.
-They all wear masks in Mexico.

861
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,630
-For pro wrestling?
-Lucha libre.

862
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,360
I want to show how great Mexico is.

863
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:28,990
That sounds nice.

864
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,600
I'll lighten things up a bit.

865
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,330
Lucha libre.

866
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,900
Lucha libre?

867
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,400
-Lucha libre.
-Lucha libre.

868
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,860
-Lucha.
-Lucha?

869
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,160
-Lucha.
-Lucha.

870
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,160
I have several hundred masks in my drawer.

871
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,630
Today I brought a dozen of the best.

872
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,540
Just wait and see.

873
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,990
Lucha is going to explode.

874
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,960
This is an old-style mask.

875
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,730
-Máscaras.
-I know that.

876
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,230
I've seen that one.

877
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,700
And?

878
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,170
They'll get funnier.

879
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,790
Should you be saying that?

880
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,960
-You're raising our expectations.
-It's okay.

881
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,030
-The next one's funnier.
-He sounds confident.

882
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,100
He looks fit.

883
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,570
-He's got a nice body.
-He must work out.

884
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,090
-He goes to the gym.
-Is that right?

885
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,660
He did practice some sport, right?

886
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,730
He actually does do pro wrestling.

887
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,770
-Are you ready for the next one?
-Sure.

888
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,000
He has hair now.

889
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:31,800
It's kind of cute.

890
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,930
That one looks like a clown.

891
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,270
-It's like a clown, right?
-With the nose and all.

892
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:40,100
When he jumps, the hair flaps up, right?
It makes him look dynamic.

893
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,100
Does your hair flap when you jump?

894
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,190
Maybe his role is to provide comic relief,
rather than big moves.

895
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,800
-Watch out!
-Ouch!

896
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,830
-Ouch!
-Are you okay?

897
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,430
-You killed the chair.
-It's dead.

898
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,640
Ow.

899
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,290
This is a serious accident.

900
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,830
Are they okay? Nobody's really injured?

901
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,330
Are you okay?

902
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,100
-That was dangerous.
-It's totally broken.

903
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,230
I've got more masks.
We don't want any injuries.

904
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,600
That was scary.

905
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,600
Is Fujimoto all right?

906
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,930
We have an expert.

907
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,790
Looking good.

908
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,360
-He's in the zone.
-Way to go.

909
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,970
You're pathetic.

910
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,670
Don't hurt yourself.

911
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,470
Ohchi?

912
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,900
Ohchi?

913
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,460
-What's wrong?
-Ohchi?

914
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,060
-What's going on?
-Nothing...

915
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,900
Picture in your mind what just happened.

916
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,090
-Are you ready?
-We lost a chair.

917
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,290
-Ready?
-Yes.

918
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,830
He fell down sideways.

919
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,730
One with hair again?

920
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,070
Did you add that yourself?

921
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,360
Did it really come like that?

922
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,260
He looks weak.

923
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,370
He does look weak.

924
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,900
You didn't add hair to look like
the wrestler who uses that mask?

925
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,230
This is how it came.

926
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,460
That was an amazing move you did before.

927
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,130
-Can you believe that?
-It was dangerous. There was a corner.

928
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,030
-I didn't know people fell sideways.
-Apparently they do.

929
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:19,960
Are you ready?

930
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,300
Okay.

931
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,170
You totally laughed.

932
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,730
It's too late now.

933
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,660
That's totally out.

934
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,760
There aren't many people who laugh
as easily as me.

935
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,100
That's how much I laugh.

936
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:48,860
I think I'm the only person who laughed
all the way through Forrest Gump.

937
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:54,700
-He's here.
-You laughed so hard.

938
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,630
I haven't even got a yellow card.

939
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:01,100
That's worth more than a yellow.
You belted out that laugh.

940
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,200
-It's a yellow card.
-Kukky...

941
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,600
Yellow card.

942
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,330
-Thank you so much.
-You're yellow for now.

943
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,300
-We get one chance each?
-I think so.

944
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,960
And Ohchi.

945
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,070
You're just slipping me an orange card?

946
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,790
I don't get any buzzers?
I'm just casually handed an orange card?

947
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:19,530
You've been smiling the whole time.

948
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,060
I've been patient with you.

949
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,470
-But I've been...
-You've been terrible.

950
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,800
Everyone keeps saying, "Ohchi, Ohchi!"

951
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,100
Sometimes, I laugh because
I know what they're capable of.

952
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,600
Whenever something happens,
I'll just try to be emotionally dead.

953
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,170
If I think about the person doing it,

954
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,360
I'll laugh in no time.

955
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,260
I can't do this.

956
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,900
When you focus on your offense,
your defense weakens.

957
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,500
-Exactly. I agree.
-Right?

958
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,940
-You become fragile.
-I'm in danger here.

959
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,990
I think I have to go on the offensive.

960
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,160
What color card did I get last time?

961
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,870
Was it orange?

962
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,030
Start!

963
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,360
-Yellow.
-Oh, it was yellow.

964
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,600
Shall we check who has what card?

965
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,160
-I'm orange.
-You're orange.

966
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,930
-I'm yellow.
-I'm yellow, too.

967
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:07,360
You don't have any.

968
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,500
-Not yet.
-Okay.

969
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,800
Anthony, Kubota,
and Kawahara are fine so far.

970
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:14,870
Scary.

971
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,460
What was that jacket all about?

972
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,700
-It gets cold and hot.
-No, it doesn't.

973
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,800
The AC has a problem.

974
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,500
You're the one with a problem.

975
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,030
Don't touch it. It's wet.

976
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,200
-Sweat?
-No, it's--

977
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,760
The problem is you.

978
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,330
There's tofu in here.

979
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,100
Wait.

980
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,130
What?

981
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,030
-Why did he laugh?
-What happened?

982
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,730
Damn!

983
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,040
-He was easy.
-What happened?

984
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,400
Damn it!

985
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,630
He totally laughed.

986
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,630
What's so funny about tofu?

987
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,300
It wasn't that funny.

988
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,270
It was a weak jab at best.

989
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,430
It was a super small jab of a joke.

990
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,630
Why did he laugh?

991
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:02,430
-No idea. He just said, "tofu."
-That's not all--

992
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,330
Show us what happened.

993
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,630
-What was it?
-It wasn't that funny.

994
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,730
-I didn't even realize.
-Reenact it for us.

995
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,270
-It's soaked in sweat.
-Yeah, it's wet.

996
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,600
That's not sweat. There's tofu in here.

997
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,390
He laughed again!

998
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,030
What?

999
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,030
Why?

1000
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,370
That's what finished you off?

1001
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,700
He let you go so many times.

1002
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,190
I still don't get it.

1003
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,160
-Was it some old inside joke?
-He uses "tofu" all time.

1004
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,270
-He uses tofu as a joke for everything.
-Now I get it.

1005
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,930
-It had built up.
-Over the years.

1006
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,060
All for today.

1007
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,400
And so when he said it today,

1008
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,900
I was ready to laugh.

1009
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,400
Good job.

1010
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,670
Good job.

1011
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,060
Damn it!

1012
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,300
-Good job!
-Time to go.

1013
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,170
At the 90-minute mark, you're gone.

1014
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,190
It's only been an hour and a half?

1015
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,200
Damn it!

1016
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,630
Why is he acting disappointed?

1017
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,600
What is there to regret
after laughing so much?

1018
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,190
-How can he be disappointed?
-He laughed the whole time.

1019
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,130
He did.

1020
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,560
It should be easy
to accept defeat after that.

1021
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,270
I was so sure I'd win today.

1022
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,240
-No chance.
-You always laugh.

1023
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,960
You spent more time smiling than not.

1024
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,630
You were cheerful the entire time.

1025
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,770
What was in your bag?

1026
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,200
Let us see.

1027
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,860
What was the best one?

1028
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,430
This bathrobe and...

1029
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,970
sunglasses.

1030
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,230
I wanted to wear these naked.

1031
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,500
-I might have laughed.
-Then what?

1032
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,530
What?

1033
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,030
What were you going to do?

1034
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,960
You were going to
say or do something, right?

1035
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,500
No, I was just going to come out.

1036
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,130
Just come out?

1037
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,800
What shallow thinking.

1038
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,170
To be honest,

1039
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,230
I couldn't do anything at all.

1040
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,860
I have so many regrets!

1041
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,230
I lost because
I didn't go on the offensive.

1042
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,890
Trying to hold back your laughter
is the hardest thing to do.

1043
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:21,930
I laugh easily in everyday life.

1044
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:23,900
But I knew it.

1045
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,460
I simply couldn't sit still.

1046
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,200
I had to either smoke,

1047
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,300
or drink water,

1048
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,730
or keep walking around.

1049
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,390
And Fujimoto kept talking.

1050
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,230
The moment I start to listen
to things like that,

1051
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,100
I can't help but laugh.

1052
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:50,530
Just remembering that makes me laugh.
I'm not meant for this show.

1053
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,400
That's still only two gone.

1054
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,430
Two people out in one hour and a half.

1055
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,030
-How's the pace?
-Pretty fast.

1056
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:04,130
-Several of us have no more chances.
-You're right.

1057
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,130
They are not allowed to laugh.

1058
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:12,200
But the prohibition of laughter seems
to contradict the creation of comedy.

1059
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:16,330
Why did you introduce that rule
for this show?

1060
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,060
It is a contradiction.
Comedy is a contradiction.

1061
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,860
It's two different sides of the same coin.

1062
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:25,530
For example,
there was a time in my life when

1063
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,460
I wanted to be the funniest man
on the planet.

1064
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:34,370
I put all my effort into it,
and tried my best to become that guy.

1065
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,400
But one day I realized,

1066
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:41,100
the least funny man in the world
is probably the funniest.

1067
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,630
So, no matter how hard I try,
I can only ever be second place.

1068
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,230
It hit me one day.

1069
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:51,830
Comedy is that kind of thing.

1070
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,530
Sometimes people laugh at
the worst possible moment.

1071
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:01,160
But when things like that happen,
that moment becomes comedy, too.

1072
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,270
-Show us your anus.
-Show us properly.

1073
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,060
Show us a bit more.

1074
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:21,700
Ready?
