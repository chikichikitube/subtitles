00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,170
THIS PROGRAM WAS PRODUCED UNDER
THE SUPERVISION OF MEDICAL EXPERTS,

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,870
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HEALTH
AND SAFETY OF THE STAFF AND CONTESTANTS.

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,630
KITANO

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,500
Captain!

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,470
Thanks for gathering, brave warriors.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,630
THE CAPTAIN
SUBARU KIMURA

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,300
-All right.
-I am your captain, Subaru Kimura.

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,970
I love when he says that line.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,230
Our next target is Takeshi Castle's third
fortress, Ichikawa Ennosuke Castle.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,700
THE THIRD CASTLE
ENNOSUKE CASTLE

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,730
Many obstacles will stand in our path,
but I believe

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,030
that you have it in you
to defeat and conquer.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,230
Let's make it happen!

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,400
Fantastic! So you've returned, Mr. Sasuke?

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,370
MR. SASUKE
KATSUMI YAMADA (56)

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,930
-Yes, here I am.
-Wow, he's 56?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,570
I hate to say this, but...

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,330
your track record hasn't been great.

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,170
GAMES FAILED: DRAGON GOD'S POND, SLIP-AND-
SLIDE QUIZ, STRONG ARMS, MUSHROOM PLOP

20
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,730
-It wasn't good at all.
-No, not at all.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,870
-I hope you'll score better this time.
-I will.

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,400
All right, that's the spirit.

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,630
And today, our army goes beyond Japan.

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,930
We have warriors
from all over the world, right?

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,130
Please raise your hands.

26
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,300
Fantastic!

27
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,900
-From abroad? How lucky are we.
-Wow. That's great.

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,030
That's correct. Takeshi's Castle has been
broadcasted in over 150 countries.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,570
We have passionate fans around the world.

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,530
This time around, we have
hardcore Takeshi's Castle fans

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,570
joining the army from every continent.

32
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,630
You, in the front with the red t-shirt.
Where are you from?

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,100
-Technically, the US. Oh, thanks.
-Technically?

34
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,530
-I'm from America.
-America?

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,670
How do you feel going into battle?

36
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,230
-I've never been good at sports, but...
-Okay.

37
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,700
-My determination is limitless. Let's go!
-Right!

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,930
-He's fluent.
-Your Japanese is excellent.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,230
-Would you prefer English?
-That's all right.

40
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,930
Additionally, the army will have support
from a few star players.

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,300
They'll attempt to conquer Ennosuke Castle
with their powers combined.

42
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,800
-We have a superstar among us.
-A superstar?

43
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,930
GOLDEN BOMBER
YUTAKA KYAN (37)

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,830
Oh, it's Kyan.

45
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,830
-You there. Aren't you Kyan?
-That's me.

46
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,400
-I've performed at Kohaku four times.
-Wow, how cool.

47
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,570
I usually only accept TV gigs
with my bandmate, Darvish.

48
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,870
But today, I came to hog the spotlight.

49
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,170
Wonderful.

50
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,570
Let's go.

51
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,970
I hope you can work as a team. Sound good?

52
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,670
Let's go!

53
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,530
-Nice.
-Everyone is pumped.

54
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,000
Well now, everyone, our first challenge is

55
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,330
The Border Wall.

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,930
I want every one of you
to get to the other side.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,970
Now, charge!

58
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,030
Wow! Amazing.

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,800
Gather round,

60
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,930
elite warriors!

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,630
THE YEAR 1986

62
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,700
Charge!

63
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,300
In 1986, a colossal battle broke loose.

64
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,470
THE IMPENETRABLE CASTLE

65
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,870
A castle so impenetrable,

66
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,200
only 8 out of
127 battles have ever seen its halls.

67
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,570
8 WINS, 118 LOSSES, 1 DRAW
WIN RATE 6%

68
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,430
That dreadful castle has reemerged
in the Land of the Rising Sun.

69
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,670
JAPAN

70
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,970
RESURRECTION

71
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,070
THE YEAR 2023

72
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,200
Charge!

73
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,130
Takeshi's Castle is back!
Fortified with extravagance and fortitude,

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,170
packed with new games,
it's the palace of your dreams!

75
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,270
WHO WILL EMERGE
AS THE BOLDEST WARRIOR?

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,670
NO TIME TO FEAR

77
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,470
I'll bring justice upon you numbskulls!

78
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,230
Have a look and see for yourself.

79
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,200
TAKE NO PRISONERS

80
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,400
Victory is ours!

81
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,770
I'm gutted!

82
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,770
Tear it down

83
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,670
to take home...

84
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,130
ONE MILLION YEN

85
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,970
I will destroy you!

86
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,530
I made it!

87
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,770
Here we go!

88
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,200
Fall, fall till you can fall no further.

89
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,870
Struggle as you may,
he has you in the palm of his hand.

90
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,230
DANCE...

91
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,530
The man of the hour
that you've all waited for...

92
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,400
IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND

93
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,130
ARMY VS TAKESHI

94
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,430
Takeshi's Castle!

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,130
TAKESHI'S CASTLE

96
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,970
This great battle to overthrow
Takeshi's Castle is the first in 34 years.

97
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,000
Among the three fortresses
that protect Takeshi's Castle,

98
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,870
there first was Ueda Castle
and then Watanabe Castle.

99
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,030
The army had fought tirelessly,

100
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,300
but were decimated
by Takeshi's army in the end.

101
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,900
The enemy they'll face
in this battle is Ennosuke Castle.

102
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,070
On the way, there are seven strongholds
that are meant

103
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,370
to prevent the army from advancing.

104
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,700
BATTLE OF THE THIRD CASTLE
FOREIGN FORCES HAVE ARRIVED

105
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,530
The battle to overthrow
the third castle begins now.

106
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,870
Rumbling onto the battlegrounds
like blustering winds are

107
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,170
powerful warriors that were carefully
selected for this mission.

108
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,300
The army consists of about 104 warriors.

109
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,470
Most of them are
in their teens and twenties.

110
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,370
We have a young infantry on our hands.

111
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,830
Additionally, it's a diverse group
of warriors, who have been strategizing

112
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,130
on how to defeat the castle
from across the ocean.

113
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,600
We're coming for you!

114
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:38,600
THE THIRD CASTLE
ENNOSUKE CASTLE

115
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,630
TAKESHI'S CASTLE CHIEF &amp; LIEGE
OSAMU SHITARA &amp; YUKI HIMURA

116
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,100
-Here we are in the third castle.
-All right.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,870
-Huh?
-The lord of the castle isn't here.

118
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,570
-You're right. I wonder...
-He's gone. What's happened?

119
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,000
-My Lord?
-My Lord!

120
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,500
-My Lord?
-My Lord!

121
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,730
Whoa.

122
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,800
My Lord?

123
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,600
-I rushed over from another gig.
-I see.

124
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm Ennosuke Ichikawa.

125
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,070
Introducing, Lord of the Third Castle,
Ennosuke Ichikawa.

126
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,330
THE THIRD CASTLE LORD
ENNOSUKE ICHIKAWA

127
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,670
Nice to meet you.

128
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,800
-Nice to meet you, too.
-Please have a seat.

129
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,100
So, Lord Ennosuke,
welcome to Takeshi's Castle.

130
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,130
-I grew up watching this show.
-I imagine.

131
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,870
Is there any game you remember?

132
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,970
First, there's that wall you climb.

133
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,400
THE BORDER WALL

134
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,330
-I remember Dragon God's Pond...
-Yes.

135
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,700
-...and also Strong Kongo.
-Very good.

136
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,600
That's where he chased after you.

137
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,000
There's one where they threw
volleyballs at you.

138
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,170
-You remember lots of them.
-Of course.

139
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,230
THE 7 STRONGHOLDS
OF ENNOSUKE CASTLE

140
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,600
We'll see many of those nostalgic games.

141
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,170
Nice, I can't wait.

142
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,570
At the moment, it just so happens
that the count has gone MIA.

143
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,270
-He's disappeared?
-Exactly.

144
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,770
But have no worries. We've gathered
all of our technology know-how

145
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,170
-and put together an AI count.
-Nice, an AI count.

146
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,200
-Shall we summon him?
-Sure.

147
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,570
-Good morning. I'm Koji Higashino.
-Here we go, another impersonation.

148
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,800
-Good morning...
-That's not how you talk.

149
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,530
-Pardon me, my mistake.
-Come on, Count!

150
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,830
-The AI is out of control.
-That's not who you are.

151
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,430
-Nice to meet you.
-There's our count.

152
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,770
-This is exciting.
-Well, now,

153
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,400
there's an unruly gang
who's trying to bring down this castle.

154
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,330
-Let's bring them to their knees.
-Agreed, we won't let

155
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,730
-a single person near the castle gates.
-That's right. Great plan.

156
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,770
-There is no way I'll lose!
-All right, that's the spirit.

157
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,600
Okay, everyone, our first challenge is
The Border Wall.

158
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,130
I want everyone to get to the other side.

159
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,130
THE BORDER WALL
DIFFICULTY RATING: 15%

160
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,600
-I'll let them get by.
-Don't you dare.

161
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,530
TAKESHI'S ARMY, DUO TOM BROWN
MICHIO &amp; HIROKI NUNOKAWA

162
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
-I meant, I won't.
-There you go.

163
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,470
We'll make it to the end!

164
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,330
We will invade the castle!

165
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,670
All right.

166
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,500
Charge!

167
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,170
-Wow!
-Great!

168
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,270
GET OVER THE WALL
WITHIN FIVE MINUTES

169
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,530
The battle has now officially begun.

170
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,630
The first challenge is The Border Wall.

171
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,430
In the battles of the 1st and 2nd castle,
not everyone made it over the wall.

172
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,470
Let's hope that the entire army
can make it over this time.

173
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,370
Good job, everyone. Stay calm.

174

REPORTER, NASUNAKANISHI DUO
SHIGEKI NAKANISHI

175
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,530
Bustling sound. Wow, they're already here.

176
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,770
REPORTER, NASUNAKANISHI DUO
AKIYUKI NASU

177
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,430
They're fast. And relentless.

178
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,400
The opponent is trying to blind us.

179
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,900
-Congrats! Well done.
-Yay!

180

INTERNET ENTERTAINER, USA
AJ ERENDS (33)

181
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,130
Should I speak in Japanese?
I did it! I defeated it!

182
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,270
Good job.

183
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,730
HOKKAIDO UNIVERSITY GRAD STUDENTS

184
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,970
FRANZISKA HEUMANN (29)
&amp; IVAN BALLIANA (23)

185
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,500
That was fun.

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,370
While some warriors jubilantly celebrated
their success in getting over the wall...

187
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,100
3 MINUTES REMAINING

188
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,700
-...some continued to struggle.
-Nice, good job.

189
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,470
Take that. And that.
I won't let you through.

190
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,570
Don't underestimate Japan.

191
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,970
-No, he fell.
-There he goes.

192
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,430
It's going up my crotch. My crotch!

193
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,370
Oh no! You have to protect your groin.
That's dangerous.

194
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,970
-Bring your leg up.
-People are helping others up.

195
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,600
1 MINUTE REMAINING
7 WARRIORS LEFT

196
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,930
7 warriors remain.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,230
Come on, everyone.
They're helping each other.

198
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,100
Come on. He's so cool.

199
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,430
-Help each other.
-Go!

200
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,830
-Wow.
-Fantastic!

201
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,530
-That's great.
-Go, go!

202
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,930
Oh no!

203
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,370
I'm sure he hurt his butt.

204
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,700
Just one person left. You got this!

205
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,270
Time is almost up.

206
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,170
-He's running out of time.
-Don't give up!

207
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,870
30 SECONDS REMAINING
ONE WARRIOR LEFT

208
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,600
The army is one person away
from saving the whole group.

209
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,100
Everyone is helping.

210
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,070
Even Yamada, aka Mr. Sasuke, who only
assisted women in the previous battle.

211
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,170
He's not leaving anyone behind this round.

212
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,530
-He's letting them pull him up.
-Keep going!

213
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,530
Yes!

214
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,830
-They all made it.
-The whole group?

215
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,900
Fantastic!
You were a lifesaver, Mr. Sasuke.

216
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,830
Awesome!

217
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,830
NO WARRIOR LEFT BEHIND

218
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,200
-Everyone got over.
-Everyone.

219
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,770
The whole army made it. Amazing job.

220
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,130
Well, they can have this one.

221
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
-Really?
-It's fine.

222
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,970
107 WARRIORS REMAIN

223
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,000
Third times a charm. The entire army
makes it over The Border Wall.

224
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,530
This gives us hope for their chances
of overthrowing the castle.

225
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,400
In this battle, the road ahead forks
into four different directions.

226
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,200
The warriors are given the choice
to compete in the task they feel adept in.

227
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:58,030
-Wow. They chose cooperation.
-Yes. What did you think, Lord Ennosuke?

228
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,130
-The more enemies, the merrier.
-Well, it's only the first stage.

229
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,700
We'll let them have it out of generosity.

230
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,770
-It'll keep them spry.
-This group has good teamwork.

231
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,900
We have many warriors participating
from abroad this time.

232
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,870
Our show broadcasted overseas,

233
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,670
-so most of them are fans.
-Right.

234
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,530
-I'm sure they're elated to be here.
-I agree.

235
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,330
-It's lots of fun after all.
-Yes, let's see what's next.

236
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,800
-Coming up, we have a new game.
-A new game?

237
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,470
-It's called From Right and Left.
-From Right and Left?

238
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,030
AVOID THE BARS THAT STICK OUT
TO GET ACROSS THE BRIDGE

239
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,770
-It'll make sense once you see it.
-From Right and Left.

240
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,600
First, let's take a look at the test run.

241
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,800
TEST PLAYER
TOSHIAKI KASUGA, COMIC

242
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,000
Look, it's Kasuga.

243
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,270
-What's up, everyone?
-Why so loud?

244
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,070
There he goes with that bit again.

245
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,000
Pardon me while I take care of this.

246
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,670
-If he doesn't make it, most people won't.
-You're right.

247
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,470
-I get it now.
-They have to walk across fabric.

248
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,830
-The footing is wobbly.
-I see.

249
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,200
And you have to avoid those bars
from both sides.

250
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,670
-It got him.
-Oh no.

251
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,070
He fell almost instantly.

252
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,370
Damn it!

253
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,870
Damn it.

254
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,500
This is impossible.

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,030
The entire army will fail in this round.

256
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,300
-No one will make it.
-There's no stability.

257
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,230
-Wow... it might be impossible.
-Are you sure about this?

258
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,830
No one will make it to the castle.

259
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,870
You've made this game too difficult.

260
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,800
-Okay. Well...
-Isn't that great?

261
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,900
Even the Shanghai Circus acrobats
couldn't pull that off.

262
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,700
-I agree.
-That might be true.

263
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,330
The water underneath is murky,
so we might lose some people if they fall.

264
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,330
I'm pretty sure we'll find them.

265
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,270
At the battles of the second castle,

266
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,170
General Tani was kidnapped by
Kyoko Hamaguchi from Takeshi's army.

267
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,170
He somehow escaped
by the skin of his teeth and is back,

268
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,270
ready to command
the army through battle once again.

269
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,330
Great job making it past The Border Wall,
brave warriors.

270
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,630
GENERAL
HAYATO TANI

271
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,530
-It's General Tani.
-Amazing job. Not to change the subject.

272
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,670
-He's finally back.
-But have you seen this guy in black garb?

273
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,200
It's similar to what I have on,
holding a whistle and yelling "Charge."

274
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,500
CAPTAIN KIMURA IS HAVING A NAP

275
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,870
You saw him? But you can't express
anything beyond body language.

276
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,630
-That's too bad.
-What's going on?

277
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,000
-How are you? You there.
-I'm good.

278
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,770
DATA SCIENTIST, UK
JULIAN ONYALI (38)

279
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,770
-Where are you from? Nerima?
-From Nerima.

280
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,530
-Nerima!
-What?

281
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,300
-Which country are you from?
-I'm from England.

282
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,570
-England?
-Yes.

283
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,830
What made you want
to come to Takeshi's Castle?

284
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,830
-I used to watch it in the UK.
-Really?

285
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,200
-They watch it over there.
-Maybe I should work overseas.

286
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,670
Takeshi's Castle has a great reputation.

287
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,300
The game you'll be competing in is called
From Right and Left. It's a new game.

288
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,300
-True to its name.
-You're done if those get you.

289
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,130
I can't say much about it,
but I believe you can beat it.

290
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,530
I want everyone to try their best.
Sound good?

291
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,770
-All right.
-Oh well.

292
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,770
Charge!

293
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,430
REPORTER, NASUNAKANISHI DUO
AKIYUKI NASU

294
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,730
From Right and Left will keep you
on the edge of your seat.

295
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,200
The Takeshi's goon who will
command this game is...

296
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,900
TAKESHI'S ARMY
YOSHIAKI UMEGAKI, COMIC

297
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,370
-It's Umegaki.
-Nice.

298
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,330
That's nasty. I feel like you blew out
more than a bean from there.

299
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,500
-And here's another secret weapon.
-Hey! Come on!

300
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,070
Here he comes. Why is he acting so cocky?

301
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,100
TAKESHI'S ARMY
TOSHIAKI KASUGA, COMIC

302
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,630
This is no surprise. He was already
introduced in the test run.

303
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,570
Hurry up and do it. Hurry.
It's too hot for this.

304
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,800
-What's up, everyone?
-He's facing the wrong way.

305
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,200
-Turn around.
-What's the point of this?

306
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:59,600
FROM RIGHT AND LEFT
DIFFICULTY RATING: 97%

307
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,900
Charge!

308
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,400
-So Kasuga gets to aim that.
-Okay.

309
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,900
EX SPANISH EMBASSY EMPLOYEE, SPAIN
ALVARO CAMACHO CRIADO (27)

310
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,270
-Here he comes.
-You got this!

311
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,300
-I'm strong!
-Spain.

312
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,130
CROSS THE BRIDGE WHILE
AVOIDING THE BARS TO WIN

313
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,300
-He shouldn't hurry.
-Slow down.

314
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,100
That was dangerous.

315
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,470
That was dangerous.

316
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,500
-They come at you from both sides.
-That was dangerous.

317
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,770
-That's risky.
-Only at Takeshi's Castle.

318
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,200
SUPPORT ENGINEER, SPAIN
ERICA MARTINEZ (30)

319
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,770
-I'll try my best!
-Good luck. Come on.

320
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,270
-Okay.
-You got this, Erica.

321
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,900
-She's fast.
-Doing good.

322
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,430
-Now she's taking her time.
-She's doing great.

323
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,000
-She's doing great.
-Nice.

324

DATA SCIENTIST, UK
JULIAN ONYALI (38)

325
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,730
I'll do my best.

326
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,770
OPERATOR OF THE BARS

327
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,400
Come and get it.

328
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,170
Kasuga prepares to welcome him to battle.

329
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,500
-Here come the bubbles.
-Maybe he should crouch down.

330
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,170
There's not much space
between the red and blue bars.

331
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,130
-Bubbles...
-Oh, dear.

332
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,870
He tried crouching,
then it hit his face. Smack dab.

333
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,870
He ducks and tries to avoid the blue bar
and is taken out from the other side.

334
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,330
This is the horror of the new game,
From Right and Left.

335
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,970
-Please cheer for me.
-The next warrior...

336
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,470
PROFESSOR TAKESHI'S CASTLE

337
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,700
...to take on this demanding challenge is

338
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,530
a diehard fan of Takeshi's Castle,
Joshua Murphy from America.

339
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,030
A diehard fan?

340
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,270
TAKESHI'S CASTLE
THE SCRIPT

341
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,030
-He owns a rare collection of scripts...
-The original?

342
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,700
...and jackets only given to production
crew members, among other things.

343
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,200
-How does he find them?
-On top of that,

344
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,800
he's memorized events
from all 133 past episodes.

345
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,400
Joshua is absolutely obsessed
with Takeshi's Castle.

346
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,800
JOSHUA LOVES TAKESHI'S CASTLE

347
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,670
-Can you pick a random number?
-23.

348
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,700
It's episode 23.

349
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:12,370
The Border Wall, The Devil's Domain,
and Dragon God's Pond. Then, Ball Run...

350
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,600
Surprisingly, he can recall
every game that was played

351
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,030
in an episode that was chosen at random.

352
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,530
SWAPPING NOTES WITH TAKESHI'S CASTLE'S
MUSEUM MANAGER, MAEJIMA

353
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,300
Upon learning that his beloved show
was making a comeback,

354
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,130
Joshua fulfilled his lifelong dream
of competing in Takeshi's Castle.

355
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,530
He boarded a plane for the first time
in his life to come to Japan.

356
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,870
RODE HIS FIRST EVER PLANE TO COME TO JAPAN

357
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,470
DIEHARD FAN OF TAKESHI'S CASTLE
JOSHUA MURPHY (31)

358
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,200
-He must be elated.
-I bet.

359
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,700
-This is the highlight of his life.
-With his know-how, he might make it.

360
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,830
Oh no, it's not safe. Be careful.

361
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,170
It's too funny.

362
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,130
That was too funny.

363
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,330
Why do they keep being smacked
in the face before falling?

364
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,100
Takeshi's Castle is painful.

365
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,700
-It was worth waiting for 34 years.
-Wow.

366
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,400
Just then, a superstar walked
onto the scene to support our army.

367
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,500
-Oh, I'm so nervous.
-Hey, it's JP. It's Matsumoto.

368
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,270
CELEBRITY IMPERSONATOR
JP (39)

369
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,370
I was told that I was doing
a different show.

370
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,630
But this is none other than
Takeshi's Castle.

371
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,570
-Wow, Matsumoto came to Takeshi's Castle.
-Seriously.

372
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,500
Hito-hito-hitoshi!

373
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,970
ARMY'S SUPPORT WARRIOR
CELEBRITY IMPERSONATOR, JP (39)

374
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,630
Look, it's Matsumoto.

375
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,370
Matsumoto,
are you up for this kind of program?

376
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,370
JP was supposed to be here today,
but he has other work,

377
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,800
so I'm here as his replacement.

378
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,600
-That would never happen. Never.
-Is that so?

379
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,170
Let's do this. Watch Hitoshi go!

380
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,300
-Good luck.
-Oh no.

381
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,500
I hope he gets past at least one bar.

382
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,000
Whoa, I have to be careful.

383
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,670
-Hang in there.
-JP might be too cautious?

384
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,070
That's good. Okay.

385
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,470
-Good job.
-Keep it up. Oh no.

386
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,070
He went out exactly like we wanted him to.

387
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,370
-How did he not see that coming?
-It was obvious.

388
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,870
-It was right in front of his face.
-Exactly. How?

389
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,700
I was walking...Then suddenly
I'm spinning and splash!

390
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,370
-That's a good impersonation.
-Thanks.

391
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,870
MR. SASUKE
KATSUMI YAMADA (56)

392
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,630
-I think walking like this...
-Meanwhile, the Sasuke legend

393
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,370
was figuring out how to make
a successful comeback.

394
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,100
TEAM YAMADA'S ACE PLAYER
YOSHIYUKI YAMAMOTO (29)

395
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,000
-It makes you stop...
-The guy next to Yamada is very sharp.

396
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,330
-Apparently, that's his best pupil.
-Got it.

397
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,300
This familiar face is our next challenger.

398
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,930
BACK FROM BATTLES AT THE 2ND CASTLE
CHIITAN, ETERNALLY 0 YRS OLD

399
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,530
-It's Chiitan.
-There's no way Chiitan will make it.

400
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,000
Great. I see that you're pumped, Chiitan.

401
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,200
Chiitan, you got this!

402
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,330
-That fabric is not wide enough for her.
-You're right.

403
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,630
-This is a crapshoot.
-How risky.

404
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,130
-This is a crapshoot. There's no way--
-Chiitan...

405
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,670
-Chiitan, your neck...
-Why, Chiitan...

406
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,600
Come on, come on. You're doing great.

407

INTERNET ENTERTAINER, USA
AJ ERENDS (33)

408
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,030
This new game, From Right and Left,

409
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,170
-a run for their money.
-This is fun to watch.

419
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,130
Here we go!

420
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,900
We are...Tokyo Theater Girls!

421
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,930
-We're here to win.
-Yay!

422
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,170
The next warriors are...

423
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,730
Mixing together theater and idol-dom,

424
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,170
Tokyo Theater Girls is
a group of performers

425
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,630
who can all act, sing, and dance.

426
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,900
-All right, let's go!
-Yeah!

427
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,470
Charge!

428
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,900
TOKYO THEATER GIRLS
SHION IIZUKA (23)

429
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,630
I'm Shion. Let's get the party started!

430
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,270
She's fast. Look at her go.

431
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,030
Go, Shion!

432
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,570
-Girls are lighter, so they fly further.
-She was blown aside.

433
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,870
I think the red bar got her.

434
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,700
-It got her like, thump!
-Yeah.

435
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,100
One light push and she flew, like "Shoo!"

436
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,470
TOKYO THEATER GIRLS
MONE FUKUSHIMA (25)

437
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,730
After that, the girls continued to push on
with their youth and vigor.

438
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,330
TOKYO THEATER GIRLS
NAGI RINNO (24)

439
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,700
TOKYO THEATER GIRLS
YUI CHITOSE (23)

440
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,100
One by one, they make
a flashy display of falling,

441
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,770
but each time,
they make it a little further.

442
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,100
She was doing so well.

443
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,900
TOKYO THEATER GIRLS
RISA OKUMA (22)

444
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,970
In the end, they hang their hopes
on their youngest member, Okuma.

445
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,370
-You got this.
-Let's go!

446
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,100
THE GROUP'S PRODUCER
KAZUHIRO SHIMOMURA

447
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,200
-Good luck!
-I promise I won't fall.

448
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,200
-You got this!
-Good luck!

449
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,570
-Charge!
-You got this!

450
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,570
Let's go.

451
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,030
No one has more energy than me!
I'll try my best!

452
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,300
-Use that energy. Make it happen.
-You got this!

453
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,400
-I think she can do it.
-Use all that energy.

454
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,530
-Okay, good.
-Advancing too quickly isn't good either.

455
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,170
See, she's skinny,
so she can wait between the bars.

456
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,600
You got this, Okuma.

457
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,800
-Look, she's got the hang of it.
-She might make it.

458
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,270
-Hang in there. She has...
-She's figured it out.

459
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,500
-Yes! She's going to make it.
-Yeah!

460
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,000
You got this. You got it!

461
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,700
-Here come the bubbles!
-You can do it!

462
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,300
-You did it!
-He's been waiting at the end?

463
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,770
-Awesome!
-I did it! I made it to the end!

464
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,300
Hurrah!

465
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,400
-You managed to wait between bars.
-Yes, I ran up to them and then waited.

466
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,030
-That's amazing.
-Look, fits like a puzzle.

467
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,730
-That's the tactic I used.
-And it worked beautifully.

468
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,530
-Yes, I'm so happy. Thank you!
-Congrats!

469
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,870
-Thank you!
-Well done. Fantastic.

470
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,570
Only two warriors remain.

471
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,070
It's finally time
for these two to shoot their shot.

472
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Katsumi Yamada, aka Mr. Sasuke,
couldn't redeem himself

473
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,600
during the battles at the first castle.

474
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,430
Now he's back to try again
along with his sharpest pupil.

475
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,900
He knows what to expect now.

476
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,970
-This time I'll win and prove myself.
-You hear that?

477
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,930
We came shouldering the weight
of these titles on our chests.

478
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,830
We won't go quietly without a fight.

479
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,270
Yamada's back is against the wall
and he can't afford to lose.

480
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,170
The person he brought
to bolster him this time is...

481
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,970
-He's from Black Tigers.
-It's him.

482
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,370
Black Tigers is a fitness group
that Yamada mentors,

483
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,930
and Yoshiyuki Yamamoto
is the best of that crew.

484
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,900
-He's fantastic.
-In the Sasuke race,

485
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,470
he was the first to reach the finals
since the formation of the group.

486
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,170
He is Yamada's
most highly regarded protégé.

487
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,800
He's the best we've got
and is not to be underestimated.

488
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,170
THE BEST OF BLACK TIGERS
YOSHIYUKI YAMAMOTO (29)

489
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,500
Will he be able to live up
to Yamada's high expectations?

490
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,730
You got this!

491
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,230
-Here he comes.
-Good luck.

492
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,530
-Go, but take your time.
-Look how wobbly it is.

493
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,570
-Take your time.
-Look how wobbly it is.

494
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,070
Wait... Really?

495
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,800
Lame. That was lame.

496
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,800
He got ahead of himself,
lost balance and fell.

497
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,270
Yamamoto, the brightest pupil
of Katsumi Yamada...

498
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,430
Things didn't work out for him
like they did for Sasuke.

499
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,370
ONE WARRIOR REMAINING

500
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,070
Only one person has made it past
this stage.

501
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,970
Here to close out this round
is this legend.

502
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,570
Why is this so difficult?

503
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,170
I want to run through it
and get as far as I can.

504
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,530
-I see.
-Approaching it slowly is not my style.

505
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,200
-I'll use momentum.
-Like always.

506
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,770
MR. SASUKE
KATSUMI YAMADA (56)

507
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,600
-Here goes nothing.
-He's up. Go, Yamada.

508
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,530
Bring it on, Mr. Sasuke.
I've been waiting.

509
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,600
He's being cautious. Very cautious.

510
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,600
-Oh no.
-He's wobbling.

511
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,570
-This won't do.
-He can't afford to end there.

512
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,600
-He doesn't care.
-It's like he was walking the plank.

513
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,070
-What was that?
-What's the point?

514
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,030
What a pitiful way to go.

515
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,800
Seemingly prompted by nothing,
he immediately loses balance.

516
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:23,030
Then he plunges straight into the water
with an awkward plop.

517
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,970
Another unfortunate outcome
following his disaster in Strong Arms.

518
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,000
-I thought we'd have more fun with him...
-Me, too.

519
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,930
-That wasn't like him.
-That was quick even for Mr. Sasuke.

520
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,030
You couldn't get very far.

521
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,630
Yeah... I barely moved an inch, honestly.

522
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,700
-You were barely out the gate.
-I think so, too.

523
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,330
I couldn't make my mark once again.

524
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,370
ONE WARRIOR REMAINS

525
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,430
Only one warrior makes it past
From Right and Left.

526
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,900
-Only one?
-One warrior?

527
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,900
I hope the warriors charging the other
three strongholds are doing a better job.

528
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,230
Only one warrior?

529
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,330
Only one warrior made it out
of From Right and Left.

530
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,970
Everyone won in the first game
and now there's only one. Just one.

531
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,630
What did you think, my lord?

532
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,470
I hope they've realized how strong we are.

533
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:18,130
We let them have the first game.
Then we kicked them off their stool.

534
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,430
Why did we go from easy straight to
final boss level and nothing in between?

535
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,430
Let's see what the AI count thought.
AI Count!

536
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,570
That girl had the right idea
waiting between the bars.

537
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,470
-Okuma, was it?
-The one with boundless energy.

538
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,600
The entertainment industry works
in the same way.

539
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,130
You have to slide into open doors
before they close.

540
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,830
-Is that so?
-You have to slide in where you can.

541
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,230
-When you really think about it--
-Goodbye now.

542
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,570
-Our next game is Mushroom Plop.
-Classic.

543
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,400
GRAB HOLD OF THE MUSHROOM
AND LAND ON THE FLOATING ISLAND

544
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,900
We've seen it once.
Himura has already tried it.

545
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,370
-Yes, I did a test run.
-Really?

546
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:55,030
I tried grabbing onto it and
I couldn't even hold myself there.

547
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,130
-You couldn't get on to begin with?
-Yes, so I gave up.

548
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,230
That's how that went.

549
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,800
-It ended before you could start.
-Correct.

550
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,500
So I think this is going to give them
a hard time, too.

551
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,300
This will be the second appearance
of Mushroom Plop since Ueda Castle.

552
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:16,500
Most of the army met the fate
of being plunged into the pool,

553
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,500
but three brave warriors
won in that round.

554
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,800
However, this game has since been
modified to be harder.

555
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,000
REPORTER, NASUNAKANISHI DUO
SHIGEKI NAKANISHI

556
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,730
I, Nakanishi, will be reporting
for Mushroom Plop.

557
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,570
-What is this? Water?
-Who's attacking?

558
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,100
TAKESHI'S ARMY, DUO TOM BROWN
MICHIO &amp; HIROKI NUNOKAWA

559
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,200
Are you in charge of the hose this time?

560
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,000
-Yes, and we won't make it easy.
-What?

561
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,030
Watch this!

562
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,300
Help me!

563
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,830
MUSHROOM PLOP
DIFFICULTY RATING: 95%

564
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:02,530
This time, many of the global warriors
will try their hand at Mushroom Plop.

565
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:08,130
So we decided to host...
The Mushroom Plop World Cup Series.

566
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,600
ANNOUNCER
SHINYA SUGIYAMA FROM TBS

567
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,630
Will these brave warriors
and beloved fans of Takeshi's Castle

568
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,670
be able to defeat the formidable opponent
that is Mushroom Plop?

569
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,730
The Mushroom Plop World Cup Series
is finally under way.

570
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,430
HOKKAIDO UNIVERSITY GRADUATE STUDENT
FRANZISKA HEUMANN

571
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,370
Franziska Heumann, representing Germany.

572
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,200
Last April, she came to Japan
to attend Hokkaido University.

573
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,930
She enjoys kayaking and is confident
in her balancing capabilities.

574
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,030
Charge!

575
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,700
-Standing at 5'8" tall.
-I got this. I think.

576
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,570
HUG THE MUSHROOM AND LAND ON THE ISLAND

577
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,170
She was a fan of the show back in Germany.

578
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,830
-She could just fall, but it spins.
-Will she make it?

579
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,130
She's spinning quickly. She spins out
of control and slides off.

580
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,930
She spins out of control, slides off
and takes the plunge.

581
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,100
It's all about centrifugal force.

582
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,430
The key is to let go sooner
than you think.

583
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,270
Exactly. That's the trick.

584
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,500
The mushroom is spinning.
Her legs miss the island.

585
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:13,500
She slides into the water,
still spinning from the momentum.

586
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,470
MISSION FAILED

587
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,070
I was a little nervous.

588
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,170
-But it was lots of fun.
-That's good.

589
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,170
HOKKAIDO UNIVERSITY GRADUATE STUDENT
IVAN BALLIANA

590
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,270
Ivan Balliana, representing Italy.

591
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,070
He's proud of his pizza baking skills.

592
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,030
Will he reward himself
with a mushroom pizza party if he wins?

593
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,830
Allelomou!

594
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,700
-Ivan Balliana is off to the races.
-Go! Ivan! Go!

595
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,630
He's being hosed down. Can Ivan handle it?
Oh no, he takes the plunge.

596
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,700
-Here we go. Get it.
-No, too soon.

597
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,670
-I think the water made him slip.
-Got it.

598
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,400
He fell a good distance before the island.

599
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,900
An unexpected fall.

600
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,400
Was Tom Brown's water attack
too much for him?

601
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,900
Ivan Balliana falls well
before the target,

602
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,530
not even grazing its shiny, red surface.

603
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,170
MISSION FAILED

604
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,330
It was very difficult.

605
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,170
That was a good try.

606
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,300
SPORTS MANAGER
MANGO AMER

607
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:22,330
-Mango Amer, representing Jordan.
-All right!

608
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,330
He holds a black belt in judo.
Today, he's wearing his uniform.

609
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:28,900
Charge!

610
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,400
-Here I go!
-You got this!

611
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,500
He remembers watching Takeshi's Castle
as a kid in Jordan.

612
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:40,530
His special talent is that he can play
"Nada Soso". Mango Amer, will he make it?

613
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,530
There he goes, taking a dynamic plunge!

614
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,030
He falls into the pool,
spraying water in every direction.

615
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:57,130
Mango Amer clung tightly to the mushroom,
only to let go a little too late.

616
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,870
He may have made it if he'd let go sooner.

617
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,300
MISSION FAILED

618
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,630
I swallowed so much water.

619
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,330
SPANISH LANGUAGE TEACHER
DIANA HERRAIZ (34)

620
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,000
Mushroom Plop has been made harder
by adding the hosing attacks.

621
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,400
MISSION FAILED

622
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,630
Diana Herraiz, representing Spain
was up for the next round...

623
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,600
TECH COMPANY EMPLOYEE, SPAIN
JAVIER SÁNCHEZ DELGADO (31)

624
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,830
...followed by another Spanish warrior,
Javier Sánchez Delgado.

625
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,700
Two back-to-back losses.
Sadly, both failed.

626
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:32,200
No one could beat the new
and improved Mushroom Plop.

627
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,900
Only one international warrior remained.

628
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,900
MISSION FAILED

629
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,770
They're still letting go far too late.
They have to aim earlier.

630
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,770
TOHOKU UNIVERSITY GRADUATE STUDENT
DÁITHÍ Ó HAODHA

631
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,800
Dáithí Ó hAodha, representing Ireland.

632
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,800
Arriving in Japan four years ago, he's now
a graduate student at Tohoku University.

633
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,600
HAODHA'S GIRLFRIEND OF 5 YEARS
MIE SHIMBAYASHI (30)

634
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,200
-Good luck!
-You got this!

635
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,300
He and his girlfriend, Mie, both
came to compete at Takeshi's Castle.

636
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,330
He's trilingual in English, Japanese,
and Irish. Can he make it?

637
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,300
-And he slips!
-How could he not?

638
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,030
He had a good grip on the mushroom,
but he slipped.

639
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,400
He tries to grab hold of the island,
but could not stick a landing.

640
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:19,200
-We did nice work!
-The hosing attack has proven effective.

641
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:23,230
He was spinning before reaching
the target, the red island.

642
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,070
He landed on the island,
but couldn't manage to stay on it.

643
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,000
MISSION FAILED

644
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,730
I'm in despair. Seriously.

645
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,530
So far, six international warriors
have tried and none have succeeded.

646
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,730
Next, the Japanese warriors are up.

647
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,300
Here at The Mushroom Plop World Series,

648
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,200
it is now time for Japan
to make an appearance.

649
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,800
JAPAN'S EX SOCCER LEAGUE PLAYERS
MASAYUKI OKANO, SHOJI JO, YOSHITO OKUBO

650
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,330
Hailing from the Japanese
national soccer team,

651
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,370
these three legends are here
to joins us today.

652
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,570
-Really? They'll try it?
-What a glamorous cast.

653
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,230
Team Japan has gained
some powerful reinforcement.

654
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,630
In a last minute decision, we now have
warriors from the actual World Cup games.

655
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,670
They're legendary strikers who have
competed on the global stage,

656
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,030
and now they're at Takeshi's Castle
to land a perfect goal.

657
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,600
Wow, that's Okano.

658
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,600
EX NATIONAL LEAGUE SOCCER PLAYER
MASAYUKI OKANO

659
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,770
I don't care if he's a national hero
or whatever. He's going down.

660
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,030
Only one of us gets to have
luscious locks.

661
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,170
You should cut yours.

662
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,630
Let's go!

663
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,070
Also known as the Delight of Johor Bahru.

664
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:35,270
It's Okano, who scored the magic goal
taking Japan to the World Cup in France.

665
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,870
-That's amazing.
-Let's hope he takes home another win.

666
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,630
-Looking good.
-Will he bring uproarious joy once again?

667
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,730
The water has him spinning. Okano spins.
Can he make it? He plunges in head first.

668
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,330
-Wow. He had great aim, as expected.
-Masayuki Okano!

669
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,030
He makes a flashy splash as he falls
head first with legs spread wide.

670
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,470
The support warrior falls dynamically.

671
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,300
He falls from the Delight of Johor Bahru
into the pit of the Mushroom Tragedy.

672
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,430
MISSION FAILED

673
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,700
He slips and disappears.

674
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,530
-It's too funny not to laugh.
-I'm bummed.

675
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,670
You went down as if you were hit
by a ball from behind.

676
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,330
I thought I would land perfectly.

677
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,500
He's got a good sense of balance
even while spinning.

678
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,170
-I think so, too.
-It looks like the key is

679
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,400
-to fall forward once you let go.
-I agree.

680
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,230
I hate to say this,
but Jo has gained weight.

681
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,400
EX NATIONAL LEAGUE SOCCER PLAYER
SHOJI JO

682
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,900
Let go earlier than you think you should.

683
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,230
Keep your face
to the right while you're spinning.

684
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,230
Interesting.

685
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,400
-Jo, formerly representing Japan. Now 47.
-Go!

686
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,530
-Go, Jo! You can do it!
-He retired in 2006.

687
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,830
Jo, Jo!

688
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,600
Seventeen years since his retirement,
Shoji Jo is now at Takeshi's Castle.

689
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,200
Shoji Jo. Can he do it?
Can he hit the target?

690
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,870
-He plunges, back first.
-It's just too slippery.

691
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:00,130
Shoji Jo. He slipped and fell.

692
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,300
We did the same exact thing.

693
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:07,400
Jo is spinning. Is he too heavy?

694
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:11,270
He disappeared as if he was
being sucked into the water.

695
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,070
VIEWS OF OKANO VS JO

696
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,970
This made me more nervous
than the French World Cup.

697
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,970
-Really?
-Way more.

698
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,170
MISSION FAILED

699
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,600
That's what athletes tend to say.

700
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,670
-There's no way that's true.
-Exactly.

701
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,470
EX NATIONAL LEAGUE SOCCER PLAYER
YOSHITO OKUBO

702
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,900
-He only recently retired.
-True.

703
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,330
-You can't let go as easily as you think.
-No.

704
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,570
So let go completely and try to land
on your back.

705
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,970
-Okay. You think?
-You won't make it front facing.

706
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,030
You want to land on your back?

707
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,100
-He said so, didn't he?
-Yeah.

708
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,470
Representing Japan in the last round
of Mushroom Plop,

709
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:47,100
is our hopeful warrior, Yoshito Okubo.

710
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,770
Can he prove his worth
as an ancillary warrior?

711
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,800
-Yoshito!
-The crowd is cheering for him.

712
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:58,800
The last of three warriors to represent
Japan. He retired from soccer in 2021.

713
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,630
Top scorer, Okubo.
There he goes! And he slips!

714
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,970
-Did he make it?
-Was that a fail?

715
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,070
It's a fail.

716
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,870
He landed firmly on his back. But...

717
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,700
-Wow. That was close.
-So close.

718
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,100
He was close.

719
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,700
For a moment, we thought he'd made it.
Okubo's timing was perfect.

720
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,770
He lands firm and tries to stick
the landing by raising his legs.

721
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,030
MISSION FAILED

722
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,730
-But is dragged into the water.
-What a great try.

723
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,470
-You were so close. You were.
-Wasn't I? I made it onto the target.

724
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,170
What happened after I landed?

725
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,070
In soccer, the ball hit
the goal post and flew outside.

726
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,330
Oh no... People would have words for me.

727
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:46,130
This concludes
The Mushroom Plop World Cup Series.

728
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,830
The new and improved version
is now mind-blowingly difficult.

729
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,270
Will there be another warrior
to defeat it?

730
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,570

733
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,870
Good try.

734

ANIMATOR
CHANG SHIN YUAN (31)

735
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,000
Why is he pulling her out like that?

736
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,370
Hang in there.

737
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,030
COLLEGE STUDENT
YUITA (19)

738
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,930

GRADUATE STUDENT
MIE SHIMBAYASHI (30)

740
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,430
She's taking too long. Let go.

00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,300
BAND BOYS AND MEN TRAINEE
TAICHI UTSUMI (21)

742
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,470
So close!

743
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:33,000
The next warrior to face the new
and improved Mushroom Plop is...

744
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,270
In his third year of middle school,

745
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,430
he was the Nagano Prefecture Champion
in the 100-meter track and field event.

746
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,370
Haru Yamaguchi is currently a high school
student and an athlete in his prime.

747
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,630
CURRENTLY IN HIGH SCHOOL
HARU YAMAGUCHI (16)

748
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,400
My parents loved this show as kids
and I wanted to try it.

749
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,730
HIS SPECIAL SKILL IS ACROBATICS

750
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,930
During breaks, he warms up
with his favorite acrobatic moves

751
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,800
and watches past episodes
with his father for research.

752
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,270
FATHER - MINORU

753
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,100
He's done everything he can
to prepare for battle.

754
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,530
I'll beat this. Please root for me.

755
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,500
-I got this!
-Go get em'.

756
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:15,500
Will this youngster be the first
to beat the game?

757
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,770
-He might make it.
-I think so, too.

758
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,570
Grab it!

759
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,730
-He might make it.
-I think so, too.

760
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,830
Grab it, grab it!

761
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,930
Grab it, grab it!

762
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,130
Stay there. Don't slip. He did it!

763
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,530
He made it! Awesome!

764
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,270
Isn't it great to be young?

765
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,330
He took aim from a spinning mushroom
and landed beautifully.

766
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,500
A high school student, Haru Yamaguchi,
is the first warrior to beat the game!

767
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,730
He's awesome.

768
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,830
-Congrats. How was it?
-Thanks. Piece of cake.

769
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,030
-Easy peasy?
-Totally.

770
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,330
-You landed perfectly.
-Yeah, didn't I?

771
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,230
It's great to be young.
He doesn't mince his words.

772
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,600
What a great age.

773
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,230
Following that success...

774
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,530
HUGE FAN OF EISAKU YOSHIDA
RYOTA YOSHIDA (18)

775
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,930
Ryota Yoshida, who loves the actor,
Eisaku Yoshida, also beat the game.

776
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,930
-Wow. He landed and didn't move.
-And now two warriors have won.

777
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,270
Go, Yoshi!

778
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,870
-Fantastic!
-I feel great.

779
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,600
-Was it easy for you? Okay.
-So-so.

780
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,430
Two warriors beat Mushroom Plop, one
of the most difficult tasks for the army.

781
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,430
Go forth and overthrow Ennosuke Castle!

782
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:40,300
-We have two warriors remaining.
-Only two. Two people.

783
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,630
There was one warrior last time
and now two?

784
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,600
-How did this happen?
-This is a record.

785
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,030
Now we'll host the consolation games.

786
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,330
-Since we lost most of the army. Right.
-Yeah, down to three. Yeah.

787
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,230
We feel sorry for them.
Is it okay to let them play?

788
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,870
That's fine. Let them think we have mercy.

789
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,900
We'll give them some hope
and devastate them later.

790
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,230
I like that idea.

791
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,070
SIGN-UP FOR CONSOLATION GAMES HERE

792
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,930
Warriors who failed will randomly
be allocated to one of three games.

793
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,600
If you win,
you'll be able to return to the frontline.

794
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,300
You will compete
in the Slip-and-Slide Quiz.

795
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,930
Good luck!

796
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,930
That person was all business.

797
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,530
She couldn't cheer me on or anything?

798
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,700
TOKYO THEATER GIRLS
NAGI RINNO (24)

799
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,370
-I'll catch it. Let's go.
-She's from Tokyo Theater Girls.

800
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:40,400
You have to catch the ball
that you launched in this one.

801
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,700
At this point, you can't see it,
so you have to rely on your teammates.

802
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,670
Right. So if your buddies... Wait.

803
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,130
-Good try.
-I wanted her to dive face first.

804
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,470
-In the center.
-The center!

805
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,700
-Everyone tries to help.
-Then they dive.

806
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,670
-So close.
-The position was right.

807
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,230
I don't want to get muddy like that.

808
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,470
They supplied some good quality mud.

809
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:11,230
It's hard to get it to stick
to your face like that.

810
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,930
Now, the Slip-and-Slide Quiz.

811
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,530
-Question.
-You got this.

812
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,870
JULIANA NO TATARI
GINTARO YAJIMA (36)

813
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:19,730
-When is the Japanese holiday, Dog Day?
-Commit to an answer.

814
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,630
-A. January 11th.
-Okay.

815
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:27,130
B. November 1st.

816
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,630
-Dog Day is a holiday?
-Which one is it?

817
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,570
-Don't goof off.
-We need an answer, not a performance.

818
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,670
Dog Day?

819
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,400
-Come on, hurry!
-Yajima!

820
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,500
-It's B!
-Go!

821
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,500
CORRECT ANSWER
B: NOVEMBER 1ST.

822
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,200
-Oh no...
-How could you get that wrong?

823
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,530
-I chose C.
-It's Tug-of-War or Splash.

824
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,670
TAKESHI'S ARMY
TOHRU ONOJIMA &amp; KOSHIHIKARI MOCHIDA

825
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,600
-Hey, it's them.
-Now, for a special rule.

826
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,000
I thought it was someone else.

827
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,730
I'm Kato-pan, the news anchor.
Start the Music Festival!

828
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,070
-Kakenukete Keitora is the duo.
-Let's begin.

829
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,470
-He won't win.
-Ready, go!

830
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,100
There's no way... Wow! Be careful!

831
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,070
The winner, Takeshi's army.

832
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,570
Sorry! You're in last place.

833
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,800
-Did you think he'd fly that far?
-There's no way he could win.

834
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,830
DIEHARD FAN OF TAKESHI'S CASTLE, USA
JOSHUA MURPHY (31)

835
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,400
Hey, it's Murphy.

836
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,970
-Next up, he flew in just for this event.
-Good luck.

837
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,670
It's Takeshi's Castle's diehard fan,
Joshua Murphy.

838
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,070
-Hurry, hurry.
-Can he make it back to battle?

839
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,930
-Hurry. Get down there!
-He's too slow.

840
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,100
You'd better hurry.

841
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,570
-Come, diehard fan.
-Good catch!

842
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,900
It seemed he had caught the ball at first.

843
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,100
But the ball bounced back out when he
hit the ground. A painful mistake.

844
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,100
FIGHTING SPIRIT AWARD IS GIVEN TO PEOPLE
WITH NEAR WINS OR WHO TRIED THEIR HARDEST

845
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,870
EVEN AFTER FAILING, YOU CAN MOVE
TO THE NEXT ROUND

846
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,270
But he's given the Fighting Spirit Award
for coming so close.

847
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:04,400
Good luck in your next game, Joshua!

848
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,630
GOLDEN BOMBER
YUTAKA KYAN (37)

849
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,770
I made it here purely by luck.
I hope luck earns me a win.

850
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,400
-Let's go!
-Good luck, Kyan!

851
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:16,630
Which historical period lasted longer?

852
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,930
-A. Edo period.
-I don't know either.

853
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,070
-B. Heian period.
-Is it B?

854
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,170
CORRECT ANSWER
B. HEIAN PERIOD

855
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,270
RETURNS TO BATTLE

856
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:29,770
-He did it. He's back in the game.
-Well done!

857
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,370
BACK FROM BATTLE 1 &amp; 2
CHIITAN (ETERNALLY 0 YEARS OLD)

858
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,230
-Chiitan.
-We hadn't seen her in a while.

859
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,430
TAKESHI'S ARMY
DONGURI TAKESHI

860
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,400
-Thanks for coming.
-Good luck, Chiitan!

861
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,570
Chiitan! I'll eat you like string cheese.

862
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,230
He's that solo act guy.

863
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,870
-Come and get it, then.
-Chiitan is ready to fight.

864
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,530
Ready, go!

865
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,270
-Chiitan is strong. Hold on.
-She's that strong?

866
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,730
Chiitan has muscles.

867
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,730
-Beware of Chiitan.
-Oh no, Chiitan...

868
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,330
Oh no, Chiitan... What are you doing?

869
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,570
RETURNS TO BATTLE

870
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:05,670
With an unexpected comeback,
Chiitan is headed back to battle.

871
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:08,230
-Brilliant job!
-Chiitan is back in the game.

872
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,370
-I have a thought about Chiitan.
-Yes?

873
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:15,130
Couldn't they change the person inside
to suit the game?

874
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,000
True. That is an option.

875
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,970
Has the same person played Chiitan
this whole time?

876
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:23,300
I don't think so. The Chiitan we just saw
is someone we've never seen.

877
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,200
I guess they're cheating.
This version was way too strong.

878
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,230
-Well, she's back in now.
-I guess so.

879
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,770
-Our next game is the Dragon God's Pond.
-All right, I've been waiting.

880
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,670
A TAKESHI'S CASTLE CLASSIC, USE THE STONES
TO GET ACROSS THE POND

881
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,970
-Here it comes. It's here.
-Look at that.

882
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:42,000
DRAGON GOD'S POND
DIFFICULTY RATING: 100%

883
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:47,400
We're Boys and Men from Nagoya!

884
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:49,330
We're here to take the nation by storm!

885
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,400
-Hey, it's them.
-The idol group from Nagoya, Boys and Men.

886
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,000
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

887
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,430
THE TEAM'S AUDITION FOOTAGE

888
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,030
The group made their own decision
to apply to the show.

889
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,000
They won't be paid
and are paying their own expenses.

890
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,400
Their passion for Takeshi's Castle
is unmatched.

891
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,770
TEAM BOYS AND MEN: MASATO YOSHIHARA,
KENTO HIRAMATSU, TATSUNORI TSUJIMOTO

892
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:15,230
I want to show people what we can do
and hope they come to like Boys and Men.

893
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,830
Boys and Men for life!

894
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,130
SKIP OVER STONES TO THE GOAL
IF YOU FALL, YOU FAIL

895
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,730
TEAM BOYS AND MEN
MASATO YOSHIHARA (28)

896
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,200
-Hang in there. He's making it happen.
-Good job.

897
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,830
-Oh no, he failed.
-He got past the first wobbly one.

898
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:33,670
What a shame.

899
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:35,300
TEAM BOYS AND MEN
YUHI (29)

900
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:36,900
-Nagoya in my soul!
-Go get em'.

901
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,830
-Do it for Nagoya.
-Good luck!

902
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,300
-Two at once?
-Not that stone. It's a trap.

903
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:43,970
Everyone steps on that one.

904
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,470
They put the wobbly ones
where people naturally want to step.

905
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:48,900
-I think you're right.
-Hello!

906
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:51,830
-Go. He's fast!
-Yeah. From that way.

907
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,400
-He's so fast!
-He's doing great.

908
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,830
-Go on that side.
-He's doing great.

909
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,370
TEAM BOYS AND MEN
KENTO HIRAMATSU (27)

910
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,330
So frustrating.

911
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,570
The Dragon God's Pond is
a Takeshi's Castle favorite,

912
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,330
but it's seen some major improvements.

913
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,530
At the battles of Ueda Castle,
we learned that this game

914
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,470
is now significantly more difficult
than it used to be.

915
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:20,130
The furthest the army could get
was half way,

916
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,500
and none of them could beat this game.

917
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,800
However, Hiramatsu from Boys and Men,

918
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:30,330
so far has broken the record
for the longest run.

919
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,170
We hope that someone from their group
can beat the game this round.

920
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,030
I won't stop!

921
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,030
TEAM BOYS AND MEN
YUKIHISA TAMURA (31)

922
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,770
He might make it. Wow!

923
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,300
Oh no. Just one more step!

924
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,670
He might make it. Wow!

925
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,070
Just one more step!

926
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,100
That was so close!

927
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:01,370
-He practically touched the finish line.
-Seriously? He failed.

928
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:04,670
-With one stone left...
-I'm so bummed.

929
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,500
-I bet.
-So frustrating.

930
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,430
-Did it feel like you had it?
-Honestly, yes.

931
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,070
I thought I could make it.
But my last step landed in the water.

932
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,130
You got this, Honda!

933
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,230
So far, no one from the team has made it.

934
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,200
They've put all their hopes into Honda,
their last warrior.

935
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,500
Go! He's fast! Good.

936
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,570
TEAM BOYS AND MEN
TAKAFUMI HONDA (29)

937
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:24,900
Looking good.

938
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,770
-He might make it!
-He's close.

939
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,870
-He's got this!
-Oh no!

940
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,530
So close.

941
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,400
-Oh no! So close.
-That's the culprit.

942
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:36,230
-He's got this!
-Oh no!

943
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,800
So close!

944
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,170
Why, Honda!

945
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,000
What happened in the end?

946
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,770
Well, my leg wasn't long enough.

947
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,400
I knew which way I needed to go.
I saw it clearly. But I couldn't reach it.

948
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,970
-You just missed the last stone.
-It was close.

949
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,470
-If you could've put your foot on that...
-I would've had it.

950
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,930
But these are the limbs I was given.

951
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,070
-My potential was limited from the get go.
-But you're an idol.

952
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:03,900
But I don't have long legs.

953
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,930
NEXT EPISODE, ENNOSUKE CASTLE
THE FINAL BATTLE

954
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,230
Will someone finally beat
the Dragon God's Pond?

955
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,630
And Kyoko Hamaguchi
will be back on a rampage,

956
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,400
this time, with her dad, Animal Hamaguchi.

957
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:17,900
Will they overthrow Ennosuke Castle
in the final battle?

958
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:18,900
Go!

959
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,570
SUPPORTING ARMY
BEHIND THE SCENES

960
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,500
FORMER JAPAN NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM TRIO

961
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,070
-The timing for that is tricky.
-Isn't it?

962
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,770
As a representative of the soccer world,
one of us has to make it.

963
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:35,230
That would be nice.

964
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,570
THEY REPRESENTED SOCCER PLAYERS
IN THE WORLD SERIES

965
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:41,070
You even looked nervous.

966
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:48,070
-It's okay to succeed, right?
-Yeah.

967
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:52,500
GRADUALLY, THEIR SPORTSMANSHIP
CAUGHT FIRE!

968
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,800
-Yoshito did great.
-Yeah. He did well.

969
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:56,070
A DISASTROUS DEFEAT BUT
THEY HANDLED IT LIKE CHAMPS

970
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,270
-That was frustrating.
-But we almost had it.

971
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:01,930
But it's fantastic that we get to be
in a show that we used to watch.

972
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,070
Here I go. Blizzard!

973
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:07,570
JP WHO ACTUALLY TRIED
MANY OTHER THINGS

974
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:15,400
HE GAVE THE GAMES
AND HIS IMPERSONATIONS HIS ALL

975
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:17,700
The winner is Takeshi's army!

976
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,400
I've had enough. I'll take a water bath
on my balcony.

977
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,070
MOOD-MAKER OF THE ARMY,
YUTAKA KYAN

978
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,800
-Let's do our best!
-Sure!

979
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:35,370
HE DIDN'T PERFORM WELL...

980
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,970
Damn it. I'm frustrated.

981
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,400
HE RETURNED TO BATTLE
THROUGH A CONSOLATION GAME

982
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:47,430
I made it!

983
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:50,070
AFTER THE CONSOLATION GAME

984
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,830
-You made it.
-Thanks!

985
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,530
I'm feeling much better now!

986
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:56,870
