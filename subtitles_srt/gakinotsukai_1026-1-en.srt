1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,530
They said "you guys buy them"

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,600
They said "buy them"

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,380
So Japan bought them

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,660
Shut up you two!

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,660
In this episode, they will point out things they see and spout some trivia

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,660
There's gotta be something about bowling

7
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,630
Incidentally they would give turkeys as presents to those that got 3 strikes

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:27,360
So that caught on with young people

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,360
The heavenly voice verifies their trivia

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,730
And on this drive,

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,530
the end won't come until they've accumulated 100 trivia

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,860
Starting at Shiodome, in front of NTV, they got off to a good start,

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,300
The roller bags these days can spin in multiple directions ... it's convenient

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,600
No shit!

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,960
The quality of the trivia started to drop

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,300
Tanaka rescued them from this pinch!

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,660
Something about Condors,

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,730
There it is, the animal trivia

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,230
This is gonna be good

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,730
Crows can manipulate around 40 words

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,930
What do you mean "manipulate"?

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,130
Even inside the Family Restaurant they took a break in, he continued with the animal trivia

23
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:27,620
Trivia Count

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,460
2 hours since the start, they've come up with 45 trivia

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,060
However, sometimes they can't come up with anything

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,930
Yamsaki is forcefully supressing his sexual desires right now

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,600
He almost jumped at an old lady's ass at the bank

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,760
Wrong! Wrong!

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,500
Will they be able to get 100 trivia?!

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:59,980

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:07,260
Trivia Drive, 2 hours since the start. They head out on National Route 1 once again

32
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,860
Drive A GO GO!

33
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,860
TN: "Drive A GO GO!" is a show Hosei appears on

34
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,300
Why?

35
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,660
Why did he say that?

36
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:26,700
Trivia Count so far:  45

37
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,900
They are still far away from their goal of 100

38
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,430
I can't remember where I heard this,

39
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,630
They say men in their 40s think of sex once every 4 minutes

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,400
It really pissed me off

41
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,160
As a representative of men in their 40s, allow me to say,

42
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,630
That's totally incorrect

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,830
Definitely incorrect right?

44
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,000
That's impossible, every 4 minutes

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,330
There's no way it's every 4 minutes

46
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,230
There's a McDonald's there

47
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,140
Oh, what is it?

48
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,030
You know the McShake?

49
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,500
When it first came to Japan, it was really mediocre, and unpopular

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,530
So they changed something and it exploded in popularity

51
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,060
They changed the straw,

52
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,800
Ahh I see

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,380
They made the straw fatter, and the size they changed it to,

54
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:34,260
They made the size similiar to the average female nipple size

55
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:41,030
They made the suction required similiar to that required to drink milk from a mother's breast,

56
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,030
And it took off after that

57
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:49,580
The McShake became popular after they changed the straw

58
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,560
Oh wow

59
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,830
As expected

60
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,630
Alright more on McDonald's

61
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:53,400
When they first came to Japan, I think DownTown-san would've been in highschool

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,060
Do you know how much 1 hamburger used to cost?

63
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,700
Around 500 yen?

64
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,100
It was 1 dollar,

65
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,600
360 yen

66
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,020
I see!

67
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,230
That's cool right?

68
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:17,740
The price of a McDonald's burger in Japan was 80 yen

69
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,060
Wow really? That was...

70
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,360
Asshole!

71
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,360
No way!

72
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,660
Pull over and let us out

73
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,660
Let us out asshole!

74
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,800
So 1 dollar used to be fixed to 360 yen right?

75
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,430
Do you know why they decided on 360 yen?

76
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,900
Americans didn't understand anything about Japanese culture,

77
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,860
So when they were considering how many yen a dollar should be,

78
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,780
TN: The character 円 for "Yen" can also mean Circle ("En")

79
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,780
They said, let's base it on the circle

80
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,360
360 degrees

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,830
Ehh?!

82
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:57,340
Between 1949-1971 based on a fixed exchange rate 360 Yen = 1 USD

83
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,800
Let us off!

84
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,100
Get out of the car asshole!

85
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,400
Let's change drivers

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,200
You better cut it out

87
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,500
Eh? What's going on with me today...

88
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,800
You really gotta knock it off

89
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,660
There's a poster of an Elephant on that convenience store

90
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,900
Stop forcing animal topics like that!

91
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,900
You're really forcing this

92
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,130
An elephant's nose and upper lip stretch out as one piece

93
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,180
They're the same part, the upper lip and the nose

94
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,760
Tanaka's stories are so disturbing!

95
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:20,860
An elephant's upper lip and nose are attached

96
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,860
Like the bald vultures

97
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,860
We're halfway done

98
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,130
Aoyama Clothing

99
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,260
It reminds you of Miura Tomokazu right?

100
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,260
Yes indeed

101
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,830
So we can go from Miura Tomokazu -> to Momoe-chan

102
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:42,500
So everyone thinks Momeo-chan's last concert was at Budokan, where she left the mic and said "See ya", right?

103
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,060
In fact the actual last show was 2 days later on the Show "Yoru no Hit Studio"

104
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,300
That was the last one

105
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,160
Eh? Really?

106
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,960
Hit Studio was the very last one

107
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Ah, is that so?

108
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,140
Momoe-chan's last concert was on Yoru no Hit Studio

109
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,900
Ah that felt nice

110
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,500
Cause everyone thinks the Budokan was the end right?

111
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
A train just passed by

112
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,140
Trivia Count: 50

113
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,230
Oh yeah, we're heading towards Yokohama

114
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Ah, oh yeah,

115
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,000
You see that roadsign, I'm not sure if it applies to that too, but,

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,100
You know those male female symbols for washrooms?

117
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,000
They originated in Japan

118
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,060
I think it started with the 1970 Osaka Expo

119
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,130
Ahhh the World Expo?

120
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,530
It was easier for foreigners to understand symbols instead of writing

121
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,260
At the Osaka Expo? Wow!

122
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,260
Yes yes

123
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:40,780
Washroom male female signs originated in Japan

124
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,360
Wow!

125
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,630
I didn't know that!

126
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,130
Ah, you see the Yokohama Landmark Tower?

127
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,030
That's the tallest building in the world

128
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,460
Actually, at 296 metres it's the tallest building in Japan

129
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,780
Ah, tallest in Japan?

130
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,300
Won't the Skytree surpass it?

131
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,700
It will be the world's tallest Broadcast Tower, at 634 metres

132
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,900
Endo you're so smart!

133
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,600
That's amazing? Wow, the tallest Broadcast Tower?

134
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:08,020
Yokohama Landmark Tower:  tallest building in Japan (296m)
Tokyo Skytree:  Tallest Broadcast Tower in the world (634m)

135
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,760
Endo's counter was great just now

136
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,500
I was like *pow* *pow*

137
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,260
There's Yokohama Stadium

138
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,830
It's Yokohama Stadium

139
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,860
Yokohama Stadium huh?

140
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,230
Do you know why Baseball has 9 innings?

141
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,930
I don't know either

142
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:27,300
In the past, after the game both teams would come together and have dinner

143
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,960
And the guy that would cook for both teams,

144
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,130
He would finish cooking lots of tasty things usually by the 9th inning

145
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,660
And the cook got pissed, he said "When are you gonna eat?!"

146
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,400
"My food is gonna get cold!"

147
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,560
So that's where the 9 innings started

148
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Wow, that's why?

149
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:55,180
Baseball has 9 innings because a cook complained

150
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,330
Oh it's true!

151
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,300
I didn't know that

152
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,500
How does this guy know that?

153
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,460
Trivia Count:  57 + 1

154
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,900
2.5 hours since the start,

155
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,860
They begin to exhaust their collection of trivia

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,960
So in order to think of more themes, they head to Yokohama Chinatown!

157
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,860
What kind of trivia will the be able to come up with?!

158
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,560
Well, it is useful to be on the street

159
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,300
Yeah

160
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,930
This is a "Chinatown" right?

161
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,660
Yeah a Chinatown

162
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,530
But there's nothing here!

163
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,560
Gold medal!

164
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,860
Ah, a gold medal

165
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,630
Gold medals are made of silver aren't they?

166
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,560
Entirely silver?

167
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,430
Gold medals are made of silver?

168
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:50,100
Gold medals are made of silver

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,330
Yup

170
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,560
Ehh that's amazing!

171
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,060
They're made to look gold

172
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,530
TN: Sangokushi is a manga adaptation of The Romance Of The Three Kingdoms

173
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,530
You know the word "Aho" (idiot) from Sangokushi?

174
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,430
"Ato" was the name of Shu Han's child (character in the manga)

175
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:06,130
And that kid was really reckless, so in Japan "Ato" became "Aho"

176
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,460
It became "Aho"?

177
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,020
The etymology of "Aho" comes from the name "Ato"

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
Wow!

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,300
What the hell man? Stick to animals!

180
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,760
Yeah!

181
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
I'm so disappointed

182
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,600
Cause I saw that thing

183
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,430
Tanaka actually really likes Sangokushi

184
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,300
He does like it

185
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,260
Anything, anything could work...

186
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,060
Umm, this pig here...

187
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,100
We think pigs are fat right?

188
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,860
We have that image right?

189
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,100
They're mostly muscle

190
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,460
No way!

191
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,830
So when we call fat people pigs...

192
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,530
It's very rude to pigs

193
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,260
Cause it's muscle?

194
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,600
They have the same body fat percentage as models

195
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,180
Pigs are mostly muscle

196
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,730
Really?

197
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,730
Wow!

198
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,400
I wanna say something about Chahan or something

199
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,560
Yeah

200
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,530
Ah, shark fin..

201
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:08,060
Sharks are cartilaginous fish,

202
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,500
So the only fossils they leave behind are their teeth

203
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:23,940
Since sharks are cartilaginous,
only their teeth remain as fossils

204
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,860
Yeah so ... That "aho" fact was unnecessary

205
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,230
Just animal facts

206
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Yeah!

207
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,060
That "Aho" was unnecessary!

208
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,300
I just like Sangokushi

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,560
Hello!

210
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,560
I can't come up with anything

211
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:40,260
Peking Duck, is actually just the skin

212
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,960
Yeah of course

213
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,600
You knew that already of course

214
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,260
It was too shallow a fact

215
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,160
A bit too shallow

216
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,780
There it is!

217
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,900
Panda!
There's a lot of Pandas here

218
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,100
We have this image they only eat bamboo, but their omnivores so they eat things like bugs too

219
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,630
They eat insects

220
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:02,420
Pandas are omnivores and eat also insects

221
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,630
They're omnivores huh?

222
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,430
Yeah, they eat insects too

223
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,330
There was a photo of Agnes-chan there,

224
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,160
Agnes-chan can actually speak Japanese really well

225
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,500
Well yeah, she just has an accent

226
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,630
Ah, Shozo might know about this

227
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,660
Ahh yeah!

228
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,560
Matsumoto-san speak about that please, that Dragon

229
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,600
The "Touch the reverse scale"?

230
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,430
Dragons have a single scale under their chin that's in the reverse direction

231
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,560
So if you flick that, the dragon gets really angry!

232
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:46,460
Dragons
have a single scale under their chin that goes against the grain

233
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:46,460
The phrase "Touch the reverse scale"

234
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,400
That's where the phrase came from?

235
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,600
That's where it came from

236
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,460
As they say

237
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,460
Wow!

238
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,100
Manholes are round so they don't fall down

239
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,430
If it was rectangular it would fall down if it wasn't aligned

240
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,800
But circles are always aligned and it never falls

241
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,660
I see!

242
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,930
Ah that one felt great!

243
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,580
Manholes are circular to prevent falling

244
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,860
That one felt great

245
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,960
With the help of Tanaka and Matsumoto, the 5 continue to accumulate trivia

246
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,660
They get back in the car, and set off on National Route 1 once again

247
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,380
Trivia Count: 69

248
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,630
We're almost done

249
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,400
We're almost done

250
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,940
Finally, 69

251
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,760
Well in the worst case, we stick to animals and Tanaka does the rest

252
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,340
That's true

253
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,330
I'm sure we'll finish in no time!

254
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,560
Tanaka definitely knows 30 animal facts

255
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,060
Nissan...

256
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,820
Carlos Ghon...

257
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,660
You know Carlos Ghon, even though he looks like that, is NOT a sea turtle

258
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,660
He doesn't make an animal call after laying eggs

259
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,060
He's definitely a sea turtle

260
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,260
Shall I say something about sea turtles then?

261
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,830
We have this image that turtles tuck their heads and limbs into their shell right?

262
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,800
Sea turtles don't do that

263
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,560
A lot of people don't know this,

264
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,700
They put their limbs to the sides right?

265
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,700
They put them to the side, yes

266
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:17,630
Land turtles chose to defend themselves by entering their shell,

267
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,160
Sea turtles chose to escape quickly by swimming

268
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,760
Ah I see, they gotta defend themselves after all

269
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:31,420
Sea turtles don't enter their shell

270
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,060
Ah, that reminds me of something

271
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,130
Sharks often attack humans right?

272
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,730
So the mo-

273
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,730
They don't often do that though

274
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,730
They often attack,

275
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,830
I have heard about such incidents

276
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,830
Only a few times though

277
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,700
And often, surfers-

278
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,760
It's not often, though

279
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,730
Sharks really go after surfers,

280
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,830
Do you know why?

281
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,460
I think I've heard about this

282
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,730
Oh I don't know

283
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,860
Turtles are shark's favourite food

284
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,030
And if you look at a surfer on a board from below, they look like turtles

285
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,600
And that's why they get attacked

286
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,930
I see

287
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,600
That's true

288
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:18,500
Surfers when paddling
look like turtles to sharks

289
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,960
We're finally in the 70s

290
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,960
First time he got it

291
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,300
It's not my first time!

292
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,900
A gorilla, look there

293
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,500
Gorillas ....

294
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,630
They can be gay sometimes

295
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:39,540
Gorillas can be gay

296
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,960
Wow, Gorillas are like that?

297
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,540
Tanaka you're incredible!

298
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,000
Wow, finally

299
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,940
Trivia Count: 78

300
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,630
Wow, we're only 6km from Totsuka

301
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,130
Oh crap. What about Totsuka Yacht School?

302
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,630
Totsuka Yacht School...

303
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,330
Trucks, there's Isuzu trucks there,

304
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,700
The three lamps they have on top, they indicate the speed

305
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,830
Ah yeah, that's right

306
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,260
20 - 40 - 60 km/h

307
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,660
Yes, that one is indicating 40 km/h

308
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,830
Ah, is that why?

309
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:14,260
The 3 lamps on trucks indicate speed

310
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,630
Like that one right?

311
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,630
Yeah, the middle light is out

312
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,200
Woah, that's what that means

313
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,860
So Takeda Tetsuya looked at those lights and said "I ain't gonna die!" - He knew he'd be fine

314
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,860
TN: Reference to the film "101st Proposal" in which Takeda Tetsuya jumps in front of a truck and survives

315
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,860
"I'll be fine if that hits me"

316
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,980
After this

317
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,980
They get to 100?!

318
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,630
"It's only going 40 km/h"

319
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,900
Trivia Count: 90

320
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,120
It's gonna be rather difficult to finish this off

321
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,230
Just 10 left

322
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,530
It's gotten really difficult

323
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,430
There aren't as many billboards and stuff

324
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,960
KYOLEOPIN

325
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,960
TN: KYOLEOPIN is a health drink

326
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,160
Imada got smacked by Hamada cause of that

327
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,830
The KYOLEOPIN incident

328
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,530
What happened?

329
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,630
Imada was told "Go buy some KYOLEOPIN"

330
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,060
And he didn't know what that was

331
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,860
"KYOLEOPIN?"

332
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,460
"KYOLEOPIN!"

333
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,030
He didn't know how it was spelled either

334
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,630
He didn't think it was a Katakana word

335
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:07,000
So he asked for KYOLEOPIN, and he got something that might be it. He thought "Well this'll do"

336
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,460
But Hamada said "THIS AIN'T KYOLEOPIN!"

337
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,800
And then slapped the shit out of him

338
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,830
That was more or less the first time they met

339
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,460
I think that's pretty good trivia

340
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,500
Can I use the fact that I'm feeling sleepy?

341
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,430
Yes, please

342
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:36,900
When you want to sleep, there's the sheep counting right? "Sheep 1, sheep 2"

343
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,560
The reason it's sheep - In English, 羊 means "Sheep"

344
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,460
And 寝る is "Sleep" - So because the words are similiar, it makes you sleep

345
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,060
So Japanese people are weird then

346
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,730
They are

347
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:04,820
The reason behind counting sheep is
because sheep sounds like sleep

348
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,800
There we go!

349
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,600
There are some people that I think can't tell the difference between sheep and goats,

350
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,660
The most obvious thing is the goats live in high places,

351
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,330
And sheep live in pretty flat lands

352
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,930
You can tell by looking though

353
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,260
Goat

354
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,260
Sheep

355
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,560
Some people can't I guess

356
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,060
Yes,

357
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,060
Water Bugs (Tagame) and those other ones are also hard to distinguish,

358
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:31,860
Water Bug

359
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,430
Diving Beetles? (Gengoro)

360
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:31,860
Diving Beetles

361
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,930
Diving Beetles and Water Bugs are hard to tell apart,

362
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,660
So there's a way to tell,

363
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,660
There was a clear difference between them, but I have clearly forgotten

364
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,560
Clearly forgotten

365
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,360
Kengoro is my dad's name

366
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,230
My dad and the father of Hiromi from B-21 were in the same class at school

367
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,460
Eh?!

368
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,200
That's my trivia

369
00:17:48,460 --> 00:18:01,780
Hamada's dad was in the same class as B-21 Hiromi's dad

370
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,130
And they both went to Tosoya?

371
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,060
My dad went to Tosoya, his dad went to Daiiku

372
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,830
Ah Daiiku

373
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,330
That's amazing

374
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,730
My older sister, and Tsutsumi Shinichi (actor),

375
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,530
Were in the same grade at the same high school

376
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,760
Just leave that for the last 6

377
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Tsutsumi's friend said they liked me,

378
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,030
And they came over to my house,

379
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:24,130
And I've recently they're now a story teller in Kansai

380
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,030
So hard to follow!

381
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,820
Trivia Count:  95

382
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,060
There's nothing at all out here!

383
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,230
Yeah...

384
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,100
Damn this is getting worse

385
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,430
We're in the last 10

386
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,560
Ah, there it is, an ambulance

387
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,200
Ambulance!

388
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,200
119 (Japanese emergency number)

389
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,930
Do you know about the 110 number? (Calls the police)

390
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,730
What about it?

391
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,130
In the past, they used rotary phones right?

392
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,860
1 and 0 are the farthest numbers on the dial,

393
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,630
So it takes time to dial 1, 1

394
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,000
They picked the farthest numbers?

395
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,030
Yes, so you can take the time to think calmly

396
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,460
Like "Do I really need the police"?

397
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,260
Yes, something like that

398
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:22,100
They picked 110 because 0 is far from the 1 so you can take that time to think calmly

399
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,400
I

400
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,860
Just 4 more...

401
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,440
I think that's not good though, it should be faster to dial

402
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,730
Yeah, so you don't have to think

403
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,230
Hold on, I really,

404
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,980
Trivia Count: 96

405
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,900
REALLY don't want to keep driving

406
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah, we've traveled really far

407
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,000
Just 4 more!

408
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,400
Can I use the topic of phones?

409
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:38,660
In the past, when Japan first got phones

410
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,430
The phone numbers weren't multiple digits long

411
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,660
And the most famous example,

412
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,800
"Castella is #1, Phone is #2, 3:00PM Snacks from Bunmeido"

413
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,800
TN: Bunmeido is a snack company

414
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,400
That was Bunmeido's number, if you asked to be connected to #2 in Shinjiku,

415
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,000
It would connect to them

416
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:09,700
Shinjiku's #2 was Bunmeido's number

417
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,960
3 more left

418
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,260
Finally, the last 3

419
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Anything is-Ah a Tanuki just ran by!

420
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,860
A Tanuki?

421
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,200
Liar!

422
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,100
From the mountains, see!

423
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,830
Stop lying!

424
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,860
It's the lost continent of Mu, see there

425
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,100
The Mu Continent?

426
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,500
On the billboard there

427
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,130
There might be something about the Mu Continent

428
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,930
Game? Okay I got something

429
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,400
Do you remember when that game "Seaman" was popular?

430
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,400
Oh yeah, I remember

431
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,930
Do you know what happens at the very end?

432
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:45,580
Seaman

433
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,660
I don't, tell us please

434
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,560
He turns into a frog

435
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,600
No way, a frog? What kind?

436
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,600
Really?!

437
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,500
He turns into a frog with a human face

438
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:52,380
Seaman turns into Frogman

439
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,200
He ends up as a frog?

440
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,260
He ends up as a frog

441
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,460
Just 2 more!

442
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,260
Well the last one, it would nice to end on a high note

443
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,260
Yeah, a high note

444
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,900
If you say something like that, we'll never finish!

445
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,420
Trivia Count:  98

446
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,860
Shizuoka...

447
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,500
There's a lot to say about Shizuoka

448
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,860
I'm gonna end up in Shizuoka

449
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,800
It's gonna be a pain to get back

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,040
Yes, it will

451
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,430
Harajuku Park 3...

452
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,260
The guy on the bike that passed us had a Seahorse on his jacket

453
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,760
Don't lie!

454
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,730
No really! He did! The camera could confirm it

455
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,500
It was a blue jacket

456
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,760
We gotta confirm that first

457
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,600
But we're in a jam, he might've gone ahead

458
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,100
Alright, say your Seahorse trivia

459
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
The thing about Seahorses,

460
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,900
The one who gets pregnant is not the female, but the male

461
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,260
The female deposits her eggs into the male,

462
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,830
And the offspring grow inside the male's body

463
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,800
It's the male's role to reproduce!

464
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,940
Male seahorses are the one that get pregnant

465
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,900
I want to confirm that jacked though

466
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,200
Yeah, we gotta confirm that somehow

467
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm very certain it was a seahorse

468
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,560
Tanaka has the worst eyesight too...

469
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,260
That's true, the one with the worst eyesight...

470
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,460
Alright!

471
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,940
After this:  The final trivia?!

472
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,130
Last one!

473
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,200
Last one!

474
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,460
Trivia Count: 99

475
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,360
Should be a good trivia for the last one

476
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,060
Yeah

477
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,860
Something as good as the Turkey one

478
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,030
It sucks now there's traffic

479
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,400
Yeah that's true

480
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,530
Whale! It's a whale!

481
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,630
Yeah, it's a whale!

482
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,200
There is! For real, a whale!

483
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,060
There's a dolphin too

484
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,130
Ah, this is a good one

485
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,820
Which one should I pick? What should I do!

486
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,820
Pick a good one, for the ending

487
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,730
Hurry! Before the signal changes!

488
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:43,800
Generally, dolphins and whales are the same species,

489
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,400
Under 4m is a Dolphin, and over that is a whale!

490
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,000
It's kind of underwhelming

491
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,630
No, that's not it, that's not it

492
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,660
He even said "generally"

493
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,430
That's not it right?

494
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,030
Whales...Ah that's not it!

495
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,100
Umm, no that's not it

496
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,930
Calm down Tanaka, calm down

497
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,660
This is one of those situations

498
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,000
Whales, you guys know this,

499
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,700
Their nose, their nose is on their back right?

500
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,500
They shoot water out of there-

501
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,030
That's their nose?!

502
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,500
I didn't know that

503
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,360
THAT is amazing!

504
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,830
That's their nose?

505
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,400
"You know their nose?" you say...

506
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,730
That's their nose?!

507
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,730
That's their nose

508
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,660
Wow!

509
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:35,420
Whale holes are their noses

510
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,600
We did it!

511
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,400
What kind of ending is this?!

512
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,600
I didn't know that was their nose

513
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,900
"You know they have their noses there" - You're amazing man!

514
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,060
You're too advanced!

515
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,200
4 hours 41 minutes after leaving NTV,

516
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:45,540
100 Trivia Accumulated!

517
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:45,540
4 hours 41 minutes after starting

518
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,100
They finally got 100 trivia!

519
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,460
He was so many steps ahead,

520
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,230
"You know their nose right?"

521
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,730
He was touching his back, I was so confused

522
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,360
That was impressive enough on it's own!

523
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,820
Why did you start with the thing about Dolphins and Whales?

524
