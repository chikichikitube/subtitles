2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,880
I want to summon up all of my 46 years of living.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:15,060
For Housei's 46 birthday he's doing a 24 hour long interview!

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:13,490
Narrator:
Yamada
Shinichi

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,330
Speaking about his whole life,

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,170
he will talk for 24 hours straight, this is a new challenge.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,240
Loads of unknown stuff from his past!

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,410
When I was in middle school, I bought like 'eccentric clothing for delinquients'.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,010
For real?

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,080
Are you mucking about?

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,420
7 HOURS SINCE THE START

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,420
I formed the band in 1st year.

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,820
What kind of activities did you do?

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,460
We performed in a studio.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,790
In front of people?

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,790
Well, we didn't perform in front of people but...

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,770
The interview continues without rest for 15 hours

18
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,900
Time seems to stop for him...

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,340
As he starts to reach his limit, he continues to talk.

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:13,020
An emotional episode about Tsukitei Happo
getting him into the Kyoto Rakugo Association

21
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,680
And then in the middle of his massage,

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,680
he talks about how Tsukitei Happo defended him

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,450
whilst the other rakugoka's were against him.

24
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,180
He tells us a touching story of how he got to be a rakugoka.

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,760
"If Housei does something wrong, I'll quit"

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,060
For him to do that much for me...

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,130
I've never thought it was possible for someone to do that...

28
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,030
Those are some disgusting tears, eh!?

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,230
Damn!

30
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,540
Jesus!!!

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,300
What a disgusting picture!

32
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:38,310
Questions answered from his
childhood to his move to rakugo

33
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,240
Up until now, the amount of questions he has answered is...

34
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,310
1006 Questions

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,740
And there's more!

36
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,450
Character count from his childhood to his move to rakugo

37
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,450
There has been a total of 160,242 characters written.

38
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:49,690
Will Housei be able to beat the 24 Hour Interview!?

39
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,700
2:28AM...

40
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,730
17 hours and 28 minutes since the start

41
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,730
There's 6 and a half hours 'till the finish.

42
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:08,170
Now that the massage is over, the interview starts back up.

43
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,510
Hmm.. Let's see...

44
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,380
Now we enter into the frank questions.

45
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,550
What did you eat yesterday?

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,790
Eh~ What did I eat....?

47
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,030
Eh~ What did I eat!?

48
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,370
First, let's try to remember breakfast.

49
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,240
I didn't eat breakfast.

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,580
I just remembered it was Shabu-Shabu.

51
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,780
I just remembered it was Shabu-Shabu.

52
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,710
For breakfast?

53
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,150
Not for breakfast.

54
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,050
I had it in the evening.

55
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,730
Where?

56
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,730
Huh?

57
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,730
Where?

58
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,990
In Osaka...

59
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,990
Namba.

60
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,600
How did it taste?

61
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,410
Is there nothing more to ask?

62
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,140
You would
react like that.

63
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,280
I don't care...

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,890
18 hours and 1 minute since the start

65
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,890
6 hours remain until the finish.

66
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,760
Now for the next question.

67
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,900
Could you wake up please Housei-san?

68
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:47,270
The interview continues as he fights

69
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:47,270
against the temptation to sleep.

70
00:03:47,270 --> 00:04:01,190
Who do you like better, Endo or Tanaka?

71
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,750
Endo.

72
00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:01,150
I really like Endo when he's doing High Tension.

73
00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:01,190
High Tension - A series of Gaki episodes

74
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,690
Alright.

75
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,460
What time is it?

76
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
You're lying~

77
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,070
Eh~ Only 2 hours have passed since then?

78
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,040
You've got to be kidding me...

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,000
This is bad!

80
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:26,240
What do you play with your kids?

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,240
Right now, jigsaw puzzles.

82
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,420
I bought a 1000 piece puzzle of 'The Seven Deities of Good Luck'

83
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,490
Have you finished it yet?

84
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,490
No~

85
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,590
Right now, just the frame.

86
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:47,070
Could you show me your piano skills?

87
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:47,070
♫ Hums "Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence" ♫

88
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,970
What the hell is this!!

89
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,970
Are you okay Housei~?

90
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:09,190
When do you think rock died?

91
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,620
Rock hasn't died.

92
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,190
Rock will continue to live forever.

93
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,790
It's like he's preaching!

94
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,960
Do you ever feel old?

95
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,130
I'm feeling it right now.

96
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,800
My farts just don't stop.

97
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,670
It's not something I can control with my will anymore.

98
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,700
It's getting
brighter!

99
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,310
It's not something I can control with my will anymore.

100
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,780
They've just started running wildly...

101
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,850
Is your hair okay?

102
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,850
It hasn't changed at all.

103
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,920
It has.

104
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,090
Your hair seems black

105
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,060
but you haven't started balding?

106
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,060
No, no I have not.

107
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,790
I get picked on about it.

108
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,100
It's honestly a joke.

109
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,330
We just do it as friends.

110
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,680
What do you love about your wife?

111
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,640
She's just so kind.

112
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,110
She's just so kind.

113
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,120
Her kindness is just so deep.

114
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,750
Her kindness is just so deep.

115
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,990
The city starts to bustle around once it's daybreak.

116
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,990
22 Hours and 3 minutes

117
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,860
There is now 2 hours remaining.

118
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,700
Amazing huh?

119
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:35,970
As the interview prepare's for the next question

120
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:35,970
What sort of question will she throw at him!?

121
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,800
Up until now the interviewer has thrown various questions at him,

122
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,710
what will she throw at him next in the remaining 2 hours!?

123
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,020
Is there anything you want me to ask you?

124
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,390
So this is what
happens, huh?

125
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,030
Damn,
that was funny.

126
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,830
"Is there anything
you want me
to ask you?"

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,830
And he's
struggling to
answer that...

128
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,670
Hmm...

129
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,180
I don't think there's anything I want you to ask.

130
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,280
If you were born as a girl

131
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,280
what sort of job would you want to do?

132
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,620
A woman's clothes designer.

133
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,530
I think women understand women's clothes the best...

134
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,700
I think being a designer would be cool.

135
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,600
What would be your brand name?

136
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,470
I'd want to attach "HOUSEI" to it.

137
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,540
But would everyone pronounce it as "HOUSE"?

138
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,540
Oh yeah, that's true.

139
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,910
I think if I did it

140
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,180
「ＨＯＵＳＥ - i 」。

141
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,720
「ＨＯＵＳＥ - i 」。

142
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,560
Oh I don't give a shit.

143
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,960
What about the image of it?

144
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,370
Coco Chanel herself said what the best colour was.

145
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,970
Black, this is the best colour.

146
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,840
Black, this is the best colour.

147
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,570
So...

148
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:22,950
HOUSE-i would have to have the 'best colour.'

149
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,820
So what colour would that be for you?

150
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,850
I think it's got to be black.

151
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,720
The same!?

152
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,190
So it would look a lot like Chanel clothing...

153
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,160
Yeah but there is no other colour...

154
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,790
Well HOUSE-i is

155
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,600
not Coco Chanel's rebirth or anything,

156
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,930
but I would want to go with black.

157
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,340
Since we are now talking about fashion,

158
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,440
when you look back on your life

159
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,140
there were a few stories about your fashion
choice so I just want to touch on that again...

160
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,880
So in middle school,

161
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,880
you were wearing 'eccentric clothing for delinquents'?

162
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,450
After that, you were a surfer?

163
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,320
After that, you were a surfer?

164
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,320
Yea, that's right.

165
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,020
A complete surfer.

166
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,430
What was
the fashion?

167
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,430
Trainers of course.

168
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,200
Weren't you too hot wearing trainers on a beach?

169
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,770
What the hell...
A surfer wearing
trainers....

170
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,640
What the
hell is this!

171
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,640
Whenever it gets
bad he goes to
drink something!

172
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,140
Since the start.

173
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,010
It looks like when things are
getting bad you go for a drink huh~

174
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,480
When this interview is over why don't you

175
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,480
phone your wife and tell her how happy you are?

176
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,250
Yea, that's good.

177
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,520
What do you think your wife is going to say?

178
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,590
She'll be like "Oh my god, great work

179
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,830
that must have been so tough!

180
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,670
But seriously, great work.

181
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,070
What time are you coming home today?"

182
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,040
Umm...

183
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,870
Tonight I have my birthday party.

184
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,210
Were you the type of person to always accomplish his goals?

185
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,380
Like 'Once you start, you always accomplish it'?

186
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,050
No, I wasn't.

187
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,660
And that's why for example,

188
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,660
I've never finished a jigsaw puzzle.

189
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,930
So the Fukuwarai you're doing right now...

190
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,430
Fukuwarai - 'Lucky Laugh' a game
similar to Pin The Tail On The Donkey.

191
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,930
Fukuwarai?

192
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,430
Were you not playing Fukuwarai with your daughters...?

193
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,200
Wait I'm wrong... What was that jigsaw puzzle?

194
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,240
What was it again?

195
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,570
'The Seven Deities of Good Luck.'

196
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,570
Yes...

197
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,740
Sorry, when we carried on speaking after this...

198
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,710
I just got really sleepy there...

199
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,420
Yeah, I mean I'm not really surprised...

200
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,860
23 hours and 46 minutes since the start

201
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,560
Finally we visit the moment of fate.

202
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,170
And now, finally we have nearly finished the 24 hours.

203
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,170
Yep.

204
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,010
This really is the last question.

205
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,010
Yes.

206
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:07,710
What do you feel looking back on this whole experience?

207
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,080
Looking back on it I...

208
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,820
I didn't think I'd talk about my wife so much.

209
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,690
I think, I was saved by my wife.

210
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,260
I think, I was saved by my wife.

211
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,290
My wife and I are the protagonists.

212
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,900
My wife and I are the protagonists.

213
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:32,270
My fate is my wife's fate and my wife's fate is my fate.

214
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,110
If my wife is working hard

215
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,110
I'll work just as hard.

216
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,410
The philosophy I just said,

217
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,840
my wife shares the same view.

218
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,310
I consult first with my wife.

219
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,950
Everything is my wife.

220
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,790
There's a saying 'If you're going to die, die on stage'...

221
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:53,260
Well I've never thought I would die on stage.

222
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,130
When that happens, I want my family...

223
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,500
at least my wife, by my side.

224
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,240
I guess the stage is fine, as long as she is watching.

225
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,370
The thing he learned from this challenge

226
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,180
is his deep love for his wife.

227
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,650
Good morning!

228
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,160
24 hours is up, congratulations!

229
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,560
24 hours is up, congratulations!

230
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:45,910
He calls his wife to convey the emotions he's

231
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:45,910
feeling after the 24 Hour interview.

232
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,140
For the sake of informing his achievement,

233
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,140
he calls his wife.

234
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,510
I'm gonna call her.

235
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,080
Alright.

236
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,880
You've reached the voicemail service from AU.

237
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,520
When you hear the signal....

238
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,300
Well! Let's go home.

239
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,030
Well! Let's go home.

240
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:48,470
24 Hour Long Interview complete

241
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,000
With this the curtain for the 24 hour long interview

242
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,470
comes to a close.

243
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,970
Maybe she was sleeping?

244
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,040
Yeah, probably...

245
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,310
At 9 AM?

246
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,010
At 9 AM.

247
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,850
If I could, this time... Um...

248
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:06,460
My interview

249
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,460
was transferred onto paper

250
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,460
Ah, amazing!

251
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,460
Uwa!

252
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,560
There is a character count of 225,037 characters.

253
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,060
There is a character count of 225,037 characters.

254
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,570
Because a normal novel contains 70,000 characters,

255
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,900
this is 4... No 3 times more!

256
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,800
this is 4... No 3 times more!

257
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,940
Amazing!

258
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,940
Wait a second Matsumoto.

259
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,340
Please try reading it.

260
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:27,180
Because of the Baby Boom Age, there were too many for one class~

261
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,980
In 1st year was there 8 classes... Or 9 classes...

262
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,250
In 1st year was there 8 classes... Or 9 classes...

263
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,580
Maybe there was 10 classes?

264
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,580
How many were there then...?

265
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,950
Well, this thing...

266
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,090
No, no, please read more!

267
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,090
No, no, no.

268
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,060
I've already watched enough!

269
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,230
Seriously, it's all actually been written here...

270
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,760
Well then, with this,

271
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,700
I'm publishing a book!

272
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,570
Of this!?

273
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,570
Yes.

274
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,240
Oh, right.

275
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,040
So you are asking if someone wants to publish that?

276
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,140
Yeah, that's right.

277
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,980
So you're going to ask them to contact you...

278
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,980
That's completely different to what you said...

279
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,780
It's totally different...

280
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,950
So get this published, huh?

281
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,880
But what are you going to do with this, if no one wants to publish it?

282
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,920
But this, I somehow want to...

283
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:15,330
As it is now, why don't you stick it in the
drawer beside the bed in hotel rooms?

284
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,030
Instead of the bible?

285
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,700
Instead of the bible?

286
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,060
It'll be a hotel guideline.

287
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,570
They'd be surprised huh? Thinking "What is this?"

288
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,970
To all the publishers who may want to publish this

289
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,240
I will be waiting to hear from you.

290
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,680
Everyone here will do their best promoting the book.

291
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
So please, I am counting on you!

292
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,690
5 Minute Free Talk

293
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,690
When did you cry recently?

294
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,920
We've got a postcard!

295
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,920
Alright.

296
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,030
Hello everyone, when I was watching the Olympics,

297
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,030
I saw the various skills and abilities of people like Mao Asada.

298
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:56,400
It gave me a rush of emotions and I cried a lot.

299
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:05,810
Lately, I've had the feeling you guys cry at more things,

300
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:05,810
have you cried at the Olympics or at anything in your daily lives?

301
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,810
This is like serious...

302
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,780
Not like the person who wrote this.

303
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,280
Like properly crying...

304
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,280
Yeah.

305
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,680
I was watching unedited footage of the opening ceremony,

306
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,690
on the television in real time of course.

307
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,320
The Olympics?

308
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,120
Yes, the opening ceremony.

309
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,320
They lit the Olympic torch

310
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,290
and you know they do that thing...

311
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,130
Then finally it was lit but

312
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,130
at that time I sort of leaned forward out of my kotatsu.

313
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,770
That was amazing.

314
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,800
Because of all the tension at that time,
I don't know if I'd call myself easily brought to tears but

315
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,740
I cried!

316
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,380
Actually I want to talk about something a bit different...

317
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,410
I remembered this recently, and during middle school…

318
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,780
Downtown's middle school happening!!

319
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,780
I was with Hamada for ages.

320
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,050
Actually I want to talk about something a bit different...

321
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,820
I remembered this recently, and during middle school…

322
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,730
I was with Hamada for ages,

323
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,660
and we were at someone's house.

324
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,470
We were watching the

325
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,470
closing ceremony of high school baseball.

326
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,240
Closing ceremony, that's what it's called, right?

327
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,240
Yeah, that's right.

328
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,140
Hamada was like "I want to watch the closing ceremony."

329
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,540
Yeah...

330
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,210
And I had no idea at all why he wanted to watch it...

331
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,150
And I had no idea at all why he wanted to watch it...

332
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,810
Like why the hell do you want to watch that?

333
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,790
And this program called 'Our Journey' was on at the same time,

334
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,890
something like that anyway...

335
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,850
Like a drama series...

336
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,660
And I really wanted to watch that...

337
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,590
He was like "No no, Mattsun, just no."

338
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,330
We're obviously going to watch the
closing ceremony of the high school baseball.

339
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,330
I was like what the fuck!?
I thought he was kidding at first.

340
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,600
There's no way someone would
want to watch a high schooler...

341
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,810
Like literally...

342
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,870
I was thinking "How could you want to watch that?"

343
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,450
It was like the first time ever we nearly got in a fight...

344
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,010
When I think about it now, I still don't get it.

345
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,250
Like why the hell did you want to watch that...?

346
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,620
Obviously, we should've watched 'Our Journey'...

347
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,560
Yeah, I get you... When I think about it now.

348
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,830
Why the hell did you want to watch it then!?

349
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,830
I wonder what made me want to...

350
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,590
And it was the closing ceremony as well...

351
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,030
It was, yeah... And then

352
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,930
I was like, "Wait, are you serious?"

353
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,530
Like, "What is fun about that?"

354
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,070
But before it, isn't there the actual final?

355
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,940
Yes.

356
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,940
No, the final had already finished.

357
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,270
It finished...

358
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,270
No, so..

359
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:17,170
So the winners and losers came together and...

360
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,170
No, that finished as well...

361
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,640
The final finished and it was like "Okay, it's finished"...

362
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,010
And to be honest, I don't really care too much
for high school baseball anyway...

363
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,280
And I was like "Okay, great, 'Our Journey'
is about to start on TV so let's switch the channel"...

364
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,520
You were like "Just no... Let's watch the closing ceremony"

365
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,190
You were like "Just no... Let's watch the closing ceremony"

366
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,990
I was like, no, no, no, no...

367
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,260
What the hell!?

368
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,230
You were like, "No, just no... Seriously, just no..."

369
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,260
I'm serious...

370
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,260
No, no, no...

371
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,430
Obviously there was a reason he wanted to watch it...

372
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,430
I was like, "What the hell!! He's messing with me!"

373
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,770
Like...

374
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,400
You were like, "Obviously I want to watch it...

375
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,040
Everyone was trying so hard..."

376
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,470
I'm serious, I'm serious!

377
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,510
"Everyone was trying so hard

378
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,510
and the winner has been decided...

379
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,410
Obviously I want to watch the closing ceremony..."

380
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,180
I don't know...

381
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,750
I was like "WHAT...!?"

382
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,050
Maybe I wanted to see the reaction and stuff...

383
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,790
Maybe that was it...

384
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,790
Yeah and he wanted to watch that...

385
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,790
No way would you want to watch that...

386
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,120
Who gives a shit about the aftermath...

387
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,560
To this day, I do not understand the reason...

388
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,170
I don't really remember what actually happened that day...

389
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,270
I just can't shake it off...

390
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,600
You were about to fight...

391
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Yeah...

392
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,070
We were literally so close to a full on fight...

393
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,380
I asked so many times, "But why, just why?"

394
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,310
He would just answer, "'Cause everyone tried so hard."

395
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,720
Tanaka's scary first meeting with Hamada!?

396
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,110
"They tried so hard"?

397
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,720
Oh just cut it out!!

398
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,090
Yesterday, Matsumoto-san

399
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,090
talked to us about when

400
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,990
we first met...

401
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,560
Does everyone here like remember how they felt when meeting each other?

402
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,730
So for example, when Housei-san met Downtown...

403
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,670
Like your first impressions of them...

404
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,670
Of course.

405
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,100
What was it like?

406
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,100
I don't remember at all.

407
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,470
The second chome theatre.

408
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,510
Oh really?

409
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,510
Yes.

410
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,010
You were on that program 'It's 4pm apparently'.

411
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,650
* Broadcast from April 6, 1987
to September 29, 1989

412
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,010
That far back huh?

413
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,280
The time of that program?

414
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,710
Yeah, "It's 4pm apparently" was starting to take off.

415
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,550
So we were like 23, 24 years old...

416
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,550
Yeah, that's right.

417
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,050
Hamada-san was

418
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:14,090
you met me next to the corridor next to the audience.

419
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,660
And I said "Good morning", you were like "Oh, morning."

420
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,030
You were a bit scary but you said "Oh, morning."

421
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,070
Oh, he didn't run and try and hit you?

422
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,440
What the hell, why would I hit him?

423
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,670
He was just like "Oh, good morning"...

424
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,670
How about Matsumoto?

425
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,270
He was in his dressing room

426
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,010
and was reading a newspaper.

427
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,080
And when I said, "Good morning!"

428
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,010
He was like, "Yeahhh"...

429
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,680
Damn... You wouldn't even look him in the eye...

430
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,550
Damn that's scary...

431
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,590
He wouldn't even look you in the face.

432
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,360
When I first said my greetings to Hamada-san...

433
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,930
We were filming for Gaki at Sanseido...

434
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,400
Oh yeah...

435
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,400
And we finished the opening and we went to say hello...

436
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,000
I mean my part didn't get into the final edit that time...

437
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,110
So we were at the car park, waiting...

438
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,980
And Hamada-san walked in front of us.

439
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,980
We were like, "Good morning"...

440
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,980
He didn't even look at our face and just said "Yeah"...

441
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,380
He does that, right?

442
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,720
Like I remember it so well...

443
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,390
You should definitely look them
in the eyes and say hello at least...

444
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,960
That goes for you too then!!

445
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,060
You'd think that's common sense, right?

446
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,530
I was told that I was going to be on Gaki

447
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,930
and they told me, "From next week."

448
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,570
And the week before,

449
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,570
I went to introduce myself to you two.

450
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,670
But I had already met you right?

451
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,210
Yes, Matsumoto-san, you had.

452
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,210
At Tokyo station, right?

453
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,210
And I was just...

454
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,580
for the first time, I went to introduce myself to you.

455
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,580
Oh, was it?

456
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,650
I said "My name is Cocorico and I will
be working with you from next week."

457
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,190
"My name is Tanaka..." That is what I was going to say.

458
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,590
And as I said "Oh, I am Cocorico's Tanaka...
I will be working with you from next week..."

459
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,660
You had already walked off...

460
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,330
Just as a human being...

461
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,330
Don't take the piss!

462
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,470
I was literally just like this...

463
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,470
I hate people like that...

464
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,300
I really hate people like that.

465
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,300
You've got to be kidding me.

466
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,200
It makes me want to quit Yoshimoto.

467
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,570
Surely you don't feel that strongly about it...

468
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,010
It's important though...

469
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,010
I was probably in a rush...

470
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,480
Yeah probably, I was stuttering a bit...

471
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,410
In my first and second year...

472
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,320
Along with 'All Hanshin Kyojin'

473
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,750
when I was meant to introduce myself

474
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,020
I was just so nervous.

475
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,960
Before I introduced myself to them...

476
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,390
I was thinking in my head,
"You're introducing yourself to All Hanshin Kyojin"...

477
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,260
So I knocked and said "Excuse me..."

478
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,430
I said "Nice to meet you, I am All Hanshin Kyojin"...

479
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,930
This is real.

480
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,440
I just freaked out.

481
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,440
That's so scary!

482
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,740
I really freaked out...

483
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,740
That...

484
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,010
If they had taken that the wrong way they could've
been like "Who does this punk think he is...?"

485
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,340
They hadn't heard what I said...

486
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,780
No no no, that wasn't it...

487
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,780
Was it not?

488
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,950
They reacted to what you said in your favour...

489
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,980
Did they?

490
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,020
They said "That's US!" to him.

491
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,420
That was so good!

492
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,250
No, seriously.

493
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,260
Forget that, your impersonation of him was so good!

494
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,460
What is with that high quality??

495
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,260
Oh, really?

496
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,130
Surely you didn't need to make that impersonation that good...

497
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,700
Was it really that good?

498
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
Yeah, it was.

499
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,530
He said "That's US" whilst laughing...

500
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,930
No, the one before was better!

501
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,570
Oh just leave it.

502
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,970
Yeah, he said that to you.

503
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,970
Was it? I was just so nervous...

504
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,380
So he must have thought,
"Oh, this poor kid must be so nervous"

505
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,080
and reacted to make you less nervous...

506
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,310
That was probably it.

507
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,310
Yeah, probably.

508
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,350
Yeah, they could probably
tell you were just nervous.

509
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,850
And Hamada-san as well,

510
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,250
I had just watched you always on TV and

511
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,990
I was to introduce myself to you...

512
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,060
I was like in the same state...

513
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,600
I was like so nervous and seriously...

514
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,930
I was so close to saying,
"Nice to meet you, I'm Hamada."

515
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,970
Seriously, I just held back

516
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,070
and panicked at the time...

517
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,370
Well if you had said it,
he would as usual just have hit you.

518
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,040
Don't you have anything else to ask...?

519
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:09,690
Gaki no Tsukai #1198 (2014.03.30) - Heipo Review
