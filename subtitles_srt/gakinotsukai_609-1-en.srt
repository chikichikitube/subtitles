Subbed by Mickstar813 & HouseiGIFs

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,650
On tonight's Gaki no Tsukai
a new challenge begins

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,720
5 men who aim for the summit of the comedian world

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,090
It's this... Breath Holding Challenge!

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,090
The name:







Breath Holding Challenge

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,820
Right, Matsumoto-san...

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,920
Yeah?

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,920
What are we doing today?

9
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,390
We've decided we need to form a new club

10
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,560
Downtown

11
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,560
Hamada Masatoshi

12
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,560
Matsumoto Hitoshi

13
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,030
Right!

14
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,160
And there are loads of clubs in this world

15
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,100
But the thing we are the best at...

16
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,840
has got to be "holding our breath"

17
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,400
Like hell we are

18
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,740
The 5 sleeping lions of Yoshimoto

19
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,640
I'm talking about us by the way

20
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,610
We were sleeping..?

21
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,540
Indeed...

22
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,480
So we're waking up now, correct?

23
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,350
We're going to form our "Breath Holding" club

24
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,350
Right!

25
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,820
Right here, today

26
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,220
Alright!

27
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,750
Cocorico

28
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,750
Endo Shozo

29
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,750
Tanaka Naoki

30
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,790
To see how long you can hold your breath for underwater...

31
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,620
Right

32
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,690
And we're going to have our first match today.

33
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,290
I see

34
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,320
And our leader for today

35
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,260
is Yamasaki Hosei-san

36
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,260
Alright!!

37
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,260
Zaki-san!

38
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,290
We are counting on you!

39
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,290
We're counting on you, boss

40
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,100
Leader

41
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,100
Yamazaki Hosei

42
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,730
I'm the leader?

43
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,730
Right.

44
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,260
Why's Yama-chan the leader?

45
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,870
Simply put, he's good at it

46
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,470
He's our secret weapon

47
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,500
Really?

48
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,500
Yeah.

49
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,170
He has a huge lung capacity

50
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,010
When you hold your breath, it's all about lung capacity

51
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,340
So

52
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,340
That's exactly what he just said

53
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,240
I just said that

54
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,240
You did, Endo-san did indeed say that

55
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,150
So basically, my lung capacity is awesome

56
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,080
No jokes here

57
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,720
No but like

58
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,720
What you mean by that?

59
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,950
I'm not just saying that and it turns out I do the worst

60
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,950
Oh right, I get you

61
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,120
So there's no anticlimax?

62
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,120
No.

63
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,160
We will definitely win

64
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,360
But you know, since it's the first ever match,

65
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,000
the staff haven't brought just any ol' regular opponents

66
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,030
I see

67
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,030
I see

68
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,130
They've brought some serious opponents

69
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,600
They were told to come here at 3 o'clock apparently

70
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,300
Man, that's early

71
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,310
Well anyway, let's get the opponents of our first ever match in here

72
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,280
Please enter

73
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,280
What the hell is that?

74
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,350
Damn!

75
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,350
Amazing

76
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,250
They are totally 100% stupid

77
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,250
Damn

78
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,520
They are absolute idiots

79
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,690
Watch out!

80
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,160
That's dangerous...

81
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,290
Are you okay?

82
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,960
Alright!!

83
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Here we are!

84
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,700
There's the father of all those idiots

85
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,170
Why was the father hiding below?

86
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,200
Office Kitano Team

87
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,670
I was a bit embarrassed, that's why...

88
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,010
Office Kitano Team...

89
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,470
Damn, they're going to be tough opponents

90
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,540
Yeah they are

91
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,070
Here they come

92
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,070
You know...

93
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,580
I'm sorry but

94
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,180
You've chosen the wrong opponents

95
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,180
Wait, why is that?

96
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,580
However you look at it,

97
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,880
when it comes to anything with water,

98
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,550
we are Number 1

99
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,950
Well, maybe that is the case

100
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,290
But don't underestimate our Yamasaki

101
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,820
Right?

102
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,190
We're going to do it

103
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,330
You have more lung capacity than any bug out there, right?

104
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,390
Yeah...

105
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,500
Are we really going to win..?

106
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,500
That's awful

107
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
What?

108
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,970
We will definitely win

109
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,970
Saying that,

110
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,870
I've actually played Darumasan ga Koronda (tag game) underwater.

111
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,540
Amazing

112
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,540
We're in trouble here...

113
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,410
You're working too hard, man

114
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,480
But we definitely won't lose though

115
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,040
and you guys, as well...

116
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,880
I don't think there's any point being that serious...

117
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,280
Don't say that!

118
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:01,290
Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai
ya Arahende!!

119
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,750
We're going to win

120
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,890
This is a battle

121
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,090
This program is sponsored by the companies as seen onscreen

122
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,260
Anyway, it's a team competition

123
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:14,730
They time how long they can stay underwater

and add the times up to decide the winner at the end

124
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,000
So everyone has a go

125
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,860
back and forth

126
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,100
and then add all the times up at the end,

127
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,570
so please decide your team order

128
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,570
OK.

129
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,840
Right then, let's go ahead with it

130
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,070
And talking about orders, Kitano Team,

131
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,340
do you know who's going first?

132
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,810
I think we'll start with our weakest guy...

133
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,420
Me? Right then, I'm going first

134
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,050
We will then

135
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,450
Endo!

136
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,450
Right!

137
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,190
Endo Shozo

138
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,190
Mimata Matazou

139
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,190
Round one

140
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,850
I'll do my best

141
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,290
I will, I'm going to really get stuck in

142
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,290
We're counting on you

143
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,690
We can get a good few seconds more here

144
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,690
I will try my best

145
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,530
I'm going to win

146
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,690
I'm not going to lose, man.

147
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,930
Look at you, with your shit body

148
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,900
First up

149
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,900
Jordan's Mimata Matazou

150
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,170
First up, Office Kitano Team choose Mimata.

151
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,900
With his fat belly, will he be able to hold his breath for long?

152
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,540
Right then

153
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,640
First up for Office Kitano

154
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,570
Starting with Mimata

155
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,310
Why did I not get to decide which team went first?

156
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,550
You're being way too serious

157
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,410
Yeah, you really are

158
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,250
No, because it's easier to see how long the other person stayed under so you have something to aim for...

159
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,650
Well yeah, I get you

160
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,590
So maybe later on, we can make it so that you go first out of the two teams

161
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,490
Yeah, yeah

162
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,490
Yeah, sure we can do that

163
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,090
Yeah, that's fine

164
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,830
Then it's fair

165
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Let's be fair

166
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,630
By the way, right now, the world record

167
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:26,970
Holding breath

168
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:26,970
Martin Stepanek (Czech Republic)

169
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:26,970
World Record: 8 minutes 6 seconds

170
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,000
is held by some bloke from Czech Republic

171
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,700
8 minutes, 6 seconds...

172
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,070
8 minutes?!

173
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,540
So yeah, try your best

174
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,570
I don't have to think about being funny, I just concentrate on this, right?

175
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,640
Of course

176
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,880
Have you ever even been funny before?

177
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,880
Oh yeah, sorry...

178
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,250
Like not at all...

179
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,210
As soon as your face goes past here, it starts

180
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,750
I understand

181
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,750
Right then, are you ready?

182
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,750
Yes!

183
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,750
Do your best!

184
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,260
Let's go then

185
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,690
Ready

186
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,890
Start

187
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,230
He's in

188
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,060
Do your best

189
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,830
Why is he playing with his hair..?

190
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,700
Wow

191
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,040
Can you hear us?

192
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,580
Can you hear us?

193
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,040
He must be able to see us

194
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,040
Oh my God, he's already struggling

195
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,650
Uh oh

196
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,910
He's struggling

197
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,390
He's struggling now

198
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,520
He's finished

199
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,690
We don't know what you're saying

200
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,560
I wonder why he's trying to talk to us...

201
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,500
Alright!!

202
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,500
Damn...

203
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,730
Result: 36 seconds

204
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,000
That's great for us!

205
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,630
It is

206
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,630
36 seconds!

207
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,470
36 seconds!

208
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,470
Wait, what were you saying under the water?

209
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,070
I was saying "how long have I been under"

210
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,070
But obviously we can't hear you!

211
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,040
But 36 seconds isn't bad

212
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,180
Right?

213
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,280
I wonder...

214
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,780
Wait, you guys made this "club"... haven't you done it before?

215
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,550
Umm, no... This is our first time ever

216
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,560
Endo Shozo

217
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,560
First up

218
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,150
Gaki team, first up is Endo

219
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,560
He has plenty of energy from playing high school baseball, even with his belly.

220
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,160
We're counting on you, man

221
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,430
Honestly, when you get here, you get really nervous

222
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,700
Relax, man...

223
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,700
They're not used to this at all...

224
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,070
Right then

225
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,830
Endo, ready...

226
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,200
Start

227
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,070
Man he's got a serious face on

228
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,340
That's good

229
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,010
His concentration is good...

230
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,010
It really is

231
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,780
When little bubbles come up, that's a good sign

232
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,280
I see

233
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,420
He's quite good...

234
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,460
That's good

235
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,620
Right? Keep calm, man...

236
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,430
Exactly, keep calm...

237
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,690
Great stuff, Endo...

238
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,030
Hold on, it's getting a bit...

239
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,960
Keep calm

240
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,030
Uh oh!

241
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,400
Keep calm, you've still got a long way to go

242
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,510
Wasn't that bubble a bit big just now..?

243
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,610
He's fine

244
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,610
This is bad

245
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,480
He got over that hard part

246
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,340
Are you kidding me?

247
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

248
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,310
You're fine still

249
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,480
He's done

250
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,790
That was good

251
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,790
That was good

252
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,090
Result: 47 seconds

253
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,350
47 seconds!

254
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,260
Next us is Taka-san and me

255
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,960
Gatarukanaru Taka

256
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,960
Hamada Masatoshi

257
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,960
Next up

258
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,490
We're counting on you

259
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,090
Let's widen the gap here

260
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,230
There's only a 11-second difference, right?

261
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,230
That's right

262
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,430
I'm sorry

263
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,930
but we're going to push you right to the limit

264
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:22,340
Gatarukanaru Taka

265
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:22,340
Next up

266
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,270
Kitano Team, next up is Gatarukanaru Taka, 45 years old

267
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,340
He's one of the elite comedians as well...

268
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,740
Oh man, it's really nice being in here

269
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,880
Oh really?

270
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,080
That feeling of returning home...

271
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,250
Oh man, when you get in, it's nice

272
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,150
Right then

273
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,980
Ready

274
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,280
Start

275
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,520
He's really happy

276
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,520
Look at that smile

277
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,830
Amazing

278
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,390
He's looking good

279
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,100
Compared to the wash basin, there's water pressure in this

280
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,660
Ah, I see.

281
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,660
So it gets harder

282
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,870
But is it okay for him to have his mouth open?

283
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,700
No, this is really bad

284
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,270
Why are you like sounding like a guide book for this..?

285
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,010
Uh-oh...

286
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,280
His face

287
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,350
Something's come out of his mouth!

288
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,420
You're kidding me!

289
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,420
He's finished soon!

290
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,430
No way, stay in longer!

291
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,390
Do your best!

292
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,630
His legs...

293
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,570
He's staying in there...

294
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,970
He's gotten over 50 seconds

295
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,600
Will he get 1 minute?

296
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,370
Amazing!

297
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,010
Result: 53 seconds

298
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,580
I wanted to get to 1 minute

299
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,340
Something weird came out of your mouth halfway through...

300
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,210
Damn, that's tough

301
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,620
Right then, leave it to me

302
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,820
We're counting on you

303
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,820
What a guy...

304
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,920
By the way, out of all of us, he's probably the worst...

305
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,360
He's probably the worst out of all of us

306
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:57,200
Hamada Masatoshi

307
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:57,200
Next up

308
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,960
Gaki Team, next up is Hamada

309
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,200
He's basically just a guy who sucks holding his breath; how well can he do?

310
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,300
How many seconds do I need?

311
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,870
Well we'd really like you to get at least 45 seconds

312
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,970
He got 53 seconds...

313
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,510
Yeah, there's a 42-second difference right now

314
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,080
Office Kitano Team: 42 second lead

315
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,180
So if you get 45 seconds...

316
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,150
You can see the timer from inside

317
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,380
Could you?

318
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,380
No, not at all

319
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,520
Oh, can't you?

320
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,520
You need goggles

321
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,880
Someone get me some goggles then

322
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,550
No, because if you do that, we can't laugh at your face

323
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,890
That's true

324
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,090
You can't put goggles on in here

325
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,030
Yeah, otherwise we can't get a good reaction from your face

326
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,160
It's all about the time

327
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,530
Right then Hamada-san, we're counting on you

328
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,330
Ready

329
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,370
Start!

330
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,370
We're counting on you!

331
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,300
There he goes, 45 seconds...

332
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,570
He looks like he's struggling already

333
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,580
That's hilarious

334
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,680
That's funny

335
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,880
WHAT?!

336
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,180
Result: 9 seconds

337
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,280
NO WAY!

338
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,750
Awesome!

339
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,750
YOU'RE KIDDING ME!

340
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,550
HAMADA-SAN!

341
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,590
That's fucked up, that's so fucked up.

342
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,460
What is?

343
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,090
No, I'm just pissed off now

344
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,690
No, I heard a noise in my ear

345
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,330
This is such a joke

346
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,270
I'm begging you, man, seriously

347
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,370
I can't stay underwater because of my ear

348
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,970
Well yeah, I know but still...

349
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,800
Right?

350
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,640
They've lost

351
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,810
I'm really sorry, but we've got this in the bag now...

352
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,140
Fantastic work, sir

353
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,440
Seriously...

354
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,780
Well done

355
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,150
This is worse than a child

356
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,680
You know, you can't see underwater

357
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,250
No, you can't

358
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,020
Of course you can't if you stay under for that short a time...

359
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,090
But you were really trying to see the timer?

360
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,090
Exactly, exactly

361
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,790
And then suddenly I heard this noise in my ear

362
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,060
and thought "Fuck it, that's it" before my ear got worse

363
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,990
What the hell, man? 9 seconds...

364
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:44,870
Halfway point

365
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:44,870
Tanaka Naoki

366
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,360
Next up is Tanaka

367
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,030
He has scuba experience, but can he pull it off when it matters?

368
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,600
We're seriously counting on you here, man

369
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,810
Yep, I will seriously

370
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,710
Seriously, I want to continue with this "team"

371
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,910
Yeah, seriously

372
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,910
Right.

373
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,910
"Team"?!

374
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,380
So just think you're here alone

375
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,750
Don't listen to anyone around you

376
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,520
That's right

377
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,550
Just go for it

378
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,290
Okay

379
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,290
Ready?

380
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,260
Let's get to it then

381
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,260
You going to be okay?

382
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,920
Yeah.

383
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,860
Ready

384
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,430
You might find some insects in there by the way...

385
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,160
Start

386
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,560
Right then

387
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,060
This is scary

388
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,940
He's doing well

389
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,940
It's good

390
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,940
He's really concentrating

391
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,040
He going to be okay?

392
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,040
He's doing fine

393
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,810
Hold on

394
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,940
He's trying to come up

395
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,880
No no, get down

396
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,880
Stay under

397
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,180
He's got to

398
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,080
He's fine

399
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,320
You still got plenty in you

400
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,820
Go down, go down

401
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,620
Okay, good

402
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,490
That's fine, keep calm

403
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,490
Come out, come out...

404
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,430
Go down

405
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,330
Down, down... That's right

406
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,130
Good

407
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,970
41 seconds...

408
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,240
No way

409
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,670
Result: 41 seconds

410
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,870
No way

411
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,010
What the hell, man?

412
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,780
I drank some water...

413
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,850
I don't give a shit, man...

414
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,850
That's the worst

415
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:12,690
Halfway point

416
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:12,690
Yamasaki Masaya

417
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,780
Kitano Team, next up is Jordan's Yamasaki

418
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,250
He's got a good body, being 180cm tall; will he be able to perform?

419
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,760
I'm going to try my best

420
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,760
Go for it

421
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,920
Wait, what was that?

422
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Huh?

423
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,930
Your part will just be briefly summarised

424
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,660
Sorry about that, doesn't matter how well you perform

425
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,200
It'll be like "And he got this many seconds" and that's it

426
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,800
Just your part...

427
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,800
Seriously...

428
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,610
Right then, let's get to it

429
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,610
If you don't get to 1 minute, you're out...

430
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,110
Okay...

431
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,110
Ready

432
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,780
Start

433
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,280
I wonder what kind of face he'll show

434
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,090
He just hit his face on the glass...

435
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,790
You can't see well under there after all

436
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,860
You don't realise how far away you are inside...

437
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,360
Man his face is annoying

438
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,830
Isn't he in trouble..?

439
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,470
Yeah he is

440
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,670
Wait a minute...

441
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,810
He's in trouble

442
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,540
Hold on a minute

443
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,410
Stay under

444
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,250
Do your best

445
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,420
OI!

446
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,720
Result: 37 seconds

447
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,680
Are you serious?

448
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,250
We can still win, we can still win

449
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,990
You were doing your best, right?

450
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,990
You can just summarise my part...

451
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,030
You know, you can just go home now, man...

452
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,230
Office Kitano: 29 seconds ahead

453
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,460
Wait a second...

454
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,730
If we get 30 seconds on them in the next one, we can win; what shall we do?

455
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,730
You're talking about the order?

456
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,230
I think the most confident person should go last to be honest...

457
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,300
I honestly think now is better

458
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
I agree

459
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,800
Really?

460
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,640
Seriously, I think so too

461
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,840
Okay

462
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,840
and let's put our hopes on Matsumoto-san at the end

463
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,580
Excuse me

464
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,320
We're going to change our order here

465
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,550
Eh?

466
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,990
This is part of our plan

467
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,390
Yamasaki is actually amazing at this

468
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,520
I'm going next

469
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,960
With a bang!

470
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:09,970
Next up

471
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:09,970
Yamasaki Hosei

472
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,400
For the Gaki Team, next up is Yamasaki

473
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,970
The Daddy who has a lot of confidence in holding his breath will try to rid his name of being a weakling.

474
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,770
I think it's time to reveal my record...

475
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,670
Recently, I mean it was in a wash basin

476
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,810
but Yamasaki tried it then

477
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,410
and got close to 3 minutes, when doing it...

478
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,410
Eh!?

479
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,650
But you know, when he gets in, the water volume and water pressure will shock him

480
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,120
That's true

481
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,620
So he might get so shocked and come up sooner than 9 seconds...

482
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,450
Yamasaki, we're seriously counting on you here

483
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,320
Let's do this

484
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,290
Oh wow, the temperature is perfect

485
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,830
Who cares...

486
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,730
No one cares about that; it's just about the time...

487
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,260
Like he's getting into the bath...

488
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,770
Are you okay?

489
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,100
He just went under and came out...

490
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,270
That's it...

491
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,770
Wait, wait...

492
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,370
We don't need like this kind of "betrayal"...

493
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,510
Seriously

494
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,010
We don't, it won't be funny at all...

495
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,010
"Betrayal"...

496
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,180
Right then, let's get going, Yama-chan

497
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,850
Ready

498
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,320
Start

499
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,890
He just floated in

500
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,590
His breathing technique is suspicious

501
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,030
Wait a minute, he's struggling already

502
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,830
Hold on!

503
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,200
No, he's fine

504
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,200
This is where it starts

505
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,670
He's fine

506
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,670
I told you, the wash basin and this are different

507
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,480
Yeah, this is genuinely painful for the whole body

508
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,480
That's right

509
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,110
Look at him

510
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,910
Come on, Hosei-san, come up already

511
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,680
This is really bad

512
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,250
He's crying...

513
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,420
He's crying underwater..?

514
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,020
Hold on, this is it

515
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,760
Zaki-san, seriously, we're counting on you

516
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,230
Don't push yourself too hard!

517
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,430
You'll actually die if you try too hard!

518
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,100
Don't come up...

519
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,930
Hit the thing for him

520
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,400
See, his eyes are opening up...

521
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,440
He's doing well though!

522
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,750
Here it comes

523
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,820
This is going to be awesome, he's going to get a good time

524
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,890
He's actually amazing, he's gone past a minute

525
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,890
Damn...

526
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,490
He's doing well

527
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,190
Here it is!!

528
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,190
Zaki-san!

529
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,830
Oh my God!

530
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,930
Come up now, come up

531
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,730
He's struggling so much

532
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,800
You can do it!

533
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,200
Zaki-san, you're doing well!

534
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,200
It all hit him at once!

535
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,840
He looks ridiculous!

536
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,040
This is hilarious, this is hilarious!

537
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,080
Wow!!!

538
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,410
Result: 1 minute 33 seconds

539
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,010
Yamasaki, that was awesome!

540
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,010
YEAH!!!

541
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,720
Are you OK?

542
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,350
Amazing!

543
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,450
That was amazing!

544
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,450
Well done!

545
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,520
That was amazing

546
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,520
YEAH!

547
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,820
You really are amazing

548
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,820
Right?!

549
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,320
They've completely flipped the tables...

550
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,430
They're like more than 1 minute ahead now

551
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,600
1 minute 4 seconds?

552
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,000
1 minute 4 seconds...

553
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,370
We need at least a minute here...

554
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,240
We can win...

555
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,100
Yamasaki, that was awesome!

556
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,100
Yeah, Zaki-san!

557
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,070
That was fantastic

558
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,570
Amazing

559
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,810
Amazing, that was awesome

560
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,810
Fantastic

561
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,950
Damn, the Gaki team had an ace in their team...

562
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,650
I know, right?

563
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,850
But his face just suddenly changed

564
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,550
I know, all of a sudden

565
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,220
Yeah, I died once in there...

566
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,950
You died once?

567
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,860
I really did

568
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,620
Your face went mental suddenly...

569
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,590
Well he was amazing, but

570
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,060
we have the man who once became 2nd in the world...

571
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,530
That's right

572
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,270
This is the part I have no idea about...

573
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,140
Kitano Team, next up is the man who became 2nd in the world in bench press lifting once, Nabeyakan

574
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:44,410
Nabeyakan

575
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:44,410
Next up

576
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,410
His awesome muscles which he's trained so much will help him greatly

577
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,640
Here we go then

578
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,640
You going to be okay?

579
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,310
Here we go then

580
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,010
Ready

581
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,310
start

582
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,750
Here he goes, damn he went low

583
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,620
He went so low

584
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,550
This is really bad though; there's more pressure down there

585
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,820
He's really tough on himself, huh?

586
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,790
He's fine

587
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,490
I wonder how long he will stay in there

588
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,160
He looks totally fine still

589
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,160
He really does

590
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,830
He can still go, oh hold on...

591
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,040
Uh oh

592
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,170
Great, great!

593
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,540
He's struggling!

594
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,710
His face looks like a father's one now...

595
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,340
This is bad

596
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,150
Just a bit more...

597
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,950
What is this even?

598
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,950
What is this?

599
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,620
Not yet, not yet!

600
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,790
Not yet!

601
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,490
No, no, no!

602
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,900
A bit more

603
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,900
He's still hanging on though

604
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,270
You can

605
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,270
You can do it

606
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,130
Amazing, stay in a bit longer

607
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,470
He's doing well

608
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,110
I will hit the thing when you get to 1 minute so keep going!

609
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,870
He's done a minute!

610
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,870
You're close to a minute!

611
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,080
Amazing, amazing!

612
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,080
You're close to 1 minute now!

613
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,210
Amazing, holy shit!

614
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,150
This is bad, this is bad!

615
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,790
Oh man, oh man!

616
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,790
This is awful!

617
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,820
He's amazing

618
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,020
This is awesome!

619
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,590
Wow!

620
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,200
Result: 1 minute 18 seconds

621
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,900
As expected of him

622
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,930
That's awesome, you did fantastic.

623
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,870
You did well

624
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,870
That was amazing

625
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:24,400
Office Kitano Team: 14 second lead

626
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,700
That was amazing

627
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,740
The second half has been awesome

628
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,540
I know, he got close to Yamasaki...

629
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,510
Yakan, that was amazing

630
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,780
Let's go first here...

631
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,810
Yeah

632
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,610
Then Matsumoto won't know what the hell to do last...

633
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,150
There will be loads of pressure on him and everything

634
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,650
Damn you, you veteran!

635
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:48,660
Great Gidayu

636
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:48,660
Last up

637
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,090
Finally to the last person

638
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:48,660
Kitano Team has the man who has risen up the ranks doing a number of jobs, Great Gidayu!

639
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,660
Right then, here we go!

640
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,760
Ready

641
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,600
Start!

642
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,600
Oh man, why would you do that!?

643
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,970
Why would you do that?!

644
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,580
That's a no-no!

645
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,420
We spoke about not doing this too!

646
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,820
Wow, his hair is...

647
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,820
God damn it...

648
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,520
And he hasn't moved an inch...

649
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,090
This is bad...

650
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,690
What is he doing?

651
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,760
Oh damn

652
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,700
Result: 31 seconds

653
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,970
Alright!

654
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,570
You can do this!

655
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,810
Couldn't you hold your breath for longer?

656
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,570
....I'm sorry, I really am

657
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,210
You've done so much to get here!

658
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,480
Matsumoto-san's face has gone so white...

659
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,410
I don't know what to do...

660
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,750
This is a tough one...

661
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,020
I think I can do 46 seconds...

662
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,620
Over 46 seconds and Gaki Team wins

663
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,020
You can do it

664
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,350
Let's win our first ever match

665
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,290
But it's different once you get in

666
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,290
Yeah, it really is

667
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,230
Wait, do you have any advice for me...?

668
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,230
Umm, no, not really...

669
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,970
After the break - Will Matsimoto be able to win it?!

670
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:10,440
Matsumoto Hitoshi

671
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:10,460
Last up

672
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,140
For Gaki team, last up is Matsumoto

673
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,480
Will he be able to reverse the deficit under this pressure?

674
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,790
Over 46 seconds and Gaki team wins!

675
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,320
We need you to do this!

676
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,090
But you know

677
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,090
You can do this

678
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,690
But you know...

679
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,560
When you did that 25-metre race against the other 4, you couldn't even swim the whole length...

680
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,230
Your eyes might bulge out even more now since you're not wearing goggles...

681
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,100
The pressure...

682
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,270
Yeah it must be bad

683
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,070
You can do this, don't worry

684
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,370
46 seconds

685
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,370
You can do this

686
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,940
Oh man, there are a lot of spectators too

687
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,680
I'm so nervous...

688
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,780
Relax, relax.

689
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,450
46 seconds...

690
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,750
We're counting on you

691
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,180
46 seconds is a long time, you know...

692
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,350
At 30 seconds, we'll hit on the glass

693
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,180
No way he can do this...

694
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,790
At 30 seconds...

695
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,090
Shall I hit it?

696
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,090
Yeah, please..

697
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,090
You can do this

698
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,560
The pressure is intense!

699
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,560
I know

700
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,730
Good stuff

701
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,230
That's not a good thing to do I don't think...

702
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,800
Right then

703
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,970
Right then, here we go

704
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,970
Please do!

705
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,070
To decide everything

706
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,070
We're counting on you!

707
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,740
Ready

708
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Start!

709
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,740
He's under pressure

710
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,840
Right

711
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,710
Oh man, he's got a bad face on

712
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,650
What kind of a face is that?

713
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,050
He looks like a wax model...

714
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,320
He does...

715
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
What a face...

716
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,920
There's a fair few bubbles coming out...

717
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,590
He looks fine though

718
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,460
Why does he look so calm?

719
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,930
No, it all comes in one go

720
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,000
Yama-chan just suddenly...

721
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,100
Uh oh, hang on... This is bad

722
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Hold on, his feet...

723
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,500
No no! We're counting on you!

724
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,670
Stay down!

725
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,910
Not yet! Not yet!

726
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,580
Come on!!!

727
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,580
Come on!!!

728
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,620
See, he looks fine.

729
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,350
Why does he looks so calm?

730
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,850
No, it all comes in one go

731
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,120
Yama-chan just suddenly...

732
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,890
Uh-oh, hang on... This is bad

733
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,690
Hold on, his feet...

734
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,290
No no! We're counting on you!

735
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,860
Stay down!

736
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,030
Not yet! Not yet!!

737
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:12,170
Come on!!

738
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:12,170
Come on!!

739
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,840
YES!!!!!

740
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,740
So close!!!!!

741
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,610
Result: 41 seconds

742
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,150
Damn it!

743
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,880
So close!

744
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,950
We were so close!

745
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,850
They're a loser of a club, it's decided.

746
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,990
Matsumoto-san, thank you so much

747
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,520
Wait, I'm so gutted!!

748
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,930
I'm so gutted right now!

749
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,300
3 min 51 sec

750
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,300
3 min 55 sec

751
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,300
Gaki Team

752
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,300
Office Kitano team

753
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,600
