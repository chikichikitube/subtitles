3
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,970
Please begin

4
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,900
This is my first time doing such a presentation

5
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm a bit nervous....

6
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,950
Stop that!

7
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,200
I have a theory with me

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,620
The theory I bring to you this time is this....

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,380
The funny faces made by pretty girls are dull

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,000
I get that, I got the same thought as you

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You get what I mean, right

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
Some amateur model post their funny face on their blog

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,900
and it's damn boring~~~

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,970
It is boring

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,820
Aren't their blog interesting?

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,680
None of them are interesting!

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,970
The boring blog is totally another different topic...

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,770
But they really are boring...

19
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,470
I see

20
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,520
For pretty girls, since they were small

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,140
They are more interested in how to look pretty

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,180
So there is no need for them to make actually funny faces

23
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,200
They're not interested in that, they don't do it

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,280
For others, the only way to get attention is to do funny faces

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,970
Therefore, the pretty girls won't be interesting at all

26
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,100
Wait, there must be some which are interesting

27
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,860
Absolutely not

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,740
It's like, I can't imagine she'd make such an ugly face given her cute look

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,950
Basically their funny face won't make people laugh

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,060
They get responses like "That's cute" or "Dare you to make yourself ugly"

31
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,900
Responses that make us feel like we are some fuckin weirdo

32
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,970
She's scary

33
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,660
We do funny faces only to make the atmosphere feel light

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,620
Your speech is full of bad intention...

35
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,000
Sorry, if I'm too over the top

36
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,460
If a pretty girl made funny faces that were better than mine...

37
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,660
That would be my hell

38
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,040
That would be a disgrace

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,950
Exactly!

40
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,460
That's understandable

41
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,370
Let's take Kakei as example, what do you think her funny faces would look like?

42
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,620
So Kakei's funny face in 3....2....1

43
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,170
That was quite funny, wasn't it?

44
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,060
That was a good one

45
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,070
Beyond expectation

46
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,220
Why did you purposely do a good one? It should have been a dull one

47
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,820
Just now, that one's level was quite high

48
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,750
I think I'll get hated because of this

49
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,800
Alright, how about Takahashi's funny face in 3...2...1....

50
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,120
That's a good one

51
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,870
There it is..the ugly one

52
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,650
That was like the mask my father use to wear...

53
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,940
Momotaro Zamurai

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,750
This is what we call a funny face!

55
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,770
You can ditch your announcer job now

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,770
No way, I'll remain as an announcer

57
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,800
Up next, we will find out if the funny faces made by pretty girls are really dull?

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,940
Wednesday Downtown

59
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,220
Now let's test the theory "The Funny faces made by pretty girls are dull"

60
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,770
We tested this at the Omotesando street, a street where many pretty girls appear

61
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,270
Excuse me, we are from TBS

62
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,050
First, we have this pretty girl

63
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,850
The beautiful 24 year old office lady

64
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,100
Do many people around you call you pretty?

65
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,920
No, they don't

66
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't lie

67
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,120
But you must be quite popular?

68
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,050
No, not at all

69
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,270
She is humble, but when we asked her to show us her ICON on LINE....

70
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,920
We found the sign of a pretty girl,
a good looking photo taken by her as her ICON

71
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,950
For those who are not popular, or think that they are not good looking, their ICON would normally be...

72
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,380
Dogs

73
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,380
Cats

74
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,380
Childhood photo

75
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,050
This is a prejudice....

76
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,750
Can you give us your best shot at making a funny face?

77
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,600
Funny face?

78
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,450
So, are the funny faces made by a pretty girl really dull?

79
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,540
Now that's a dull one

80
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,770
This one is really dull

81
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,170
It looks dull from any point of view

82
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,750
The lowest level of funny face

83
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,600
Next up is this girl

84
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,550
She's cute

85
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,550
A 20 year old undergraduate who is working part time at a cafe

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,750
Do people around you call you pretty?

87
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,850
No, they don't

88
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,870
Stop lying to us!

89
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,120
I wish they called me that

90
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,170
However, her LINE ICON is still....

91
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,670
No doubt, the sign of pretty girl, her own portrait

92
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,750
You need confidence
to use that

93
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,660
If someone is really not that good-looking

94
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,700
They're ICON should be them on top of a world heritage

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,260
Enough with this explanation

96
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,300
Can you give us your best shot at making a funny face?

97
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,600
Seriously!?

98
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,820
And her funny face is....

99
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,100
Her funny face was so dull and it makes people feel like asking "Do you know what they mean by funny face?"

100
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,020
Next is this girl

101
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,650
A pretty18 year old undergraduate

102
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,320
People around you call you pretty, right?

103
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,920
Erm...I've no idea...

104
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,970
Does anyone say you looks like a celebrity?

105
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,620
Well... Hashimoto Kanna

106
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,950
Well... Hashimoto Kanna

107
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,250
It's not important whether you look like her or not...

108
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,750
And the old man that slowly passes behind her is also not important

109
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,350
Her LINE ICON is this...

110
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:44,020
A photo that brings up her appearance up by using her friends

111
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,250
Her funny face is...

112
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,050
Again, a dull one...

113
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,400
Next is this girl

114
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,420
A pretty girl that looks like Haruna Kojima from AKB48

115
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,700
Instead of funny, this one looks more adorable

116
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:20,570
We continued the test and found all the funny faces by pretty girls are dull

117
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,250
No one is interesting

118
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,970
Next is this pretty girl

119
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:58,200
A 24 year old undergraduate who uses a posed look for her LINE ICON

120
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,250
Finally, an acceptable funny face

121
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,880
Quite a surprise for us to get an unexpected funny face

122
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,650
And then this 24 year old pretty girl

123
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,740
Seems like there are some pretty girls that can do a moderately funny face

124
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:36,250
But as a whole, the funny faces by pretty girls are mostly dull

125
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,740
What about this talent who seems quite good at doing funny face?

126
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,050
Sorry to disturb

127
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,700
It's Wednesday Downtown

128
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,680
What..what...what??

129
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,200
A talent that's active in variety show, Nana Suzuki, who can be considered as pretty

130
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,650
This may be a bit sudden

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Please give us a funny face in 3...2...1...

132
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,650
Please give us a funny face in 3...2...1...

133
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,740
Now!? No way. Wait...what's this about?

134
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,420
Now!? No way. Wait...what's this about?

135
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,710
She didn't do it immediately

136
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,910
This is sudden

137
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,900
Wait a sec, I need a certain angle

138
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,540
An angle?

139
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,400
To make a funny face

140
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,910
You need to take the shot from a low angle, is that okay?

141
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,900
She concerns about the quality of her funny face more than the making of funny face

142
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,910
That's what we call a pro

143
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,380
Please shoot it properly

144
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,020
This is a bit hard for video

145
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,650
Manager, please check for me too

146
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,000
3...2...1...

147
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,300
She's a fool

148
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,170
She indeed is a good variety show talent

149
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:45,080
What did she mean by
"manager, please
check for me too?"

150
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,420
She had shown us the pro-like funny face

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,170
Did you shoot it properly?

152
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,220
Yes we did

153
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,110
Really?

154
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Then, that's fine

155
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,020
Next we have her...

156
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,820
Good morning

157
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,250
It's Wednesday Downtown

158
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,570
What?

159
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,910
Kikuchi Ami

160
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,850
This time were doing something on funny faces, do you mind?

161
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,600
What do you mean by that?

162
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,300
Please make a funny face for us

163
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,620
A funny face? Now?

164
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,820
Are you kidding?

165
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,650
Let's do this

166
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,200
Now?

167
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,140
3....2....1....

168
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,140
I can't....wait, I can't make it

169
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,000
Can you take it from this position?

170
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,400
From below

171
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,880
As expected

172
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,370
How is this?

173
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,850
It's a bit different, right?

174
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,080
Can you show me the screen?

175
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,680
This is just cute...what should I do?

176
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
What is she talking about?

177
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,780
It just look cute...what should I do?

178
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
That's not cute at all!

179
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,850
She tried not to leave any cuteness

180
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,600
Just like Nana, she looked at the quality of a funny face, instead of doing it in a cute way

181
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,000
She can also be considered as a pro

182
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,800
So, how about this person?

183
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,600
The one who represented Japan for Miss International Beauty Pageant 2014

184
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,570
The top class beauty in Japan

185
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,570
She represented Japan?

186
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,540
Hongo Lila

187
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:26,540
Indeed that was a hot topic back then

188
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,510
That's a surprise

189
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,080
We want you to make a funny face for us

190
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,800
Funny face...is that fine?

191
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,800
Funny face?

192
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,310
Although she's a pretty, there's potential within her

193
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,370
Could she give us a nice one?

194
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,650
Let's find out

195
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,970
I'll try to make it

196
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,880
You will?

197
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,140
She's has the strength
of a Yokozuna

198
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,400
3....2....1....

199
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,730
Now we know that basically, the funny faces made by pretty girls are dull
