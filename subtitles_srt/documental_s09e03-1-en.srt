Thanks For Watching!

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,630
Has the entertainment world had a big change with the arrival of the Coronavirus or the new stay-home culture?

3
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,740
Well, I have been drinking and having interesting conversations with different celebrities about this.

4
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,460
Like "This and that happened the other day." or "This other thing happened at the stage.".

5
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,590
Just stuff like that.

6
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,000
I feel those types of discussions are lacking.

7
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,710
So time to chat?

8
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,700
Goto, please sit down.

9
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,810
And I'm sure all of them have

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,940
thought deeply about comedy individually.

11
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,380
So...

12
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,640
So I think their individual powers have been strengthened in these times.

13
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,460
Right...

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,450
-Whoa, Master Kiyoshi.
-Good morning.

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,010
Has he always had this body?

16
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,690
His pecs are amazing!
He must be working out.

17
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,770
Even though you're not talking!

18
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,030
This dude is not talking!

19
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,560
He's not talking!

20
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,680
Abareru you get the yellow card!

21
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,460
Damn it!

22
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,490
Bastard!

23
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,470
Is there "Re"?

24
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,060
So for "Re"...

25
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,400
I really love this one.

26
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,820
"Throw away the shrimp and take the soup."

27
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,660
He laughed so hard!

28
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,540
He's gagging!

29
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,000
Yellow! This is your last chance.

30
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,180
He got the name wrong.

31
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,290
I'm thirsty.

32
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,730
That's right, he doesn't remember Okuyama at all.

33
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,420
He doesn't.

34
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,490
I do not think so!

35
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,750
-Huh?
-Huh?

36
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,290
The size of his eyes is amazing.

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,890
I don't think so.

38
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,280
I mean, Momoi couldn't remember the name of the movie producer at all.

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,180
I mean, I'm also in the wrong there.

40
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,200
I don't think so.

41
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,470
You were calling her Okumura all the time.

42
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,800
We told you it's Okuyama but you kept saying Okumura.

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,500
I don't have those thoughts!

44
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,760
What is he saying?

45
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,050
He is wrong.

46
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,180
Huh? It's a goblin.

47
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,720
He's crazy.

48
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,710
-It's a goblin.
-What's his deal?

49
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,970
He's a crazy student.

50
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,170
-He closed it.
-He's been held back 80 times.

51
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,510
-He got held back 80 times.
-Right.

52
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,470
Failed student.

53
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,760
Maybe that person has a hint.

54
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,320
Here come the scientist.

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,160
That's great, you can do it because you're young.

56
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,380
Momoi always has it.

57
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,460
I want Momoi to go home.

58
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,350
Did he mistake Okui's name with Okuyama?

59
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,230
That's right.

60
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,650
-No, it was Okumura.
-Oh, Okumura...

61
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,370
Okuyama, right?

62
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,240
-Okuyama?
-Right, Okuyama.

63
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,610
Another experiment?

64
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,950
It's water.

65
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,240
You went for that one?

66
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,110
Huh? She stopped.

67
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:26,840
Huh?

68
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,400
She's gonna say something.

69
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,860
Solo travel in Mutsu province.

70
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,500
Stop that already.

71
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,310
Two.

72
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,360
That one again?

73
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,010
Did you go to Mutsu recently?

74
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,110
Hello Momoi.

75
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,760
You have pretty good lighting there.

76
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,720
It's the one I use to take photos.

77
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,700
Did you bring that yourself?

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,010
It was just there.

79
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,030
That's great.

80
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,170
-Getting good lighting like this is the most important thing for this type of job.
-It's super bright! and she talks with anyone.

81
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,480
That's how it is.

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,590
She's very sociable.

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,930
-Older celebrities all have lots of experience.
-It's the same for people in the service industry.

84
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,480
I would really love it if someone did some impersonations.

85
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,770
Shall I do some?

86
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,810
My heart is very big so...

87
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,910
Seiya how about you do it?

88
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,700
Would you like to see some of my impersonations?

89
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,410
-Of course!
-How about you do her?

90
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,000
Me?!

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,370
Yes.

92
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,470
-I impersonate her? May I?
-Or course, try it.

93
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,630
-Of course, you can do it.
-In front of the real person?

94
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,160
Ehm...

95
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,220
How come there's this many people?

96
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,520
Don't you think that wasn't bad?

97
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,540
Here comes Master Nikaku. (Editor's Note: 1)

98
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,510
His personality is a bit...

99
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,980
Who is he trying to imitate?

100
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,350
You know how you eat whenever you get hungry?

101
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,400
Yes.

102
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,080
Right.

103
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,780
Don't give me that, "I don't think so" crap.

104
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:04,850
But I do.

105
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:05,700
You're wrong.

106
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,980
-He's got his mouth taped so he can't speak.
-It's not the same guy.

107
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,990
It's not the same guy, it's a different one.

108
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,500
That's super scary.

109
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,690
This guy definitely eats humans.

110
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,800
He eats humans.

111
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,600
What's with him?

112
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,160
Amazing.

113
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,360
-So scary.
-That was so scary.

114
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,280
-Why would he do that?
-He's not saying a word.

115
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,970
What did he come here for?

116
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,260
Why is he here?

117
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,550
Going home?

118
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,410
Who are you?

119
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,690
Please tell us.

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,010
I'm Sasaki.

121
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,440
-Sasaki?
-Sasaki?

122
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,630
That's Soshina's actual surname.

123
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,700
-I mean, I am Sasaki.
-Hmm... Sasaki...

124
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,850
What's your name?

125
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:53,980
Suzuki.

126
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,190
Suzuki?

127
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,370
Are you Suzuki Sasaki then?

128
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,280
Do you have any hobbies?

129
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,420
Cycling.

130
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,640
That's so normal...

131
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,520
Yes.

132
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,370
Huh?

133
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,200
-I'm going.
-What'd he say?

134
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,250
He said "yes" and went back.

135
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:12,950
Yes?!

136
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,840
I'm going.

137
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,820
Could I try this thing I saw on the internet?

138
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,910
-Sure, sure.
-What is it?

139
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,250
-What's wrong?
-It's just something I saw.

140
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,180
You can apparently improve your reflexes with this.

141
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,120
You just have to put his tape-like stuff and your reflexes will get better. (EN: 2)

142
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,120
-Runners put it on their soles or on their Achilles heel.
-Right! I've seen that.

143
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,270
Below the ear as well.

144
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,990
You're going in the neck too?

145
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,410
-Could I borrow this for a moment?
-Sure.

146
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,440
The bamboo sword?

147
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,760
Just smack me and I'll stop it.

148
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,420
Me?

149
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,400
Alright, then Goto please do it.

150
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,540
I...

151
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,830
-Like catching a falling sword.
-Right.

152
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,660
I'm going, okay?

153
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,470
Yes, please go ahead.

154
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,390
Alright.

155
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,490
Come!

156
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,450
It was only the first one...

157
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,360
It was only the first one.

158
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,860
Too hard.

159
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,350
It's like...

160
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,140
-You went for the final strike.
-You're hitting him like it's the finals of a match.

161
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,280
That was a final strike.

162
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,750
I mean, I don't know sports...

163
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,650
Sorry.

164
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,420
Also, it's too fast.

165
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,250
Just try it a little slower.

166
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,460
-Slower?
-Don't know if I can do it.
-Just try it out.

167
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,620
-Like this?
-A bit faster. Just like that.

168
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,530
And you're too quick to pull it back. It was unfair.

169
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,820
You're too fast with the follow-up strike.

170
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,120
I see.

171
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,190
Go when I say so.

172
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,230
Go!

173
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,350
Not even close.

174
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,240
-I'm twitching.
-Your face is convulsing.

175
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,750
-Isn't he hitting him harder?

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,910
-Goto! He's convulsing!
-This is bad.

177
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,090
Oh my god, Goto! What did you do?

178
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,600
You damaged your underling's face.

179
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,600
Doing it with a pet bottle was hard but doing it with a bamboo sword is ridiculous.

180
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,430
But you told me to do it!

181
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,130
Why do you go like that when you're in pain?

182
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,310
Why do you convulse?

183
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,030
It's just stress. It's stress from the pain.

184
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,490
Whenever I'm in pain I go like this from the stress.

185
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,280
Are you alright?

186
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,840
Sorry, then please do it three times in a row.

187
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,230
-I see.
-Are you really fine?
-I'll match your timing.

188
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,650
-I just have to stop it once and that's it.
-You look really cool.

189
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:21,790
Here we go.

190
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:22,750
Go!

191
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,260
Go! Go!

192
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,520
Ouch! Ouch!

193
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,240
You should quit it.

194
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,840
Where are you going?

195
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,970
He's convulsing again.

196
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,790
Bang, bang.

197
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,880
-You had a pretty good rhythm going on there.

198
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,800
-It was like a gospel.
-It looked like your breaths had synced.

199
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,910
I think you can do it with the roles reversed.

200
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,440
-That was like a chorus.
-Oh, reverse?

201
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,700
You look at the first one and then you try to catch the second one.

202
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,300
-Right, let's try that.
-Yes, you look at the tempo first.

203
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,820
You give up on the first strike.

204
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,180
So you eat the first one and then you try to catch the rhythm.

205
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,190
Right.

206
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,140
-Eat the first one.
-Eat it.

207
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,650
Go!

208
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,170
-Three times?
-Yes.

209
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,400
Go!

210
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,550
4, 2, 3...

211
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:07,590
Tragic...

212
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,050
I might barf...

213
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,130
-You look like a weird Nabeatsu.
-I might barf. (EN: 3)

214
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,460
He's getting dizzy.

215
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,680
You have to grab it quickly.

216
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,140
-Oh, the Master...
-Can I borrow his power?-Sure.

217
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,120
-Can I borrow his power?-Sure.

218
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,890
Go ahead.

219
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,360
3 times?

220
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:29,810
Yes!

221
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,620
Come on Goto.

222
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,000
Goto won't do it.

223
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
I mean, I'm the underling now.

224
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,030
He's the big Master.

225
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,940
Now that he's got the mask on...

226
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,250
I can't be hitting the great Master, even if it's only a mask.

227
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,080
The Master's mouth today has been looking like one of those head shots you get.

228
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,580
3 times.

229
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,340
3 times.

230
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,560
And eat the first one.

231
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:53,840
Go!

232
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,030
What are you doing?!
Quit it already!!

233
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,030
He's playing Master Kiyoshi properly now.

234
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,020
I don't mind killing you.

235
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,430
"I don't mind killing you"?

236
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,610
You can't.

237
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,370
Sorry.

238
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,070
That's scary.

239
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,390
I mean...

240
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,650
Isn't that Kubota?

241
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,650
Didn't he get a Medal of Honor? (EN: 4)

242
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:15,770
Try it.

243
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,230
What's gonna happen if Soshina hits the master?

244
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,980
You have to succeed or he'll get mad.

245
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,580
3 Times?

246
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,960
Here I go.

247
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,770
I'll just die!

248
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,670
I'll die.

249
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,380
What am I gonna do if I lose the 10 million and get my skull fractured?!

250
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,850
-Okay... Okay...
-What are you doing?

251
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,800
Okay!

252
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,990
A weird role?

253
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,530
I'm Kiyoshi Nishikawa!

254
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,260
That startled me.

255
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,990
-Huh?
-Huh?

256
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,230
Oh, it's that thing.

257
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,330
I'm Kiyoshi Nishikawa!

258
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,920
Master Kiyoshi?!

259
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,060
-Whoa that's scary!
-I'm Kiyoshi Nishikawa!

260
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,510
40 years later? 40 years later?

261
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,490
I'm Kiyoshi Nishikwa!

262
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,480
-Huh?
-Huh? Which one?

263
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,860
-That guy?
-Master Kiyoshi is making a lot of appearances today.

264
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,590
This is not Kiyoshi, is he?

265
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,660
-Is he not him?
-Who's this?

266
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,370
Who?

267
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,210
I'm Kaiou Kaku! (EN: 5)

268
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,440
-Kaiou Kaku?
-Oh, the one from Baki?

269
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,580
I'm Kaiou Kaku!

270
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,770
-Who is he?
-The Master from Baki?

271
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:25,470
I'm Kaiou Kaku. I mastered martial arts in China over 4000 years ago!

272
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,810
-Awesome.
-I'm Kaiou Kaku.

273
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:28,690
-Are you strong?

274
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,730
-He looks super strong.
-He's super strong.

275
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,460
The ultimate martial art does not require strength.

276
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,370
You will receive great injuries by one single strike.

277
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:39,990
-Right.
-Right.

278
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,150
The ultimate weakness is the only thing that can neutralize all attacks.

279
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,060
That's right.

280
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,970
-A leaf won't be affected by my punch.
-Huh?

281
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,100
-A leaf won't be affected by my punch.
-Right, cause he's not trying.

282
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,630
So, now I will show you the ultimate weakness.

283
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,040
You're talking just like Sunshine.

284
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,430
I will do zero damage.

285
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
This is called "Shaolin".

286
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,450
So please hit me.

287
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,270
This is the guy from Baki, he also negates all damage.

288
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,380
Momoi can you hit him?

289
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,960
Actually, a strong person would be better.

290
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,060
-Then, let's go with Junior.
-Right, Junior.
-Yes, I haven't done this before.

291
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,790
That's true.

292
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,790
I...

293
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,950
-Junior, do it like in Baki.

294
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,020
Junior has been doing this for a long time.

295
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,620
What about Abareru?

296
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,490
I don't think so.

297
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,300
When did he say that?!

298
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:28,930
You have to time it.

299
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,730
His weakness is amazing.

300
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,900
Oh, his weakness?

301
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,340
-He's already weak.
-That's amazing.
-Won't it hurt?

302
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,880
I will take everything.

303
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,210
I can already tell, this guy's amazing.

304
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,660
He's a pro.

305
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,450
How hard should I go?

306
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:46,930
With everything.

307
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,050
-Huh?
-Junior, I'll do it for you.

308
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,720
-Junior's full force would be bad.
-I'll do it instead.

309
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,140
I mean if you really want to you can do it.

310
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,050
Alright, here I go.

311
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:57,930
-Can I go?
-Here I go.

312
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,450
Okay.

313
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,170
-Ready?
-Yes.

314
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,410
It didn't work at all.
Shaolin.

315
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,520
This is Shaolin.

316
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,060
Sure.

317
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,760
Ready? Ready?

318
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,160
-On the face?
-On the face?!

319
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,040
The face?!

320
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,580
Ready?

321
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,030
Here goes.

322
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,010
I'm going for the face.

323
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:21,490
Shaolin.

324
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,350
Huh?

325
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,900
-He's hurt.
-It didn't work.

326
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,870
-I mean, he said so himself...
-Abareru, you go.

327
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,020
It seems to me like it did affect him.

328
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,770
This is Shaolin.

329
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,610
Right?

330
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,180
Abareru, go for the face.

331
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,680
Whoa, it fell off.

332
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,590
That was dangerous.
-So unsafe!

333
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,250
Scary.

334
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:39,960
So scary!

335
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,900
This is scary.

336
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,780
-Scary.
-It's so scary.

337
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,860
-Why?
-Is he 130 years old?

338
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,600
This is what he looks like?

339
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,360
I think he is hurt.

340
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,710
We should do a bit more.

341
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,640
Just do it harder.

342
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,290
-I mean I hit him pretty hard just now.
-Right...

343
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,500
-But you didn't go full force.
-In the face?!

344
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:52,860
Are you okay with that?

345
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,850
Should be fine.

346
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,870
It's his "weakness".

347
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,130
Oh, he fell.

348
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,150
Is he alright?

349
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,570
-I don't think he's fine.
-Doesn't it hurt?

350
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,690
-It's hurting him.

351
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,750
So it doesn't hurt?

352
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,820
It has no effect, this is Shaolin.

353
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,160
Amazing.

354
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,270
Shaolin.

355
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,610
So are you just going home?

356
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,480
I won't.

357
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,400
Huh?

358
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,270
Soshina, what's up?

359
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,700
I thought he would say something funny.

360
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,500
I mean, it looked like he wanted to go home but couldn't because it was awkward.

361
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,720
-He should go home.
-It was nothing.

362
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,330
I mean, it's fine.

363
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,450
-Huh?
-Oh!

364
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,540
Year 3 Class B. (EN: 6)

365
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,250
I had warned my students of this...

366
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,600
But I took some drugs!

367
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,410
Who did the drugs?

368
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,470
Year 3 Class B.

369
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,620
Ehm... It must have been Shu.

370
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,210
Hello, I'm Kyosuke Himuro. (EN: 7)

371
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,670
-Oh, Himuro!
-Himuro!
-I'm here now! Everyone! Enjoy the party!

372
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,820
I will read the Tarot cards for you on this special occasion.

373
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,880
-Tarot?
-You can read the Tarot cards Himuro?!

374
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,520
-Let us hear you sing.

375
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,160
-Right!

376
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,230
I will read the Tarot cards.

377
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:17,720
Yes.

378
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,740
-Oh, huge cards.
-I'll read the Tarot cards for you.

379
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,530
Whoa.

380
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,680
What would you like me to read?

381
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,480
I would like to know about work.

382
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,200
So you want me to tell you about your work?
Alright, pick a card.

383
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,090
-Alright then, Soshina, go ahead.
-Take your pick.

384
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,170
Then... This one.

385
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:33,630
This one?

386
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,660
This one!

387
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,620
Hotei has turned into a skeleton.
(EN: 8)

388
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,800
You will wear shoes full of mud next year.

389
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,160
Thank you.

390
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,950
-Hotei also comes up!
-You will wear mud filled shoes.

391
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,650
Ask about anything you want.

392
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,310
-Alright then, let's go with love.
-Love?

393
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,290
Alright, love.

394
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,180
This one.

395
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,820
Oh, this one!

396
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,760
-Oh, I did it!
-Hotei is...

397
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,900
-Oh, this is love related.
-Hotei is flirting with Kumiko Yamashita.

398
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,830
-Kumiko Yamashita?
-Yes, he's flirting with Kumiko Yamashita.

399
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,660
You are racing along the Mevius Highway...

400
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,610
You'll fall in love.

401
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,230
You will fall in love.

402
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,040
-You will fall in love.
-Isn't that good?

403
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,910
You will fall in love.

404
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,680
You go.

405
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,200
Me?

406
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,990
Then, I choose health.

407
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,980
-Health?
-Yes.

408
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,560
You will die!!

409
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,860
I'll die?

410
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,510
He'll die? But it looks like such a nice card.

411
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,870
It looks really good.

412
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:34,640
Judgment.

413
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,360
Are you okay?

414
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,740
It's like the one I pulled.

415
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,600
-Sorry, could you do Momoi?
-Oh, sure.

416
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,520
You're spitting a lot so be careful.

417
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,970
I don't like these kinds of things.

418
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,630
-Pick a card.
-I don't want to die though...

419
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,800
What are you asking?

420
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,050
-What is it?
-Ehm...

421
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,190
Acting?

422
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,190
Acting...

423
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,040
-That's fine.
-Well, it's all work-related.

424
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,080
Oh, this one...

425
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,900
Hotei is upside down in this one.

426
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,290
You will go crazy after the Honky Tonky.

427
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,460
What does that mean?

428
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,950
You...

429
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,360
You will be popular.

430
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,690
I'm so glad.

431
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,440
But she's already super popular...

432
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,100
-She's selling really well.
-She's already a star.
-She will be popular.

433
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,250
-She will be popular.

434
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,770
I hope I get that acting luck.

435
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,240
Hold on, who are you?

436
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,030
I'm Kinpachi, the drug addict.

437
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,730
Oh, right.

438
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,120
Hold on.

439
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,450
What would you like me to read?

440
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,580
-How will my pancreas turn out?
-Alright, good!

441
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,180
Pancreas?

442
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,210
Pancreas?

443
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,130
Here I go!

444
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,320
Is he worried about his pancreas?

445
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,440
He must be.

446
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,960
alright!

447
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:41,590
Huh?

448
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,610
Hotei is fighting with a lion in summer.

449
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,510
You will die.

450
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,030
Oh no, he'll die.

451
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,730
How about you read your own future?

452
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,700
Of course, I can do that as well.

453
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,050
Ehm... Let's see...

454
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,250
Let's see how my next album will do.

455
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,610
-How will my album do?
-Sure.

456
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,130
Alright, I'll read the cards.

457
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,650
-Huh?
-What?

458
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,280
I will die... overseas.

459
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,050
Die?

460
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,870
There's tons of death.

461
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,090
Everything is death.

462
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,260
Everything...

463
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,650
Everything will die.

464
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,530
There's one card left though...

465
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,480
Can I go then?

466
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,250
Oh, go ahead.

467
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,640
-Please pick a card.
-Alright.

468
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,670
What would you like to see?

469
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,820
Then... About my big brother.

470
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,970
-Your brother?
-Yes.

471
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,060
-Here we go.
-Okay.

472
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,600
Complex.

473
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,790
This a complex.

474
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,330
Amazing.

475
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,980
Complex has turned up.

476
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,570
Amazing.

477
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,700
This is good.

478
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,810
Oh, it's good!

479
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,440
What does it mean?

480
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,080
Seiji will die next year.

481
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:55,990
Die?

482
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,060
-Everyone dies.
-Why is everyone dying?!

483
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,570
-That's such a bad omen.
-That's too soon.

484
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,320
-This fortune reader is so tasteless.
-I thought he'd give us good news.

485
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,840
What's Master Seiji's cause of death?

486
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,060
-Master Seiji?
-Why do they call him Master Seiji?

487
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,960
He's not a Master yet.

488
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,700
What's Master Seiji's cause of death?

489
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,440
Necrosis.

490
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,290
-Necrosis?! He'll rot to death?
-Necrosis.

491
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,460
Master Seiji?

492
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,130
Seiji...

493
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,300
Will he be alright?

494
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,720
-What's wrong?!
-What's wrong?!

495
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,000
Are you okay?

496
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,660
This guy again.

497
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,650
He's back.

498
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,460
It looks like he entered my body.

499
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,070
-You liar!
-He infiltrated him.

500
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,570
He's in my body.

501
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,190
What's that?

502
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,970
What is this collage-looking thing?

503
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,340
It's super scary.

504
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,900
It's a monster.

505
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,740
A monster.

506
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,320
He came into your body...

507
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,200
And he's controlling you.

508
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,690
-He's possessing you!
-Oh no! Oh no!

509
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,070
This guy is scary.

510
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,260
Y-You can punch me.

511
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:49,980
You too?

512
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,890
You can punch me!

513
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,520
-There's a lot of punching today.

514
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,280
You can punch my face!!

515
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,850
You too?

516
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,670
Please drive it out!

517
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,950
Should I volunteer for this?

518
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,360
-What's with this?
-Should I volunteer for this?
-Please go ahead.

519
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,410
Is there a point to this?

520
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,560
Drive it out!

521
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,920
Alright, I will.

522
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,270
Drive it out!

523
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:10,570
Where?

524
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,060
Around here.

525
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,550
That's your body though... Is that okay?

526
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,910
-So she's killing it, right?
-Right

527
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:17,940
Go ahead.

528
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,030
Get out of this person!

529
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,790
Get out of this person!

530
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,970
-Go, go, go.
-Go.

531
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,670
Harder! Harder!

532
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,880
Get out of this person!
-You have to drive it out.

533
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,850
Harder! Harder!

534
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,620
-Get out!
-Harder!

535
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,960
-Get out!
-Harder!

536
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,470
-Go!!
-Get out!
-Harder!

537
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,340
-Get out!
-Harder!

538
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,630
-Get out!
-Harder!
-So long...

539
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,720
-Get out!
-Harder!
-It's so long... Super long.

540
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,500
-Get out!
-Harder!

541
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,350
-Get out!
-Thanks!

542
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,210
No one's laughing.

543
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,630
I can't believe no one laughed after that.

544
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,100
They won't laugh.

545
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,380
Of course.

546
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,560
Oh, hello... I will be doing some ventriloquism.

547
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,980
Ventriloquism?

548
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,620
Yes.

549
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,570
I've been doing shows all over the country.

550
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,050
Yes.

551
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,750
-What is that?
-This is Mr. Penis.

552
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,120
-Nice to meet you.
-Mr. Penis?

553
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,840
That person over there, please pay attention.

554
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,500
Mr. Penis?

555
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,960
Yes, Mr. Penis will answer your questions, no matter what you ask.

556
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,040
-Alright, please ask a question.
-Where did you come from?

557
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,100
From North Kyushu.

558
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,490
-Huh?
From North Kyushu.

559
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,800
-A penis from North Kyushu...
-A penis from North Kyushu...

560
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I came from North Kyushu.

561
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,660
How old are you?

562
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,620
-Huh?
-How old are you?

563
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,390
How old? How old do you think I am?

564
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,290
I mean, it looks pretty clean... So maybe it's in its teens?

565
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,260
What did you say?

566
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,540
-You're pretty clean so...
-I'm so happy.

567
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,570
Huh?

568
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,040
It made a sound.

569
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,660
Like a hissing sound.

570
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,550
Will something come out if we praise it?

571
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,160
Are there any other questions?

572
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,310
What kind of girls do you like?

573
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,300
-I love every girl.
I love her.
-Thank you.

574
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,000
It's making that sound but nothing is coming out.

575
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,390
It's such a failure.

576
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:56,790
He's doing something.

577
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,290
-What's happening?
-What's going on?

578
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,400
-Is there any other questions?
-Ehm...

579
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,790
What is written on your shirt?

580
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,770
It's Patagonia.

581
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,040
Nothing is coming out.

582
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,840
It's dripping down your elbow.

583
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,930
I'm sorry.

584
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,360
I get all sweaty when I'm nervous.

585
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,390
Disgusting.

586
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,430
Life never goes as you'd expect...

587
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,760
Does it?

588
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,870
What are you looking at?

589
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,480
What is your name?

590
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,710
I'm Kyosuke Himuro.

591
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,540
Huh? What's that?

592
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,660
I bet the hole is off center.

593
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,790
Can I look at the opening part?

594
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,630
Please do it.

595
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,460
Huh?

596
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,890
Here comes another one.

597
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,100
Huh?

598
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:45,860
Huh?

599
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,000
Who are you?

600
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,670
Eat the bread!

601
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:52,870
Huh?

602
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,330
Oh, he said, "eat the bread".

603
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,750
Poor thing.

604
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,830
Oh, here it goes.

605
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,140
Oh, he's doing it.

606
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,910
Eat the bread!

607
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,170
Poor thing.

608
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,050
-That's so sad.
-Yeah, that's sad.

609
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:11,910
It's so big too.

610
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,480
The crown, I mean.

611
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,300
He must hate bread.

612
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,630
Eat it...

613
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,530
Soshina, you should give him some mandarin.

614
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,280
Is a mandarin any better?

615
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,880
-Thank you, thank you.
-Here's a mandarin.

616
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,440
It's a mandarin.

617
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,770
Here comes the mandarin.

618
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,130
Oh, he's going for it.

619
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,210
-He's going for it.
-Juice is coming out.

620
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,980
Eat the mandarin!!

621
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,580
That makes a pretty loud sound.

622
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:39,700
That's true.

623
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,110
That's kinda scary.

624
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,660
-Eat the mandarin...
-Is he an idiot?

625
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,220
-Does he not get what a mandarin is?
-It hurts...
-Maybe it's too hard.

626
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,360
Himuro...

627
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,230
It's a hard one.

628
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,890
Himuro, it's looking at you.

629
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,980
It's going to Himuro.

630
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,340
No, no.

631
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,330
This guy is a star! He's a star!

632
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,700
Don't do it! No!

633
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,280
Eat Himuro!!

634
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,660
Image down.

635
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,380
-Image down...
-Image down...

636
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,170
-But the image is not down.
-Right, not at all...

637
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,150
Huh? Isn't he looking at Momoi now?

638
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,700
Oh no, it's looking at Momoi now.

639
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,570
Oh no.

640
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,740
No! Stop it!

641
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,530
Don't eat Momoi!

642
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,790
She's a star!

643
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,570
That hurts!

644
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,170
Ouch!

645
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,930
Ouch!

646
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,280
Ouch, it hurts!

647
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,550
Stop!

648
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,010
I'm telling you, no!

649
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,350
Don't you know how to hold back?

650
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:45,490
That's true.

651
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,530
Now that I think about it...

652
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,290
It was super loud.

653
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,020
-It was super painful.
-It must have been.

654
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,370
You held back when you pecked yourself but not with me?

655
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,390
SK-II. (EN: 9)

656
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,220
That's the wrong way of saying SK-II.

657
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,390
-What part is she getting mad at?
-How do you say it?

658
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,360
For a clear skin, SK-II.
-Oh no, he's acting like a boy again.

659
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,390
For a clear skin, SK-II.

660
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,130
He just completely hid behind the chair.

661
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,680
He did!

662
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,280
You laughed!

663
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,460
I heard you chuckling.

664
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,600
-You definitely had a smile.
-Huh? Who was it?

665
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,560
Huh?

666
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,740
Oh, isn't this pretty bad?

667
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,460
-Of course it was Seiya.
-Whoa! Hold on!

668
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:38,270
But we couldn't really see it from this side.

669
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,410
-He was hiding it.
-But some of these cameras must have caught it.

670
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,020
But you knew you were laughing, right?

671
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,010
I mean, I held it back with my nose.

672
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,600
-It wasn't like a full out laugh.
-No way.
-No way, no way.

673
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,790
Momoi, I'm sorry.

674
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,340
-It hurt so much.
-Poor Momoi.

675
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,510
The sound it made was so loud. It was hilarious.

676
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,810
You held back when you pecked yourself but not with me?

677
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,750
SK-II.

678
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,640
That's the wrong way of saying SK-II.

679
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,650
-What part is she getting mad at?
-How do you say it?

680
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,810
For a clear skin, SK-II.
-Oh no, he's acting like a boy again.

681
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:13,770
It was his nose.

682
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,920
For a clear nose, SK-II.

683
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,510
He laughed with his nose.

684
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,090
I don't know about this one... It got away from me.

685
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,490
-I will leave it to everyone's judgment.
-Oh, it got away.

686
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:26,630
I really only did that with my nose.

687
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,010
-My face was like this.
-But did you find it funny?

688
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,250
Not at all.

689
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,230
Hey!

690
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,520
But you were laughing.

691
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,360
It felt like I was studying in a library.

692
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,770
-I mean, you're immediately out if you smile even a little bit next time.
-I'm sorry!

693
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,840
I'm sorry everyone, you can take me out if I falter even a little bit next time.

694
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,390
-He's safe for now.
-I'm sorry.
-Alright, he's in orange.

695
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,200
Just tell me again if you found it funny or not.

696
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,010
I really didn't.

697
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,860
-Why?
-Why are you asking again?

698
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,830
He was pretending to do it.

699
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,390
This must have hurt.

700
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,890
-It really hurt.
-It's super painful.

701
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,790
Ouch!

702
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,830
-This must hurt.
-Of course.

703
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,970
This definitely hurts.

704
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,250
Seiya really doesn't know how to hold back.

705
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,190
I'm so sorry Momoi.

706
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,540
-And she's like a veteran, senior woman celebrity...
-You should really quit it.

707
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,220
What kind of stuff are you pulling here?

708
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,260
Please give me an insurance card.

709
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,430
Aren't you listening?
I'm asking you, what are you trying to pull here?

710
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,650
Please give me a certificate of residence.

711
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,120
Look...

712
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,320
-Huh?
-Huh?

713
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,190
Huh?

714
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,390
A scary person has entered.

715
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,780
-Good morning.
-Junji?
It's the Master. (EN: 10)

716
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,670
Hello.

717
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,680
Good morning.

718
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,460
Aaaa, it's that thing.

719
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,630
-Huh?
-What?

720
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,780
I came on a summer night.

721
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,230
-Huh?
-The taxi...

722
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,490
-Is that Junji Inagawa?
-Oh, a taxi came in the night.

723
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,370
The taxi came and the woman smoothly raised her hand up.

724
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,860
-So it's a ghost story.
-It came slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly...

725
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,920
And she had a bad feeling, she didn't like it.

726
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,170
-I can't understand most of it.

727
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,300
So a taxi came and there was something there.

728
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,010
So I thought, "What is that? I don't like it".

729
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,380
But it came slowly, slowly, slowly, towards me!

730
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,940
That's what I thought.

731
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,730
And that thing...

732
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,730
What does it mean?

733
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,770
Her accent is amazing.

734
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,380
And the thing stopped right in front of me.

735
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,690
-Huh?
-Is she targeting me?

736
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,020
And it came slowly towards me.

737
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,420
-Her voice feels ready for the punchline.
-And I was like, "What? That is weird.".

738
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,000
-That was...
-She's still doing that voice.

739
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,380
I thought that was weird.

740
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,360
-Weird...
-And maybe it was...

741
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,280
This kind of face.

742
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,170
-It was a duck face.
-A duck face.

743
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,310
-That was cute.
-Not scary at all.

744
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,940
-That was cute.
-She was playing a cute girl.

745
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,880
That was great.

746
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,510
Yes, like this.

747
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,020
-It was like you were splitting something up.
That's right.

748
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,420
It was just a meeting.
-That's what I thought.

749
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,660
It was a normal meeting for Soshina.

750
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,570
We just met.

751
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,280
The fact that Abareru thinks this is funny is hilarious to me.

752
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,320
Right?

753
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,200
Huh?

754
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,570
It's a goblin.

755
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,140
-Excuse me...
-Three eyed, goblin...

756
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,090
He's turned into Hiei. (EN: 11)

757
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,360
Do you have any other shapes for sunglasses?

758
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,500
A different shape?

759
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,120
Oh, he needs three lenses.

760
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,540
I have a dry eye.
My eye is dry.

761
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,300
For his third eye!

762
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,290
-I have a dry eye.
-It's Mitsume Kozou.
-He's missing one lens. (EN: 12)

763
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,030
Do you know where they might sell it?

764
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,700
Not really...

765
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,240
I've never seen anything like it.

766
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,130
So not here?

767
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,990
-There isn't.
-Where should I go then?

768
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,160
-I really haven't seen anything like it.
-But it has to be in the city.

769
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,070
You should stretch out your legs, it's important.

770
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,950
-Why are you trying to look for a store close-by?
-A nearby place...

771
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,440
-If possible... Within west Tokyo.
-Just go to the suburbs.

772
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:35,710
Is it because he stands out?

773
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,560
West Tokyo?

774
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,710
-West Tokyo?
-Yes, I live in west Tokyo.

775
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,550
That's far.

776
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,640
-West Tokyo...
-And in the city...

777
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,610
Anyways, I haven't seen anything like it.

778
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,040
Sorry, I'll come back again.

779
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,850
He's got such a bland character for a three-eyed brat.

780
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,470
Huh?

781
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,750
-Are you looking at me?
-He's right, what a bland character.

782
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,120
Everyone is looking at you right now.

783
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,750
-Can't you see us?
-Everyone's looking at you, Abareru.

784
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,320
Alright!

785
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,140
That startled me.

786
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,340
-Me too.
-Let's play a game.

787
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,070
Oh!

788
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,270
The continuation?

789
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,230
Let's play a game.

790
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,240
Let's!

791
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,150
Let's do it!

792
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,520
Just drop them...

793
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,860
This guy's games take too long.

794
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,680
The last one was a hit.

795
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,190
So we have 3 more left.

796
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,230
-Are there three more?!
-Which one is good?

797
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,600
We'll do "Exploding Ice Gag Battle"

798
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,970
Both parties will take off their tops.

799
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,060
Each one will take an ice rock.

800
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:31,590
And they will start screaming gags at each other while they melt the ice on top of their nipples.

801
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,110
What?

802
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,450
And...

803
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,340
What?

804
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,810
You lose if you can't bear it any longer and step away.

805
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,990
Or the one that laughs first loses.

806
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,190
They won't laugh.

807
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,760
-And the one that steps away...

808
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,440
I mean you don't have to explain that the loser is the one that laughs.
That's the point of this show.

809
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,530
-Is this guy an idiot?
-That's just this show's rule...

810
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,300
-I mean, you laugh, you lose.
-This guy is an idiot.

811
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,840
-So, furthermore!!
-You'll lose if you laugh, that's obvious.

812
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,080
So the person that steps away after doing this...

813
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,830
Has to scream out the name of the hot food he or she wants to eat the most.

814
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,260
-You're always adding those weird rules...
-I love food.

815
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,710
-This is the "Exploding Ice Student".

816
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,790
-Huh?
-What?

817
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,680
-Are you out of breath?
-Huh?! What?!

818
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,420
-He's pissed.
-You just said "Ice Student".

819
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,840
Explain to me what he just said.

820
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,990
-What's wrong?
-What's the matter?

821
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,600
That's "Exploding Ice Gag Battle"

822
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,840
I mean, have no idea what the rules are.

823
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,870
So you have to melt the ice?

824
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,820
The one that melts it first wins.

825
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,310
The first one is the winner.

826
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,970
-Please aim for that.
-So you melt it on the other person.

827
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,800
Yes, you melt it on your opponent's nipple.

828
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,950
Now let's move on.

829
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,720
Huh? So that was the explanation?!

830
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,390
-I see, so you're explaining each one.

831
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:41,650
-I want you guys to pick. Though I would love to do every single one...
-Let's just hear everything out.

832
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,160
-I mean, let's hurry up and play.
-I mean, we saw this one already.

833
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,580
Then let's do it.

834
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,740
-The explanations take too long.
-Alright! Let's go!

835
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,710
-Let's do the "Ice Gag Battle".
-It's really hard to understand.

836
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,560
-We have to see it first.
-Are you doing it alone?

837
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,280
I will battle someone in a trial match.

838
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,600
Isn't he perfect?

839
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,270
-You're already naked.
-I see.

840
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,510
And you also have lots of gags.

841
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,240
Is that okay?

842
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,340
I mean, Goto hasn't done much today.

843
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,700
I did the popcorn thing.

844
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,050
It was super hot.

845
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,590
-You haven't done anything today.
-Didn't you see my balls?

846
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,420
But you haven't moved at all today.

847
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,560
I mean, I had my balls out.

848
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,580
Didn't you look at them?

849
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,740
Which one of my balls was out?

850
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,480
The right one.

851
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,840
Then you did see it.

852
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,720
-Let's go.
-Alright, let's try it out.

853
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,150
I really have no clue what we're doing.

854
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,930
In the end I didn't understand the rules.

855
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,960
-It's huge.
-It really is.

856
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,550
Alright, let's go with this one.

857
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,400
It's in close quarters.

858
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,380
-Sorry, can I hear the rules again?
-When should they start shouting the gags?

859
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,760
While we are both melting the ice on each other's nipples.

860
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,520
-We'll both start shouting out gags.
-At each other?

861
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,070
Yes.

862
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,370
And the one that melts it first is the winner.

863
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,250
It's super long.

864
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:04,760
It's cold so the person that steps away first has to scream out the name of the hot food they want to eat.

865
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,500
So can you come back if you scream the name of the food?

866
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,740
No, you lose.

867
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,770
So you shout the name of the food and you still lose?
There's no point in screaming then.

868
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,110
That's just the game.

869
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,720
Huh?

870
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,470
Is that where you get excited?
By screaming out names of hot food?

871
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,060
I don't get it.

872
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,080
-But Seiya has strong nipples.
-But I'm pretty tired today.

873
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,920
-This guy is an idiot.
-Set...

874
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:25,980
-Huh? Set?
-What?

875
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,110
-Alright.
-Set.

876
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,210
Closer.

877
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:28,670
Yes.

878
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:29,780
That's good.

879
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,910
-That's too close.
-Ready?

880
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,520
Put it on.

881
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,920
Put it on.

882
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,600
It's super cold!

883
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,290
Cold!

884
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,690
Ready.... Start!

885
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,320
Yay! Yay! Gag!

886
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,950
Balloon! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yeah!

887
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,020
A job where you touch electricity.

888
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,550
Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle, shoulder Yakisoba.

889
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,550
Gachon!

890
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,330
They're not human anymore.

891
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:08,780
Take that!
Boom! Pow! Contact!

892
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,370
-Aiiin!
-Here it is.

893
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,940
-I only have one gag.
-He's out of gags.

894
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,030
-Super Aiiin!
-Nabeyaki Udon!!

895
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,490
He lost.

896
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:22,540
That's good.

897
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,530
He named a hot food.

898
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,530
Was anyone excited about me shouting "Nabeyaki Udon"?

899
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,110
I just thought he lost...

900
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,440
-I don't have any gags, this is hell for me.
-Anything is a gag.

901
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,350
You can take someone else's gags.
They were doing it after the second one.

902
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,180
You can't think of gags with ice on your nipple.

903
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,680
You'll shout the hot food again?

904
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,660
Alright then, let's change it to the name of the place of your first kiss.

905
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,340
So I have to yell the name of the place where I had my first kiss?

906
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,270
Yes, you scream it.

907
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,830
-If you're at your limit you scream the name of the place.

908
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,200
Where was I?

909
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,100
Ready... Start!

910
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,050
Okay.

911
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,680
Whoa.

912
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,750
Crack! Swirl! Swirl! Crack! Peanut!

913
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,410
-His face is convulsing a lot.
-He must be pretty stressed.

914
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,260
I-I... can no longer be in this unit.

915
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,120
That was the lawyer Yokoyama. (EN: 13)

916
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,960
Who's gag is that?

917
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,990
It's not a gag.

918
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,330
Motivation switch: on! Boom! Psssh! Calpis!
(Jp Drink)

919
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,680
Good.

920
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,660
What? I told you I'm in the wrong.

921
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,820
-Who?
-Who's that?

922
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,790
It's Kenshiro Matsunami, when he threw the water. (EN: 14)

923
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,390
-That's not a gag!
-I don't have any gags.

924
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,030
A gag! Pop! Bang! Nipples!

925
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,410
This is like a children's show.

926
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,660
OhaSuta.
(Variety Show for Children)

927
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,610
Children would love this game.

928
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,520
What happens now?

929
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,300
Safe!

930
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,070
-Safe?
-Safe?

931
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,220
Such loose rules.

932
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,560
-Is that really safe?
-He really hasn't set any rules.
-Next up is Kubota.

933
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:50,780
-Come on!
-What should I do?

934
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,600
Gag... Gag...

935
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,500
Come on! You can do it!

936
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,510
I'm sorry, please let me go now.

937
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,580
What's that?

938
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:03,350
Well in my village those who didn't work would have to pay with their eye.
That's the gag.

939
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,020
-Good!
-That's scary.

940
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,890
-That's so scary.
-It's not a gag.

941
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,130
Crack! Pop! I drank elbow water! Delicious!

942
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,180
Shut up! Take this you idiot!

943
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,140
-Whoa, what happened?!
-What? What? What?

944
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,560
I messed up and it came out the other way.

945
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,310
I messed up.

946
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,800
-Huh? What?
-It came out the other way.

947
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,260
I messed up and it came to me.

948
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,600
-That's the worst.
-Awesome.

949
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,270
Must've hurt...

950
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,550
He's failing at everything.

951
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,680
Kubota is really messing everything up.

952
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,190
So that means he lost?

953
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:32,920
He won?

954
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,180
He didn't say the place of his first kiss so he lost.

955
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,310
The first place?

956
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,820
The place of his first kiss.

957
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,930
I mean I can say it.

958
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,120
Even if you do, you still lose.

959
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:42,980
Is it too late?

960
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,290
I mean, you can try saying it.

961
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,250
The changing room at Uniqlo!

962
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,570
The changing room at Uniqlo!

963
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,560
Such bad manners.

964
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Your first kiss?

965
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,240
-What?!
-Good for you!

966
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,520
That's weird.

967
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,900
What about you, Goto?

968
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,430
-I...
-Say it out loud.

969
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,530
Out loud!

970
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,070
Next to Suma's aquarium!

971
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,170
-Next to?
-Next to?

972
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,700
-Outside?
-At the beach.

973
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,410
Oh, so while looking at the sea.

974
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,390
Junior, what about you?

975
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,050
Aggression!

976
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,890
Next to Morinomiya station!

977
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,900
-Next to? It's the "next to" series.
-See! Outside!

978
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,680
-But there's tons of cars passing by.
-Next to...

979
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,520
There's tons of cars there.

980
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,530
Momoi, what about you?

981
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,440
Bar's toilet!

982
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,770
That's so gaudy. I see...

983
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,020
They must have taken her there.

984
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,190
-A bar's toilet...
-That's pretty rare...

985
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,580
Did he say anything after the kiss?

986
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,100
I don't remember what I said but outside...

987
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,020
He yelled, "Masayo we're going home!".

988
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,250
That's my real name.

989
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,070
Oh, your real name.

990
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,750
What kind of work did he do?

991
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,850
I think he started working straight after high school.

992
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,990
-That's pretty normal.
-Was he like a construction guy?

993
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,840
-What's with that way of asking?
-He may have done some of that work.

994
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,730
I mean, everyone does some kind of work.

995
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,320
-Shall we move on to the next game?
-Huh?

996
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,670
-Are we doing another one?!
-What?

997
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,260
Is there more?

998
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,930
-We still have time.
-There's 2 more left.

999
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,630
Then explain the rules first.

1000
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,520
These seem to be very different.

1001
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,110
Oh, the "I want to smell my dad's fart" game?

1002
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,750
Well...

1003
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,140
The player will make this pose.

1004
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,760
Right.

1005
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,130
And we will put a whoopee cushion here.

1006
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,430
Then the other person will grab an ab roller.

1007
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,240
This.

1008
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,300
And because you want to smell your dad's fart...

1009
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,210
You go like this.

1010
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,970
And try to activate the whoopee cushion.

1011
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,680
And you have to yell your father's name if it makes a sound.
In my case I would yell Katsuo.

1012
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,670
"Katsuo, thank you!"
Like that.

1013
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:50,800
And the person on the floor also has to yell something out.
That's the game.

1014
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,130
-That's so complicated.
-What was that?

1015
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,500
-I didn't get any of that.
-I'm clueless.

1016
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,370
-Let's drop it.
-I don't get it.

1017
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,000
Look at Abareru's face.

1018
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,320
Of course you would make that face.

1019
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,260
The player wants to smell the fart!

1020
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,320
-Right, right, I get that.
-You're father's fart, right?

1021
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,900
So you go like this, right?

1022
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,380
Your dad is opening up his legs and you go in to press the whoopee cushion.

1023
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,870
Then you're happy, so you yell your father's name.
"Katsuo, thank you!"

1024
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:20,370
Then your dad has to scream something back to you.
That's the game.

1025
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,590
-That's so random.
-But what do you shout?

1026
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,140
Is there a winner in this?

1027
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,110
No, it's just that kind of game.

1028
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,820
-We can decide what to shout.
-It's like I'm in a dream.

1029
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,240
This is too much work.

1030
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,480
But we can shout the same things as the last game.

1031
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,300
This guy is pissing me off.

1032
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,640
It can be anything.

1033
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,450
Out!

1034
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,250
I think!

1035
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,130
I think there is!

1036
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,790
Kimura is here.

1037
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,080
They must have added random sounds here.

1038
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,860
That's right, there were different sounds before.

1039
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,820
They completely ignored Ikezaki's game.

1040
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,950
Cha!

1041
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,720
Nishio! It's Sumiko!

1042
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,910
-It's Nishio and Sumiko.
-It's Kiyoshi Nishikawa.

1043
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,500
-These are not gags.
-It's Kiyoshi Nishikawa.
-These aren't gags.

1044
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,140
Matsumoto sure makes weird stuff.

1045
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,340
It wasn't me though...

1046
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,770
1 and a half hours...

1047
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,140
-I actually made a movie. Would you like to watch it?
-Sure let's see it.

1048
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,250
It's like a game...

1049
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:18,720
I wanna see.

1050
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,670
-A game?
-It's like...

1051
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,400
-Making a game is pretty hard.
-That's amazing.

1052
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,310
-I tried making something.

1053
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,590
Is it a game?

1054
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
It's more of a playful video.
-A playful video?

1055
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,470
I see.

1056
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,150
So it's not a video game per se, right?

1057
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,350
I just want you to feel like you're playing the game.

1058
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,730
-CR?
-It's like in Pachinko.

1059
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,190
-You love Pachinko, don't you.
-I do.

1060
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,110
-So it's always been my dream...
-That's too close.

1061
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,790
Too close.

1062
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:47,920
-Here we go. It's starting.
-CR Oniyakko Tsubaki.
-Here we go.

1063
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,900
It's a spinning one.

1064
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,420
That hand-made style is so cute.

1065
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,150
It's like a flip book.

1066
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,250
Please hit it big.

1067
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,930
-Big fail.
-Huh?

1068
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,580
-There's a line.
-Don't cry, aren't you a man?

1069
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,390
"Ki Ki Ki Ki Ki Ki"

1070
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,000
Oh, it has great performances.

1071
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,240
"I'm coming! The enemy is at Charles de Gaulle Airport!"

1072
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,670
"You can only talk after you have defeated this Furoshiki wrapped Tsubaki."

1073
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,910
-Oh, it's a reach?
-Maybe...

1074
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,180
It's a fake out!

1075
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,170
Alright!

1076
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,820
I'm coming! The enemy is at Charles de Gaulle Airport!
-It's hot, so hot!

1077
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,690
-"Three time you have given me the box of cakes. My heart is dancing. I shall grant you the final secret techniques."
-"It's been a while since I last had a Chicken skewer!"
-The performance is amazing!

1078
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,810
Once more!

1079
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:42,350
-"I'm coming! The enemy is at Charles de Gaulle Airport!"
-Here it comes!

1080
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:47,690
-"Three time you have given me the box of cakes. My heart is dancing. I shall grant you the final secret techniques."
-"It's been a while since I last had a Chicken skewer!"

1081
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:47,730
"It's so delicious today as well! So hot!"
-"Three time you have given me the box of cakes. My heart is dancing. I shall grant you the final secret techniques."
-"It's been a while since I last had a Chicken skewer!"

1082
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,720
"It's so delicious today as well! So hot!"

1083
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,230
-She just said, "so hot".
-Is it hot?

1084
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,070
Ah! A freeze!
-Here it comes!

1085
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:59,340
-"The recording of this 26th episode was made in April, on a totally normal day."
-Is it here?
-Ah, she's saying it!

1086
00:42:59,340 --> 00:42:59,850
We're hitting the jackpot.

1087
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:01,760
-Here it comes.
-This is it.

1088
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,020
-It's her husband.
-Amazing sequences. Huh?

1089
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,200
-This was filmed on the fly.

1090
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,100
Clinking?

1091
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,150
Candid filming is so cool.

1092
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,720
It is.

1093
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,030
That's true.

1094
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:10,750
He's dropping them in.

1095
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,770
-Everything is related.
-So we'll hit the jackpot if this hits?

1096
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,210
I wonder...
After all, this was all made on the spot.

1097
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,370
His face...

1098
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,140
This sequence is kinda scary.

1099
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,860
So long!

1100
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,510
-There's a lot of time with nothing.
-Right?
-Amazing.

1101
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,400
Wasn't this the "hot" section?

1102
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,840
He did say that before.

1103
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,350
Listening to this for a long time might hurt.

1104
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,880
-It's so long.
-So long.

1105
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,420
-Oh, here it comes.
-He it comes.

1106
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,410
No way.

1107
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,380
-Huh?
-What happened?

1108
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:43,910
Something happened.

1109
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,090
Huh? He was filming from above?
-What's that?

1110
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,350
So we got it?

1111
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:48,320
He's laughing really hard.

1112
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,430
He's gonna show us!

1113
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,270
Here it comes!

1114
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,270
Show us!

1115
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,700
Here it is! Here it is!

1116
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,000
They're making us wait.

1117
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,640
Dai is laughing already.

1118
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,750
Show us! Show us! Show us!

1119
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,870
-Show us!
-This is so long.

1120
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,730
We already saw this.

1121
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,530
They're teasing us too much.

1122
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,150
-All matching!
-All matching!

1123
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,090
It's a big win!

1124
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,980
"Big win! Congratulations!"

1125
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,480
"You did it!"

1126
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,460
"I knew it!"

1127
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,530
"Let's keep going!"

1128
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,320
"Brother, I know you could do it."

1129
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,120
It's changing! It's changing!

1130
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:31,050
-It was so long!
"-Congratulations!"

1131
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,910
"Demon Rush!"

1132
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,350
"Enter!"

1133
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,880
"Aim for the right."

1134
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,620
What's this?

1135
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:47,720
It's a big win

1136
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,870
-Are you singing this yourself?
-That right.

1137
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,470
This is a home run.

1138
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,430
Oh, we got it.

1139
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,820
This is a different one.

1140
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,210
It's so intricate.

1141
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,580
Aho Mild Kuni.

1142
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,990
"Takai 5 Carats."

1143
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,180
Don't write the lyrics with three people.

1144
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:07,820
He's riding a unicorn.

1145
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,300
Unicorn.

1146
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,310
Kouhei Doshima?

1147
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,530
-That's right.
-That's amazing!

1148
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,710
Tons of people were involved in this.

1149
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:19,840
-This is the real deal, isn't it?
-That's right.

1150
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,120
I see...

1151
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:23,960
So cute.

1152
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,680
It's so cute.

1153
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,150
-What round is this?
-It's kinda nice.

1154
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,680
This looks like it'll become popular.

1155
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,990
It's so long.

1156
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,270
What's this?

1157
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,790
Mukai from Tenshin as well?

1158
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,530
-Mukai as well?
-He helped with the story.

1159
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,300
Ehm...

1160
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,010
With the composition?

1161
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,090
-It comes up in the story.
-Oh, there's a story?

1162
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,780
This is for another Anime.

1163
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,830
-What are we looking at?
Right, I have no idea.

1164
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,570
-Pachinko?
-It's only about 13.

1165
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,190
Oh, it's two people now.

1166
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:55,980
Oh, are you singing this as well?

1167
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,550
-Yes, yes.
-Yes, I'm singing here.

1168
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,630
I told you.

1169
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,460
Pay attention.

1170
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:07,020
[To be continued.]

1171
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,430
-Huh?
[To be continued.]

1172
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,140
To be continued?!

1173
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,210
Are there pending episodes?

1174
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:12,810
-It was so random.
-What's that round thing?

1175
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,040
-So random.
-Isn't the round thing the jackpot?

1176
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,090
I didn't really get it but that was long.

1177
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,940
You're right, it was long.

1178
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,860
I mean, they tend to be long lately.

1179
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,240
The one with the husband was super long.

1180
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,290
Huh?

1181
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,120
-Huh?
-It stopped.
-Hold on.

1182
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,210
Is there more?

1183
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,760
-Huh?
-Is there more?

1184
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:29,860
That's all.

1185
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:30,740
-No way.
Huh?

1186
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,390
You laughed at your own joke!

1187
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,890
Oh my god.

1188
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:41,040
You've gotta be kidding!

1189
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,060
I held it in!

1190
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,020
That was close!!

1191
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,660
-I was so close!
-That was scary!

1192
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,310
So close!!

1193
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,410
I was so shocked.

1194
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:50,840
What was that just now?

1195
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,080
-What was it?
-What was that?

1196
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,160
-So scary!
-Why did you laugh?

1197
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:56,540
I pulled through.

1198
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,110
You looked so happy.

1199
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,830
-Everyone was making such a big fuss...
-Of course.

1200
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:03,950
Of course we would, it was so long!

1201
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:07,980
I already knew there was nothing else once the ending song kicked in.

1202
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,610
What?!

1203
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,070
I mean, let's look at the replay.

1204
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,070
I'm sorry, I can't...

1205
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,260
Why would you play the ending?

1206
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,720
Huh? Hold on.

1207
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,530
Huh? What?

1208
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,090
Is that it?

1209
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,290
-That was it.
-No way.

1210
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:24,740
She just laughed.

1211
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,030
You laughed at your own joke!

1212
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:31,630
It's fine, it's just her first time.

1213
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,800
-Yellow for you.
-I'm sorry.

1214
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,170
Alright everyone, it's about time.

1215
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,250
-Are we getting the 20 million?
-Whoa, it's pretty tight this time around!

1216
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,460
Ehm... 20 million!

1217
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,580
Alright!!

1218
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,040
Just one hour left!

1219
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,790
Let's go!

1220
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,330
-It's such a close battle.
-I've got to go to the bathroom.

1221
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,080
Me too.

1222
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,840
This is a great battle.

1223
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,700
It's gonna be crazy.

1224
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,720
Alright, let's go.

1225
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,580
-Excuse me!
-Huh? What's wrong?

1226
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,100
I actually prepared some footage myself.

1227
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,860
I made a game.

1228
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,080
-Which one?
-Could we watch it all together?

1229
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,130
-Which is it?
-It's a game.

1230
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,120
-Footage?
-Alright, please take a seat.

1231
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,670
Where are we watching it?

1232
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,820
-Se... Soshina over here.
-Se?

1233
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:26,080
I just messed it up a bit!

1234
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:29,030
One time is fine!

1235
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,130
Don't get all riled up!

1236
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,400
You wouldn't want me to call you Ishio, would you?

1237
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,750
You can call me Iwao. (EN: 15)

1238
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,660
Why would you call me Ishio?

1239
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,870
Why would you take that Kanji?

1240
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,510
It would be, Iwao, not Ishio.

1241
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,630
I would be shocked if you called me Iwao.

1242
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,120
-So stop it.
-Are you guys alright? You shouldn't fight like this.

1243
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,520
Huh? Oh, sorry about that.

1244
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:54,990
Shall we play the game?

1245
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:58,380
-Sure.
-Let's keep it light and friendly.

1246
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,480
Why did you choose that name, Soshina? (EN: 16)

1247
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:01,810
Me?

1248
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,050
How did you come up with it?

1249
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,160
You should turn it off.

1250
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:07,410
-This is bad.
-Oh no.

1251
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:09,020
Are you leaving?

1252
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,090
We just saw everything...

1253
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:15,240
-Ehm...
What's up with Goto?

1254
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:22,000
I wanted to start comedy as a humble man, so it was my way of saying, "I'm just a normal man, but please take care of me".

1255
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,800
That's why I chose Soshina.

1256
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,190
Were there any other names?

1257
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,720
Gagagigo or something like that.

1258
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,130
Whoa, that's crazy.

1259
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,250
What does that mean?

1260
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,300
It's...

1261
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,430
-It's a monster's name. It's a character from my generation.

1262
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:37,790
Or also Soccer.

1263
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,810
-Soccer?
-Soccer...

1264
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,260
-That's amazing.
-Your favorite sport?

1265
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,930
-Aikata Soccer.
-That's amazing. (EN: 17)

1266
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,820
-Aikata Soccer...
-Where are you going?
-Hold on.

1267
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,340
-So you might have named it Seiya and Soccer?
-That's right.

1268
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,120
-From your name Myoujou Shimofuri?
That's right.

1269
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,780
-So you didn't know Seiya yet?
-Soccer would have been amazing.

1270
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,310
He was already Soshina when I met him in high school.

1271
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,810
-You met him back then?

1272
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:03,010
Soccer would have been amazing.

1273
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,370
Were there any other names?
Is that all?

1274
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,640
-Not right now...
-What's wrong? What's wrong?

1275
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,340
Not now.

1276
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,300
Huh? Is that a third person?

1277
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,240
Mitsudomoe? (EN: 18)

1278
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,270
That's good.

1279
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,700
Let's do a little bit of gaming.

1280
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,520
-No one can beat that high score.
-This guy looks pretty strong.

1281
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,750
-Round one.
-900 million?

1282
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,240
-Fight.
-The high score is 900 million.

1283
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,630
-Is it Abareru vs Bozu?
-Abareru vs Bozu.

1284
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:33,260
Bozu...

1285
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,050
-Bozu?
-Bozu?

1286
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,710
-He's pretty strong.
-You can do it.

1287
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,410
-His kicks are pretty effective.

1288
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,650
-That's amazing.
-Oh, a low kick.

1289
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,490
The low kick keeps coming.

1290
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:44,860
Headbutt!

1291
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:46,160
Oh, he's been caught.

1292
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,960
He's getting beat.

1293
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,050
He's caught.

1294
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,680
Where are they fighting?

1295
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,720
He's gonna lose, he's about to lose.

1296
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,150
Abareru!

1297
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,020
-Oh no, oh no.
-That's bad.

1298
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:04,780
-Oh no.
-It's over.

1299
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,870
He lost.

1300
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:06,760
He lost properly.

1301
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,170
You lose.

1302
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,490
-Oh, Bozu won.
-So strong!

1303
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:10,700
-Round 2.
So strong!

1304
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,930
-Fight.
-Hold on, let's see what happens.

1305
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,320
It's bad.

1306
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,540
He's doing some damage.

1307
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:20,190
He can do it.

1308
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,650
Oh, make sure he doesn't grab your head.

1309
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,370
-Oh, he's learned his lesson.
-Go, go, go!

1310
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:26,040
Good, good, you can do it.

1311
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:28,300
What is that?

1312
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,570
Huh? I can't see it.

1313
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,280
What's that?

1314
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,230
He inhaled it.

1315
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:32,370
A smell?

1316
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:33,350
He's brought out a smell.

1317
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,640
-He's losing HP!
-Hold on!

1318
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,310
He's losing HP.

1319
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,280
-What's that?
-What is he smelling?

1320
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,640
Oh no, oh no, oh no...

1321
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,840
That's a crazy color.

1322
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:52,900
So weak.

1323
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,900
-"You lose!."
-Bozu must be really strong.

1324
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,420
Oh, continue.
-Continue.

1325
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,780
It's the uninhabited island photo.

1326
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:02,080
-What should I do?
-We need some coins.

1327
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:03,840
We need some coins.

1328
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,500
It's from that time he got bit by a mosquito.

1329
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:11,030
-When the mosquito bit him.
-We lost because there's no coins.

1330
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:14,270
Oh, it's impossible without coins.

1331
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:14,970
Coins...

1332
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:18,490
-I didn't bring any with me.
-That last face is that one, isn't it?
-Do we need coins?

1333
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,100
-Huh? Is that it?
-Is that it?

1334
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,650
Fight!

1335
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:24,540
Huh?

1336
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,110
Here it is.

1337
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,140
-Again?
-You can still play?

1338
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,330
Here we go again.

1339
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,800
Oh, he's pretty strong.

1340
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,190
But Abareru is way bigger...

1341
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,710
-Low kick?
-Is this another reach?

1342
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,090
You should do more low kicks.

1343
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,370
You shouldn't get caught again.

1344
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:40,880
Again... Run away.

1345
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,120
This is bad.

1346
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,500
He's got you again.

1347
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,230
Can't he somehow get out of this?

1348
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:49,760
How many times is this gonna play?

1349
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,500
Whoa, he got screwed again.

1350
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,510
You have to strike back or you're done for.

1351
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,240
See, he's destroying you.

1352
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:58,340
This is such a boring game if you can lose like this.

1353
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,650
Losing like this is so unpleasant.

1354
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,450
Abareru, you lose instantly.

1355
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:06,060
-I lose if I get caught.
-Can't you get away from it?

1356
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,830
If you get caught and they spam 'Y' it's over.

1357
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,340
It's a new game.

1358
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,430
But there are only 2 characters.

1359
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:15,430
I mean, try not to get caught.

1360
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,190
Is he gonna make you smell that thing again?

1361
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:20,660
You can do it! You can do it!

1362
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,220
-Go!
-Go!

1363
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,830
-What if you step back?
-Step back.

1364
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,220
-Push it away.
-He's smelling it.
-This is the same thing.

1365
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,420
-Push it away.
-We just saw this. We saw this already.

1366
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,070
We saw it already.

1367
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:38,050
Is there something else?

1368
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,180
Maybe after this?

1369
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,590
Is there something after this?

1370
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,850
-I'll try running away.
-Run, run.

1371
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:43,880
No way.

1372
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,270
-Damn it!
-Run away!

1373
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,290
Why did you show it twice?

1374
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,880
Is there something else?

1375
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,660
He just showed it to us twice.

1376
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,690
Coins, coins.

1377
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,040
-Coins!
-Someone, coins!

1378
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,440
-Someone, coins!
-Coins! Coins! Coins!

1379
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:01,450
We don't have any!!
-Someone, coins!
-Coins! Coins! Coins!

1380
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,550
We don't have any!!

1381
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,330
No coins.

1382
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,050
We don't have coins.

1383
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,100
-The opponent's level was too high for me.
The computer?

1384
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,670
-It was the same match twice.
-Who were you playing against?

1385
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,950
-It was online.
-Online?
-Yeah.

1386
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,850
Were you fighting against someone?

1387
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,150
I mean, it was the same fight twice!

1388
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,810
It was online, so...

1389
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,700
-It was someone overseas.
-Where?

1390
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,270
The U.S.

1391
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:22,580
Such a simple answer...

1392
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:29,490
-Oniyakko, may I do a bit of an exam on you.
-He doesn't play the Boke much in those situations.

1393
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,420
-An exam?
-An exam?

1394
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:30,770
Yes.

1395
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:31,480
Me?

1396
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:35,930
Is that like a metal detector?

1397
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,180
Oh no...

1398
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:40,920
You have metal there.

1399
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:41,770
She doesn't have any.

1400
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,510
-But it just made a sound.
-What? What?

1401
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:45,950
It makes a sound when there is no metal.

1402
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,440
-So there's no metal?
-No metal!

1403
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,250
No abnormalities!

1404
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,070
Abnormalities found!

1405
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:49,970
-Huh?
-Huh?

1406
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:50,760
What do you mean?

1407
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,610
There was something in the crotch area.

1408
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,780
You have something in your crotch, don't you?

1409
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,020
What does she have?

1410
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:58,870
What is in there?

1411
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,060
-Huh?
-It's a crotch diary. (EN: 19)

1412
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:00,710
Huh?

1413
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,120
-A crotch diary.
-No way.

1414
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,700
-Do you know what she's talking about?

1415
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:05,640
I do have it.

1416
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:06,640
Huh?

1417
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,310
How about you try it with Kubota?

1418
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:15,840
He's also got something.

1419
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:16,990
-You do?
-All done.

1420
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:18,000
-He has?
-What do you have?

1421
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,540
In your crotch...

1422
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:21,980
You have a crotch shark. (EN: 20)

1423
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,470
Like a sharksucker?

1424
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,870
I don't have such things.

1425
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,030
Try it with Junior.

1426
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:31,940
How about Junior?

1427
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,170
I don't think there's anything there.

1428
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,030
The sound is different.

1429
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:40,840
What does that mean?

1430
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,010
What's it mean?

1431
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,830
It's so long.

1432
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:53,170
For real.

1433
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,420
So long.

1434
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,480
What does it mean?

1435
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,400
-Huh? Which is it?
-What is it?

1436
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,440
Does it mean there's something there?

1437
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,600
-What's in there?
-Something's in there.

1438
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:04,470
Here...

1439
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,690
We have a My Number Card. (ENL 21)

1440
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:08,890
Why?

1441
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,370
It went off by itself.

1442
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:11,950
She's examining her own body.

1443
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:13,960
Exam?

1444
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,130
How about you do it on yourself?

1445
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:15,620
Sure.

1446
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:32,460
Huh?

1447
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,360
She laughed...

1448
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,550
So scary! So scary! I'm scared!

1449
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,050
I'm sorry.

1450
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,420
What happened?

1451
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:43,440
Alright!

1452
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,340
-Kuwata...
-Was that my lucky strike?! (EN: 22)

1453
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,470
Why?
-Was it Kuwata?

1454
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:48,190
It was Kuwata's face.

1455
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,960
Kuwata's face? It's her counter!!

1456
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,340
-But why?
-She was laughing so hard.

1457
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,310
It was uncontrollable laughter.

1458
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:57,450
It looked like he was holding back a laugh.

1459
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,050
It looked like he was doing a Kuwata impersonation and that made me crack up.

1460
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,030
You thought he was setting you up.

1461
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,390
How about you do it on yourself?

1462
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,140
-He's really holding back.
-It's true.

1463
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,080
Are you holding it in here?

1464
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:12,350
-He's doing it a little bit.
-It's really Masumi Kuwata.

1465
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,460
He's really doing it.

1466
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,660
That's just Abareru's face.

1467
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,580
She laughed so hard.

1468
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,510
That's my normal face!

1469
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:24,590
You laughed at my resting face.

1470
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:25,760
It's just his normal face.

1471
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,650
-Right?
-It's just a normal face!

1472
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,400
He looks like he's holding back a laugh.

1473
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,510
I was holding back a laugh.

1474
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,630
-This point goes to Abareru.
-Alright!!

1475
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,140
I'm her counter!

1476
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,460
-Yellow.
-That's right.

1477
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,890
Let's go!!

1478
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:45,780
But this is amazing in itself.
No one has dropped out yet.

1479
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:46,990
Alright!!!

1480
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:47,900
That's amazing.

1481
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:48,970
We'll go for the 20 million.

1482
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,020
It's the power of the 20 million.

1483
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,110
Lick, lick, punch!
Lick, lick, punch!

1484
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,000
Lick, lick, punch!

1485
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,960
Are you talking about Krillin?!
