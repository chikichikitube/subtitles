6
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:06,760
And now, here's a clip from last week's episode, "Let's Play With Nostalgic Arcade Games"

7
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,990
They played old arcade games from when they were young

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,650
And today, we present to you some rare footage from it we couldn't add to the full episode

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,230
You're good at this, Tanaka?

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,230
Yep, I played it so much

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,810
Oh, this one

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,880
I never did this before

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,880
You didn't?

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:49,670
Jump Up - strike the button with your hand - you win if the weight stops right at the assigned colored square

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,570
They chose a game Tanaka claims to be good at: Jump Up

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,680
Strike the button with your hand; if the weight stops on the assigned color square, you win

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,080
You go Tanaka

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,990
Should I go first?

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,990
Yeah, so we can see how it's done

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,600
I guess the hard part is to balance

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,200
Yes, 'cause it can stop anywhere

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,200
I see

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,850
You got the highest one

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,910
The highest one is the easiest

25
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,910
Right

26
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,950
You don't need to regulate your power

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,950
You just go full strength

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,950
Really?

29
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,840
Can't it go above it?

30
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,840
No, it can't

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,250
To get the highest one, you just have to deal a strong blow

32
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,720
Are you kidding me?

33
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,400
Right, it's the top

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,400
It just has to go up

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,380
Alright, I'm going to put all my strength in this

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,800
Didn't go well, dude

37
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,180
It went too high

38
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,180
See? It went over

39
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,950
Oh shit, is that what happens when you get the highest?

40
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,010
What's that tone of voice?

41
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,660
They're all your seniors here

42
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,370
I was talking to Endo!

43
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,020
But if he got that high, I think anyone can make it

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,020
That's right

45
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,510
I didn't remember this

46
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,050
I wanna try again

47
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:48,680
Tanaka failed because he didn't remember well, but Hosei and Endo too didn't make it

48
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,780
And then...

49
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,980
The central one looks good enough

50
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,150
I wanna strike a bit harder

51
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,150
Please do

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,550
So half-assed...

53
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,450
He's an half-assed scaredy cat

54
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,880
I thought that would be stronger

55
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,880
He's so afraid

56
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,030
You got the lowest one

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,030
It's the lowest

58
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,920
You should try to do it like Hamada did just now

59
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,920
That's right

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,660
What the hell?!

61
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,280
It was my first time touching it!

62
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,280
It's the same for us

63
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,640
They wanted to complete it and did a second round... but it didn't go well at all

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,050
That was such a weak-ass strike

65
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,320
So close!

66
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,600
That was probably the closest one

67
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,880
You got that again

68
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,880
Lowest one again

69
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, nice

70
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,760
Go!

71
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,960
Unbelievable

72
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,780
That was really something

73
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,410
Just go for it, we gotta show what we got

74
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,790
Practice first

75
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,790
It's close to what you did before

76
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,340
Stronger, stronger, practice

77
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,550
More! Harder!

78
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,550
I think that's it

79
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,680
You're snapping so much since you got your point

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,490
I'm not angry, idiot

81
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,820
Find your rhythm

82
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,320
And "wham"!

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,330
Hopeless

84
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,750
(staff) OK, thank you for today!

85
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,450
Even if their recording session is over, they can't get away from the games

86
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,930
What's that move?

87
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,930
How does this work?

88
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,760
That's so strange

89
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,760
Uh? Hamada-san?

90
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,550
I witnessed something incredible

91
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,780
Matsumoto-san

92
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,650
Endo was playing pinball here

93
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,650
Quit it, dude

94
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,060
And Hamada was there, relaxing and watching him

95
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,620
And he leaned against this but it's not attached firmly to the ground, and he almost fell

96
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,620
Of course it's not!

97
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,350
I couldn't focus at all

98
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,350
Of course they didn't dig a hole in the studio

99
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,040
It's so stupid just to assume that

100
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,580
He's so dumb it's scary

101
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,260
I bet you didn't even remember how to do it

102
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,960
After enjoying the games, they decided to play with the spinning top some more

103
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,470
It's spinning!

104
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,610
See? I can still do it

105
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,610
That's incredible

106
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,120
[humming]

107
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,980
[humming last song from previous episode]

108
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,980
I think I can do this

109
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,950
How about Hamada Shogo's songs?

110
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,950
Those were great

111
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,980
I'm gonna spin it

112
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,040
Watch out!

113
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,810
Where did he throw that?

114
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,680
This guys is no fun at all, I swear

115
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,580
I wish he would change school

116
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,710
There was this rumor of him wanting to change school...

117
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,630
Are you kidding me?!

118
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,450
You can do it Tanaka, right?

119
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,450
Sure

120
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,520
Maybe getting older made me forget how to do it

121
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,240
Here I go

122
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,110
Watch out!!

123
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,120
These guys suck, man!

124
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,430
It's no fun at all playing with them

125
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,610
What the hell was that?

126
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,610
That was dangerous

127
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,980
I'm really sorry

128
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,980
What's wrong with Cocorico?
