1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,020
On Gaki no Tsukai,

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,530
Matsumoto's 54th Birthday

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,910
Some unexpected guests take part

4
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,460
And his partner Hamada will sing too

5
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,310
Excuse me

6
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,420
Oh welcome

7
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,810
Welcome

8
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,040
Happy Birthday!

9
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,980
Yamamura Momiji

10
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,280
Thank you very much Momiji-san

11
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,820
Momiji-san thank you very much

12
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,860
Beautiful today as always

13
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,110
It's Kitty-chan

14
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,200
It's Kitty-chan

15
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,820
I remembered,

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,330
Congratulations!

17
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,770
You came all the way here

18
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,550
I'm happy to be here

19
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,170
Matsumoto-san,

20
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,800
During meetngs for segments,

21
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,090
He brings you up Momiji-san quite often

22
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,240
"I want to include Momiji-san"

23
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,660
Oh really? That makes me so happy

24
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,880
Matsumoto-san is always on TV when I turn it on

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,710
And you said "You're so boring. Go get Momiji-san,

26
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,860
"Wearing a pink Kimono" It made me so happy

27
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,230
That my name came up on a show that I had nothing to do with

28
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,280
What do you like about Momiji-san?

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,130
I think Momiji-san has an exquisite balance, as an actress,

30
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,950
She can also do standup. She can switch into comedy with ease.

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,280
I see. Such high praises

32
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,190
I'm extremely happy

33
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,240
She lets me use her as a theme for Oogiri (improv)

34
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,510
Like "What is Momiji's body count"

35
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,910
Momiji-san you don't mind that?

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,770
Using me like that,

37
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,130
It makes me very happy

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,650
Oh really?

39
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,730
Even though it would not be strange for her to tell me to stop

40
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,730
Because you were born, because you're here,

41
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:23,680
I am also here now

42
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,480
If you weren't there, I,

43
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,320
I wouldn't be here

44
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,530
Is he your father?

45
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,970
The reason I'm on so many variety shows,

46
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,130
Matsumoto-san, it's thanks to you

47
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,120
She's talking now

48
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,460
An uninteresting actress like me,

49
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,600
Thank you for tsukomi-ing me, truly

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,440
Although, saying I have a body count of 70 is a bit too much

51
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:05,080
When I went to greet him back stage,

52
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,350
Even if he's taking a nap, he wakes up

53
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,150
You came right up to me,

54
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,730
And said "You didn't have to get anything!"

55
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,530
And you accepted my silly souvenir

56
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:24,310
That Matsumoto-san, I like him so much I don't know what to do

57
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:40,250
The sweet girl you talk about,

58
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:47,040
When I hear the happy stories

59
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,530
I realise, I realised

60
00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:00,940
I'm jealous of her

61
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,610
I want to become your daughter,

62
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,340
Matsumoto-san's daughter,

63
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,130
Happy Birthday!

64
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,150
She even wrote the song

65
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,510
This is the song, please accept it

66
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,310
She properly wrote everything

67
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,510
When I heard the first chorus, I thought she was singing about her dad

68
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,660
If it wasn't for Matsumoto-san, you wouldn't be here

69
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,450
You allowed me to be born, into the world of variety shows

70
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,970
That's what you mean, he is your parent in that sense

71
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,840
I think of him as a father in that way

72
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,330
You weren't on as many variety shows back then

73
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,840
When I did, I got nervous,

74
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,370
And one time I made a joke, and it fell silent,

75
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,530
And people didn't whether or not to tsukkomi to an actress,

76
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,530
TN: tsukkomi is similar to a retort

77
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,770
But after Matsumoto-san reacted to my joke, everyone realised "Oh it's ok to react to her"

78
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,730
And everyone did,

79
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,910
And for that I'm very grateful

80
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,080
In that sense he's your parent, he brought you to variety

81
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,770
Papa!

82
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,600
Though today you're Mama, Mama

83
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,570
You want to become his daughter right?

84
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:27,710
He has such a wonderful smile when he talks about his daughter,

85
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,710
"Must be nice" I thought

86
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,130
Maybe I shouldn't talk about her so much anymore

87
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,910
But I enjoy hearing about her. I love his radiant smile when he's talking about her

88
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,440
Did her feelings reach you?

89
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,150
They did, I mean,

90
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,950
She even wrote the notes

91
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,910
For the piano

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,420
So nice, you came all the way here for us

93
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,950
It's great for us too

94
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,750
We have you on Gaki sometimes, like at the new years right?

95
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,240
She does a lot

96
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,460
I was able to play Akemi-chan

97
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,730
Oh right, Akemi-chan

98
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,440
Oh! Good evening!

99
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,680
Kyoko-chan, you made it for us?

100
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,290
Kyoko Hamaguchi

101
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,160
Take the flowers, take the flowers

102
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,600
Matsumoto-san, happy birthday!

103
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,970
Thank you very much

104
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,400
Thank you for having me

105
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,130
I never imagined you'd be here

106
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,910
I'm always, I'm totally, a huge fan

107
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,330
Thank you, I'm always cheering for you

108
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,020
I'm very happy, congratulations

109
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,390
Your lipstick is wonderful, it's glossy over here

110
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,220
Yes, I'm not used to it

111
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,240
But speaking of, you've gotten better at makeup recently

112
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,420
Thank you very much

113
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,460
You're becoming more and more feminine

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But I'm very glad, thank you for inviting me to this celebration

115
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,640
Thank you for taking the time to come

116
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,710
I'm very nervous!

117
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,730
Oh really?
I'm glad you're here

118
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,220
Do you hang out outside of work?

119
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,550
No, not really

120
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,420
No, not in private

121
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,910
The first I saw,

122
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,820
Matsumoto 54th Birthday

123
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm happy

124
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,000
Do you hang out outside of work?

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,310
No, not really

126
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,150
No, not in private

127
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:57,680
The first time,

128
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,770
When we met in a dream,

129
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:10,860
I was still 10 years old,

130
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,840
You made me smile

131
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:24,460
20 years since then,

132
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,310
Meeting you for the first time, like I dreamed,

133
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,640
From happiness,

134
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:40,480
I was nervous,

135
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,590
My heart was beating

136
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:57,530
I like your hairstyle and your fashion too

137
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:03,500
Laughing loudly, laughing shyly,

138
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:12,540
I love all of your shy gestures

139
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,280
And in the future, forever,

140
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:27,090
Stay the way you are Matsumoto-san

141
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:33,370
And in the future, forever,

142
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:41,970
Forever, Forever,
I will love you forever

143
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,840
Brilliant

144
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,060
Amazing

145
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,660
Her range was great

146
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,620
She hit the high notes

147
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,280
You're good at singing

148
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,480
I was super nervous

149
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,460
Kyoko-san, Matsumoto has a nice body now don't you think?

150
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,880
What do you think about that?

151
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,600
There was someone I always train with in my gym

152
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,840
Matsumoto-san kept working on his chest,

153
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,440
We were like
"I wonder how much he can bench"

154
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,800
We had a conversation about that

155
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,400
I'm glad to hear you guys were talking about that

156
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,510
Yes

157
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,000
Thank you very much

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,280
It was nice and simple

159
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,080
Her feelings were directly conveyed

160
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,930
Yeah the people who aren't regulars on this show,

161
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,310
I'm glad to be surprised by them

162
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,280
That sort of thing makes you nervous normally

163
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,570
And it's natural to get nervous when singing

164
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes

165
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,150
With wrestling, moving around gets rid of the nervousness, but,

166
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,200
You can't really move around, holding the mic

167
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,800
But I'm glad I was able to do my best for this celebration

168
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,970
You hate shiny things

169
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:28,750
You love to say "Don't call me papa"

170
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,530
Matsumoto 54th Birthday Party

171
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,620
Lastly, his partner Hamada will sing

172
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:51,570
You hate shiny things

173
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:57,610
You love to say "Don't call me papa"

174
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:03,750
You hate small change (coins)

175
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:10,120
You love working out twice a week

176
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,990
You hate chilled water

177
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:22,600
You love comedy more than anything

178
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,340
We met at 6 years old

179
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:36,010
And now I realise you're 54

180
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:42,520
We met at 6 years old

181
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,890
And now I realise you're 54

182
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:55,680
Go get your physical check-up done

183
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,200
Go get your physical check-up done

184
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,710
Go get your physical check-up done

185
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:17,450
Together we are DownTown

186
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,950
It's hard to sing for your partner

187
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,400
You know everything he likes and dislikes

188
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,410
txt181

189
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,270
And he's at that age now, he should take care of himself

190
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,310
You guys have been together since age 6 after all

191
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,150
48 years!

192
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,420
Half a century in just 2 years

193
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,390
Longer than anyone

194
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,390
Yeah longer than anyone probably

195
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,430
He often tells me to get my physical done

196
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,330
What do you guys think? He should go right?

197
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,370
It makes me nervous

198
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,310
That's the reason?!

199
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,820
You'll be more anxious if you don't go

200
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,310
"A question for Matsumoto-san who knows everything about his partner"

201
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,350
"If you took all of Hamada's adult DVD's what would happen?"

202
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,240
TN (from wikipedia): Oogiri is a form of comedy that focuses on improvisation by providing a funny answer on the spot for a question or thematic topic

203
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,240
You know they should really stop with these Oogiri style questions

204
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,150
All of the questions are on the homepage

205
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,240
You really do love them

206
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,350
Not as much I used to I think

207
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,110
Of course

208
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,110
That's true for you too

209
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,880
Yeah that goes for me too

210
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,000
You would always leave a stack this high at the counter

211
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,550
Not that many, but 2-3

212
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,860
I would buy like 3-4 in the past. Not now though.

213
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,910
Right, not anymore

214
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,400
If I look back, I did throw away a lot of them

215
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,330
Before I threw them away, remember those CD cases?

216
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,260
They were like photo albums, with DVDs

217
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,620
Damn you took this seriously

218
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,040
I did

219
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,710
If I was thinking of throwing one away I would put it back in backwards

220
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,880
Like "under consideration"?

221
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,240
It could've been I was just in the wrong mood at the moment

222
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,620
This guy is an idiot!

223
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,660
Sometimes, you know you go back and look at them

224
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,280
And I would try out the ones I put in backwards

225
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,350
If it's bad then I throw it away,

226
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,680
Yes of course

227
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,620
But sometimes, I really hit the jackpot

228
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,710
A close call

229
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,710
A close call

230
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,200
I would go "THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL!" alone at night

231
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,680
I get that

232
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,550
While wanking, while wanking

233
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,330
I would say it while wanking

234
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,330
This guy is an idiot!

235
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,330
This guy is an idiot

236
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,040
If I gathered all of yours my arms would be shaking trying to hold them

237
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,550
That's not true

238
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,550
I think it is

239
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,200
But for you Hamada-san, you don't buy the commerical ones right?

240
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,350
Like I actually buy the ones at the store,

241
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,660
I also go to the store

242
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,660
There you go again. Enough of that.

243
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,640
Are there DVDs they don't sell at the store?

244
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,950
Your collection is like that right? It's all self-produced

245
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,480
It's true!

246
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,400
It's true though!

247
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,930
Is your head alright?

248
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,840
But it's true

249
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,840
What the hell do you mean self-produced?

250
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,530
You make them yourself right?

251
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,530
I don't do that

252
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,750
Really?

253
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,350
Then I guess I was mixed-up

254
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,800
What kind of mix up...

255
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,560
I heard that you did

256
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,680
What did you mix up

257
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,930
The question says take all of them, but I can't

258
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,260
Cause they're self-produced

259
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,880
Self-produced-

260
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,880
You come out with a new one every month

261
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,730
New ones

262
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,260
Hamada-san, your house has a huge screen right?

263
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,910
I don't I don't

264
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,400
I heard you have an A/V room

265
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,680
A/V and AV is confusing though

266
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,680
TN: A/V = Audio Video
AV = Adult Video

267
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,930
Like a real A/V

268
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,150
I don't have anything like that

269
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,910
It's a normal TV

270
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:19,950
That's what I've heard

271
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,150
Someone just made that up and told you

272
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,400
Then how many do you have in your collection?

273
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,510
How many?

274
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,060
Honestly I think you have 200,000

275
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,820
It's not exactly 200,000...

276
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,150
Then how many?

277
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,930
I don't really know...

278
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,260
No no no there's some I'll throw away, I'll throw them away

279
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,750
Then hurry up and get rid of them. Where do you get rid of them?

280
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,060
Anywhere

281
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,570
Stop speaking like a corpse

282
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,220
Does your wife know about this?

283
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,710
I'm pretty sure she does

284
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,110
Oh, that's like a grey area?

285
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,730
If she sees them, she's not gonna go "What the hell"?

286
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,420
She's not going to look at them. They're in my room.

287
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,910
We don't look at them together like
"Wow this one looks great!"

288
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,020
That's weird

289
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,370
That's weird

290
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,370
One time I,

291
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,660
I got a phone call during work from my wife,

292
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,200
"Sorry" - My wife is that type, she goes "Sorry",

293
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,220
"The player in the living room was broken, and there was a DVD I wanted to watch"

294
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,600
She decided to use the player in my room,

295
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,020
And on the tray the comes out, there was an erotic one there and she saw it

296
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,060
And these days they print the picture on the DVD

297
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,420
Yeah like the pictures

298
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,040
Like the pictures

299
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,060
So I got a call during work

300
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,040
Those scenarios are tricky

301
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,680
Should I get mad,

302
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,550
Or should I be like "Oh that's fine"

303
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,840
What did you do?

304
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,000
Nothing more or less than that

305
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,000
You're not gonna say "Don't use mine without asking!" of course

306
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,310
I never thought it would pop out

307
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,570
It is a tricky situation

308
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,570
That's all it was

309
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,640
Should we leave?

310
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,640
Let's leave

311
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,860
I'm, kind of sorry

312
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,480
Was that...alright for the ending?

313
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,730
We didn't really say anything bad

314
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,660
That's just how wholesome I am now

315
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,970
I don't even go to brothels

316
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,910
TN: Lotion also means Lube

317
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,910
You used to talk about lotion a lot

318
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,750
Lotion? What about lotion?

319
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,660
Moisturizer?

320
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,420
You used to talk a lot about how you use lube on yourself and stuff.
You don't use it anymore?

321
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,330
Ah, I do use lube

322
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,700
You use it?!

323
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,020
So you do use it

324
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,440
I do

325
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,170
I would put it in my bag when traveling

326
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,730
In the past right?

327
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,730
In the past

328
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,400
I put the whole bottle once in my second bag,

329
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,040
And after work when I got back to the hotel to do the business,

330
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,570
It spilled everywhere inside

331
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,820
My second bag was all slimy

332
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,060
What did you do? I guess throw it out

333
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,000
I stuck my hand inside and got some

334
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,000
You still used it?!

335
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,820
For a moment I thought about sticking it in the bag...

336
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,910
Shut up idiot. Let's go

337
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:54,670
Together, we are DownTown
