1
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,450
I've always wanted to do this someday.

2
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,130
Finally, we decided to do this.
This is great.

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,600
"Just when we thought we've reached the end, there was more."

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:49,780
I want all the previous winners to appear and decide the true champion, the King of Kings.

5
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,920
"The King of Kings of Documental"

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,580
The 100 million tsukkomi.

7
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,450
The movement has stopped.

8
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,190
The chill revolution ended long ago.

9
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,090
Nationalism in this country is about using meta jokes and basic jokes to ridicule each other.

10
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,360
What you need is not an ism, but a rhythm.

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,630
Notice the distorted cognition.

12
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,900
More than enough is too much.

13
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,600
Keep the beat witty.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,400
A trackmaker who does both ordinary jokes and dirty jokes is even better than the melody of the flatterer.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,240
The big fight @ the underground arena deeper than the culvert.

16
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,740
A dark gambling worth letting your earned money turn to dust.

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,610
Rogues aim for the head of the KING of COMEDY, where chaos is planned.

18
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,480
Xiaoli doesn't work either.

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,350
Four trillion subliminal returns.

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,920
Take it down with a forehead Joyman.

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Stars and Stripes of Human Bullet vs. Resurrected Gold Pig.

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,220
Inflate the tenga with your nose and shout this.

23
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,760
"I want to know defeat."

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,060
"I would like to lose just once."

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,900
"Give me the sweet humiliation of a loser."

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,500
Gera Get Out

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,100
Gera Get Out
(Gera: A person who laughs easily.)

29
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,440
Gera Get Out

30
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,510
Gera Get Out

31
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,910
Gera Get Out

32
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,240
Gera Get Out

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,540
Gera Get Out

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,720
I see...
A champion tournament.
Great! I'll do it!

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,250
A champion tournament...
Am I allowed to compete?

36
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,290
I'm a challenger.
Because I think I'm the lowest.

37
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,360
I won't run away because I'm a fighter.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,430
I have to do things that push myself to the brink of death.

39
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,530
I want to crush Zakoshi in the champion tournament.

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,940
Make the drawn masks laugh.
Violence that changes the form of the tyrant of comedy.

41
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,770
Exorcise the loveless guardian angels and turn it into a laugh.
Raflesia and Amnesia with big smiles.

42
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,380
Hamelin's Pied Piper's Cheesing.
The cost of Malice&Mice.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,480
Get 'em a contingency fee without orthodox method.

44
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,820
It's exciting because God only knows what will happen.

"Anyone who does not compete in the Documental

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,200
The winner of this tournament should go abroad.

51
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,610
That guy should represent Japan in the world championship.

52
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,970
That's a good idea.

53
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,210

Documental - Season 10
Episode 1 “The Resolve of the Kings”

57
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:35,340
To My Dearest
The long rainy season has made every day a good day for mushroom picking.

58
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,740
The mornings and evenings have gotten much colder and I am wondering if I should take out the kotatsu these days. (Note: 1)

59
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:51,990
This time, we have decided to invite all the winners of the past Documental competitions to the Grand Champion Tournament.

60
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:03,460
Since this is the champion tournament, you do not need to bring 1 million yen.
Please come empty-handed.

61
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:12,570
The champion will receive a cash prize of 10 million yen.

62
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,910
Of course, you may decline.

63
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,150
But I am sure you will all come.

64
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,950
The season of waiting for spring will begin again.

65
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,090
I wish you all a glorious spring.

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,670
Today is the Documental Grand Champion Tournament.

68
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,010
It's great!

69
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,450
This time we have a new position called observer.

70
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,950
Please come that room once in a while to stir stuff up.

71
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,690
Of course you guys are allowed to laugh.

72
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,260
Oh, I'm allowed to laugh?

73
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,160
That sounds like fun!

74
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
Only the challengers are not allowed to laugh.
You are all allowed to laugh.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,070
But we are not in the habit of laughing in that room.

76
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,570
Right!

77
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,630
I'm sure you're right.

78
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,540
Yeah, it's kind of a weird feeling, I guess.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,240
Also, if you laugh, we'll take a small cut of your fee.

80
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,280
Hey, are we just going to take risks?

81
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,790
Do they know who's coming this time?

82
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,390
- Of course they do.
- Only the winners will be here this time.

83
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,260
I'm the first one here?

84
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,530
- Kotouge did a great job.
- Yeah

85
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,330
Hello.

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Here you are.

87
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,000
The time has finally come.

88
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,910
I want to do a dirty comedy that cannot be aired on TV.

89
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,510
"He was the winner of Season 2,
earning 10 million yen in prize money."

90
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:03,550
He is the one who made everyone think that Documental are hilarious.

91
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,160
Was it really a comedy?

92
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,930
That was a great scene that will go down in history.

93
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,040
"A shouting comedian
from Sony Music Artists
who excels at offense and defense."

94
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,670
If anything he's more of the dramatic type.

95
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,280
Cheap jokes will never work on them.

"Raging Machine-gun Monk"

97
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,890
Documental has no rules.

98
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,760
I want to take away all the limiters and give it my all.

99
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:48,760
This is a comedy street fight.
I have to be prepared to break 5 or 6 bones.

100
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,440
I have no idea how much this will affect my future TV work.

101
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,240
I don't care if I lose two or three of my regular shows because of this.

102
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,750
I haven't been here in a long time.

103
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,630
Oh, hello!

104
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,670
Here he is.
Yamamoto of Gokuraku Tombo.

105
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,130
You are carrying a lot of his stuff.

106
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,500
Did he win?

107
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,740
Yes, he did.

108
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,540
Yeah.

109
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,410
But we were criticized by viewers who asked "Did he win?"

110
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,720
Excuse me.

111
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,690
No thank you.

112
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,820
I can't.

113
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,460
I can't do it.

114
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,000
"He was the winner of Season 3,
earning 10 million yen in prize money."

115
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,910
I think Yamamoto will be very spirited this time.

116
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,910
Because he's been criticized a lot.

117
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,080
People say, "Yamamoto didn't win."

118
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:20,690
I have competed in the same season as him.
At some point he tried to go under the radar.

119
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:30,830
He knows that.
He must be coming here today with the intention of showing off something great.

120
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,170
"Resurrected Gold Pig"

121
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,870
I have done many simulations since I received the offer.

122
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,740
No matter how many times I simulated, I always lost.

123
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,720
Then I decided to enjoy it.

124
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,590
I didn't think I would be here again.

125
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:01,260
They know who will be here, so they will take their own measures.

126
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,800
Yeah, it's totally different from our match.

127
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,860
It's totally different.

128
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,630
This is a nostalgic place.

129
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,370
That was quick.

130
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,510
Here comes Cookie from Yasei Bakudan.

131
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,810
He has already won twice.

132
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,120
TWO TIMES!

133
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,050
Hello.

134
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,060
A champion tournament?

135
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,790
Actually, I've been waiting for this.

136
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,600
I've been wanting to compete in the champion tournament for a long time.

137
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,770
Finally this letter reached me.

138
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,170
"He was the winner of Season 4 & 8,
earning 20 million yen in prize money."

139
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,910
Cookie is the favorite.

140
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,910
But his defense is the weakest among today's members.

141
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:58,790
He laughs so easily that he has to go on the attack first to counteract it.

142
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,660
"Comedian Killer"

143
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,870
I have never seen a view beyond the "hilarious".
I'd like to see it.

144
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:18,540
I want to crush Zakoshi and become champion for the third time.

145
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,040
"Finally, the two encounter each other."

146
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,080
I can't lose to him.
But I can't imagine losing to him.
I can only imagine my victory.

147
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,450
What should I buy with 10 million yen?

148
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,530
He is a crazy person, so he will laugh if I do something crazy.
I will seppuku him in front of zakoshi.

149
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,830
And he will laugh if something funny comes out of my belly.

150
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:51,870
I lost to Yamamoto-san.
I was there when you won.

151
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,740
I don't know how I won either.

152
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,610
You were with Yamamoto-san when you competed for the first time, weren't you?

153
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,950
It wasn't the first time, it was the second time.

154
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,820
I was in the season 1.

155
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,550
Then that's the second time.

156
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,320
- Zakoshi is here.
- He is strong.

157
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,690
Only the strong guy come here.

158
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,470
Here you are.

159
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,270
Oh, I received this again!
Nice!

160
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,770
Documental is me.

161
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,340
This is my show.
This is my tournament.

162
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,350
"He was the winner of Season 5 & 7,
earning 20 million yen in prize money."

163
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,890
He was attacking relentlessly.
How many jokes does he have?

164
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,820
The number of jokes will determine the winner.

165
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,530
This guy is incredibly strong.
And hilarious.

166
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,960
He never looks our way.

167
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,430
He only thinks of himself next.

168
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,340
He does not let his guard down.

169
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,970
I'd like to hear what he laughed his belly off at.

170
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,350
"Dump Truck Without Brakes"

171
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,520
I enjoy Documental the most.

172
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,050
I make jokes every day so that I am always ready for the Documental.

173
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,760
I don't spend my days slacking off.

174
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,330
No matter who comes, they are no match for me.

175
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,960
After all, zakoshi is strong.

176
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,800
He's scary, but I'm looking forward to him.

177
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,130
Even if we know what he's going to do, we can't stop him.

178
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,600
His digital jokes are insane.

179
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,310
I am Mr. Documental.

180
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,180
I'll give you a scolding!

181
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,210
I'm going to change the shape of you!
(Note: 2)

182
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,480
Are the winners entering in order?

183
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,080
Maybe so.

184
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,220
They are all shaved heads.

185
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,050
"The theory that shaved heads are the winners."

186
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,060
Is there a theory that shaved heads will win the Documental?

187
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,860
Everybody wants to win.

188
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,930
Who doesn't want to win?

189
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,100
I don't think I can.

190
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,000
Then abstain.

191
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,800
Here she comes.

192
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,510
She's the only woman.

193
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,150
She's a tough opponent, too.

194
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,780
Here you go.

195
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,490
Is this the mileage card I applied for?

196
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm very honored and pleased.

197
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,830
"She was the winner of Season 6,
earning 10 million yen in prize money."

198
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,600
Her defense is solid.

199
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,570
She continues to attack with weak jokes.
Opponents won't like that.

200
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,450
She is very persistent.
She does one thing all the time.

201
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,890
If you fall for her tricks, you are in trouble.

202
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,620
"The smashing girl who has lost a lot of weight”

203
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,390
You've lost weight.

204
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,960
I'm fatter than Arisa Mizuki.
(Note: 3)

205
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,670
See?
That's a depressing joke.

206
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:18,950
I don't challenge as a winner.
I challenge as a loser.
So I'm not stressing.

207
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,180
I want to compete with the intention of learning from the skills and balls of my seniors.

208
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,590
I'm very excited!

209
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,260
I really wonder what will happen today.

210
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,290
How cute.

211
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,660
This conversation is out of this world.

212
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,670
You all have beautiful eyes.

213
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,170
What's so beautiful about this guy's eyes?

214
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,810
He has eyes that look like they were carved with a carving knife.

215
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,210
He is the last.

216
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,380
Here he comes.

217
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,310
You all have a lot of baggage.

218
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,080
This is the finale, right?

219
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,280
It's not a finale.

220
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,450
If we do this champion tournament, it's the finale, right?

221
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,150
Hello.

222
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,590
What? What is it?

223
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,260
Ah, here it come!

224
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,930
"Dear Kubota
I'm in love with your talent."

225
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,000
" I want you to compete it."

226
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,840
"Downtown also grew up watching Kubota in some ways.
I'm waiting for you.
From Hitoshi Matsumoto"

227
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,940
Hey, is this for real?

228
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,550
It's going to be fun and stimulating.

229
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,480
"He won the Season 8 that never came to be,
but was stripped of his prize money."

230
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,660
"But he won in Season 9,
earning a total of 20 million yen in carried-over prize money."

231
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,460
I'll crawl out of hell as many times as I have to.

232
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,230
I wanna be very popular with women and get laid with them very much.

233
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,760
I wanna kiss a lot of women in this day and age.

234
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,070
I haven't laid with a woman, but I've laid with the Goddess of Comedy.

235
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,810
Kubota is really hilarious at times.

236
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,180
I have high expectations for him.

237
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,140
But sometimes he is not funny at all.

238
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,010
He has quite a few ups and downs.

239
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,680
"Never Ending Self-desperation"

240
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,890
In another five or six years, comedy will die.
So I'll make memories.

241
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,220
Kubota is insane.

242
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,880
Hello!

243
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,280
Hello.

244
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,620
You guys are getting a long fine.

245
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,620
It is the champion tournament, right?

246
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,650
You guys are getting a long fine at the champion tournament?

247
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,420
Sorry.

248
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,960
Should we have been tense?

249
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:43,760
Sorry.

250
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,230
I was going to out all of you.

251
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,500
Is that over?

252
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,500
That's not going to happen.

253
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,630
Shall we all go around to places with spiritual energy?

254
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,300
Yeah!

255
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,200
That sounds more fun.

256
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:04,480
Today we have gathered only those who have experience of winning.

257
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,180
For Kubota and Zakoshi, they may win a total of 30 million yen.

258
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,350
Right.

259
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,060
This time you guys are not giving out 1 million yen.
So you guys will not lose anything.

260
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,560
Let's decide the true champion today.

261
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,770
But you all are used to seeing this, right?

262
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,370
No, it's not!

263
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,000
I still can't get used to it.

264
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,240
It has power.

265
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,580
Yamamoto's victory spark controversial.

266
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,010
Controversial...

267
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,780
You were very criticized in the review section.

268
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,550
I did something controversial...

269
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,250
Are you already depressed?

270
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,820
It shows on your face.

271
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,130
Stay strong!

272
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,230
Stay strong!

273
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,170
That being said, I won.

274
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,670
I brought three more cards today.
You will be ejected when you get a red card from me.

275
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,910
The time limit is six hours.

276
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,210
Six hours is still better.

277
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,240
Is that so?

278
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,880
Yes, I prefer six hours instead of four.

279
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,010
Really so?

280
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:20,090
This time, unlike usual, there are people called observers.

281
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,760
We prepared someone just to stir stuff up.

282
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,830
Will they come to this room?

283
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,600
In some cases they will come here.
Basically, you are the only people in this room.

284
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,170
Of course, oservers are allowed to laugh.
But please do not laugh along with them.

285
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,500
I see

286
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,370
May I use them for my jokes?

287
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,540
Of course you can.

288
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:51,220
In six hours we will find out who is the King of Kings.
Good luck to everyone.

289
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,990
It will begin a short while after I return to my room.

290
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,490
- Are we starting already?
- Of course.

291
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,590
Do your best!

292
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,260
Thank you!

293
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,160
Thank you!

294
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,890
See you.

295
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,900
Use the props around here as you like, as usual.

296
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,240
Good bye.

297
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,610
Let's not laugh.

298
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,610
Ugh, is it about to start?

299
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,710
It's okay to laugh now, right?

300
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,540
If you want to laugh, now is the time.

301
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,850
I'm a laughing easily, so I'm going to laugh right now.

302
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,710
You smoke too early.

303
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,250
Then let's start.

304
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,050
Champion tournament!

305
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,720
The Documental Grand Champion Tournament is started!

306
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,360
Let's not mix up our bags.

307
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,060
Yeah.

308
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,370
Who's going to attack first?

309
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,140
They will all have come up with a strategy.

310
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,470
I am about to laugh.

311
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,440
Everyone has a big bag.

312
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,310
Mistaking a package for someone else could be fatal.

313
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,150
Ah, I am about to laugh.

314
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,210
Come on!!

315
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,690
The vibe is so different from the past.

316
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,860
Yeah.
Their enthusiasm is different from the past too.

317
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,220
Let's do something to cheer up!

318
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,930
Are you going to do it already?

319
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,090
Let's do something!

320
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,970
They are still in the locker room.

321
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,900
Were you trying to do something?

322
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,570
Let's do something!

323
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,270
Zako, you smacked me upside the head earlier, didn't you?

324
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,740
What?

325
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,770
You smacked me earlier.

326
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,580
No, I didn't.

327
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,510
Suddenly you...

328
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,420
And please don't call zakoshi Zako.
(Note: 4)

329
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,820
Why?
I can call this guy Zako, right?

330
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,650
That is my concern.

331
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,620
You should call him Zakoshi or Shisho.

332
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,590
He is Zako.

333
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:42,200
It hasn't even been a few minutes since we started and suddenly you don't want to be smacking other people's heads.

334
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,300
Once it starts we should be allowed to do whatever we want.

335
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,100
No, no, no...

336
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,370
Kubota...

337
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,940
You can't help that anymore.

338
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,640
And it sounded good.

339
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,070
Yuriyan is holding something in the back.

340
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,610
Yeah, right

341
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,140
Maybe she'll hit him too if he's off guard.

342
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,210
Yeah!

343
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,720
Do they staring contest in such a situation!?

344
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,720
Do they make funny faces?

345
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,390
Do they staring contest in the champion tournament?

346
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,530
I haven't seen this in a while.

347
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,300
It's a great opening.

348
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,330
Coo-chan seems to laugh.

349
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,500
He's  laughing?

350
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,600
Kotouge too.

351
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,880
If I were here, I would be laughing.

352
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,350
I didn't expect them to have a staring contest.

353
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,050
It was truly a showdown of power.

354
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,290
I think we have opened up to each other.

355
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,990
Don't you think so?

356
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,460
I really think so too.

357
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,660
Right?

358
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,890
I want to smack him, too.

359
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,360
- Go ahead.
- Can I smack you?

360
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,530
Sure.

361
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,970
He's almost laughing because it hurts so much.

362
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,740
Excuse me, can only a shaved head do this?

363
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,110
That's right.

364
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,110
You want to do it too?

365
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,250
- Can she smack you too?
- Go ahead.
- Sure.

366
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,880
There's a lot of baldness.

367
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,650
Yeah.

368
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,950
High baldness rate.

369
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,650
- Nice.
- Good!

370
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,420
You can do it harder.

371
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,690
Can I do it?

372
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,920
Do more.

373
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,100
Kotouge is throwing that.

374
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,730
He's throwing that.

375
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,870
Hey, he put water in it.

376
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,940
Don't put water in it!

377
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,540
Don't put water in it!

378
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,510
Hey, there's water in it.

379
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,710
Oh, that's nice.

380
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,250
Wipe the water off.

381
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,850
This is dangerous.

382
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,880
Don't hit people with that!

383
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,020
- Can I do it?
- Sure.

384
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,460
Big Kinoshita!

385
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,160
It’s Kinoshita.

386
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,920
Did he laugh?

387
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,690
He laughed, didn't he?

388
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,560
Who's Kinoshita?
(Note: 5)

389
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,430
It was a good cheering up.

390
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,560
- Really?
- Yeah, it was good.

391
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,230
- I actually have a Guinness record.
- What kind of record?

392
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,630
What is it?

393
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,400
I let my nails grow too long.

394
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,700
Ugh, that's gross.

395
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,470
It looks like a Medusa snake.

396
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,240
That's gross.

397
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,740
I've seen it in pictures.
It looks just like you.

398
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,180
Can this be used as a scarf?

399
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,340
In winter, yes.

400
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,750
Can I eat this?

401
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,920
Of course.

402
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:21,890
What is he doing?

403
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,190
What does he think it is?

404
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,190
Hey, Coo-chan!

405
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,400
Don't suck my nails!

406
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,570
What is this?

407
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,670
Oh, it stinks!

408
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,370
Oh, it stinks!

409
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,140
Oh, it stinks!

410
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,780
Whose impression is that?

411
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,240
Who?

412
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,180
People who just smell.

413
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,880
You are not an impression of someone else?

414
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,020
Don't sniff a woman's nails and say stink it!

415
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,480
So I'm supposed to apologize!?

416
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,320
No.

417
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,790
IIIIII'M SOOOOOOOOOO...

418
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,990
This is an exaggerated Desuyo.
(Note: 6)

419
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,530
RYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!

420
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,900
Cookie!

421
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
This move is funny.

422
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,400
Yeah.

423
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,340
Should I have given Coo the card?

424
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,840
Why did you smack me first?

425
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,980
Let's not talk about that anymore.

426
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,180
That's enough.

427
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,680
Don't you think it would be better for you if I smacked you?

428
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,280
Give me a reason.

429
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,620
I'll say it for you.
It's because you were expelled from Yoshimoto.
(Note: 7)

430
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,050
He spoke collectively.

431
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,590
It's because you're an asshole.

432
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,890
You're a piece of shit.

433
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,330
You are a fucking pedophile.

434
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:32,990
I'm not...

435
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,300
Fucking pedophile.

436
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,400
Who is the celebrity you would most like to lay with?

437
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,070
Who?

438
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,740
Please answer seriously without cheating.

439
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,140
Haruka Ayase.
(Note: 8)

440
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,410
That's not true.

441
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,540
That's not true.

442
00:25:49,710 --> 00:26:00,590
I answered like this because I didn't want to hear your prepared response.

443
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,420
Wha...huh...

444
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,560
Hey.

445
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,730
You can't just ask me all this crap and then give me that bland answer.

446
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,730
You do that sometimes.

447
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,800
You're trying to pick a fight with him.

448
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,870
You're scary.

449
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,640
You ask me all these questions about me, and when I answer you, you say, "huh."

450
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,170
Hey!

451
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,810
Serve you right, fucking pedophile!

452
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,180
"Don't take it for granted!"

453
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,680
"Don't take it for granted!"

454
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,250
"Don't take it for granted!"

455
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,780
Don't make fun of Kato!
(Note: 9)

456
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,620
- "Don't take it for granted!"
- Don't make fun of Kato!

457
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,720
Say Kato-"san"!

458
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,860
You caused him the most trouble!
You're the one who has to say Kato-"san"!

459
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,400
Yeah!

460
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,430
You fucking pedophile!!

461
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,740
Do you even know what you've done!?

462
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,140
Do you even know what you've done?

463
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,540
Why is he like that when he gets mad.

464
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,780
What the hell did you do!?
Hey!

465
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,150
- Reflect on it.
- Reflect on it.

466
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,050
To top it off, you were selling meat wrapped rice balls?
You idiot!
(Note: 10)

467
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,880
What's that!?

468
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,590
Don't sell those things.

469
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,390
"You are not humble!"

470
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,020
"You are not humble!"

471
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,660
"If you were one of our employees, I'd call you an idiot!"

472
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,830
"I'd call you an idiot!"

473
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,900
It's Money Tigers.
(Note: 11)

474
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,960
"You are not humble!"

475
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
It's President Kobayashi.

476
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,030
Well noticed.

477
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,500
- That's President Kobayashi, right?
- Yes!

478
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,570
Jackpot!

479
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,900
He likes Money Tigers so much.

480
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,010
Please don't ever do that again.

481
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,380
This is coming from a woman.

482
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,550
Don't be so clear about it.

483
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,710
Sorry.

484
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,950
- I'm kind of sorry.
- Don't worry.

485
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,780
Please apologize.

486
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,020
Yamamoto is laughing, right?

487
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,520
- Sorry if you guys are offended.
- That's okay, it is what it is.

488
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,230
- You don't get first place when you have to apologize.
- Why are you in first place?

489
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,290
You're third place.

490
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,560
You're third place, right?

491
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,570
Then come on, who's second or third?

492
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,300
What?

493
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,700
If I'm first in something.

494
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,940
If I'm first in something, who's second and third?

495
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,270
- In what field are you first place, asshole?
- Don't say asshole.

496
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,080
Pedophile.

497
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,740
Don't say it yourself.

498
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,250
Don't you ever feel reflective?

499
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,250
Kubota laughed?

500
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,450
Are you a pedophile?

501
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,750
Don't say that.

502
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,090
I'm not a pedophile!

503
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,050
You're a pedophile!

504
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,060
You have pedophile blood in your veins!

505
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,220
If you're not a pedophile, what are you?

506
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,230
Answer him.

507
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,730
Then what are you?

508
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,000
If you are...

509
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,630
You guys are really out to get me, aren't you!

510
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,400
What are you guys doing!?

511
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,000
Indeed.

512
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,800
Because you...

513
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,370
You guys teamed up or something!?

514
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,270
No!

515
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,620
I'm blind in one eye.

516
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,350
That’s bad!

517
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,360
I'm blind in both eyes.

518
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,060
That's just violence.

519
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,390
He hit the woman.

520
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,600
Are you okay?

521
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,700
This is terrible!

522
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,000
This is dangerous.

523
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,500
Are you okay, Yuriyan?

524
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,540
Don't touch her boobs!

525
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,570
Don't touch her boobs!

526
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,540
She is in danger!

527
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,110
Hey, don't touch her boobs!

528
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,880
Yamamoto laughed!

529
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,220
Yamamoto-san laughed.

530
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:21,520
Yamamoto-san?

531
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,390
No, it wasn't me.

532
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,520
I don't think this was me.

533
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,930
Wasn't that Kubota?

534
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,430
No.

535
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,800
I don't know but I think it was Kubota.

536
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,230
Who laughed?

537
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,700
You know...

538
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,410
You were just chilling.

539
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,310
What does that mean?

540
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,410
Were we grinning?

541
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,880
Yes, there is such an atmosphere.

542
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,450
Among them, one in particular was laughing.

543
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,190
Yamamoto.

544
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,450
Me!?

545
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:00,190
You almost laughed several times, but somehow you managed pull through.

546
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,800
But the boobs thing definitely made you laugh.

547
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,960
Was I laughing?

548
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,870
Let's watch the replay.
Yamamoto was grinning throughout the whole thing.

549
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,010
She fell down in a weird way.

550
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,760
This is out.

551
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,660
Really?

552
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,260
Yes, this is out.

553
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,130
You're still laughing.

554
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,670
Does that count as laughing?

555
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,770
You absolutely laughed.

556
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,600
You were like a audience member at a comedy show.

557
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,540
Then I should laugh more.

558
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,710
I give you a yellow card, of course.

559
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,450
I understand.
I'll be on my guard.

560
00:30:54,510 --> 00:31:01,150
You should keep your guard up and look as if you are angry.

561
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,660
Like this?

562
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,630
Why are you doing it now?

563
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,130
Why are you trying to make us laugh now?

564
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,100
You think you're gonna get points?
