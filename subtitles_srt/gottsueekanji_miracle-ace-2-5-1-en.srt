00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,180
That's hurts!

3
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,320
Masao-kun

4
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,650
Masao-kun is in trouble, he will soon
be hurt. Hurry "Miracle Ace!"

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,230
It's "Miracle Ace", you're bothersome!

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,260
Go away!

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,900
Just go.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,530
Thank you Mister.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,540
You helped me again

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,510
Helped you? It was a coincidence
I usually walk home the other way

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,180
Something told me to walk this way

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,950
You're always getting bullied huh?

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,020
Yes, but I don't know why

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,250
There must be something about you that gets you bullied

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:41,890
You think so?

16
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,790
Yeah

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,290
Mister?
- What?

18
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,290
I have a favor to ask

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,460
Don't get angry, just listen

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,070
You're giving off a weird vibe

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,530
Promise you won't be mad?

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,270
You promise?

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,710
Actually, I really wanted you to take off
that paper mask so I can see your face

24
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,140
So what about it?

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,020
Thank you

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,260
I got something good... something sweet

27
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,700
It's sweet

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,700
This here

29
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,700
Choose one

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,680
Which do you want?

31
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,680
You can drink that one Mister

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,250
Sorry about that

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:45,850
It's Ok

34
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,450
That was mine right?

35
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,450
Yes

36
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,620
Open this

37
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,560
I just cut my nails yesterday

38
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,900
Yeah, this taste better

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,940
Ahh, this is good

40
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,880
Mister the last time

41
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,820
I want to be strong like you

42
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,420
It's cold! What are you doing?

43
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,850
I'm sorry

44
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,120
I'm a mess

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,460
I wanted to be strong like you

46
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,090
That fine, but I'll get scolded when I get home

47
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
I'm sorry

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,260
You should be more careful

49
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,470
It could be you are getting bullied because of stuff like this

50
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,970
Really?
- Yeah

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,840
I have to dry this

52
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,280
Maybe when you wear this, it makes you stronger

53
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,620
Hmm... maybe

54
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,620
This is what gives you power!

55
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,490
Come at me

56
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,500
Right?

57
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,270
I'll put this back on

58
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,270
I have it on right?

59
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,940
Do you remember just now?

60
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:14,970
Yes

61
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,010
You remember right?

62
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,380
Come at me again

63
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,410
Somehow something is wrong

64
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,250
I can't really say what's wrong but

65
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,920
It's something... I got to go

66
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,390
What?

67
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,020
Oh, I have to go

68
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,060
Where are you going?

69
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,490
I have to go and get my insurance card

70
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:37,900
Sorry

71
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,860
OK

72
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,470
Well, see you again

73
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,330
Thanks for everything!

74
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,210
So that's "Miracle Ace", he still has a lot of secrets
