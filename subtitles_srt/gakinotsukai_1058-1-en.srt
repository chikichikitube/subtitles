We thought he parted ways with this show, but...

We thought he parted ways with this show, but...

18
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,500
"Thanks for everything" my ass!

19
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,480
They thought this was enough to cut ties with Shoji, but...

20
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,380
I'm not quitting this yet!

21
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,380

No one wants to do this, huh?   - I guess not

34
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,660
It's the wigs

35
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,860
I mean, I'm not the only one, right?  - We're in the same boat

36
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,440
I'm not really invested

37
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,940
We're not dressed like this 'cause we want to

38
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,940
That's right

39
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,180
But don't you think that "Feudal Lord Classroom" sucks?

40
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,640
Doesn't it feel like a parody? I mean,

41
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,740
We had "ninja" and lots of other stuff before

42
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,420
Can't we, like, meet him in Shimbashi, get his signature and cancel this shit?

43
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,260
Alright, alright...

44
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,430
Heading to the meeting spot

45
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,430
Heading to the meeting spot

46
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:22,820
Even in this dire situation, Yamazaki
is trying to make us laugh with his erected topknot

47
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,470
Thanks for noticing
- "I thank thee", I'd say

48
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,240
So...
- There's a sign

49
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,080
It's the same as always...
- There it is

50
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,080
Gather here for the
Feudal Lord Classroom!

51
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,310
Is he here already?

52
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,750
Yeah, he's here

53
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,750
I can see him

54
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,020
I ended up seeing him
- I didn't mean to, but our eyes met

55
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,350
It's that shenanigan

56
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,920
I think I've seen it before
- I don't remember what it's called

57
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,420
The hell is this?

58
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,360
Oh! It's been a while, hasn't it?

59
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,500
Good morning

60
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,740
'Morning

61
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,930
Are you doing well?

62
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:00,440
Murakami Shoji

63
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:00,440
Murakami Shoji

64
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:00,440
Murakami Shoji

65
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,020
Murakami Shoji showed up early,
in spite of everyone's desire

66
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,720
You know, I'm just back from a Feudal Lord Meeting

67
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:10,450
Don't expect much from today's episode
Nothing relevant is going to happen.

68
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:10,450
Don't expect much from today's episode

69
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,800
T'was fun!

70
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,330
There were tons of Feudal Lords...

71
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,400
Yeah?

72
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,150
It was really fun, we ate a whole lot

73
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,650
Like, boiled ainame and stuff

74
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,000
T'was... t'was outrageously delicious!

75
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,360
I bet it was, huh

76
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,660
The fuck is wrong with you, Hamada?!

77
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,980
What have I done now?

78
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,090
What have you done? I'll tell you what!
- What the...

79
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,460
Don't you wanna become a Feudal Lord and eat good stuff?!

80
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,840
Of course I want to eat

81
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,730
Not sure about the Feudal Lord thing...
- Everything was delicious!

82
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,070
Isn't he shouting too much?

83
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,070
Yeah, even more than usual

84
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,110
I've caught a cold today, I don't have much voice

85
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,110
Huh? Really?
- And you're still so loud?

86
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,940
His volume doesn't reflect that

87
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,810
Anyway, today I'm really going to make you all

88
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,550
some fine Feudal Lords, I swear

89
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,850
All the other things we've done... I wouldn't recommend becoming any of those

90
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,660
But today you'll become Feudal Lords!

91
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,480
So goddamn loud

92
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,930
My eardrums hurt
- Just shut up

93
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,960
How about we play a little game?

94
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,960
- Oh, are we going to?

95
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,600
Tell me something a Feudal Lord would say

96
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,100
It's a sort of quiz show

97
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,240
I bet you know some words a Feudal Lord would use, huh?

98
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,800
I see
- Let me go first

99
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,150
Something a Feudal Lord would say! Hey, hey!

100
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,610
This pleases me!

101
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,050
Hey, hey!

102
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,790
That is indeed foul

103
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,040
Yeah, it works
- Nice! Hey, hey!

104
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,920
Come closer, would you?

105
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,920
- Oh, nice one

106
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,120
Hey, hey!

107
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,630
Disband!

108
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,630
Nice one!

109
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,900
Hey, hey!

110
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,630
You shall be beheaded!

111
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,630
- This works!

112
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,770
Hey, hey!

113
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,340
Heads high, don't succumb to pain!

114
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,580
What the hell are you... "Heads high"?
You're copying his "come closer" but... it's ok!

115
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,660
Ah, is it good?!

116
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,580
It's fine, yes

117
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,080
I've changed my mind, it's good!

118
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,680
You did? Thank you

119
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,750
Someone!

120
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,020
Hey, hey!

121
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,420
Was that... it?
- "Someone", you know...

122
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,260
I thought the game changed for a sec

123
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,860
You mean as "someone, help me"?
- That's right

124
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,680
Hey, hey!

125
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,730
And now, this issue is settled

126
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,730
That's a good one!

127
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,000
Hey, hey!

128
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,530
I order you to commit seppuku

129
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,530
Nice one!

130
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,730
Hey, hey!

131
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,070
Who art thou?

132
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,120
I like this one! Hey, hey!

133
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,070
Bring me a horse!

134
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,670
Nice! Hey, hey!

135
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,980
You shall be beheaded!

136
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,980
Nice one! Hey, he--

137
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,880
Huh? Didn't you just copy him?

138
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,100
He did

139
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,880
- He did
- He did it so nonchalantly

140
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880

Let's start with something essential
to a Feudal Lord: a training for military arts

148
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,800
Feudal Lord Classroom - Lesson 1

149
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,800
Military Arts Training

150
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,970
First off, do you know what these are?

151
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,470
Don't expect much from today's episode
Nothing relevant is going to happen.

152
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,470
Don't expect much from today's episode

153
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,400
These over here

154
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,470
Targets?

155
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,980
Tsk

156
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,250
You're ok with that normal answer?

157
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,850
How about "is this a doll stand?"

158
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,780
Or "Is this for the Hina Matsuri?"

159
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,820
That's right, it's the five court-musician dolls!

160
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,290
Don't you need jokes like that at all?

161
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,580
Not really...

162
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,160
Of course you do!

163
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,730
Alright Yamazaki, who's this?

164
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,130
This is Saverio, right?

165
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,130
Yep, that's him

166
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,860
Are you ok with that answer?

167
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,700
Do you want to give up on this world?

168
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,100
I don't...
- Do you mean showbiz with that?

169
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,570
What are we...?

170
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,840
You're a feudal lord, aren't you?

171
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,840
Of course I am

172
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,080
I was asking about the other world (showbiz)

173
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,960
I thought he was talking about being a feudal lord

174
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,740
We have to become one, first

175
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,290
So, if you ask me what's crucial
when it comes to becoming a feudal lord...

176
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,120
I'd say it's horseback archery

177
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,090
Do feudal lords do that?

178
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,750
Of course they do, lots of daimyos used to

179
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,900
This gesture is strange too, right?
Why is he letting go?

180
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,970
Yamazaki...
- Yes, sorry.

181
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,770
Are you ok with that?

182
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,060
Here comes the tilted neck

183
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,770
You sure?

184
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,630
So, as our first training,
we'll learn how to perform horseback archery

185
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,400
Here!

186
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,420
Whoa... I've never done it before

187
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,020
You really like those things...

188
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,020
What is this?

189
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,850
It's a wheelbarrow

190
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,830
That's what I see

191
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,020
The hell are you saying?
And why are you speaking so softly?!

192
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,020
You said it
- I mean, that's it

193
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,930
I'm saying, you really like those, right?

194
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,400
I always see one of these around you

195
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,020
But you can't ride a horse, right?
- Right, right

196
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,560
We can't, actually

197
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,380
That's why we're relying on this
- I see, I'm sorry

198
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,510
You know what this is, right?

199
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,510
- Yep

200
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,370
Yamazaki?

201
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,940
It's a bow

202
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,480
You really gave up, didn't you?

203
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,680
How about answering "it's a fire tool used by cavemen" or such?

204
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm sorry

205
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,960
Unbelievable...

206
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,790
Alright Tanaka, let's start from you!

207
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,790
Oh, sure!

208
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,620
You're brave, you can become a feudal lord

209
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,020
Oh, is that so?
- Amazing!

210
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,030
Come here, Hamada
- Thank you

211
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,590
Yes?

212
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,060
Have this

213
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,430
Sure...
- Place it around your neck

214
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,500
What should I do with it?
- Like this

215
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,870
Here
- Huh?

216
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,270
What is...

217
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,340
Like this
- Careful, ok?   - Sure

218
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,110
I'm coming from this way, get ready

219
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,850
What the hell are you doing there?!

220
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,140
What the hell am I supposed to...

221
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,490
Are you here to stop us from working or what?!

222
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,740
What should I do with these?!
- You gotta make some noise, like this!

223
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,820
Oh! I see!

224
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,260
Of course
- I see...    - That's the horse running, right?

225
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,630
Let's see how you do it

226
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,100
The sound is...

227
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,220
A horse is faster than that!

228
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,700
Do you want to...

229
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,540
You wanna screw this over or what?

230
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,320
This is something precious I've warmed up for ya!

231
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,660
Don't say it like that

232
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,320
He surely warmed it up for us

233
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,080
Come on, do it properly!
- Show me how

234
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,280
Like this!
- I see

235
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,620
Now you try

236
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,900
Here we go
- Good luck!

237
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,280
Good luck!
- Go for it, Tanaka!

238
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,760
What the hell?!
- Careful!

239
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm not really good at this
- For crying out loud...

240
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,200
Just do it!

241
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,970
He's pretty good at it!
- That sounds nice!

242
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,960
Alright, let's go!
- He's good at it

243
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,420
Here I go

244
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,620
Oh no
- I'm sorry

245
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,860
Oh, is that so? I'm sorry

246
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,860
You gotta follow me, come on!

247
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,530
It's weird if the horse is over here
but the sound is over there, right?!

248
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,680
Next up, Yamazaki rides the horse
while Matsumoto is in charge of its sounds

249
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,500
Horseback archery

250
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,500
Horseback archery

251
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,500
Matsumoto

252
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,500
Matsumoto

253
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,500
Sound making

254
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,500
Sound making

255
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,500
Yamazaki

256
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,500
Yamazaki

257
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,830
Alright, let's go

258
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,140
Maybe he can strike two arrows before getting here?

259
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,140
You're right, he could do it

260
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,510
Good luck!
- Give it your best

261
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,510
Here we go. Say "go" when you're ready!

262
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,800
Can I?
- Yes

263
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,380
Go!

264
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,210
You're the one who should say "go", idiot!

265
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,340
Ouch!

266
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,460
It's your job!
- I guess he's right

267
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,080
He's scary...   - Really
- Sorry, I forgot to say it

268
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400
Go!
- Go!

269
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,080
Oh, no! He lost an arrow!

270
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,380
This is scary! Stop! I'm scared!

271
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,620
Goddamn...

272
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,900
Wait a sec--- stop it!
- Watch out, it's dangerous!

273
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm scared! I'm scared!

274
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,660
Stop it, please!
- Be brave! Man up!

275
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,410
This is so scary!
- Shoot it now!

276
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,040
Please! Stop!

277
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,340
You're no good

278
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,840
This is impossible

279
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,680
The sound was pretty crappy too

280
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,720
Hey

281
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,060
I had enough, I'm exhausted
- Sure

282
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,060
We don't have time to waste on this crap

283
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,930
Celebration Training

284
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,930
Feudal Lord Classroom - Lesson 2

285
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,380
A true Feudal Lord, must be able
to reduce the distance from his people

286
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:48,810
Don't expect much from today's episode
Nothing relevant is going to happen.

287
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:48,810
Don't expect much from today's episode
Nothing relevant is going to happen.

288
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,740
When there's some sort of battle

289
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,880
You can win or lose, but there's a big difference

290
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,410
When you win, it's the best feeling ever, right?
- Yes

291
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,580
So it's time to practice how to celebrate when you'll win

292
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,380
Do you know how to properly do it?
- Is there a proper way?

293
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,190
Well, it's a sort of ceremony itself, right?

294
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:12,200
Use the provided tools to liven up the celebrations!

295
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:12,200
Use the provided tools to liven up the celebrations!

296
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,440
They'll use the tools Lord Shoji provided them

297
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,440
To liven up the victory celebrations

298
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,700
Matsumoto's challenge!

299
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,700
Matsumoto's challenge!

300
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,700
Matsumoto's challenge!

301
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,170
Matsumoto will be the first challenger

302
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,030
Make sure to liven it up for good, ok?

303
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,310
Hoorayyyyy!!

304
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,440
- Oh yeah!

305
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,150
You're making fun of this, aren't you?

306
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm not, I swear

307
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,980
Move away, geez

308
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,020
I knew I had to do this in the end

309
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,090
Show us how it's done
- I agree

310
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,000
That thing wasn't there before...

311
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,430
He got that thing for himself

312
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,830
Ah, you're right...

313
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,270
Thanks to all of you guys,
today we defeated our enemies!

314
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,270
You surely gave your best!

315
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,070
I'm so glad and happy I just can't---

316
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,040
That's how happy I am!

317
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:18,800
On August 28th, in the shopping district, a new pachinko parlor will open

318
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,710
Boss, use this to make some fried rice

319
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,090
What's wrong?

320
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,900
Huh?

321
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,130
Is everything ok?

322
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,510
Well...

323
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,440
We... we're fine
- Yes, we are

324
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,310
You're doing your best

325
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,270
Are you sure you---

326
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,710
I thought it was good

327
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,710
Even if you say so,

328
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,380
Are you sure you want to become Feudal Lords?

329
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,540
I'd like to try, if possible

330
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,950
I know, right?
- Yes

331
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,420
Alright, let's move on to our next train---

332
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,020
Ouch

333
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,700
Gimme a break

334
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,960
Coming up

335
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,960
Coming up

336
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,960
Shoji will give them all a prize!!

337
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,960
Shoji will give them all a prize!!

338
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,800
A present from the Feudal Lord

339
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,800
Feudal Lord Classroom - Lesson 3

340
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,800
Feudal Lord Shoji will give a prize to the
5 men undergoing his harsh training

341
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,100
In the end we only move

342
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:41,310
Don't expect much from today's episode
Nothing relevant is going to happen.

343
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:41,310
Don't expect much from today's episode
Nothing relevant is going to happen.

344
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,820
If we're given money

345
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,460
Or material goods, am I right?

346
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,160
I know that's everything people ever want

347
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,950
I know that Tokugawa too
had a buried treasure, if you try to look for it

348
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,050
That's why

349
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,360
Today I'll have you search for the buried treasure of Murakami

350
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,220
Turn around for a sec
- Sure

351
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,030
You're doing it now?
- Don't look back!

352
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,600
Count to 10!

353
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,470
Alright, here we go
- Sure

354
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,010
One, two, three, four...

355
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,880
Five, six, seven, eight...

356
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,910
Nine, ten!
- Good! You're done

357
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,960
Now...

358
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,190
Where's the treasure?

359
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,390
Can we take as much as we want?
- Sure you can

360
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,810
Oh, here's another!
- I got it

361
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,460
Here's two
- There's a bunch over here

362
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,000
Hey, hey

363
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,970
What do you think your countdown was for?

364
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,140
Now that I think about it...

365
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,160
I toss them and you go like
"can we take as much as we want?"

366
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,980
This isn't the right answer!!

367
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:55,150
It's like eating a pizza soaked in water, who would eat it like that?!

368
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,220
Well, whatever

369
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,220
Eh?
- Whatever?

370
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,560
Whatever

371
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,360
Alright, Matsumoto
- Yes

372
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,660
I got number 2
- Oh! Wait a sec...

373
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,300
You did it!
- Huh? What?

374
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,570
You did it!

375
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,800
Here

376
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,410
Terracotta figures?

377
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,290
But these aren't your regular figures
- Really?

378
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,610
Yep
- What are they?

379
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:29,820
President Osaki (from Yoshimoto) gav--- gave this to me 13 years ago

380
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,150
He told me they'd bring me luck

381
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,830
After 1-2 years since I received them

382
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,130
My job offers crumbled down faster than usual

383
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,250
Now they're yours

384
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,540
I don't think I...
- Whatever, let's move on

385
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,220
I've got number five
- Number five!

386
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,840
You picked a good one!
- Thank you

387
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,980
Here, Yama-chan...

388
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,450
So nostalgic!

389
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,960
Nostalgic, isn't it?

390
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,100
It was something, back in the days

391
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,140
- This used to be so popular

392
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,020
High-heel Momoko used to wear this a lot

393
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:07,460
High-heel Momoko

394
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,460
She said "bro! When you won't wear that thing anymore, give it to me!"

395
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,490
Is that how it went?
- I swear, she always said that

396
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,790
Also, this one...

397
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,430
I got this from president Kanai, from the steel mill

398
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,010
This is real, check it out
- What's with that pair?

399
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,640
It's a Versace!

400
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,640
That's right!
- This isn't cheap stuff

401
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,410
He told me "wear this when you'll visit Korea"

402
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,850
It doesn't feel like a real conversation

403
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,940
You can wear them together?
- That's correct

404
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,050
That's really nice
- Congratulations!

405
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,650
Your turn, Hama-chan
- I got number 10

406
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,000
Here

407
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
Hama-chan...
- Yes?

408
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,600
Watch this and learn again what comedy is
- What's that?

409
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,060
It's my DVD

410
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,600
Its title is "I did my best"

411
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,070
I was forced to personally sell 1200 copies of this

412
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,400
Oh my

413
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,940
I almost went bankrupt

414
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,940
"Personally"?

415
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,420
Next up, they'll learn the right
love techniques to conquer every girl

416
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,820
Feudal Lord Classroom - Lesson 4

417
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,820
Love techniques

418
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,450
It's crucial for a Feudal Lord

419
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:15,980
Don't expect much from today's episode
Nothing relevant is going to happen.

420
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:15,980
Don't expect much from today's episode
Nothing relevant is going to happen.

421
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,720
To have lots of children so you have more heirs

422
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,720
I see...

423
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,700
That's really important   - That's right

424
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,940
You need to know some techniques

425
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,370
Alright, I'll pretend to be a woman

426
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,370
Tanaka!
- Yes?

427
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,000
Come right here
- Sure

428
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,670
Come here and try to casually touch my nipples

429
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,170
Like, nonchalantly. I'm a woman, you know!

430
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,210
Does he really have to?
- I guess so

431
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,040
What is he singing?

432
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,260
You suck!

433
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,460
What's that song?

434
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,960
You really suck!

435
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,260
Sounded like a folk dance...

436
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,260
Yeah, kind of

437
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,520
You gotta go for it, quick and determined!
- I see, quicker

438
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,840
Determined?
- You're not good at all

439
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,880
Matsumoto, you try
- Sure

440
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,140
Alright
- Please

441
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,960
He's not going for it

442
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,300
Kind of...

443
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,200
He's attacking from the outside

444
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,200
Maybe that's where he's starting

445
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,460
That hurts!

446
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,520
Wasn't that good enough?

447
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,400
It hurts!

448
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,020
I'm sorry

449
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,870
Sit down
- Yes

450
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,900
Listen, you gotta do it nonchalantly

451
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,580
Pretend you're walking past behind her...

452
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,980
And then?

453
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,640
So, you're walking behind her...

454
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,760
The fuck are you doing?!

455
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,610
H-Hey, stop it

456
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,380
What the hell are you doing?
This has nothing to do with it!

457
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,380
- That's weird!    - Hey, Lord!

458
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,980
This has nothing to do with my nipples!

459
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,980
What are you doing?

460
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,320
Can you just go and aim down there?!

461
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,320
Why not?!

462
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,560
Of course you can!

463
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,560
Ah, I see...

464
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,700
When a lady gets... you know, in that mood...

465
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,870
That's how it ends!

466
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,000
And then

467
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,220
You're ready to take her to the bedroom

468
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,580
I see

469
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,600
You know?

470
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,030
You take her to the bedroom...

471
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,030
Yes...

472
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,620
What's that?

473
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,020
It's her kimono sash

474
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,020
Ah, I see

475
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,020
Makes sense

476
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,740
I'm going to...

477
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,630
I'm going to strip it all away from ya!

478
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,530
I can see all your embarrassing parts!

479
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,640
Wanna go home?

480
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,190
Should we go?
- Yeah...

481
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,050
Oh, he used it all

482
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,300
Excuse me!

483
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,230
Can I have another one?

484
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,350
Let's go home

485
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,640
Yep

486
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,350
W-Wait...

487
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,180
Oh, God!

488
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,680
I call upon thee!

489
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,920
Bang!

490
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,330
Bang!

491
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,690
Bang!

492
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,590
Bang!

493
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,400
Don't you hear something?

494
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,240
I definitely heard something

495
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,360
What's that?

496
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,900
Is this still going on?

497
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,900
What's that?

498
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,370
What?

499
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,540
What's that?

500
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,540
What's going on?

501
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,910
Wait, what's that?

502
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,570
Is it part of this bit?

503
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,860
Whaaaat?!

504
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,300
What's this?!

505
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,860
It's a Feudal Lord...

506
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,420
Eh? Is that a Feudal Lord too?

507
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,800
Nishioka Tokuma

508
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,800
Nishioka Tokuma

509
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,620
What are you doing here?

510
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,670
Nishioka Tokuma's
Feudal Lord Classroom

511
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,670
Nishioka Tokuma's
Feudal Lord Classroom

512
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,800
"Classroom"?

513
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,670
What do you think?

514
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,800
Why don't you come to my class instead?

515
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,800
Oh, definitely!

516
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,740
By the way

517
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,340
Your teacher hasn't any approval to do so, right?

518
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,060
Have you?    - Really?

519
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,250
My Classroom has been approved by the shogunate!

520
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,060
Let's go to his Classroom, then!

521
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,060
- That sounds way better!

522
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,240
What do you think? Wanna join me?

523
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,550
- I think it's good, let's go!

524
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,240
Alright then, follow my lead

525
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,590
- Yes! Alright, let's go

526
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
- Good

527
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,540
- Thanks, you saved us!

528
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,180
- Thank you so much!

529
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,500
Come on, follow me

530
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,500
- So he's not a Feudal Lord...

531
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,260
Tokuma's got everything arranged

532
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,160
- Yeah

533
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,460
True, such a lifesaver!

534
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,500
You got involved in his schemes, didn't you?

535
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,710
I'm a Feudal Lord, and I'm feud up with all of this!

536
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,610
You got me? I'm a Feudal Lord!

537
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,150
What are you? A Feudal Frog?

538
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,150
