December 10, 2000

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,120
Backstage before recording the show

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,700
Gaki no Tsukai, before shooting

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,920
Yamasaki and Cocorico wait for Downtown.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,230
But only one man arrived.

8
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,440
Hel-

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,180
Huh?

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,390
Hello.

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,700
Hello.

12
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,740
It's Hamada, right?

13
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,120
Who is it?

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,140
No, come on, that's hard to smoke, right?

15
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,760
That's hard to smoke, right?

16
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,180
That's hard to smoke, right?

17
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,800
I can see saliva stuck on there.

18
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,460
Since I'm wearing this, you get it, right?

19
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,960
Well, yes, we've already done this - how many times?

20
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,180
I don't even want to say it.

21
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,380
The boss has said he wants to do this.

22
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,640
With another version.

23
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,340
What does he want to do?

24
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,470
Then will you take a look at this?

25
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,810
Yes.

26
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,380
Can you put this in?

27
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,640
What does he want to-

28
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,310
This, this is it.

29
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,810
What?

30
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,610
Hold on.

31
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,380
What?

32
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,380
Look at that.

33
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,830
This is...

34
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,570
What?

35
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,120
Look at that.

36
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,600
Crazy.

37
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,020
Look at that.

38
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,900
Whoa, whoa.

39
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,700
There is no way this is doable.

40
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,850
We can't do this.

41
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,260
Look at that.

42
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,700
That, that jump.

43
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,080
Wow.

44
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,080
Wow.

45
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,070
Look at that.

46
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,890
He's spinning.

47
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,970
This is, what's that...

48
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,700
at the champion level, you know?

49
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,540
Yes.

50
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,220
This is amazing.

51
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,350
Backside grab

52
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,030
sh... shifty frontside.

53
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,320
Five-four-oh air.

54
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,410
I have no idea what's going on.

55
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,590
Yes.

56
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,310
I don't know what that means at all.

57
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,570
That's the name of that technique.

58
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,030
That, right there, did one-and-a-half turns.

59
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,600
What we saw there?

60
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,950
So – yeah –

61
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,550
He does one-and-a-half turns up there and comes back down.

62
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,360
But the boss says

63
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,860
"That's nothing."

64
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,920
He wants to do two-and-a-half turns.

65
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,350
He wants to do two-and-a-half turns.

66
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,690
The technique is called

67
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:44,830
Backside grab

68
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,830
shifty frontside 900 air.

69
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,700
I have no idea what you're saying.

70
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,240
Again, Matsumoto makes an unreasonable demand

71
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,400
Again, Matsumoto makes an unreasonable demand

72
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,340
saying he wants to do two-and-a-half turns on a skateboard.

73
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,430
Hamada became a kuroko again

74
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,360
But Hamada became a kuroko* again.

75
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,940
But Hamada became a kuroko* again.

76
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,600
*Kuroko is a traditional Japanese theatre stagehand.  Kurokos wear all black to imply to the theatre audience that they are supposed to be invisible and not part of the onstage action.

77
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,760
To make Matsumoto's dream come true

78
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,980
To make Matsumoto's dream come true.

79
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,380
To make Matsumoto's dream come true.

80
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,840
(Two-and-a-half Turns on a Skateboard in the Air)

81
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,840
Matsumoto Hitoshi

82
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,840
The Backside Grab Shifty Frontside 900 Air Challenge

83
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,120
Matsumoto Hitoshi,

84
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,700
the challenge: two-and-a-half turns on a skateboard in the air.

85
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,880
On Sunday

86
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,880
you have a job in Sapporo as a side act.

87
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,340
Is that true?

88
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,910
Why do you know that?

89
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,360
Yes, why?

90
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,580
He's here.

91
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,610
Hey!

92
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,320
That is some outfit.

93
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,890
Can you scrubs really do this?

94
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,230
He's really pissed.

95
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,610
Yeah, we're fine.

96
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,620
Do you all know what we're trying to do?

97
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:25,940
Yeah, we do.

98
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,490
Say it, what are we trying to do?

99
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,500
Back-

100
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,330
(The cue card) He's reading it.

101
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,820
He tried to read it.

102
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,570
He tried to read katakana.*

103
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,230
He tried to read katakana.*

104
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,600
*Katakana are Japanese letters used for foreign loanwords.  It is common for Japanese people to find it awkward to read many foreign loanwords in katakana stringed together as this rarely occurs in Japanese text outside of specialized terminologies.

105
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,380
Say it.

106
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,340
Right, so,

107
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,150
Backside grab

108
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,370
shifty frontside 900 air.

109
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,730
Yeah, that's it.

110
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,480
Say it.

111
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,480
He's reading it.

112
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,590
Backside grab-

113
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,210
Don't read it.

114
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,040
Hammer it into your brains.

115
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,030
It's in yours?

116
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,200
Of course, dumbass.

117
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,530
The person in question?

118
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,070
Yeah.

119
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,930
What is it called?

120
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,770
Ow!

121
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,670
Why?

122
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,210
What was that for?

123
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,380
Let's go.

124
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,380
Please, do this properly.

125
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,600
Because you're the one who's the most lazy about it.

126
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,380
That's true.

127
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,500
Yes.

128
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,400
Do it properly with effort.

129
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,610
I did give that some thought.

130
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,830
I was a bit too lazy about it.

131
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,800
I was a bit too lazy about it.

132
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,560
I'm thinking I relied too much on you.

133
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,010
Today, if we don't do things right, I'll get injured.

134
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:13,770
Today, if we don't do things right, I'll get injured.

135
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,510
Today, if we don't do things right, I'll get injured.

136
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,530
That's true.

137
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,850
This much, I want to avoid.

138
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,640
Give it your best.

139
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,680
Give it your best as if you have a side part.

140
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,120
Give it your best as if you have a side part.

141
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,280
Yes, let's go.

142
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,910
Here we go.  I'm gonna get on.

143
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,630
This is annoying.

144
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,340
Get him on.

145
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,920
Shoes, shoes.

146
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,640
Get his legs...

147
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,920
Got him on.

148
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,220
Hold him up by the shoulders.

149
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,900
Straighten his legs.

150
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,730
At least straighten your legs by yourself, damn it.

151
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,140
At least straighten your legs by yourself, damn it.

152
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,900
Good.

153
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,860
That's right.

154
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,210
Watch out.

155
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,840
Watch out, watch out.

156
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,940
Watch out, watch out.

157
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,500
One more time.

158
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,160
One more time, one more time.

159
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,030
One more time.

160
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,600
Ow, ow.

161
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,160
Ow, ow.

162
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,380
I got it.

163
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,530
It's the-

164
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,890
His legs-

165
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,910
Aren't fixed.

166
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,160
Because his legs aren't fixed.

167
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,340
they're not on the board.

168
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,280
Oh, that's why.

169
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,490
We have to fix his legs.

170
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,470
Good.

171
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,750
Let's change it to this one.

172
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,770
Let's do this one.

173
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,530
A skateboard with shoes fixed on is prepared

174
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,700
Bring him over here.

175
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,560
Here we go.

176
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,340
A rope is then attached and pulled from above

177
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,750
Here we go, here we go.

178
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,810
Ready and

179
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,750
Go

180
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,510
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

181
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,390
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

182
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,110
A little more.

183
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,880
A little more, a little more.

184
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,690
A little more, a little more.

185
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,110
A little more, watch out.

186
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,760
A little more.

187
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,910
Argh.

188
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,910
Watch out.

189
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,780
He's hanging off of me.

190
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,760
Are we limited by how much we can push him

191
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,800
Matsumoto gets angry and leaves

192
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,640
because we're limited by how much we can pull him, right?

193
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,630
Because, you know

194
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,240
with a thin rope, you can't really get him up by that much.

195
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,800
Isn't that why this didn't work?

196
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,070
Wouldn't it be faster if we just get the people who know

197
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,070
how this all works to do it?

198
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,230
Definitely.

199
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,230
Definitely.

200
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,650
The group go backstage to apologize to Matsumoto

201
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,720
*"Ashita Ga Arusa" was a TV drama that all Gaki members appeared in, with Hamada and Cocorico in starring roles.  The "Sweater Ga Arusa" Coat was a real gift campaign sponsored by Georgia Coffee.  See a TV ad they did here: http://y2u.be/72E6G9eU7CQ

202
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,720
Matsumoto was applying to win a free "Sweater Ga Arusa" Coat

203
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,720
from Georgia Coffee.

204
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,720
Was there something

205
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,720
you were unsatisfied with that made you leave?

206
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,960
You say "something you were unsatisfied with" but

207
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,270
didn't I say at the beginning to make sure to not get hurt?

208
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,270
didn't I say at the beginning to make sure to not get hurt?

209
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,570
With the first hit it went "crack" right here.

210
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,570
With the first hit it went "crack" right here.

211
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,820
What the hell are you all doing?

212
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,320
You're like a bunch of hoodlums, aren't you?*

213
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,160
*When Downtown were up and coming comedians, their style was criticized seriously as "[just acting like] hoodlums (chimpira)" by Yokoyama Yasushi, their senior and a hugely influential comedian.  More here: http://goo.gl/OYVmR8

214
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,790
You're like a bunch of hoodlums, aren't you?*

215
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,120
But Matsumoto

216
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,430
But Matsumoto

217
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,780
we need you to at least straighten your legs

218
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,320
otherwise there's no way we can do that technique.

219
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,110
I wanted to straighten my legs.

220
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,180
I wanted to straighten my legs, too.

221
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,070
But I couldn't do it because of the way

222
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,070
it was said to me.

223
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,680
I don't know what he's talking about.

224
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,430
I couldn't do it because of the way it was said to me.

225
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,700
Did anyone say it in a way like that?

226
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,210
No.

227
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,160
No one said anything like that, right?

228
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,490
What's with this guy?

229
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,790
His nose is running.

230
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,630
You're right.

231
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,740
This guy's an idiot.

232
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,500
Just one more time.

233
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,660
Let's do it just one more time.

234
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,770
Matsumoto's 2nd Attempt!!

235
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,330
Matsumoto couldn't even get on the board.

236
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,770
Now, his 2nd attempt.

237
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,750
Here we go.

238
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,040
Let's go.

239
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:34,800
Go ahead.

240
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,570
Yes, please.

241
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,260
Ready and

242
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,140
Watch out, watch out.

243
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,190
BANG

244
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,350
Oh, this tilts to the side.

245
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,330
Oh, yes.

246
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,280
I'll bring that over.

247
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,250
Bring that other one over.

248
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,340
Oh, yeah.

249
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,580
This, this one.

250
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,250
Here we go.

251
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,730
This will be ok.

252
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,130
He's staring, he's staring, he's staring,

253
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,700
He's staring, he's staring, he's staring,

254
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,490
He's staring, he's staring, he's staring,

255
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,100
If you will, please.

256
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,170
Let's go.

257
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Here we go.

258
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,060
Here we go.

259
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,470
Don't letcha hands go. Seriously, don't let go.

260
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,510
Don't letcha hands go. Seriously, don't let go.

261
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,510
If you let go, this'll be bad.

262
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,230
Alright, let's go.

263
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,260
Yay.

264
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,100
Watch out, watch out.

265
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Oh god, oh god.

266
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,660
Matsumoto gets angry and leaves again

267
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,900
That was close, right?

268
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,980
What happened?

269
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,980
He was really angry, huh.

270
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,500
The group go backstage to apologize to Matsumoto, again

271
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,140
*Ogawa Natsumi is Hamada's wife.  "Welcome Home! (Okaeri!)" is a real book by her about life in the Hamada family.  Japanese link here: http://goo.gl/jhbu94

272
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,140
Matsumoto is reading "Welcome Home! (Okaeri)"

273
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,140
by Ogawa Natsumi*.

274
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,490
Give his hat back.

275
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,500
Yes.

276
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,260
Matsumoto, your hat.

277
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,100
Matsumoto, your hat.

278
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
*The other two books on the desk are real autobiographical books written by Hamada.  The red one is "Forgery (Gansaku)" and the white and black one is "Read This! (Yome)."

279
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,670
What do you want to do?

280
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,370
"What do we want to do?"  I mean, go up like this, do two-and-a-half turns, and-

281
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,850
Not once did I say "Get a surfboard for this," right?

282
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,120
I was shocked.

283
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,650
What is this?  What's going to happen here?

284
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,720
What is this?  What's going to happen here?

285
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,410
In fact when I got flipped over

286
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,140
I hurt my ribs.

287
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,400
You know,

288
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You all saw the tape, right?

289
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,820
They had that cool-sounding rock music playing

290
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,680
so there's this stylishness in doing it in that kind of atmosphere.

291
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,040
What's with you all?

292
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,180
With that Kansai dialect. Like, "Don't letcha hands go."

293
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,400
With that Kansai dialect. Like, "Don't letcha hands go."

294
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,280
In the standard dialect, then.

295
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,840
Ok.

296
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,440
Ok.

297
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,520
He's seriously saying don't speak in an Osaka dialect?*

298
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:20,160
*All five cast members virtually always speak with a Kansai dialect on the show.  The term "Osaka dialect" is sometimes used interchangeably with "Kansai dialect."

299
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,420
We can't speak in a Kansai dialect...?

300
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,070
Once Matsumoto comes, let's all speak in the standard dialect.

301
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,940
Once Matsumoto comes, let's all speak in the standard dialect.

302
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,270
Once Matsumoto comes, let's all speak in the standard dialect.

303
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,180
Yes, we'll do that.

304
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,840
Yes.

305
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,380
Matsumoto's 3rd Attempt!!

306
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,700
Emphasizing stylishness this time, his 3rd attempt.

307
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,380
Emphasizing stylishness this time, his 3rd attempt.

308
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,470
Here it is.

309
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,230
Yes, good.

310
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,570
This will work.

311
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,090
This is a sports equipment called a "Rhönrad."

312
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,970
Definitely, this will work.

313
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,370
Should we move it on?

314
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,640
What is this?

315
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,640
What is this?

316
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,510
Should we do the feet as well?

317
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,880
The feet.  The feet as well?

318
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,880
The feet.  The feet as well?

319
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,280
The feet are fine.  They're fixed on by that.

320
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
Ok.

321
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,290
Ok, it's good.

322
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,620
Ok, let's go.

323
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,920
So, we will go from this side.

324
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,960
So, we will go from this side.

325
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,360
Ok.

326
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,860
Let's go.

327
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,600
No, no, this is bad.

328
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,000
No, no, this is bad.

329
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,930
No, no, this is bad.

330
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,770
This is bad, this is bad.

331
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,600
This is bad, this is bad.

332
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,300
This is bad, this is bad, this-

333
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,240
This is bad, this is bad, this-

334
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,800
This is bad, this is bad, this-

335
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,370
Wait, wait.

336
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,370
Wait, wait.

337
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,670
Matsumoto gets angry and leaves, yet again

338
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,650
Wow.

339
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,120
He is going wild.

340
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,010
The group goes backstage to apologize to Matsumoto, yet again

341
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,800
I had found a job to start after graduation.

342
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,990
Matsumoto is being interviewed by a magazine reporter

343
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,430
So,

344
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,100
Hamada took a boat racing test...

345
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,440
Hamada took a boat racing test...

346
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,340
A foreigner?

347
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,340
They're doing an interview.

348
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,810
It's an interview.

349
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:47,450
I wasn't that interested in Yoshimoto* but Hamada really wanted me to join, so that's how it happened.

350
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:48,800
*Yoshimoto is Downtown's talent agency.

351
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,800
I wasn't that interested in Yoshimoto* but Hamada really wanted me to join, so that's how it happened.

352
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,710
*She is speaking with a Kansai dialect.

353
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,710
I understand ya.*

354
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,490
She's got an Osaka dialect.

355
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,960
If you could tell us what caused what happened earlier, otherwise we don't know-

356
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,760
If you could tell us what caused what happened earlier, otherwise we don't know-

357
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,830
I'm doubting whether or not you really care about me.

358
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,600
What is that, that round thing?

359
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,900
What is that, that round thing?

360
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,700
A Rhönrad.

361
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:13,210
I was taped while I couldn't even grip it.

362
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,080
I was fixed while I couldn't even grip it, fixed with two fingers.

363
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,150
I was fixed while I couldn't even grip it, fixed with two fingers.

364
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,820
What do you all think about how scared I was there?

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,600
I understand ya.

366
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,090

That was part of our conversation.

00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,460
I actually feel like quitting.

369
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,930
But if I quit, I'd feel sorry for you guys more than for me.

370
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,400
But if I quit, I'd feel sorry for you guys more than for me.

371
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,600
You'd end up going home with a sense of failure, so for you all, I'll try one more time.

You'd end up going home with a sense of failure, so for you all, I'll try one more time.

I understand ya.

374
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,980
That was part of our conversation.
