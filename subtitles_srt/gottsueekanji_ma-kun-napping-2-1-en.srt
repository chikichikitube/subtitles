Napping 2

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:21,270
*Hamada is dreaming that he is "Toyama
no Kinsan" based on the TV drama

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:21,270
Shitamachi Bugyo, Toyama Saemonnojyo sama is coming.

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,450
Everyone face up!

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,370
Hey, Echizenya.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,700
Do you admit that at the festival of Kajitsu Hachiman Shrine,

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:51,200
you received lots of bribes by taking advantage
of being the festival controller?

9
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,620
No, Obugyo-sama.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,920
It is not true at all.

11
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,420
It is a made-up story by this girl.

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,020
Makun, Makun!

13
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,790
Makun, phone call!

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,790
Phone call!

15
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,190
What!

16
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,320
You got a phone call.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,920
Not now!

18
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,950
Later?

19
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,420
Yes!

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,690
Shall I tell them?

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,890
Shoot, leave!

22
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,990
What! I'm just letting you know!

23
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,140
Close the door!

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,500
Hearing such words from your mouth,
that usually speak to the world,

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,600
I feel pretty ashamed.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,370
So, you are saying...

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,920
that you have no connection to this matter, is that correct?

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,420
That's correct.

29
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:49,140
By the way, I heard this girl's father, Tomekichi,
was financially in trouble.

30
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,470
Isn't it Tomekichi that was receiving the bribes?

31
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,640
No, it is not true, Obugyo-sama.

32
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,100
My father was deceived by Echigoya..

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,040
What is it?

34
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,140
The festival controller..

35
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,470
Are you still reading such a thing?!

36
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,740
Study instead!

37
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,220
What the hell!

38
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,390
All you read are these magazines, so

39
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,120
No wonder your grades are getting better and better!

40
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,550
Such magazines, huh!

41
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,690
Get out!

42
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,690
And you guys better go home!

43
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,770
Echigoya..

44
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,770
It's getting late.

45
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,840
Shut up!

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,470
What?

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,870
I'm gonna kill you!

48
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,700
Go to bed!

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,300
OK!

50
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,000
After the festival, he got stabbed and died!

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,870
Oh, that's too bad!

52
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,140
You are lying!

53
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,400
Hm?

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,670
She is just making up the story. There is no evidence!

55
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,790
Come to think about it, Obugyo-sama...On that night...

56
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,790
What are you doing?!

57
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,790
Go to sleep already!

58
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,490
Electricity is not free!

59
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,250
I know, stupid! Don't turn it off!

60
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,750
What are you guy doing?

61
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,290
Be quiet!

62
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,220
Obugyo-sama.

63
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,370
Someone called..

64
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:51,990
Hm.

65
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,390
"Play boy Kinsan" helped us.

66
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,000
Who is Kinsan?

67
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,870
So, I think Kinsan knows everything.

68
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,870
Then, you better ask Kinsan to help you with your homework!

69
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,870
Ask him!

70
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,720
So both your tutor and Kinsan can help you.

71
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,320
What do you think about this?

72
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,790
So I would like you to call Kinsan here.

73
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,750
Call him then.

74
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,050
That's..

75
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,290
Call him!

76
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,220
You call him then!

77
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,490
You leave! What a bother..

78
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,370
What are you saying?

79
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,370
We need Kinsan, and you should just shut up.

80
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:33,900
What..

81
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,900
You really need to leave!

82
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
You shouldn't talk like that..

83
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,840
You go!

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,590
That's OK. Your mama just wants to join!

85
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,720
You go!

86
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,540
Itao-san, you're handsome, huh.

87
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,950
Want some rice balls?

88
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,420
No need!

89
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,250
Sit down and shut up!

90
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,920
OK, I'll zip my mouth..

91
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,790
Obugyo-sama...

92
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,120
Hm?

93
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:06,400
Seems I don't need to be here since Kinsan is not here.

94
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,270
So, I will be leaving.

95
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,870
Hey hey hey hey!

96
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,520
From what I hear, you're just saying whatever you want.

97
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,440
What are you saying?

98
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,890
If you want to see Kinsan so much,

99
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,390
Hm.

100
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,390
I'll let you see him!

101
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,950
Can't you just see...

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,650
this..

103
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,390
Sakura shower!

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
What are you doing to your body!

105
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,470
What are you doing!?

106
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,970
You..your mama told you never to do that!

107
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,840
Look at your body!

108
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,540
Your dad will be pissed off!

109
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,370
I will put you..

110
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,340
Oh my god!

111
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,940
Haritsukegokumon!

112
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,040
*Haritsukegokumon - Punishment
by being nailed to a wooden plank

113
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,220
You can't do such a thing!

114
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,650
Take him away!

115
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,690
No way!

116
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,890
You..where are you going?!

117
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,890
Is that all OK now?

118
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,890
Not OK at all!
- Thank you very much.

119
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,970
What..what have you done..

120
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,240
And with that, the case is closed!

121
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,770
Like a Yakuza punk!

122
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
What are you doing?

123
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,100
Nothing.

124
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,100
Get away!

125
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,520
That's fine. We used to sleep together like this..

126
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,090
Stop it. It's disgusting!

127
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,520
Nothing wrong to hold my son!

128
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,490
Disgusting! Get away!

129
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,490
What is so disgusting?

130
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,450
Are you stupid?

131
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,520
If I didn't exist, neither do you!

132
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,290
What are you talking about?

133
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:34,850
What?

134
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,050
Cook something, hurry!

135
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,120
Cook something? I want to sleep with you now!

136
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,290
You stink!

137
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:41,990
Not at all.

138
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,240
If I stink, you stink too!

139
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,370
What? You are not making any sense!

140
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,170
You were born from my stinky part!

141
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,540
No one is talking about it, stupid!

142
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
What are you saying!

143
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,320
Cook something, hurry!

144
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,690
OK, OK, zip your mouth!

145
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,190
Nonsense!
