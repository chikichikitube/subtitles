00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:08,340
First ever, Gaki no tsukai ya arahende episode 8 Absolutely Tasty Hot pot

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,960
Matsumoto-san, episode 8?

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,180
Episode 8, according to the season, it is for hot pot

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,580
That's right

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,630
New idea

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,030
New idea has been coming out, example the Maneli hot pot

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,560
We can do it

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,430
The reward is good

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,620
If it's good, why nobody did it?

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,580
Heck i know

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,150
Let's begin

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,900
Top batter is Tanaka, the hot pot of his idea is?

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,670
It's Okinawa hot pot

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,680
Everything is Okinawa's

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,600
Surprisingly there is no hot pot fit the Okinawa image

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,960
Hot

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,870
And cold

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,500
Obviously from the point of health, the ingredient contains lots of nutrients

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,230
This is hot water

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,230
This is salt from Okinawa to give the distinct taste of Okinawa

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,010
There is a lot of mineral

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,360
Of course there is lots of mineral but what we care is the taste

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,290
There is no taste Tanaka

24
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,830
Put in everything

25
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,120
Everything

26
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,670
The pork and other ingredient will give the taste

27
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,120
That's right

28
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,090
I'm not sure about the taste

29
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,620
Here is Orion beer

30
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,120
1 can?

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,150
1 whole can

32
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,190
Whole can

33
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,100
Then mix it

34
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,110
Seriously?

35
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,140
The alcohol will be cooked

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,930
I see

37
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,720
Ocean taste

38
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,760
Then next

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,660
Ocean taste bad

40
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,510
That's worst

41
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Next is Endo, The hot pot he wanted to try?

42
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,790
Everyone ate French cuisine before?

43
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,570
French cuisine is luxurious

44
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,370
Eating French cuisine always take a long time

45
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,780
So this time i bring this

46
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,540
French cuisine full course Hot pot

47
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,290
It will take a short time to eat

48
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,210
It's fun

49
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,060
It looks bad

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,840
Don't tell me this is dessert?

51
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,800
Is it?

52
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,610
It is

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,310
Dessert too?

54
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,790
For French cuisine there is Consomme

55
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,000
This is delicious

56
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,020
This is delicious

57
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,160
Is this right?

58
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,660
It is

59
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,500
Veggie and meat

60
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,640
It smells nice

61
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,690
This is the one,

62
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,390
It's the bad one

63
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,950
Stop~~

64
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,610
Stop

65
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,280
Without this one i think it will work

66
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,170
This is a must

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,380
That is bad

68
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,980
I wanted to try full course

69
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,670
Together they become tastier

70
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,460
Are you really sure it's okay?

71
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,180
Next is Yamazaki, what kind of ingredient is he using to challenge Endo?

72
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,970
If Endo is going for French

73
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,520
I am going for America

74
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,060
Amazing

75
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,000
This is fun

76
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,680
This is

77
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,870
Fine

78
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,890
This

79
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,380
Soup

80
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,080
Coke

81
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,470
Coke

82
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,030
It's coke?

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,840
So America

84
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,220
Soup?

85
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,840
This is the soup

86
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,250
That is what we drink?

87
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,040
Lots of fats

88
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,120
The fats cooked with the coke

89
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
The carbonic acid will break it down

90
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,070
This is dangerous

91
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,410
It's coke right?

92
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,940
I want to eat it just like this

93
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,760
Can i pour it together?

94
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,870
Take it like this

95
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,060
Okay, see

96
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,600
Japan 2-sword style

97
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,350
2-sword style

98
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,210
Dangerous

99
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,580
This is dangerous

100
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,500
This is absolutely delicious

101
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,030
They are drinking

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,910
They can do it

103
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,440
Amazing

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,660
I'm interested

105
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,100
Next is Hamada who bring his Hometown ingredients

106
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,080
Osaka

107
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,610
This is the mark

108
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,770
This is

109
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,670
Image of Osaka

110
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,180
Again?

111
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,500
This is something that i want to avoid

112
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,230
The soup is the usual

113
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,780
Bonito Soup

114
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,360
In this..

115
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,460
I don't know what it taste now

116
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,300
For real?

117
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,530
You liking this much is amazing

118
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,110
Then it's this

119
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,490
Okonomiyaki

120
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,420
1st is Okonomiyaki

121
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,750
Wait, this..

122
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,040
The smell is not bad

123
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,980
Yeah, the smell

124
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,800
The smell not bad

125
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,370
Takoyaki

126
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,860
If we can finish this one, we will include rice

127
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,860
At the same time?

128
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,860
It will taste like brackish water

129
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,010
Wait, this looks delicious

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,180
Last is Matsumoto, what kind of Hot Pot will he bring?

131
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,030
I am thinking of something fresh

132
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,640
It's salad Hot Pot

133
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,490
Salad Hot Pot

134
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,550
All is veggie

135
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,810
All is veggie and this is Bonito soup

136
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,720
In this..

137
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,930
Everything will be veggie

138
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,130
I am making a serious face

139
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,960
Face expression don't matter

140
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
Amazing

141
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,660
I see

142
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,700
Because it don't have much taste

143
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,040
Wait, it's not Hamada's sauce here..

144
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,000
Mayonnaise

145
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,150
It's too much

146
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,370
It's okay

147
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,810
Healthy-themed

148
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
This is seriously tasty

149
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,010
For real?

150
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,140
It's still not done

151
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,820
There is finishing touch

152
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,660
I see

153
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,790
I always have extra ingredient

154
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,620
There is extra

155
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,010
Producer told me to do it

156
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,740
Don't lie

157
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,100
After we finish ours, it will be reveal then

158
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,360
Let's eat

159
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,270
First is Okinawa Hot Pot

160
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,270
Let's start, open

161
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,100
It's here

162
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,010
How is the appearance

163
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,990
First look, it's delicious

164
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,700
It's Hot Pot

165
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,970
It looks extremely good

166
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,170
This is Hot Pot

167
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,070
This is, how you say it?

168
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,950
Pork soup

169
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,230
This is surely the taste is good

170
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,810
This is absolutely delicious

171
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,290
However there is no Bonito taste

172
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,480
Lacking taste

173
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,080
The pig or whatever, the broth is in the soup now

174
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,660
There is only salt for flavor

175
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,990
How is the soup

176
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,020
The soup is ridiculously delicious

177
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,020
Seriously

178
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,130
The taste is there

179
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,510
Shut up

180
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,530
All the taste is there

181
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,100
Good

182
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
It has a very subtle taste

183
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,620
Ain't it?

184
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,000
This is not bad

185
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,150
It has a similarity to normal hot pot

186
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,250
The soup is

187
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,250
Make you liking it more and more

188
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,850
Lacking something

189
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,520
For the lack of taste, i am thinking of using

190
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,590
Sima Togarashi

191
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,750
Put just a drop

192
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,960
Enhance taste?

193
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,360
I like this

194
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,900
Just a bit

195
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,940
Delicious

196
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,650
This is delicious, you try this

197
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,210
You put this in, it become super delicious

198
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,740
A little spicy

199
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,190
Delicious

200
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,700
Very tasty

201
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,340
Delicious

202
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,480
This is delicious

203
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,090
How many point for this?

204
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,920
This one is good

205
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,580
I will give it a 4

206
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,390
I see

207
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,180
It's not I see

208
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,090
Only perfect score can satisfy this one, after you guys saying delicious all over

209
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,770
9 or 10 is fine right?

210
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,150
9 or 10

211
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,090
9 or 10?

212
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,100
It fits this right?

213
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,910
I think 7 is fine

214
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,540
Then 7 is fine

215
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,540
Se-.. I see, it's still first one

216
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,920
So for the first one

217
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,230
7

218
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,210
Taste like the usual Hot Pot, receive 7

219
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,850
Next is Endo with his mixed dessert French style Hot Pot

220
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,850
French cuisine takes time

221
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,320
This one is dangerous

222
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,770
This one is kinda messed up

223
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,060
This one please enjoy it everyone, Open

224
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,570
Is it okay?

225
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,700
What the heck

226
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,700
This is not good

227
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,520
This is bad

228
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
The cost is high right?

229
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,700
Yeah it's high

230
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,090
Around 10000 yen

231
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,960
You are using wine glass as container?

232
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,110
Obviously, this

233
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,320
Wine glass is essential for French cuisine

234
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,000
Seriously?

235
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,470
For real?

236
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,650
Then for Hamada

237
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,630
You should just put in meat

238
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,050
For being special, i will give you the dessert

239
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,380
I don't want!

240
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,460
Hamada like it a lot

241
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,060
He is fooling around

242
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,190
This is messed up

243
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,920
Is this okay?

244
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,010
I am serious

245
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,360
What taste will it be

246
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
The appearance is the worst

247
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,000
Delicious

248
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,930
Um, delicious

249
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,460
It was because there is no dessert in yours

250
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,320
Delicious

251
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,210
How is the dessert

252
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,610
Tasty

253
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,290
The meat and fish is very delicious

254
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,360
Delicious

255
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,200
Delicious

256
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,670
Delicious

257
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,130
Tasty

258
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,100
Endo, this is delicious

259
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,950
Even though it looks bad but it is delicious right?

260
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,470
Delicious

261
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,030
I still prefer to eat my full course the usual way

262
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,420
How is it?

263
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,890
This is completely 4 right?

264
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,070
Seriously?

265
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,000
Completely 4, completely

266
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,550
Around the region of 4

267
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,840
Around 4

268
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,070
We say it's delicious, however it is still not THAT delicious

269
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,690
That's right

270
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,020
The same as always

271
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,650
Endo

272
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,070
Why attack you junior

273
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,450
This is 4

274
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,030
With the worse appearance however still taste good full course hot pot, 4 point

275
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,900
Next is Yamazaki's USA hot pot, with coke as the soup

276
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,690
Let's start

277
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,450
Let's see

278
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,500
Bad

279
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,980
It float

280
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,770
Looks like Oden

281
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,870
Is this all right to use the name America for this thing

282
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,890
It stink

283
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,030
The smell

284
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,430
This is bad

285
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,490
The smell is bad

286
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,090
What did you make

287
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,990
This is the best mascot for making enemies out of America

288
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,200
Wasn't the word stop fooling around came out from your mouth?

289
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,560
What is it?

290
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,550
It looks the like the same as the previous one

291
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,550
He is fooling around

292
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,160
The soup color is fine

293
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,840
True

294
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,060
True. It looks like Tempura Udon

295
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,010
If the taste is not enough we have ketchup and mustard

296
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,240
To begin with I don't like this

297
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,800
If it's not enough you say?

298
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,420
Just put it for people who like it

299
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,690
The soup looks good, but

300
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,940
Let's eat

301
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,890
Terrible

302
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,680
Terrible

303
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,520
This is scary

304
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,610
Wait, wait, don't say that before tasting it properly

305
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,610
Wait, this is delicious

306
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,450
It's bad, the first mouthful already bad

307
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,820
Wait, eat it properly

308
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,790
Terrible

309
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,670
You didn't eat it

310
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,220
This is terrible

311
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,700
Bad, bad, bad

312
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,200
Wait, i don't want this

313
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,810
We said it's bad

314
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,690
I don't want this

315
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,430
Why don't you eat it?

316
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,410
Yamachan, this is bad

317
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,410
This is bad, this is total failure

318
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,620
This is total failure

319
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,660
Sweet

320
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,980
Ah, but maybe

321
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,710
Yamachan, try it

322
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,130
Wait, stop it already. Stop it

323
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,180
It's too much

324
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,180
It's fine

325
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,180
Why are you being so gay

326
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,950
There is no problem at all

327
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,060
Looks good

328
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,300
It's spicy

329
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,300
You are noisy

330
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,880
Why are you suddenly being such a wuss

331
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,860
Both looks and smell bad, USA hot pot get Dokuro*

332
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,860
Dangerous mark

333
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,580
Next is Hamada who wan born Kansai, he make an Osaka Hot pot

334
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,050
Then let's begin, open

335
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:52,440
Hamada's Kansai idea, how will it taste?

336
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,660
Hamada unforgettable Hot Pot, what will it taste like?

337
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,930
Okay let's begin, Open

338
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,530
It doesn't look bad

339
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,510
Is it okay?

340
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,700
The sauce can even mix with the rice and it will taste fantastic

341
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,490
Osakan

342
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,400
Kansai people

343
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,070
Hamada actually I am not that

344
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,600
You mix it

345
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,300
The yakisoba still maintain strain by strain

346
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,700
Let's eat

347
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,030
Together with rice this is very simple

348
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,040
This is confusing

349
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,420
What the heck is this

350
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,750
This is

351
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,220
Surely

352
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,030
There is no solidity

353
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,640
The noodle is too soft

354
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,930
We can't bite it

355
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:58,060
Although with that reason, inside me i said, delicious

356
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,960
It's truly delicious

357
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,620
Delicious, i like this

358
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,260
Have you tried the Takoyaki?

359
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,540
Yes, delicious

360
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,800
This is not bad

361
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,340
Would it be better if we add pepper?

362
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,540
I don't really know

363
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,390
Would it be better if adding pepper into it?

364
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,750
after i add the pepper, it just power-up

365
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,750
Adding pepper make it extremely good

366
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,660
Delicious

367
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,750
Delicious

368
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,880
Too delicious

369
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,600
Not just delicious but too delicious

370
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,200
It's extremely delicious

371
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,340
I am shocked

372
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,870
Everyone, how many point?

373
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,650
Right, how many point will you give?

374
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,350
It's troublesome

375
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,710
That's right

376
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,450
Although it wasn't that good at first but it deserves 10 right?

377
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,450
In any case, it's 10

378
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,610
It's 8

379
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,090
Let's make it 8

380
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,830
Although i have no right to say, but i say 10~~

381
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,010
Endo say 10

382
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,690
This deserve 10 right?

383
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,400
I will give it full point

384
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,560
Full point

385
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,530
Let Yamazaki decide

386
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,600
Then it is near 6

387
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,060
What the heck, WHAT THE HECK!

388
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,540
Too strict

389
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,060
Everyone is praising it so highly, so why is it 6

390
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,480
Because Yamazaki have a good taste, what he said is true

391
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,760
What the heck

392
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,400
What the heck? 6?

393
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,560
Yes, it's final

394
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,720
Sharing the same fate as Cocorico's creation, Osaka Hot Pot get 6 point

395
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,510
Next is Matsumoto's salad Hot Pot, what is the unique way of eating?

396
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,400
Let's see this, Don

397
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,830
What's this

398
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,270
I see

399
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,550
It's mayonnaise

400
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,930
It's mayonnaise?

401
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,660
It will come out like this

402
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,390
It looks healthy

403
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,070
It has an interesting smell

404
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,010
Ain't it?

405
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,700
Why eat hot salad?

406
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,550
I am still not done

407
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,280
Bring that over

408
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,980
Ice?

409
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,880
Because it's salad, i will prefer to eat it cold

410
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,740
This is salad Hot Pot core

411
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,320
But it's HOT pot, wouldn't it be okay to eat it hot?

412
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,780
What the heck?

413
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,560
So, i just put in the ice

414
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,850
Now eat it

415
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,850
Why the heck

416
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,880
You are just fooling around

417
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,100
Fooling around is the thing i hate the most

418
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,680
Danger, danger, it's not like that, what are we talking about

419
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,370
Let's eat

420
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,160
Don't stir

421
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,170
This is originally..

422
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,000
It looks so plain

423
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:55,120
Originally the soup is from Bonito, so it is fine

424
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,530
Wouldn't it be plain?

425
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,080
There is too much water

426
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,030
Asparagus?

427
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,740
It's asparagus

428
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,820
There is no taste at all

429
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,670
Not even a taste

430
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,540
Just as i thought

431
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,070
Not a slight taste

432
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,020
I actually has thought about this

433
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,780
That one..

434
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,700
What? what?

435
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,940
Sauce to dip

436
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,030
You have sauce?

437
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,760
Dressing

438
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,780
Like my secret weapon

439
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,140
I see

440
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,900
Mix it well then eat it together with the salad

441
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,420
This is..

442
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,760
acceptable

443
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,620
Right?

444
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,630
Try it

445
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,190
With the sauce it's fine

446
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,220
Right

447
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,560
Delicious

448
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,450
Why you didn't bring this out

449
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,260
Why you make this into Hot Pot?

450
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,380
True

451
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,640
First of all, it's edible

452
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,910
It is fine

453
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,680
The taste not strong enough

454
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,000
The mayonnaise didn't contribute much

455
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,870
Not a hint

456
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,650
How's this

457
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,590
How is it?

458
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,500
2

459
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,320
I see

460
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,690
I am also thinking of 1 or 2

461
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,120
I think Dokuro

462
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,860
I think 2

463
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,220
Dokuro too

464
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,320
I am truthfully, this is

465
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,510
This is just experiment, I have another one

466
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,580
I don't really care whether it's Dokuro,1 or 2

467
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,220
Is that so?

468
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,130
My main is next

469
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,620
Because it is still edible, 2 then

470
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,710
Far from the actual Hot Pot, Salad Hot Pot receive 2

471
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,700
What is Matsumoto's Main Ingredient?

472
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,050
Let's look at the ingredient, it's so called Healthy Hot Pot

473
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:47,790
Healthy hot pot?

474
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,250
What the heck did you bring

475
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,480
This is seriously..

476
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,480
This time is amazing

477
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,770
This is expensive

478
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,770
Cobra

479
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,520
Cobra?

480
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,400
What's this?

481
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,300
This is that one..

482
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,890
Deer's testicle

483
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,860
Testicle?

484
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,350
It stink!

485
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,830
What smell is this

486
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,190
What is this smell

487
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,990
What makes it so stink

488
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,600
It's the smell of testicle, it is still not clean

489
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,260
Dirty

490
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,790
I WILL not eat it!

491
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,830
It's fine right?

492
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,700
I WILL not eat it!

493
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,820
Everything here is exotic ingredient

494
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,470
How will it taste

495
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,580
Everything is exotic

496
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,470
True

497
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:42,600
After that, to add meat inside, i will use eel, this is amazing

498
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,120
After you eat this you will be..

499
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,650
You will become a nerd

500
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,590
Exotic ingredient is used, in this exotic Hot Pot, how will it taste?

501
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,150
It smells okay right?

502
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,970
You put in, leek

503
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,150
Leek is in there

504
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,630
If you eat this, you will be full of energy

505
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,730
For real? How you know?

506
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,370
The day to eat this will be Saturday

507
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,780
Normally it will be one day too

508
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,140
Eating this day by day

509
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,070
This is a big piece form the turtle

510
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,960
What the heck is that

511
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,620
Recently Tanaka

512
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,490
has been very hardworking so his portion will be big

513
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,270
Collagen

514
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,850
We cannot take the cobra

515
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:48,790
We will get the cobra later, now let's just eat what's in our bowl

516
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,610
I think Vacuum Fujiwara would like to eat it

517
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,450
He will eat it like a delight

518
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,800
It will be our first time watching someone eat rice with these

519
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,480
Bring the condiment

520
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,200
Young ginseng and

521
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,410
Don't need this

522
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,780
Do this

523
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,850
Stop, stop, stop it, it's bitter

524
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:18,540
Are you a kid? Stop because it's bitter

525
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,510
What's this?

526
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,490
Shredded ginger

527
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,100
To remove stench

528
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,160
It also has the function to remove stench

529
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,610
Because it stink though

530
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,450
The main purpose is just to remove the stench

531
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,300
Wa- What are you doing

532
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,420
What we doing?

533
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,640
Seriously what are you doing? It looks like cigarette lighter

534
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,220
Let's eat

535
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,990
This time round let's just drink

536
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,690
Strange taste

537
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,150
What's this

538
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,830
It just spread around mouth

539
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,160
True, it just go "GAH" inside the mouth

540
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,750
True

541
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,990
It goes "GAH"

542
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,790
This is the characteristic

543
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,420
Amazing

544
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,050
You must treat this seriously

545
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,070
Amazing

546
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,900
Tomorrow you wake up your **** will be up

547
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,630
I don't want anymore

548
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,760
True, i don't want it to be up

549
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,970
Stop saying such disgusting stuff

550
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,970
Why?

551
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,550
Amazing

552
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,550
It's not something bad though

553
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,810
Amazing this one goes "Gah"

554
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,820
Please eat that, it's head

555
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,560
It's damn tough

556
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:48,650
Stay tune, eating champion Vacuum Fujiwara

557
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,820
Is it okay? Vacuum

558
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,820
Please

559
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,410
We prepared rice for Vacuum

560
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,380
Good day to you

561
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,870
Go with this one?

562
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,350
The soft texture

563
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,510
Collagen too

564
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,980
Collagen only

565
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,530
This one is soft

566
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,060
It's soft right?

567
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,880
It's soft, can i get a bowl of rice?

568
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,650
I knew it will be like that

569
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,340
With rice he can eat anything

570
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,320
Maybe collagen is a good side dish

571
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,590
Amazing

572
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,890
The best way to eat collagen is with rice

573
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,630
It looks good, the collagen is delicious right?

574
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,290
You being able to eat collagen with rice, what are you?

575
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,430
In actual truth you cannot eat it

576
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,830
Because of courage
