Kumazawa Edition!

9
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,250
You were so quiet!
Kumazawa Edition!

10
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,190
You were so quiet!

11
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,650
I could only hear the part about 'strolling'.

12
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,760
I couldn't hear anything else.

13
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,820
I can't yell at a place like this.

14
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,670
So, where are we? What park is this?

15
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,430
It's Kumazawa Park!
So, where are we? What park is this?

16
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:20,880
It's Kumazawa Park!

17
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,730
Ah, right...

18
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,370
Matsumoto look.
Daikanyama, Nakameguro, Jiyugaoka, Sangenjaya, and this is our fifth time.
Ah, right...

19
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,990
Matsumoto look.
Daikanyama, Nakameguro, Jiyugaoka, Sangenjaya, and this is our fifth time.

20
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:27,670
-Yes!
-Our fifth time!

21
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,340
This program was filmed at Sangenjaya last time.

22
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,660
They had had many tip offs so the guys thought it would be very easy...

23
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,330
But the search proved harder than expected.

24
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,030
However, 1 hour 52 minutes after the start...

25
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,170
They finally found Kato from Zabungle returning from a grocery run!

26
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,500
They immediately barged in at his home!

27
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:59,200
And now, the guys have arrived at Setagaya Ward's Komazawa district!

28
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,740
With places such as the Komazawa University and the Komazawa Olympic Park,

29
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,360
this commuter town is full of greenery and is extremely popular with the celebrities.

30
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:13,990
They have received plenty of tip offs this time too, and they cannot go home until they run into a celebrity.
The hellish challenge starts now!

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,100
This one's gonna be a tough one, I think...

32
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,760
-You're totally right.
-It's gonna be hard...

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,480
We're not in the city center, you know?

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,090
Right.
We're not in the city center, you know?

35
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:21,430
It's just a residential area.
Right.
We're not in the city center, you know?

36
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:21,490
We're not in the city center, you know?
It's just a residential area.

37
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,090
It's just a residential area.

38
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,780
I have to say this, but Endo is running a fever again...

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:27,950
He's got a weak body!

40
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,740
I'm so sorry.
He's got a weak body!

41
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,950
I'm so sorry.

42
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,460
It happens pretty often, doesn't it?

43
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:31,480
But I must say, I haven't gotten a fever since Takeshi Endo's Extreme Challenge.
It happens pretty often, doesn't it?

44
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,140
But I must say, I haven't gotten a fever since Takeshi Endo's Extreme Challenge.

45
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:34,800
For real.

46
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:35,930
Well, you did have to go down those water slides over and over again.
And you were in tighty-whities.

47
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,930
It's been 4 years!
Well, you did have to go down those water slides over and over again.
And you were in tighty-whities.

48
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,200
Well, you did have to go down those water slides over and over again.
And you were in tighty-whities.

49
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:40,470
4 years since then.

50
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,380
I can't believe you had a cold and you still did that!
4 years since then.

51
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,070
I can't believe you had a cold and you still did that!

52
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,820
It's gonna be a long one today.

53
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,460
We have to try really hard today!

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,780
So, do any of you know the area?

55
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,870
No, not at all.

56
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,720
This area is mostly filled with homes.
No, not at all.

57
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,710
This area is mostly filled with homes.

58
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,060
Well, yeah...
This area is mostly filled with homes.

59
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,070
Well, yeah...

60
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,860
But I do hear some rumors of famous people running in this area.

61
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,550
Oh, right, right.

62
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,840
Arthur Kuroda must be running around here somewhere.

63
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,950
That would be awesome!

64
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,120
Meeting Arthur Kuroda would be perfect.
That would be awesome!

65
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,070
Meeting Arthur Kuroda would be perfect.

66
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,390
It would be awesome!
Meeting Arthur Kuroda would be perfect.

67
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,190
It would be awesome!

68
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,560
It would be perfect.
It would be awesome!

69
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,570
It would be perfect.

70
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:06,950
Yes, perfect.

71
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,210
We have to find Arthur Kuroda.
Yes, perfect.

72
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,900
We have to find Arthur Kuroda.

73
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,190
Perfect?
We have to find Arthur Kuroda.

74
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,640
Perfect?

75
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,560
Let's stroll around until we find a celebrity!
Komazawa Edition!

76
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,410
These are the rules:

77
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
The shoot won't end until we meet a celebrity.

78
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,570
However, all members must know the celebrity's name.

79
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,610
And naturally, we also need filming consent from their respective agencies.

80
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,220
Now, will the guys find any celebrities in Komazawa?!

81
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,130
Ah!

82
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,740
Eh?

83
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,100
Doesn't she look like someone?

84
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,710
It's Sachiyo Nomura!

Doesn't she look like someone?

85
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,940
It's Sachiyo Nomura!

86
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,990
Sachiyo Nomura?

87
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
It's Sacchi!

88
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,400
Her home is not that far away from here.

89
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,550
It's definitely not her.
Her home is not that far away from here.

90
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,190
It's definitely not her.

91
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:56,970
Yeah.

92
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,040
She would even give us a glance.

93
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,170
That's amazing.

94
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,350
Alright, let's get going!

95
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,370
Let's go!

96
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:03,650
Let's walk to the center of the park.
Let's go!

97
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,370
Let's walk to the center of the park.

98
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,590
To the center?

99
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,920
We have to check out all the walkers.

100
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,060
It's time for a little stroll.

101
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,290
-Endo!
-Yes?

102
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,620
-Ah, should I put it on?
-Oh, a mask.

103
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,920
I should.
But there's not a lot of pollen around.

104
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,560
It's not for that, it's for your fever!
We don't want your bugs!

105
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,520
Endo has a weak body...

106
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,630
And Hamada is no good either. He gets sick all the time.

107
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,170
This guy is also out.

108
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,850
You think so?

109
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,680
I'm actually pretty resilient.

110
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,250
Right, surprisingly so.
I'm actually pretty resilient.

111
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,930
Right, surprisingly so.

112
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,370
Tanaka and I are pretty resilient.

113
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,220
I almost never get sick, do I?

114
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,200
But what about the other day..?

115
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,410
I get sick, but I always hide it!!
But what about the other day..?

116
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,060
I get sick, but I always hide it!!

117
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,650
-He's shouting again...
-Even I can't be healthy all the time!!

118
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,510
Too loud...

119
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,850
You're too loud, we don't know what you're saying.

120
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,630
But you've already skipped one episode of this series!

121
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:51,960
That's right.
But you've already skipped one episode of this series!

122
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,560
That's right.

123
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,330
It's true!

124
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,100
It's only natural!!

125
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,440
The guys have decided to explore Komazawa Park first.

126
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,170
Why are we taking a stroll inside the park?

127
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,110
Well, we wanted to see if anyone famous was taking a stroll or on a run.

128
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,570
Personally, I think it would have been better if we went straight to the shops...
Well, we wanted to see if anyone famous was taking a stroll or on a run.

129
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,880
Personally, I think it would have been better if we went straight to the shops...

130
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,390
Actually I might be better if we went that way.

131
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,550
That way?

132
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,930
I mean, it doesn't really matter which way.
There's no right answer here.

133
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,700
Right...

134
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,630
Guided by the crew, the guys head towards the racetrack within the park.

135
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,890
We can't be going this way.

136
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,070
We can't go this way, for real!
We can't be going this way.

137
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,070
We can't go this way, for real!

138
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,200
Then, the guys spot a bunch of students after their training session.

139
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,530
Nothing good ever comes out of Komu's mouth.

140
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,070
You can do it!

141
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:42,920
Komurasaki...

142
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,770
We'll be at Komazawa street if we head down this street.

143
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,410
Komazawa street?

144
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,630
This is where you get mobbed and thrown into the air.

145
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,830
No way...

146
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,070
There's no way.

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,790
But you know, I have been thrown into the air way back then.

148
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,500
That's scary!

149
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,230
I was at a Karaoke place, so I went to the bathroom and ran into some students in the hallway.
That's scary!

150
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,090
I was at a Karaoke place, so I went to the bathroom and ran into some students in the hallway.

151
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,060
And they just lifted me up, in the middle of the hall.

152
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
That's the worst.

153
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,610
Yeah, but all I could do was laugh.
That's the worst.

154
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,470
Yeah, but all I could do was laugh.

155
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,670
You can't do anything, right?

156
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,730
Have you guys seen any celebs around?

157
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,600
Someone running around? No?

158
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,930
I guess it's useless to ask as a celebrity myself.

159
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,950
They're high school students.

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,300
They're high school students.

161
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,810
I bet these guys must have the hardest morning wood.

162
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,230
Hard?

163
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,600
You think so?

164
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,990
These guys are rock hard every morning.

165
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,940
Do you get morning wood?

166
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,010
Don't actually ask them!!

167
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,970
They're shy.

168
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,020
-They're still teenagers!
-What the hell are you asking?!

169
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,960
That boy's ears turned beet red.

170
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,500
They were super red.

171
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,870
Why would you ever ask something like that?

172
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,800
For real...

173
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,690
Whoa this park is huge.

174
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,800
Oh, a Chow Chow!

175
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,210
It's a Chow Chow!

176
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,630
They get along so well.

177
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,850
Have you seen any famous people on your walk today?

178
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Are you guys looking for celebrities?

179
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,000
Unfortunately not today.

180
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,410
-By the way, who have you seen around here?
-Yes, in the past.

181
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,740
We always see the Eita and his wife.
(Eita Nagayama & Kaela Kimura)

182
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Eita and his wife?

183
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,530
Kaela?

184
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,430
Yes, yes, yes.

185
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,000
-Right...
-They are always with their children.

186
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,310
I've also seen Shinji Yamashita walking around.

187
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:12,930
-That's great!
-Meeting Shinji Yamashita would be amazing!
I've also seen Shinji Yamashita walking around.

188
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,050
-That's great!
-Meeting Shinji Yamashita would be amazing!

189
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,510
He would be perfect!
-That's great!
-Meeting Shinji Yamashita would be amazing!

190
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,860
He would be perfect!

191
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

192
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:18,770
Thanks!

193
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,340
Shinji Yamashita, huh?

194
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:20,600
Shinji Yamashita would be perfect.
Shinji Yamashita, huh?

195
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,770
Shinji Yamashita would be perfect.

196
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,510
He's just the right fit for us.

197
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,570
It's only been 20 minutes since the start of the challenge.

198
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,700
The guys are heading towards the big stairs leading up to Komazawa Park.

199
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,000
There's nothing around here.

200
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,210
Geez!

201
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,560
There's really no one around.
Geez!

202
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,500
There's really no one around.

203
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,380
We're getting farther and farther away from the station so there's less and less people.

204
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,000
Right, they just scatter.
We're getting farther and farther away from the station so there's less and less people.

205
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,230
Right, they just scatter.

206
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:41,550
I see...
Right, they just scatter.

207
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:41,970
I see...

208
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,290
These are the big stairs, right?

209
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,940
Yes, this is the spot.

210
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,470
We're here.

211
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,670
But what now?

212
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,830
I don't think we'll find anything here.

213
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,800
There's no one around!

214
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,540
This is bad.

215
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,740
This is really bad.

216
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,470
That girl looks like she could be a celebrity.

217
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,270
We have to keep a good eye out.

218
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,140
Isn't she an actress?

219
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,020
That must be a script in her bag.

220
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,130
The script for episode 4 or something must be in there.

221
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,960
Episode 4?

222
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,120
-That's a late appearance if you ask me.
-Well, she gets introduced in episode 4.

223
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,540
No, no...

224
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,150
But episode 4 is still a bit too late.

225
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,470
You're right.

226
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,670
Is she gonna be alright?
Will she make the cut?

227
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,830
At this point, the guys give up on the search at the empty park and head towards Komazawa Street.

228
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,000
Once we leave the park, there's nothing around.

229
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,450
This side is also full of apartments.

230
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,880
No one's walking around here.

231
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,500
You're right.

232
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:41,720
I have a feeling we won't find anything.
You're right.

233
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,070
I have a feeling we won't find anything.

234
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,770
Let's cross this street and go to that Ramen Shop and the Lawson.
(Lawson is one of the big convenience store chains)

235
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,030
Let's visit some of those stores.

236
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,330
Let's visit some of those stores.

237
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,930
Let's look into all 3 of those stores.

238
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,170
The guys cross Komazawa Street to peek into the stores.

239
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,820
Go and have a look.
Oh, Endo you go look over there!

240
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,370
Go ahead.

241
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,960
Following Hamada's orders Endo and Tanaka search for celebrities inside the restaurants.

242
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,650
Oh, that's nice.

243
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,020
It was pretty empty.

244
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,890
This place has a line.

245
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,730
Let's have a look at Jojoen.
(High-end Japanese-style BBQ restaurant)

246
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,170
But there is not a trace of celebrity anywhere.

247
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,330
They've just opened, so there were no customers inside.

248
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,230
But they told me they get about 3 groups of celebrities a week.

249
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,000
That's a lot.

250
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,810
-They go into the private rooms, right?
-Yeah, that's why.

251
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,260
Who the hell suggested we come here?

252
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,270
Who was it?

253
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,950
I'll ride him like a pig and beat the crap out of him.

254
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,500
-Who was it?
-Really, who was it?

255
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,070
There's nobody around.
-Who was it?
-Really, who was it?

256
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,730
There's nobody around.

257
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:43,670
Who's idea was it?

258
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,130
I really want to know who it was.

259
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,680
For real, who suggested we come here?

260
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,230
It wasn't a single person, we all decided as a group.
For real, who suggested we come here?

261
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,970
It wasn't a single person, we all decided as a group.

262
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,830
The guys wander around Komazawa with no clear location in mind.

263
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,720
-There's another BBQ place here.

264
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,280
These guys must be Jojoen's competitors.
-There's another BBQ place here.

265
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,580
These guys must be Jojoen's competitors.

266
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,130
But this place is much more reasonable.

267
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,500
-Oh, really?
-Yes.
But this place is much more reasonable.

268
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:07,910
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

269
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,430
-It's a different concept.
-Right.

270
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,690
Whoa, that's amazing.

271
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,750
-You're right, it's so cheap.
-Yeah, look.

272
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,130
They even have half off for elementary school students.
-You're right, it's so cheap.
-Yeah, look.

273
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,300
They even have half off for elementary school students.

274
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,130
Whoa, it's free for old people too.

275
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,930
So, you guys can't afford Jojoen?

276
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,800
It's a bit too expensive?

277
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,830
Is that so? This one's better?

278
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,930
-Are you guys in high school?
-Is it all-you-can-eat?

279
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,230
-Oh, I see...
-It's an all-you-can-eat!

280
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
'The kings of BBQ'.

281
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,700
Whoa, amazing.

282
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,740
I bet those kids would be so happy if Hamada treated them to some Jojoen.

283
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,130
Of course they would.

284
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,740
Go ahead.

285
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,270
Tons of good rumors would start spreading about you.
Go ahead.

286
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,970
Tons of good rumors would start spreading about you.

287
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,370
You're the one that approached them!

288
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,380
You're the one that went: "Let's go".

289
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,970
You should have said something like: "Instead of waiting in line, I'll treat you to some Jojoen."

290
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,190
But saying something like that is pretty hard.

291
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,700
I mean, yeah.

292
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,760
Then why didn't you say it then?

293
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,900
You had the perfect opportunity right there.

294
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:05,520
Right?

295
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,200
I mean, I have no personal attachment to those guys.

296
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,270
And there he goes.

297
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,590
He said it.

298
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,910
At that moment, Hosei spots something!

299
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,970
There's a masked girl running towards us.

300
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,570
That could be it.

301
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,360
We won't let you run away.

302
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,040
This time we won't let you run away.

303
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,530
A girl hiding her face with a mask has appeared!

304
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,230
Hello.

305
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:33,830
Hello.

306
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,340
Have they finally found their celebrity?
Hello.

307
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,330
Have they finally found their celebrity?

308
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,090
You're a celebrity, are you not?

309
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,040
There's a masked girl running towards us.

310
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,300
We won't let you run away.

311
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
This time we won't let you run away.

312
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,780
We won't let you get away.

313
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,960
She looked a bit suspicious.

314
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,230
Hello.

315
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,010
Hello.

316
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,900
Excuse me, you're a celebrity...

317
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,270
You're a celebrity, right?

318
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,130
You're not?

319
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,980
You're not a celebrity?

320
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,020
I just don't want to get sunburn, that's why I'm wearing a mask.

321
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,290
-Oh, she doesn't want to get sunburned.
-I see.

322
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,770
-Sorry to bother you.
-Sorry about that.

323
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:07,810
What'd she say?

324
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,090
She's wearing a mask because she doesn't want to get sunburnt.

325
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,670
I thought we'd definitely found someone.

326
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,400
-Right?
-Right?

327
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,400
She had the right vibe.

328
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,530
Are you a celebrity?

329
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:18,950
No?

330
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,730
Tanaka, you're embarrassing us.

331
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:29,690
It's already been 45 minutes and there is no trace of a celebrity around.

332
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,300
Our path has been cut.

333
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,200
Which way should we go?

334
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,450
What are we gonna do?
Which way should we go?

335
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,080
What are we gonna do?

336
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Let's go that way then.

337
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,570
Sure.

338
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,310
Ehm... Can we go to where people are?

339
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,930
I don't think we should listen to anything Komu has to say.

340
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,490
It's all his fault.

341
00:11:53,590 --> 00:12:00,840
The guys stave off the main street and walk down an empty street towards Komazawa Park.

342
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,900
What time do celebrities go to dinner?

343
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,670
I'd guess around 7.

344
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,430
7?

345
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,070
Yeah.

346
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,250
That's the same as a normal family!

347
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:13,490
At 7?
That's the same as a normal family!

348
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,200
At 7?

349
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,470
Most people have dinner at 7.

350
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,250
Where are we?
Most people have dinner at 7.

351
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,650
Where are we?

352
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,680
-It'll be even earlier if they have kids.
-You're right.

353
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,270
That person's a genius!

354
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,700
This is amazing.

355
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,070
That's really good parking.

356
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,630
Eh? How in the world did they fit that in?
That's really good parking.

357
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,230
Eh? How in the world did they fit that in?

358
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,960
I'm always amazed by people like this.

359
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,740
That's amazing.

360
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,100
but I don't think they've moved it in a while.

361
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,400
This must always be parked here.

362
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,790
Whoa! But look at it! It's crazy!
This must always be parked here.

363
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,490
Whoa! But look at it! It's crazy!

364
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,310
This one's a tough one.

365
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,490
I really wanna know how they did it.
This one's a tough one.

366
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,400
I really wanna know how they did it.

367
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,500
Looks so hard.

368
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,380
Do they go back and forth?

369
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,130
That's crazy.

370
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,400
It's really amazing.

371
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,350
It's 5 o'clock.

372
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,400
Now?

373
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:49,830
Yes.

374
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:50,660
Just now.

375
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,770
Once again, the guys head to Komazawa Street.

376
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,140
There's no one around!

377
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,620
Look, we might find someone at that dog boutique.

378
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,700
Yukina could be there.
(Yukina Fujimoto, Fujimoto Toshifumi's ex-wife)

379
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,000
It looks like a place a celebrity would visit.

380
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,790
I've got a strong feeling.
It looks like a place a celebrity would visit.

381
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,000
I've got a strong feeling.

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,370
-Do you have a feeling?
-Yeah.
I've got a strong feeling.

383
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:11,430
-Do you have a feeling?
-Yeah.

384
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,260
Really?
-Do you have a feeling?
-Yeah.

385
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,570
-Do you have a feeling?
-Yeah.

386
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,230
-Alright, Yama go and have a look.
-Sure.

387
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,440
Chasing a hunch, Hosei enters the dog boutique.

388
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,030
Will there be a celebrity waiting for them?

389
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,250
I think the time frame was not right.

390
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,270
I think they usually come out a bit later.

391
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,000
But it's already 5 o'clock.

392
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,200
Maybe that's just Komazawa.

393
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:32,770
What do you think?

394
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,160
I just wonder who would pick a place like this.

395
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,330
Really?

396
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't know if celebrities actually hand around here.

397
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,880
Hosei comes back after finishing up his search.

398
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,400
No?

399
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,350
No.

400
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,760
There was no one inside.

401
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,950
And they even told me that they've never had a famous customer.

402
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,670
Did they ask, "What is a celebrity?".

403
00:13:59,070 --> 00:13:59,810
They don't go there.

404
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,060
And the dogs were barking at me.

405
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:10,160
Endo, I think you get sick more because you're always naked.

406
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,890
That's why.

407
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,500
Eh?!

408
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:15,670
Eh?!

409
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,110
This is it.

410
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,350
-W-Where?
-Alright, let's record it.

411
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,170
-This is it.
-Let's get some evidence.

412
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,200
He tripped on this.

413
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,480
It's about a 4 cm high step.
He tripped on this.

414
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,670
It's about a 4 cm high step.

415
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:24,910
-What time is it?
-It's 15:05.
It's about a 4 cm high step.

416
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,200
-What time is it?
-It's 15:05.

417
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,060
15:05!

418
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,000
-Understood.
-Alright, the incident happened at 15:05.

419
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,270
And he even tried to play it off.

420
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,330
He tried to act like it never happened.

421
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,540
That's the lamest part.

422
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,070
He tried to play it cool, and I think that's super lame.

423
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,270
I mean, it happens to everyone.

424
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,560
-Right.
-It does, it does.

425
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,930
"Ah!" or something like that.

426
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,470
Or, "Uh... I almost tripped".

427
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,230
But he went like this.

428
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,680
With his poker face.

429
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,380
That's lame.

430
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,670
We have to record this time for posterity!

431
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,740
Not the time he tripped!

432
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,330
But the time he tried to play it cool.

433
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,270
It happened at 17:05.

434
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:03,940
What?

435
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,570
At 17:05.

436
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:04,790
17:05!
At 17:05.

437
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,570
17:05!

438
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,090
He tried to play it cool!

439
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,460
You can apparently come here with your dog.

440
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,800
This looks great.

441
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,450
Let's have some tea here.

442
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,960
I didn't get enough rest before coming here.

443
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,550
Really?

444
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,210
Let's see...

445
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,700
We've only been going for an hour though...

446
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,230
Hamada is also tripping over some 4 cm tall steps.

447
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,700
Let's take a break.

448
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,330
Let's go in.

449
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,400
The boys head into the cafe to have a small break and plan their next steps.

450
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,070
But we have to keep a lookout.

451
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,460
Excuse us!

452
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,090
Let's go into surveillance mode.
Excuse us!

453
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:40,830
Let's go into surveillance mode.

454
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,590
It would be great if we found a comedian.

455
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,570
Yeah, a comedian would be great.

456
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,930
-Right.
-That would be the easiest.

457
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,670
Right, right.

458
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,480
But there's nobody around.

459
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,800
I'll go take a pee!

460
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,030
What the heck?

461
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,020
It's just as we predicted, isn't it?

462
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,970
Yeah.

463
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,070
It's empty.

464
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:00,730
Right.

465
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:00,900
-Who suggested we come here?
-I'm super curious too.
Right.

466
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,970
-Who suggested we come here?
-I'm super curious too.

467
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,470
Wasn't it Matsumoto?

468
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,170
Once again, the guys have started to search for the one who chose Kumazawa as today's location.

469
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,620
We all decided.

470
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,210
So?

471
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,360
I was just asking.

472
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,160
There's a theory that says fancy cafes often don't have washlets on the toilets.
(On Wednesday's Downtown they test trivial theories)

473
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,030
Oh...

474
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,100
I see...

475
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,210
We were talking about Komazawa being a bit empty...

476
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,780
And wondering who came up with the idea to come here.

477
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,220
Yama was also talking about it.

478
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,100
So, who had the idea?

479
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,370
Wasn't it you?

480
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,450
Hold on!

481
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,170
It was that old man right there, wasn't it?
Hold on!

482
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,500
It was that old man right there, wasn't it?

483
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,800
H-H-Hold on.

484
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,430
I have never suggested a location in all my time at Gaki No Tsukai.

485
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,740
Stop lying!

486
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,170
That's such a big lie!

487
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,560
Stop lying already.

488
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:52,900
I would never suggest anything like this.
Stop lying already.

489
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,130
I would never suggest anything like this.

490
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:54,140
Stop lying!
I would never suggest anything like this.

491
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,550
Stop lying!

492
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,440
I mean, it happens...

493
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,800
Even a rookie would know this stuff.
I mean, it happens...

494
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,110
Even a rookie would know this stuff.

495
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,330
Everyone knows you're the one making the decisions.

496
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,040
No, no, hold on.
Everyone knows you're the one making the decisions.

497
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,160
I really... Ehm...

498
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,770
Alright, should I be honest?

499
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,610
We had some work at Shimokitazawa, right?

500
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,550
Right, right.

501
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,540
We went to Shimokitazawa to film Downtown.

502
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:18,110
So going to a completely new place in such a short time would have been weird.

503
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,730
I mean, I get that...

504
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,270
Right?

505
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,190
That's why we did the other show first.

506
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,640
And we can't just go home from there, right?

507
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,860
So we finished the show there.

508
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,250
And we couldn't just keep filming at Shimokitazawa for day on end.
So they asked us to suggest another place, and this location came up.

509
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:32,610
I see...

510

511
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,070
Right?

512
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,010
But why here?

513
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,230
And you know, I'm always suggesting Ikebukuro.
But why here?

514
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,370
And you know, I'm always suggesting Ikebukuro.

515
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,730
Yeah, you did suggest going to Ikebukuro.

516
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,360
Ikeburuo would have been so nice.
Yeah, you did suggest going to Ikebukuro.

517
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,770
Ikeburuo would have been so nice.

518
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,240
But whenever I suggest Ikebukuro, the staff all go like this...
Ikeburuo would have been so nice.

519
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,040
But whenever I suggest Ikebukuro, the staff all go like this...

520
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,900
All these guys...

521
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,710
They make that face like, "This guy’s saying some crazy stuff again"...

522
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:53,940
As if they were dealing with a bomb or something...

523
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,550
Just like that.
As if they were dealing with a bomb or something...

524
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,740
Just like that.

525
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,380
A bomb?

526
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,090
Like they don't want to work with Yoshimoto again...

527
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,430
That far?

528
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,860
That's the vibe I get.

529
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,320
I mean, Ikebukuro does sound kind of bothersome.
That's the vibe I get.

530
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,870
I mean, Ikebukuro does sound kind of bothersome.

531
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,160
You're right.

532
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,870
I mean, but this is bad.

533
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,160
Do you get a lot of famous customers?

534
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,080
A lot, actually.

535
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,700
A lot?

536
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:15,990
Yes, plenty.
A lot?

537
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,570
Yes, plenty.

538
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,950
We get about 1 famous person a day.

539
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,980
1 a day?!

540
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,210
Are you in the industry?

541
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,640
No, I'm just an employee here.

542
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,290
An employee?

543
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,700
You look like Keiko Fuji.
(Junko Utada (stage name Keiko Fuji) was a Japanese enka singer and actress.)

544
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:27,950
I don't know her.

545
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,180
She was super famous back then.

546
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
She doesn't know Keiko Fuji...

547
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,300
She was Hikaru Utada's mom.
She doesn't know Keiko Fuji...

548
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,180
She was Hikaru Utada's mom.

549
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,620
Right, right, you look like Keiko Fuji at her debut.

550
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,900
Are we still looking?
We can't really stay here?

551
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,600
Right, we have to get moving!
Nothing will come out of sitting here!

552
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,070
Let's just go back to the main street.

553
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,430
Right, let's go.

554
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,730
Alright.

555
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,110
The sun has set and the boys resume their search in the darkness of the Komazawa town.

556
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,230
I can't see people's faces!

557
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,450
It's so dark!

558
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,070
Maybe we'll find someone over there.

559
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,530
Or they'll just sneak past us.

560
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,670
At that moment!

561
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:09,820
That's our AD.

562
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,940
What's wrong?

563
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,830
Oh my god! I was so shocked!

564
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,170
They finally found a celebrity!

565
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,230
But you can't be on our show!

566
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,000
You're a free agent, right?

567
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,000
-Is this Fuji TV?
-Yes, yes!

568
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,500
It's Fuji TV, we're recording Gaki.

569
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,670
Gaki? Oh, sorry, I don't think I can then.

570
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,420
Ah!
Gaki? Oh, sorry, I don't think I can then.

571
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:33,440
Gaki? Oh, sorry, I don't think I can then.

572
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,210
That sucks!

573
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,920
This person is a TV announcer for another station, he cannot appear on the program!

574
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,820
Therefore, the task is not clear!

575
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,430
Where do you think we'll meet the most celebrities around here?

576
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:52,330
You know, there's a very good chance you run into Brother Tom around here.

577
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,330
Alright!

578
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:53,360
Is that so?
Alright!

579
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:53,890
Is that so?

580
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,170
Let's go.
Is that so?

581
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:54,470
Let's go.

582
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,770
Sorry about that.
I'll excuse myself then.

583
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,730
I was so happy.

584
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,680
But he's not a free agent...

585
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,030
But I'm happy we met him.
But he's not a free agent...

586
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,680
But I'm happy we met him.

587
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,230
For a moment there I was also like,

588
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,200
"Huh? Is he a free agent?".

589
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,070
But he wasn't...

590
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,230
But he said Brother Tom is also around.

591
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,860
That was amazing.
But he said Brother Tom is also around.

592
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,370
That was amazing.

593
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,070
But I just got a good dose of adrenaline.

594
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,200
You know, back then...

595
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,650
...I'm sure they used to have a picture of Brother Tom here.

596
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,710
-For real?
-Really?

597
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,380
He must be big around this area.

598
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,440
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

599
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,210
-I always wondered why.
-This must be his hometown.

600
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,460
He's filming a Drama right now, isn't he?

601
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,100
With Nippon TV.

602
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,800
And now, did they find another celebrity?!

603
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,440
Finally, the time has come!

604
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,950
Whoa! It's that guy!

605
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,040
-Mr. Gajiro!
-Mr. Gajiro!
-Mr. Gajiro!
-Mr. Gajiro!

606
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:53,760
Amazing!

607
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,700
They have found Gajiro Sato!

608
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,720
It's Gajiro Sato...

609
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,390
We got it! We got it!
It's Gajiro Sato...

610
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,830
We got it! We got it!

611
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,160
We did it! We did it! We did it!

612
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,300
Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!

613
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,580
He played my dad once!

614
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,880
-Whoa, that's amazing!

615
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,400
Is that your store?
-Whoa, that's amazing!

616
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,550
Is that your store?

617
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,160
Could you lend us a bit of your time?

618
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,640
Sorry about that.

619
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,430
Could you come out for a bit?

620
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:11,880
We're so sorry.

621
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,400
That's amazing!

622
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,100
Please park the car before.

623
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,510
It's been a while.

624
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes!

625
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:20,800
That's amazing!

626
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,530
Close the door!
That's amazing!

627
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,280
Close the door!

628
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,870
Ah, sorry.

629
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,250
Mr. Gojiro, please come over here.

630
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,140
Good evening.

631
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,050
You know, we were strolling around the area looking for celebrities.

632
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,500
My shop is around the corner.
You know, we were strolling around the area looking for celebrities.

633
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,110
My shop is around the corner.

634
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,200
Really?!

635
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,840
We couldn't go home until we found a celebrity!

636
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,730
Am I a celebrity?

637
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,170
Wait, Mr. Gajiro, can you be on our show?
Am I a celebrity?

638
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,110

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,460
Yeah, sure.

Yeah, sure.

Thank you!

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,630
We did it!
Thank you!

643
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,330
We did it!

And everyone knows his name, right?
We did it!

645
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,650
And everyone knows his name, right?

646
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,370
Yes!

647
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,510
Should we say it properly one more time?

648
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:48,520
Alright.
Should we say it properly one more time?

649
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,040
Alright.

650
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,000
One, two...

651
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,000
Mr. Gajiro Sato!

652
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,090
Thank you.

653
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,410
I'm so relieved!

654
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,170
1 hour and 32 minutes after starting, the task is cleared!

655
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,780
Where were you coming from?

656
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,100
My store, my store.
Where were you coming from?

657
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,500
My store, my store.

658
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,700
Oh really?

659
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,000
I have a store in Ginza.
Oh really?

660
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,620
I have a store in Ginza.

661
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,280
In Ginza?

662
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,800
I'm going there.

663
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,990
You were about to head there?

664
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,470
That's my wife.
You were about to head there?

665
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:11,840
That's my wife.

666
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,930
Oh, I see.

667
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,180
Yes, yes.
Oh, I see.

668
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,610
Yes, yes.

669
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,550
How in the world did you spot him in his car?

670
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,430
Right?

671
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,170
I was wondering what was going on here.

672
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,970
For real.

673
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,480
I'm heading out now.

674
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:24,790
Thank you so much.

Keep working hard.

679
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,270
I'm so glad.

680
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,450
Well then, I'll be taking my leave now.

681
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:29,750
Thank you!
Well then, I'll be taking my leave now.

Thank you!

689
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,520
This was perfect!
Thank you!

690
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,700
This was perfect!

691
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,800
-It was...
-Too perfect!

692
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,940
I had no clue what you were all yelling for.

693
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:44,530
Yeah.

694
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,360
But this timing...

695
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,530
That was crazy.

696
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,230
We wouldn't have met him if we didn't take it easy at the coffee shop back there!

697
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,840
That was perfect timing!

698
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,770
So true!

699
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,600
It's a miracle!

700
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,970
Awesome!

701
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,170
That's amazing!
Awesome!

702
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:58,700
That's amazing!

703
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,780
It's Gajiro Sato!

704
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,450
That's crazy!

705
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,280
I'm so happy!

706
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,560
Komu, we have no problems here, do we?

707
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:06,890
Yes!

708
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,930
But that felt so good.

709
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,060
We just got the 'okay' from his agency.

710
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,800
Really?

711
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,280
Alright, the end!

712
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,100
We did it!

713
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,300
Thank you, everyone!

714
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,920
That was very satisfying.

715
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,450
I almost kissed Mr. Gojiro.

716
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,900
You were that happy?

717
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,770
I was.
