2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,650
Let's welcome our next presenter.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,450
It's Mr. Maric!

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,570
We have... We have an unusual presenter.

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,170
I'm very interested in this presentation though!

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,810
What are you possibly going to present?

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,930
Since I'm a magician, it will be about magicians.

8
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,960
Ah, yes.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,880
When I say "magician," what do you all think of?

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,130
A person who deceives.

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,990
That is probably the most common, a person who deceives.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,870
Someone who is very dexterous.

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,380
That is my specialty so I'd like to bring a theory related to that.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,570
If an evil magician decided to go all out, they can shoplift without security guards noticing.

15
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,910
In a way, this has mixed rules.

16
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,960
For example, from this distance, as an example...

17
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,910
...here's a gold necklace. See the gold necklace?

18
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,950
Let's say I shoplifted this.

19
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,740
And we're the security guards.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,590
A magician can do this with a necklace like this.

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,290
Put it in my hand like this.

22
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,550
It's in my hand, are you watching?

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,070
And it's gone. It's gone.

24
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,220
It's nowhere to be found.

25
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,450
If you seriously do not know what happened...

26
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,630
...and if we were in a big grocery store, I could steal all I want.

27
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,500
You're right, if he were an evil magician though.

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,030
T/N: The word for narcotics is "mayaku" while shoplifting is "manbiki" so Matsumoto accidentally mistakes them.

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,030
But if narcotics... Wait, we're not talking about narcotics officers.

30
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,790
ARE YOU STEALING NARCOTICS?!

31
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,790
No, he's supposed to be the security guard.

32
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:59,370
We tested the theory of if an evil magician decided to go all out, they can shoplift without security guards noticing.

33
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:06,830
With that, we turn to a store that is worried about shoplifting in the Adachi ward in Tokyo.

34
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,330
Then don't do
it there!

35
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:13,150
We conduct a magician vs. security shoplifting showdown.

36
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,290
Even though
they're worried,
you do it there?

37
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,100
The rules are two teams of two.

38
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,830
If security can catch the two magicians...

39
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,450
...among ten random customers, they win.

40
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:33,820
Tonight, Mr. Maric chooses to enlist these two magicians for the project.

41
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,510
First up:

42
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,410
A veteran performer for 30 years...

43
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,410
Ken Masaki.

44
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:52,230
Although he doesn't show up in the media much, he is known in the industry as a hidden genius magician.

45
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,150
And the other:

46
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,740
Female magician Mayuko.

47
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,170
An expert magician whose sleight-of-hand work...

48
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,920
...even Mr. Maric considers the best in the business.

49
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,820
How confident are you tonight?

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,190
Our specialty is to reveal things.

51
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,590
I am a little uneasy, but...

52
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,030
...we are still magicians.

53
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,390
I believe I can make things disappear without getting caught.

54
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,070
Mr. Maric...

55
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:32,450
challenged me to do magic that can be seen 360° around me.

56
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,740
Whether security or regular customers are watching...

57
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,650
...viewing from anywhere - I'll work my magic.

58
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,680
Whoa, cool.

59
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,890
Their opponent:

60
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,150
Security Guard Ito Yuu.

61
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,890
Fighting against all shoplifters in various media...

62
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,830
...he's a top security guard.

63
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,830
Scary, scary!

64
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,900
How many shoplifters have you caught?

65
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,700
I've been in my career for 16 years.

66
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,650
I would think over 4,000 people.

67
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,650
Staff: Tonight they'll be magicians.

68
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,620
I don't know what kind of tricks they'll use, but...

69
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,850
...they still have to take the item and hide it.

70
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,590
So we don't get tricked...

71
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,210
...for us, we fight with our eyes.

72
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,050
One hour before the showdown.

73
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,650
Both teams get 10 minutes to scope the place.

74
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,180
Kiwis.

75
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,550
I like round things, even in everyday life.

76
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,080
Normally I use white balls.

77
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,020
Making them appear and disappear is my forte.

78
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,470
If I can take this, that would be nice.

79
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,870
Something like this is OK.

80
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,490
You can make this disappear, just like that, with your custom device.

81
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,260
This would be easy.

82
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,090
Custom device?

83
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:06,200
It appears they've found a number of items they can use their magic on.

84
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,390
Meanwhile...

85
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,390
I kind of have a bad feeling.

86
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,610
Staff: Bad feeling?

87
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,610
I have a bad feeling.

88
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,860
Bad guys like dimly lit areas.

89
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,290
This opening also concerns me.

90
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,710
There's three ways, but...

91
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,950
...you can only see it from here.

92
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:33,600
Tonight we set up 20 cameras to get every angle.

93
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,750
One of the security guards will watch the monitors.

94
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,310
The other will be deployed on scene.

95
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,310
We should be able to tell.

96
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,980
If we don't get this...

97
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,230
...I'll have to quit my job.

98
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,890
Let's review the rules.

99
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,190
Among ten random customers...

100
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,750
...two will be magicians, and one a security guard.

101
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,550
The competition starts with neither knowing what the other looks like.

102
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:17,230
During the 30 minutes only magicians will steal items.

103
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,090
At the end of the contest...

104
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,990
...the security guard will accuse the suspect...

105
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,690
...who he believes is a magician, of shoplifting...

106
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,310
...and call out what items were stolen.

107
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,970
If at least two items are correct, the security guards win.

108
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:43,250
However, if at least two items aren't correct, the magician wins.

109
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,230
We thought the incorrect items will then be given as a prize...

110
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:54,390
...but that would just be stealing, so dismiss that idea.

111
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,710
Tonight will just be for self-satisfaction.

112
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,770
Was it necessary to say that?

113
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,690
Who will win this showdown? Magicians?

114
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,180
Or will it be the security guards?

115
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,810
Here they come.

116
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,340
Everyone looks the part.

117
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,850
Everyone? Do they look
like shoplifters or magicians?

118
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,250
That old man is suspicious.

119
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,250
He thinks the old man
is suspicious.

120
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:47,650
The security guards suspects something about the magician's movement...

121
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,470
...as soon as he walks in.

122
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,150
But it's meaningless
if he doesn't see
him take anything.

123
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,790
Follow him.  I'll look elsewhere.

124
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,290
Already marked.

125
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,870
The male magician is being closely marked by security.

126
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,880
My heart is pounding.

127
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,520
This guy? Maybe this guy?

128
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,890
No, he's yawning.

129
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,250
Throw out the guy in beige.

130
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,590
What about boy with headphones, that guy. No?

131
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,570
No...

132
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,230
Kind of rude!

133
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,230
That's true.

134
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,410
Security narrows down the targets one by one.

135
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,710
However...

136
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,210
I can't make any headway.

137
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,820
Staff: Maybe they haven't stolen anything yet?

138
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,590
I don't see anyone moving suspiciously.

139
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,250
Ten minutes into the contest.

140
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,230
She has something.  She's got something.

141
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,680
Candy! Candy! Candy!

142
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,550
Behind you.

143
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,770
Maybe gum? I didn't see what she took.

144
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,870
Security reacts to the female magician's movements.

145
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,090
But couldn't get proof of what was taken.

146
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,450
It looked like she put
it in the basket.

147
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,710
However, afterwards...

148
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,480
Her behavior is suspicious. This one.

149
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,610
They continue marking her.

150
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,160
I don't think I'm wrong about this one.

151
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,030
They conclude this is one of the magicians.

152
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,310
But can they correctly identify what was stolen?

153
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,150
And how much is the other magician getting away with?

154
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,380
Staff: How was it?

155
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,280
It was harder than I thought.

156
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,310
Staff: Do you know who the magicians are?

157
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,460
I think I know who the magicians are.

158
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,370
Time to prove their claim.

159
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,690
As the customers leave the store...

160
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,970
...they stop the ones they believe to be a magician.

161
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,430
The result?

162
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:05,150
How well did security observe the magician's acts of crime?

163
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,110
That's the first guy
he threw out.

164
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,110
He did say "throw out
the guy in beige."

165
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,680
You're a magician, aren't you?

166
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,210
Yes.

167
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,380
They got the first magician correct.

168
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,810
But here's where the real battle starts.

169
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,650
If two of the stolen items are accurately declared...

170
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,650
...the security guards win.

171
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,650
So, what did she take?

172
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,890
I think it's a cup of noodles and a Kewpie mayonnaise.  A small one.

173
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,450
And the result is?

174
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,030
Cup of noodles?

175
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,850
No, I do not have a cup of noodles and mayonnaise.

176
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,410
What?! Wrongly accused!

177
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,950
With that said, under these circumstances the magician wins.

178
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,360
What did she take?

179
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,650
Indeed, what did she steal?

180
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,250
What came out of the special costume was...

181
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:29,110
Rice seasoning

182
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,810
Furthermore...

183
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,020
Chocolate

184
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,020
Rice seasoning

185
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,610
This is what I thought was mayonnaise.

186
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,110
A small one.

187
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,650
Chocolate

188
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,650

189
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,650

192
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,150
Ramune candy

193
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,150
Rice seasoning

194
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,120
This girl took a lot!

195
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,620
Chocolate

196
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,620

200
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,260

201
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,260
Ramune

202
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,260
Rice seasoning

203
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,260
Yōkan

204
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:49,510
Afterwards, more and more items
kept coming from her clothes.

205
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,430
Chocolate

206
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,430

Rice seasoning

210
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,430
Yōkan

211
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,330
Chocolate

212
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,330
Kiwi

213
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,330
Lime

214
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,330

215
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,330
Ramune candy

216
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,330

217
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,330

218
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,830
Chocolate

219
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,830

220
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,830

221
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,830

222
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,830

230
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,430
Ramune candy

231
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,430

232
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,430
Ramune candy

233
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,430
Rice seasoning

234
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,430
Yōkan

235
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,730
Candy

236
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,730
Chocolate

237
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,730

238
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,730

239
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,730
Lime

240
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,730
Ramune candy

241
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,730
Ramune candy

242
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,730
Ramune candy

243
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,730
Rice seasoning

244
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,730
Yōkan

245
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,750
A cucmber?!

246
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,670
Candy

247
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,670
Chocolate

248
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,670
Chocolate

249
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,670
Cucumber

250
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,670
Kiwi

251
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,670
Lime

252
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,670
Ramune candy

253
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,670
Ramune candy

254
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,670
Ramune candy

255
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,670
Rice seasoning

256
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,670
Yōkan

257
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,670
Amazing!

258
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,810
Here is that technique.

259
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,370
It just went in.

260
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,010
In her sleeve.

261
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,190
Did you notice?

262
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,190
Pretending to reach for one cucumber...

263
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,370
...the other is put in the sleeve.

264
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:33,810
The average person cannot pull off this technique.

265
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,650
The magician continues putting things in her clothes, one by one.

266
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,150
In there there's also this.

267
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,050
A fish!

268
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,030
Wow!

269
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,850
A total of 15 items stolen without one being detected.

270
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,780
A complete victory for the magician.

271
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,250
And the second...

272
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,550
You're a magician, aren't you?

273
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,550
You're wrong.

274
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,990
Ah...is that so?

275
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,650
What?! This one didn't give away he was a magician!

276
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,230
Actually my name is Ken Masaki.  A magician.

277
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,370
We were debating.

278
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,510
Staff: How do you think he did it?

279
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,510
I don't know his method...

280
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,870
...but he looked puffy, so I was marking him.

281
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,610
The security guards noticed the puffiness in his stomach.

282
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,050
What did they find there?

283
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,170
I have potatoes, carrots, and onions.

284
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,350
My goal was curry.

285
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,470
You have three hands.

286
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,470
This is magic.

287
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,650
I see!

288
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,710
That's right.

289
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,950
Having an extra hand
is an advantage.

290
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,190
What is this?!
Scary! Scary!

291
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,190
The right hand pushing the cart was a dummy.

292
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,370
With his real hand hidden from the cameras in his stomach...

293
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,370
...he is calmly able to commit crimes.

294
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,970
This was also inside.

295
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,470
You did well to fit that in.

296
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,690
We only check to see both hands.

297
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,390
You win.

298
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,950
In conclusion, shoplifting is a crime.

299
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,730
You could serve up to ten years...

300
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,520
T/N: At the time of translating, 500,000yen is equal to $3,611USD.

301
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,520
...and fined up to 500,000 yen.

302
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,690
Perfect!

303
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,400
Although I don't think there will be anyone who would try to imitate this after watching.

304
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,760
You won't be able to pull it off this well.

305
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,010
I repeat, this is in the context of evil magicians.

306
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,750
But the one who took 10 or so items...

307
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,190
...Mr. Maric was so amused, you'd almost cringe.

308
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,090
But she took a fish! A fish!

309
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,090
Is it something only relatable to magicians?
