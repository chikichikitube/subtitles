1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,880
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai Ya Arahende!

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,420
Life of the "Ogoo" Pteranodon Endo!

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,550
Downtown

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,550
Hamada Masatoshi

5
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,550
Matsumoto Hitoshi

6
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,550
Tanaka Naoki

7
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,550
Tsukitei Housei

8
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,520
Alright!

9
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,190
Matsumoto-san      - Well, that's how it is

10
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,760
There was that gag on our last New Year's special

11
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,830
And that's Endo's Pteranodon

12
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,330
And that's Endo's Pteranodon

13
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,430
Yes

14
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,330
I think it will be forgotten soon

15
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,130
Wouldn't it be good?

16
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:29,940
PTEROSAUR

17
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:29,940
THE PTERANODON'S  UNREASONABLE REQUEST!!

18
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,840
Endo was suddenly requested to act like a pterosaur

19
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,940
And that gave birth to a new character:

20
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,810
From "No Laughing Prison" (2014)

21
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,620
Endo Pteranodon

22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:49,160
From "No Laughing Prison" (2014)

23
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,320
Raise your voice more!!

24
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,360
Mooooooore!!

25
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,260
Mooooooore!!

26
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,530
That's completely off!

27
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,870
His character was born from a cornered situation, but still...

28
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,100
I think that...

29
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,240
I can't let it sleep like this yet...

30
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,380
I want it to make a comeback this year...

31
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,720
But I have to come up with something good

32
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,720
For the sake of its comeback...

33
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,850
Endo promised to bring his Pteranodon back

34
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,520
He promised a comeback

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,520
What will his challenge be?

36
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,320
But how will he?

37
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,620
Today Endo is going to be alone

38
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,190
And he'll show us the life of Endo Pteranodon

39
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,690
The whole thing, from its birth to its death

40
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:29,470
Endo will perform all by himself its circle of life

41
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:29,470
In a 60-minutes-long play in 5 acts live on stage!!

42
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:29,470
L I F E   O F  E N D O  P T E R A N O D O N

43
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,060
In a theatrical form      - That's fucked up

44
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,200
Yeah, I agree

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,800
That's a pretty wide scale!

46
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,470
But you see, when he was doing this before

47
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,970
He made a lot of mistakes

48
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,040
He had troubles

49
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,370
Does it mean he's ready now?

50
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,270
Well, I think that

51
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,170
When Endo tries something and makes mistakes is the funniest!!

52
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,810
When Endo tries something and makes mistakes is the funniest!!

53
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,440
When Endo tries something and makes mistakes is the funniest!!

54
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,380
And if he succeeds?

55
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,410
When he does

56
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,250
And he's like "I got it", that's unreasonably not funny at all!!

57
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,680
And he's like "I got it", that's unreasonably not funny at all!!

58
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,490
That's because it contains Endo's peculiar unskillfulness!!

59
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,020
That's because it contains Endo's peculiar unskillfulness!!

60
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,590
It does get boring

61
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,590
His harsh taste comes out !!

62
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,900
I really want them to have high hopes for today's play...

63
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,430
And when it's over

64
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,970
I want them to think "So that was its comeback"

65
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,380
AN

66
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,380
UN

67
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,380

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,380
WN

69
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,670
Tonight's episode of Gaki no Tsukai

70
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,380
LENGE

71
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,380
CHAL

72
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,380
Lies on Endo's hands

73
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,310
Curtain Raising

74
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,310
Endo Shouzo in:

75
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,310
Life Of The "Ogoo" Endo Pteranodon

76
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,590
Hundreds of million of years ago, in the Cretaceous Period

77
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:28,590
The four of them are monitoring the play from another room

78
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,160
The Earth was shrouded in warm temperatures

79
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,860
I like this clip

80
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,590
And full of rich natural environments

81
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,960
Such majestic plateau

82
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,600
Was the kingdom of enormous dinosaurs

83
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,730
That's amazing

84
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,670
The winged Pterosaur soars the sky

85
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,640
That's it, that's

86
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,640
the pteranodon

87
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,010
On the land, both carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs

88
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,310
He mistook it

89
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,310
for this, right?

90
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,180
Lived in such era of fighting for the survival of the fittest

91
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,410
Yeah, I think so

92
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,110
He did the

93
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,110
Triceratops

94
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,690
And in the midst of such era

95
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,690
A singular new life was about to make its first appearance...

96
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,860
Seems interesting

97
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,160
From its birth...

98
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,820
Woah, cool!

99
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,030
He did a good job

100
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,400
The beginning of "Ovo" looks like this

101
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,230
note: a touring circus production by Cirque du Soleil

102
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,900
Did Ovo had this?

103
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,970
Yeah it did

104
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,600
He's born

105
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:18,180
Endo Pteranodon

106
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,070
That's the birth of Endo Pteranodon

107
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,650
Can you smell the

108
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,650
unskillfulness?

109
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:31,160
Well, if you ask me if I can, then I'll answer:

110
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,160
I can smell it!!

111
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,060
I thought it

112
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,060
would take more!

113
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,990
It just started

114
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,160
It's already set

115
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,890
- Yeah, he said it

116
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,890
He said "Ogo"

117
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,000
Just when he

118
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,000
was born

119
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,930
So, that's a baby

120
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,500
What's going on?

121
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,110
I can already say

122
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,210
This is way better than "Busjack"

123
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,980
ENDO'S FIRST MOVIE

124
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,980
The Bus Hijacker

125
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:55,050
note: you can watch the reaction episode for its sequel on www.shionnotsukai.wordpress.com

126
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,550
I mean, I know

127
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,550
this

128
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,550
what I'll get from

129
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,350
I see

130
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,860
Here comes his

131
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,860
harsh taste

132
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:20,570
STAGING TIME

133
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,230
Look! His hand

134
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,230
is kinda...

135
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,830
Their shape is...

136
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,470
- Yes, right

137
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,470
It's forming up

138
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,410
The hell is he--?

139
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,840
Let's stop here

140
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,450
He stood up

141
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,850
He's finally up

142
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:34,050
note: I'm not subbing any "ogo" he shouts, it's just his cry

143
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,150
That was clear

144
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
That much?

145
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,860
Was it necessary?

146
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,570
What is he doing?

147
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,370
- Yeah, he ate it

148
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,370
He ate it

149
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,180
Eating the shell to stuff his belly

150
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,940
Endo Pteranodon is eating the shell of his egg

151
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,640
That's his

152
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,640
nourishment

153
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,010
But in that moment...

154
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,680
Oh!

155
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,580
What is--

156
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,620
ROOOAAARRR

157
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,350
A carnivorous dinosaur suddenly draws near

158
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,350
There he goes

159
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,660
His hash taste rolled out from him!!

160
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,660
Well, you see

161
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,660
I did warn you

162
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,140
STAGING TIME

163
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,730
8 minutes passed

164
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,770
8 minutes passed

165
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,770
since it began

166
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,770
I told you so, guys

167
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,450
The hell is he doing?

168
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,060
As soon as it starts raining, the carnivorous dinosaur leaves

169
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,050
It started raining

170
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,190
Right, woah

171
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,520
He should have

172
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,520
used the leaf now

173
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,520
- That's right

174
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,860
- Yeah...

175
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,860
Poor thing, huh?

176
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,500
He took it again

177
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,470
Are you sure that

178
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,470
is the right way

179
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,470
to use it?

180
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,480
With his hands

181
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,540
Are those his

182
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,540
hands?

183
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,280
At this point he--

184
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,780
What the? Why

185
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,780
is he eating again?

186
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:13,320
Eating the shell to stuff his belly, once more

187
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,620
He ate a lot

188
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,080
The hell!

189
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,320
He's eating a lot,

190
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,320
what the hell

191
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,990
Matsumoto-san,

192
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,820
Do you think our audience can endure this?

193
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:25,460
For our Endo Pteranodon,

194
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:25,460
born in the age of dinosaurs,

195
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,460
A voyage known as "life" is about to begin

196
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,400
- Oh, yes

197
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,400
It's starting now

198
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,270
End of Act One

199
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,630
I see...

200
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,630
That's the end of the first act

201
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:39,510
STAGING TIME TILL NOW

202
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,470
Why aren't we watching it under the stage?

203
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,140
Why aren't we watching it under the stage?

204
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,610
If we were there, we would talk too much

205
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,140
Oh I see

206
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,410
We'd be noisy

207
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,310
He would hear us

208
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,050
We'll be heard talking by him

209
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,780
I see, I see

210
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,580
And then

211
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,550
If he notices we laughed a bit, he'll repeat that same thing forever!!

212
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,420
If he notices we laughed a bit, he'll repeat that same thing forever!!

218
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,040
Act Two: Childhood Arc

219
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,600
The season changed?

220
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,400
- It did change

221
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,400
It surely changed

222
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,240
He can now

223
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,240
perfectly stand

224
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,710
He has a pattern...

225
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,540
True, on his body

226
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,050
How old is he

227
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,050
supposed to be now?

228
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,810
Well, looks like

229
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,810
he feels at ease

230
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,820
He's lively

231
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Yeah, a lot

232
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,020
He surely is lively

233
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,720
He's an infant

234
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,720
now, right?

235
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,990
He's playing with

236
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,990
interesting

237
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,990
what he founds

238
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,490
Ok but seriously,

239
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,490
what are those?

240
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,560
Are those hands?

241
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,860
- Right

242
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,860
Not fangs?

243
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,530
I mean, he always did this

244
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,900
Yeah, he did that last time

245
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,730
And now he's doing this instead

246
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,830
And now he's

247
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,830
doing this instead

248
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,370
So hands-- hands?

249
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,200
Those are hands!

250
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,040
Looks like it

251
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,340
I'm pretty sure

252
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,340
by the time this

253
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,340
will be over

254
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,370
He'll end up with

255
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,370
two broken fingers

256
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,350
He smacked em

257
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,750
Why is he-?

258
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,580
He's wiggling

259
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,090
He probably thinks he's cracking us up with this!!

260
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,130
He probably thinks he's cracking us up with this!!

261
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,690
I bet he's

262
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,690
thinking that!

263
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,300
- Just now, yes

264
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,300
You think so?

265
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,140
He found a lump of meat stuck in a tree

266
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,140
STAGING TIME

267
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,370
Endo Pteranodon, who just found some meat on a tree,

268
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,370
Decides to climb it to acquire it

269
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,640
Come on,

270
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,640
Those are hands...

271
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,410
Prove me wrong

272
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,150
He goes "ogoo" whenever he can't use his head

273
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,260
That's because "ogoo" means he's thinking...

274
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,090
Oh, he made it

275
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,060
Good, good, he did it

276
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,770
Huh? Looks like he

277
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,770
still can't reach it

278
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,270
- And what now?

279
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,270
He can't reach it

280
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,880
Oh, come on! He's

281
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,880
clenching his fist

282
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,380
Where did his fangs go ?!

283
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,420
Geez...

284
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,490
This is no good

285
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,390
By this point our audience probably changed channel !!

286
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,530
They're all watching YORUTAMORI
- Yeah, most likely

287
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,160
note: A variety show broadcasted every sunday (2014-2015)

288
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,100
That's bad

289
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,630
End of Act Two

290
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,630
Geez      - Oh! We're done

291
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:20,870
STAGING TIME TILL NOW

292
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,640
I have thousands of complaints about this

293
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,940
Well, we can't speak directly to Endo at the moment

294
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,440
Yes

295
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,080
So, let's call the staff and told them to say him "the situation's harsh"

296
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,350
So, let's call the staff and told them to say him "the situation's harsh"

297
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,750
Now!?     - How can that be better?

298
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,620
If we say that now...
- Yeah, it'll probably influence him

299
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,290
Act Three: Adolescence Arc

300
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,690
That's his adolescence

301
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,090
His tail!

302
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:40,990
It became huge

303
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,560
- It really grew up

304
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,560
It grew so long

305
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,160
Even his face...

306
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,830
Right

307
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,700
He became an adult

308
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,070
Never saw that

309
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,070
face on him before!

310
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a new face

311
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,340
He became handsome

312
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,580
For our grown-up Endo Pteranodon, the season of love is about to arrive...

313
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,380
The season of love..?

314
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,380
I guess for us humans

315
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,380
It's around the 20s

316
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,820
It's a female Ogoo

317
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,460
A female Pteranodon appears

318
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,650
Yes, a female

319
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,490
- Creepy!

320
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,490
Disgusting

321
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,460
- It's freaky

322
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,460
What the...

323
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,460
What the...

324
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
It's an Ogoo girl

325
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,860
Ogoo girl...

326
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,970
What will he do?

327
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,970
COURTING DANCE

328
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,970
That's his

329
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,970
courting dance

330
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,980
"Ogo" at all

331
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,980
He's not saying

332
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,450
- He's not...

333
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,450
You're right

334
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,620
His hands again

335
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,360
So that's how it

336
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,360
works with Ogoos

337
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:54,900
Here goes

338
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,100
Here goes

339
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,270
- Yeah right

340
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,270
He didn't hesitate

341
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,440
Endo felt the urge

342
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,440
to add this scene

343
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,480
What the hell

344
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,150
- He made her a pillow

345
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,150
So considerate

346
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,890
I see, he used his

347
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,890
tail as a pillow

348
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,590
A tail pillow

349
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,460
Then what's the

350
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,460
point of that arm?

351
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,330
He keeps using

352
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,330
his hands!

353
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,490
I guess they're a couple now...

354
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,200
I guess they're a couple now...

355
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,300
They are

356
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,860
Is that so?

357
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,200
Yeah

358
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:32,440
Endo Pteranodon has found a partner

359
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,440
, but suddenly...

360
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,910
A rival-in-love dinosaur appears

361
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:48,090
A

362
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:48,090
lival

363
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:48,090
in rov--

364
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:48,090
A rival

365
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:48,090
-in-love

366
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,350
Wha-?!

367
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,090
dinosaur

368
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,090
appeared

369
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,550
He stuttered!

370
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,250
I didn't know

371
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,250
it was live

372
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,720
That's what

373
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,720
surprised me

374
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,490
Really...

375
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,920
So it's not

376
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,920
pre-recorded...

377
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,300
- Got him

378
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,300
He made it!

379
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,630
Like that, go!

380
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,370
"I protected you"

381
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,370
He's saying

382
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,510
"until the end"

383
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,440
He protected her?

384
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,710
I think that's

385
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,710
what that meant

386
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
But it's still there

387
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,410
What the?

388
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,550
That's the sweat

389
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,550
of someone who's

390
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,550
trying his best

391
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,890
What was that?

392
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,020
I don't think there

393
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,020
are types of sweat

394
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,590
I think that's

395
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,590
that type

396
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,660
I don't think we

397
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,660
YORUTAMORI tonight

398
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,660
can win against

399
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,030
We can only hope they're doing the exact same thing on YORUTAMORI

400
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,040
If that's the case, we're good

401
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,870
You think so?

402
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,010
Endo's still

403
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,010
not done yet

404
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,440
They've been glaring each other for 6 minutes

405
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,210
There's still more

406
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,210
Of course

407
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,080
- Yes?

408
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,080
And once he's done

409
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,280
The dummy still

410
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,280
won't move

411
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,780
I see

412
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,780
And he'll

413
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,780
get confused

414
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,290
I see

415
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,090
This is a battle between him and his other self

416
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,120
This is a battle between him and his other self

417
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,660
What's that battle

418
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,660
supposed to be?

419
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,400
That stage assistant

420
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,400
is such a bad guy!

421
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,030
He's not moving

422
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,830
He won't move

423
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,830
that thing off stage

424
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,940
He's just waiting

425
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,940
for instructions

426
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,100
Yeah...

427
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,110
See? Now he's---

428
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,910
What the?

429
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,080
Oh! He's going away

430
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,850
Of course he has

431
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,850
in the end

432
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,850
to do something

433
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,650
[censored]

434
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,760
End of Act Three

435
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,760
When it began I thought it won't have much story

436
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,560
But by now

437
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:40,300
STAGING TIME TILL NOW

438
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,460
We're at the fourth act, how will the story unfold?

439
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,100
We're at the fourth act, how will the story unfold?

440
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,190
Good point

441
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,300
I must say, it really got my attention somehow

442
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,070
I agree

443
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,930
I think that

444
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,870
Our audience must be thinking

445
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,870
"What the hell are those idiots talking about?!"

446
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,970
What are you being so serious about?

447
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,050
Don't worry, we've been just spitting out lies right now!!

448
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:59,790
Act Four: Adulthood Arc

449
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,880
After experience love many times

450
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,380
Endo Pteranodon, which is now an adult,

451
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,550
Has now a family

452
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,020
Oh! I thought so!      - I'm glad!

453
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,560
He wasn't that

454
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,560
small before

455
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,530
That's a human baby

456
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,370
- The shape of his

457
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,370
They're raising him

458
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,370
shoulders changed

459
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,130
Ok, I got it

460
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,170
Those are definitely hands (not fangs)!!

461
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,870
It's a sort of pond

462
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,180
Some fishes discovered in a pond

463
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,510
There are fishes

464
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,060
His baby!

465
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,660
He fell

466
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,530
- I don't think so

467
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,530
Did he noticed it?

468
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,960
His mom's

469
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,960
stance is weird

470
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,530
Is he mad?

471
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,510
This is...

472
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,190
This is the scene

473
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,750
In which we get

474
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,750
to briefly see

475
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,620
This father and

476
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,620
son bonding moment

477
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,620
All live

478
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:18,500
STAGING TIME

479
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,360
But even with such an happy family...

480
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,630
It's coming

481
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,230
What?

482
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,330
That must be

483
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,330
pretty big---

484
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,600
Oh, it's the same

485
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,640
A rival-in-love dinosaur appears

486
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,840
So irritating...

487
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,840
The hell is this?

488
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,050
He came again

489
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,250
- Yes

490
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,250
It must be his

491
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,250
natural enemy

492
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,620
That's the same

493
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,620
scene from before

494
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,160
He likes his wife?

495
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,160
What's his deal?

496
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,020
Is that why he's

497
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,020
targeting him?

498
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,790
- It's not, right?

499
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,790
- Yeah...

500
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,790
That's not really clear

501
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,800
He passed by

502
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
- Did he noticed him?

503
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
He just passed by

504
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,370
He hugs his wife

505
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,670
He protected them

506
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,810
He looks relieved

507
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,010
So, he protected his family?

508
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,010
That's right

509
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,690
What the hell...

510
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,090
- Yeah, all of them

511
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,090
He picked em all up

512
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,290
He's back

513
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,300
Again!?

514
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,770
The rival-in-love dinosaur appears again

515
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,630
He's back at it

516
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,500
I wasn't

517
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,500
expecting that

518
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,780
I mean, one time

519
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,780
or two is fine, but...

520
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,420
Oh! He got him!

521
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,290
He's like "don't

522
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,290
ever come again"

523
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,090
Exactly

524
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,260
He got angry

525
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,930
He hurt him good

526
00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:03,040
The moments spent along with

527
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:03,040
his beloved wife and son were

528
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,040
the happiest for Endo Pteranodon

529
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,570
About the "ogoos", it's more about variation than frequency...

530
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,480
End of Act Four

531
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,480
STAGING TIME TILL NOW

532
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,070
Meaning, that's the...

533
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,810
Hardest part      - Exactly

534
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:17,050
But in the end he didn't shout for us any remarkable "ogoo"

535
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,050
I can't understand why!!

536
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,120
He must be lost in thoughts

537
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,850
Is that it?

538
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,450
Must be that, yes

539
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,190
Amazing

540
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,190
As expected from him

541
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:21,890
I think

542
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,420
I think a nasty ogoo boom is going to happen this year

543
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,060
I think a nasty ogoo boom is going to happen this year

544
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,860
There will be statues of him!!

545
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,860
note: he actually says "hagoita", japanese ornamental paddles

546
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:36,440
Final Act: Old Age Arc

547
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,770
Endo Pteranodon: last chapter

548
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,300
Woah! He became

549
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,300
so old!

550
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,000
He surely aged

551
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,010
He aged all at once!

552
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,180
Is that the way they grow old?

553
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,840
He's just an old man!!

554
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:51,250
His son has left the nest

555
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,250
and his wife was gone before him

556
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,250
But something is about to unfold before his very eyes...

557
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,550
Come on, he's too

558
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,550
old for this now

559
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,490
You're right

560
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,590
An UFO comes flying in

561
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,030
Well, that's an

562
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,030
unexpected twist!

563
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,030
- I know right?

564
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,860
It's an ashtray

565
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,660
Isn't this a surprising turn of events?

566
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,260
This...

567
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,010
An alien appears

568
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,470
So it happened

569
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,670
What a great finale

570
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,050
that face

571
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,050
Can't blame

572
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,950
It was too sudden

573
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,220
That's the first

574
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,220
invader he saw

575
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,460
He bowed before him

576
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,460
It's like a God

577
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,600
I don't get this

578
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,600
What is he doing?

579
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,250
But just on that moment...

580
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,350
Meteorites

581
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,290
Huge meteorites crash down on Earth from space

582
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:10,200
Huge meteorites crash down, the Ice Age approaches

583
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,190
The sky becomes covered in hot clouds

584
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,100
And the Ice Age starts instantly

585
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:24,410
STAGING TIME

586
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,870
The ice age, huh

587
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
He's still small

588
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,380
You're right

589
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,920
Didn't he left

590
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,920
the nest?

591
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,890
Enough with that

592
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,730
- So long!

593
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,730
Why?

594
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,060
It's taking so long

595
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,930
I gotta say, it's

596
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,930
kinda touching

597
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,930
- It is, right?

598
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,370
It would been good if the dinosaur popped out now...

599
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,370
His rival, right?

600
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,170
I don't think

601
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,170
he'll pop out now

602
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:57,710
STAGING TIME

603
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,670
There's nothing

604
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,670
left to do

605
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,780
- You think so?

606
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,780
Is that him?

607
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,290
Just when it was

608
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,290
about to end!

609
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,620
He was ready to die!

610
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,490
He's a gradnpa

611
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,360
A fighting grandpa

612
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,100
And yet he's still

613
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,100
protecting him

614
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,240
Protecting is ok, but

615
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,240
come on, fight!

616
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,380
What now?

617
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,080
What will he do?

618
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,950
He's standing!

619
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,950
He's standing

620
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,950
nonchalantly!

621
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,050
Sorry, I'm lost

622
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,060
I have no idea

623
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,460
what's going on

624
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,590
They're glaring

625
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,590
at each other

626
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,600
His opponent is...

627
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,170
Ohh, he hid well

628
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:04,710
STAGING TIME

629
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,710
He must be tired

630
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,940
It's almost over

631
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,810
I want it (the dinosaur) to appear one more time

632
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,910
I won't let this play reach an ending!!

633
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,920
He's unkillable

634
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,020
He's back!!

635
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,360
He came again!

636
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,630
What will he do?

637
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,570
Ogoo!

638
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,800
What now?!

639
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,200
This is the best

640
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,570
He doesn't give up

641
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,110
Of course he's doing

642
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,510
The inoki-ari-jotai

643
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,880
note: a MMA style consisting in fighting while lying down

644
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,250
He's done for

645
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,100
What the hell

646
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,340
The End

647
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,480
In the end the last act was the longest

648
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:20,550
TOTAL STAGING TIME

649
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,510
Yes, you're right

650
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,710
It never crossed my mind

651
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,920
How long this was taking

652
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,780
What?

653
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,490
Are you for real?       - I swear

654
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,790
After this...

655
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,790
An unexpected situation: they'll call for a retake!!

656
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,820
Hi

657
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,420
Hey

658
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,390
Congrats

659
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:27,860
So...

660
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,760
Do you think the "Ogoo" will become popular?

661
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,760
Well...

662
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,130
To be honest, we all agreed that

663
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,370
You hardly ever said any "ogoo" all over the play

664
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:35,900
Oh, I see...

665
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,370
He's right, that was the main issue

666
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,640
Would you  mind do it one more time for us, please?

667
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,970
Only the beginning was good

668
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,940
Ohnuma, come here

669
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,980
Ohnuma Akihiro

670
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,980
producer

671
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,760
Raise your voice more!!

672
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,900
You're scared when you shout

673
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,470
At least with the first "ogoo"

674
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,440
But then, the more you shout it, the less scared you become

675
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,680
The more you do it, remember

676
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,510
Come on, one more time!!

677
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,510
He didn't shout much...

678
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,210
Yeah, too soft

679
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,510
That's the issue

680
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,320
Come on, you gotta shout more,

681
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,320
wait a sec!!

682
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,490
It's not coming out from your very first "ogoo"

683
