1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,670
Downtown no

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,670
Gaki no Tsukai

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,670
Ya Arahende

4
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,670
Translator: Staccato

5
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,660
Back again, Gaki's Jiji-Nuki!

6
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,660
Gaki Jiji-nuki (Old Man)

7
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,680
The cards being used will have various different original subjects on them.

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,680
Like the game Old Maid, match the cards to deplete your hand.

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,690
Whoever's left with the one unmatchable card must follow its orders.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,260
Let's get going.

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi      Hamada Masatoshi

12
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,000
Tsukitei Hosei        Endo Shozo       Tanaka Naoki

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,300
Bun-chan's here today.

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,820
No he's not.

15
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,600
He is this time.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,260
Here in his prime.

17
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,060
Picking the dealer, right?

18
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,350
Dealer decided by roulette.

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,800
Endo popping up a lot.

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,420
Feels like it.

21
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,200
Endo-san

22
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,240
Yes

23
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,420
You are now the dealer.

24
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,520
The theme for this game is

25
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,520
"Vicious Fight with Big Game"

26
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:59,400
Vicious Fight with Big Game.

27
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,560
Written on these cards are various big game animals.

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,390
But what is the vicious fight?

29
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,440
The loser will, with all their strength, fight a stuffed animal.

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,520
Got it.

31
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:13,270
Fight a stuffed big game animal with all your strength

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,960
Whatever happens we have to lose.

33
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,800
Let's fight a stuffed animal with all we got.

34
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,900
Yes

35
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,760
Let's do it. Yes.

36
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,480
Picking the "Old Man" (players cannot look)

37
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,560
The 'Old Man" (Joker) card is...

38
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,480
Shark

39
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
This card.

40
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,180
Players have 6 cards. (Dealer has 5)

41
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,210
Please, please, I'm begging.

42
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,150
Alright, is it a bust?

43
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,720
It's all over the place.

44
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,160
Oh, there's lots written on these.

45
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,720
Ohh.

46
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,100
God was with me. If I may...

47
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,300
Eagle

48
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,140
It would suck to fight an eagle.

49
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,620
And then there's...

50
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,540
Eh?

51
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,580
Eh?

52
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,820
Oh no, what.

53
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,200
Two pairs?

54
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,240
Seriously?

55
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,580
Lion

56
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,180
I'm honestly glad the lion is gone.

57
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,710
One card left

58
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,900
Eh?

59
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,800
Eh?

60
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,920
Once he pulls my card I'm safe right?

61
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,680
HOLY

62
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,400
He's right!

63
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,920
I guess that can happen.

64
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,500
Because he's the dealer.

65
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,520
Yes

66
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,320
To have only 1 card at this point in the game.

67
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,550
Endo

68
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,550
has won!

69
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,320
Haah ha ha ha

70
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,560
I am sooo glad.

71
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,700
That's crazy.

72
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,660
I got a pair.

73
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,660
Ok ok.

74
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,430
Kangaroo

75
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,440
I had kangaroos.

76
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,420
This might end quickly.

77
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,000
Seriously though, it's going fast.

78
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,070
Everyone else got nothing.

79
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,420
Let's move on.

80
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,680
No, I have nothing.

81
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,330
Yama-chan takes...

82
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,540
"Old Man" starts

83
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,240
Takes the card, then Endo is done.

84
00:02:15,540 --> 00:03:29,850
Shark

85
00:02:15,560 --> 00:03:29,850
Joker

86
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,600
Thank you!

87
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,620
Uwa, fastest one hunh?

88
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,840
Fastest.

89
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,840
Fastest so far

90
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,350
The fact that there's nothing is amazing.

91
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,300
Even with an opening like that.

92
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,260
Well, a match is out there somewhere.

93
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,820
Yes, there was.

94
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,690
Elephant

95
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,630
C'mon, give me something.

96
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,360
I said give me something...

97
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,930
There's nothin'.

98
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,930
A vicious fight with big game...

99
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,520
A vicious fight with big game alright.

100
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,680
I really don't want to do it.

101
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,210
No, nothing

102
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,490
This is getting crazy.

103
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,180
It is crazy, seriously.

104
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,080
Endo

105
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,530
Endo was too fast

106
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I think thats how it is.

107
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,000
Thats what it is.

108
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,700
Thank you so much for this.

109
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,170
Bear

110
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,560
Oh! A match!

111
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,720
A bear???

112
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,860
Getting a read on Hamada, Housei makes a pair.

113
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,740
Got it!

114
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,460
Rhino

115
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,960
Rhino!

116
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,790
Gradually the cards start matching up.

117
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,320
It came.

118
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,440
Alligator

119
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,630
This is something that our  children will do.

120
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,660
The children of the FUTURE.

121
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,940
Can't argue with that.

122
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,420
They will play this game.

123
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,810
The next generation

124
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,010
of comedians who won't even know us, will play.

125
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:08,020
The "Vicious fight with big game"

126
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,190
Although the game is going smoothly

127
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,600
Tanaka won't do well.

128
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,060
Once again, my new card is...

129
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,630
Damn thing came back again.

130
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Old man shark starts making its rounds.

131
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,510
This card is back again.

132
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,640
You just mentioned it.

133
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,590
Came back?

134
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,160
What's your recommendation?

135
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,230
This one maybe?

136
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,960
And your most "not recommended" is?

137
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,300
I wouldn't suggest this one I think.

138
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,300
Which which which?

139
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,490
THAT ONE?!!?!

140
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,620
HELL YEAH!!!

141
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,620
Hell yeah...?

142
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,580
Sorry about that.

143
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,580
No match.

144
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,780
He didn't get a match!

145
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,540
Pick this one.

146
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,520
That's fine?

147
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,630
I extremely suggest it.

148
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,230
What is that! Damn it to hell.

149
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,440
You're... a snake.

150
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,470
Snake

151
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,980
It was the snake.

152
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,870
Bam!

153
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,870
And then...

154
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,270
Yes!

155
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,410
Octopus

156
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,610
Tanaka won!?

157
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,620
Giant Octopus!

158
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,510
Tanaka

159
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,510
has won!

160
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,480
Thank you giant octopus.

161
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,480
Why does Tanaka get to win?

162
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,720
Cards remaining

163
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,720
Down to just 3 players.

164
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,950
I hate this already.

165
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,290
Matsumoto-san, Matsumoto-san, big game.

166
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,030
Toneruzu

167
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,030
Ucchan Nannchann

168
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,030
Would never do this.

169
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,970
A vicious fight with big game

170
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,570
You just like that title!

171
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,620
No, no, no, no, no!

172
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,810
I ain't doing the vicious fight with big game.

173
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,910
Please do it.

174
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,450
I won't do it, therefore

175
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,750
I will leave it to you guys.

176
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,600
UWAAHHH!!!!

177
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,510
Come on!

178
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,840
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

179
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,920
YES! YEEESSSSS!!!!!

180
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,860
YES!

181
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,860
YES!!

182
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,470
The place is heating up.

183
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,800
What is going on?

184
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,800
Enough Enough

185
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,470
The chances are high.

186
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,470
That's the thing.

187
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,540
Which one???

188
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,540
Your turn will decide it.

189
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,760
Not good! Not good!

190
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,250
Don't!

191
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,050
Gorilla

192
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,260
Hamada

193
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,260
has won!

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,640
Match!

195
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,260
Take it.

196
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,260
This is a big moment.

197
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,560
This is yours now.

198
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,560
Had enough? Seriously?

199
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,100
Come on, help me out.

200
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,400
Would you really be thankful?

201
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,570
Alright, this is big.

202
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,570
If you have that then...

203
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,570
It's pretty much a given.

204
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,170
Since I was 18 years old,

205
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,780
Since I was 18 years old, I've been doing this shit.

206
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,250
A vicious fight with big game?

207
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,610
Not for me.

208
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,430
No match. This game is screwed.

209
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,660
There's another chance.

210
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:44,970
Insane. This is Insane.

211
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,970
Matsumoto vs Housei. Where is this headed?

212
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,010
Now at Matsumoto.

213
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,540
Cards remaining

214
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,010
Yep.

215
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,540
The vicious big game fight.

216
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,150
He's attempting to limit any hint giving.

217
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,820
If I survive this I'm fine.

218
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,220
When in doubt, pick the middle.

219
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,220
A true student of the game.

220
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,230
Should I just throw them face up?

221
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,300
We're going.

222
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,170
The "I really don't want to do it"

223
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,170
Vicious fight with big game

224
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:19,670
Come on!

225
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,610
Come on!

226
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,000
SAFE! SAFE! SAFE! SAFE!

227
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,000
SAFE! SAFE!

228
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,320
Monitor Lizard

229
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,320
Matsumoto

230
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,320
has won!

231
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,250
Let's see the rest.

232
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,800
Shark!

233
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,800
Shark!

234
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,660
Stage is over there!

235
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,660
Go right ahead.

236
00:08:42,460 --> 00:09:47,890
Vicious Fight: Shark

237
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,260
Oh I'm waiting.

238
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,770
It's the middle of the ocean.

239
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,770
He's drowning!

240
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,180
Pretty strong.

241
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:00,610
Stab it!

242
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,550
Stab it!

243
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,120
He's underwater now.

244
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,850
He's been bitten!!

245
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,850
You gonna lose?

246
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,140
A revenge bite!

247
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,040
How's that!

248
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,300
Nobody is laughing!!

249
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,370
Not even once.

250
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,570
And now he goes straight to dirty!

251
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,780
Not even one laugh.

252
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,780
Not even.

253
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,880
Wrapping up the shark.

254
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,890
Going down? A one shot down?

255
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,260
It got your mic, you're done.

256
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,160
I can't even...

257
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,000
You didn't get a single laugh.

258
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:03,270
I thought it would end if

259
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,270
someone just laughed once.

260
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,540
You got a lot of energy.

261
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,100
Next up, the second battle.

262
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,720
The theme for this game is "Strong one-liners"

263
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:29,400
Famous one line jokes are on these cards. If you lose, you must become the comedian and perform the joke.

264
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,540
Joker

265
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,540
That don't matter!

266
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,540
The joker for this round is Kojima Yoshio's "That don't matter!"

267
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,680
Jokes this time. What kinds will we see?

268
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,020
"Whoah! It's out!"

269
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,960
This pair has saved me a bit.

270
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,890
I'm Osamu-Chan!

271
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,830
This pair is also a blessing isn't it?

272
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,830
Panty Techs

273
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,140
Shimada Tamayo

274
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,940
I'm pretty weak at those.

275
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,940
It's long.

276
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,040
Game Starts!

277
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,480
You've got 3.

278
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,680
Hunh?

279
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
No, nothing.

280
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,360
Alright, I'm going.

281
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,020
Yes, thank you.

282
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,890
Stiiiiink

283
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,180
No one asked you to come

284
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,180
Ueki Hitoshi-San

285
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,960
This one's tough so thank god.

286
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,630
You gunna start goofing?

287
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,500
Goof? You bastard.

288
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,500
That was a textbook goof.

289
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,240
You wanna fight some big game?

290
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,620
Endo breaks open the first treasure of the game.

291
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,520
I love Lassen!

292
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,520
I'm fine with it ending that way.

293
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,390
With 2 pairs in a row, Endo is the first one out.

294
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,390
Endo

295
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,390
has won!

296
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,330
Thank you.

297
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,930
You looked like Ogata just now. That's not a good thing.

298
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,170
I guess, well its a joke so...

299
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,170
Nah, when you are doing that,

300
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,030
and say thank you,

301
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,340
and say thank you, it's a goof.

302
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,000
I see Ogata more like this.

303
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,480
Like this.

304
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,800
Oh ok.

305
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,010
I'm barely safe though.

306
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,310
Many people have said it before.

307
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,650
Thank you.

308
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,190
Things are moving!

309
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,190
The next play comes from Housei.

310
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,160
Revolution

311
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,060
Hosei

312
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,060
has won!

313
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,060
I want to see one of these.

314
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,200
Finally, Matsumoto moves forward.

315
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,200
YES!!

316
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,530
Empty head

317
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,530
Matsumoto

318
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,530
has won!

319
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,800
What are you going to get?

320
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,800
Cards remaining

321
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,960
Gotta go with this.

322
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,650
Wrong!

323
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,980
If Hamada ends up losing.

324
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,980
And if you don't know the joke

325
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,650
You could viciously

326
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,160
You could viciously fight big game.

327
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,160
After finishing the joke performance.

328
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,790
If you don't know it, that is.

329
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,790
IF I didn't.

330
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,100
We could do that.

331
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,730
Ramen, Tsukemen, I'm Ikemen (Handsome)

332
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,730
See, that's great.

333
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,170
This is it!

334
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,950
Hamada vs Tanaka!! How will it go?!

335
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,580
Tanaka do you know those jokes?

336
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,580
Cards remaining

337
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,490
Yes... They are jokes that I do know.

338
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,630
Getting Pissed while Smiling

339
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,630
Hamada

340
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,630
has won!

341
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,620
Getting pissed while smiling.

342
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,070
Takenaka Naoto-San

343
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,070
Takenaka-San

344
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,070
Takenaka-San

345
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,870
Tanaka is the loser!

346
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,940
Now, what is the joke?

347
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,540
Was it the "Hot Hot" one?

348
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,580
"That don't matter!" is the one you will do!

349
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:47,690
Kojima Yoshio's "That Don't Matter"

350
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,280
But but but but!

351
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,260
That don't matter!

352
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,690
Yeah! Oh Pa-pi~

353
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,760
You don't seem to know the joke.

354
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,760
Did you really not know it?

355
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,800
I knew it, and I felt a response to my performance.

356
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,000
Not in the slightest!

357
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,510
You disrespected the joke.

358
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,560
No I am not!

359
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,580
I did it with all my strength.

360
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,710
It goes "But But But But"

361
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,510
You trailed off.

362
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,280
I would never trail off in a game of punishment.

363
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,690
You couldn't capture the original spirit.

364
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,320
Let's just do the other thing.

365
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,060
You have deep hatred towards animals.

366
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,900
The viewers couldn't grasp it.

367
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,230
No screwing up this time.

368
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,230
Is that how it is?

369
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,240
Careful!

370
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,540
It's soo big!!!

371
00:15:34,030 --> 00:16:01,060
Fight with Giraffe

372
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,440
Amazing!

373
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,350
Get away!

374
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,150
The neck is long, it is a Giraffe.

375
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,380
Oh! The neck!

376
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,300
Wow, crazy.

377
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,790
You're making weird sounds.

378
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,120
I got you now!

379
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,130
Amazing, get away!

380
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,520
Blam, blam, blam, blam.

381
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,040
We will think about which one gets broadcast.

382
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,580
I'm back.

383
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,380
Mix the two and you've got one good punishment.

384
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,960
To sum it up.

385
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,020
Yeah.

386
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,560
Uh, yes.

387
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,960
I can't stop sweating.

388
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:34,830
3rd Round: Punishment

389
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,380
Last up are the punishment games.

390
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,820
This time we will not reveal the joker, enjoy it!

391
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,280
Let the game begin!

392
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,080
I don't like the pain-inducing ones.

393
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,600
I hate them.

394
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,020
Most of these hurt pretty bad.

395
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,020
Most?

396
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,520
Adams Apple Pachinko

397
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,920
What the hell?

398
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,920
Did some dumb ass write this?

399
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,780
You saw something pretty dumb?

400
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,780
Seriously stupid...

401
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,280
Whoa, hey hey hey.

402
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
I thought you took two.

403
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,280
The two of you.

404
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,000
You two gonna vicious fight?

405
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,870
I thought he took two.

406
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,810
Comedian vicious fight?

407
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,570
Tanaka would absolutely lose that.

408
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,580
I would. I would.

409
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,450
Did you think you had one more?

410
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,450
Got one!

411
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,180
Bowling with a nose hook.

412
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,390
Bowling nose hook

413
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,610
Oh yessir.

414
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,610
You did that one.

415
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,590
Sun dried fish to the nose

416
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,400
Nothing at all!

417
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,500
Hand it over already.

418
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,940
Give me a minute to process.

419
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,850
Suggestion?

420
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,380
My recommendation is, this one.

421
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,380
This ONE!!!

422
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,020
HELL YEAH!!

423
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,020
You said it again.

424
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,020
"Hell yeah"

425
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
It doesn't seem to be funny.

426
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,560
Completely worthless.

427
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,520
"Hell yeah" is a no go.

428
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,980
Come on.

429
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,520
The middle!

430
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,060
Wait nothing. No, there's a match.

431
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,010
Paper fan the troublemaker

432
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,010
Paper fan the troublemaker.

433
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,110
A paper fanning from Hamada would suck.

434
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,880
But! Hamada won't be stopped.

435
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,660
Hell yea...

436
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,180
Saying that before you even pull the card...

437
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,630
Sun dried fish to the nose

438
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,630
Hamada

439
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,630
has won!

440
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,480
And riding Hamada's wave, Tanaka as well!

441
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,640
I'm out!

442
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,640
Struck with an exploding bolt

443
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,110
Good riddance to that.

444
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,110
Tanaka

445
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,110
has won!

446
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,540
Finally, Housei also has?

447
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,570
Fermented Tofu BOX

448
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,480

Flower Frog Stomach Drop

450
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,250
Hosei

451
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,250
has won!

452
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,560
This one's pretty "Hell Yeah"

453
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,190
That's the only one so I'll take it.

454
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,190
Alright!

455
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,130
Cards remaining

456
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,780
Are we really going to do these punishments?

457
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,700
I'm putting these three down face up.

458
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,400
YEAH!

459
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,200
FIRST!

460
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,480
THIS!

461
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,980
SHOCK MASK

462
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,580
SHOCK MASK!

463
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,780
There! Uhh, what is this?

464
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,080
Phf... erm... Fermented Tofu.

465
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:44,390
Fermented

YES!

472
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,930
Endo's got a chance!

473
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,620
This is absolutely nuts.

474
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,800
Big chance for me.

475
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,110
Give me a sec...

476
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,780
They all perfectly DONT MATCH.

477
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,120
You are in trouble.

478
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,460
How you want to do it?

479
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,290
Lay them right there.

480
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,760
Seriously though pick a good one.

481
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,140
The middle!

482
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,540
You copied me.

483
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,370
At a time like this you pick middle.

484
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,510
No dice?

485
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,750
FUCK YES!!

486
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,390
You've got to be shitting me.

487
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,520
Nothing.

488
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,690
Put them down.

489
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,460
This gonna be the last one?

490
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,570
I've got nothing from however many pulls.

491
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,740
HELL YEAH!!

492
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,740
He didn't pick middle this time.

493
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,040
He said "Hail Yeah" so its bad luck.

494
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,920
"Hail Yeah"

495
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,160
You said "Hail Yeah" Matsumoto-San.

496
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,180
Shock Mask

497
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,840

502
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,200
WHAT THE HELL!!

503
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,710
You traded into the

504
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,040
You traded into the exact same hand?

505
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:51,940
Matsumoto in trouble! What will happen?

506
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,920
Who will take the punishment? Matsumoto or Endo!?

507
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,830
Cards remaining

508
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,830
Line them up.

509
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,430
What is this battle?

510
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,730
It's really not looking good for me.

511
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:15,300
It should be mostly decided by now.

512
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,710
Middle!

513
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,350
Endo come on.

514
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,620
Raw Wasabi

515
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,620
Endo

516
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,620
has won!

517
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,040
This is...

518
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
So the punishment is?

519
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:49,210
Fermented Tofu BOX

520
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:49,210
Joker

521
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,270
Stink-type punishment.

522
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,270
I'm getting away.

523
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,000
You put your head in the box?... You can sit if you want.

524
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,480
It's that fermented SHIT

525
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,220
Yea, it's shitty.

526
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,220
It stinks.

527
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,580
Take a seat.

528
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,120
This is more than I expected.

529
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
Yes.

530
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,720
How do you put it in?

531
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,280
Put it in the front corner.

532
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Shut the lid.

533
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,280
STINKS!

534
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,380
STINKS!

535
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,380
STINKS!

536
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,650
STINKS!

537
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
STINKS!

538
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,000
STINKS!

539
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,520
That's it! LET ME OUT!

540
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,400
It's INSANE.

541
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,040
It's INSANE!

542
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
IT STINKS!

543
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,040
IT STINKS!

544
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,740
He always says that on these punishments.

545
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,950
Ah! Ah! Ah!

546
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,160
I'm stiff today.
