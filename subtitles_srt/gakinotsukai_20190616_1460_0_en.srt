2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,120
For the first time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende Chiki Chiki,

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,900
making a big reversal from a blunder!

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,460
An apology press conference
to raise your popularity~!!

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,460
I see.

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,970
Ehhh...

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,940
A bit of a bothersome idea.

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,620
We're doing it. We're doing it so...

9
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,080
Who is going to be fooled by this plan?

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,190
Who indeed?

11
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,560
I'm also not really looking forward to this.

12
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,810
Well, regardless of how much an apology
press conference increases your popularity,

13
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,860
we're still doing it.

14
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,040
That's right.

15
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,480
Well, if it's about increasing popularity,

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,510
it's no good, not in the slightest.

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,510
I see.

18
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,200
If you get in trouble,
you're obligated to do one.

19
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,920
I think it's good to learn
how to do this sort of thing.

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,900
If you don't do this sort of thing
often and you play it strangely,

21
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,390
in a few weeks, it'll be true.

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,520
"A lie turned true", that sort of thing.

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,620
Scary! Scary!!

24
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,000
Scary, isn't it?

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,430
Especially Hamada has got something.

26
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,430
No, no, no.

27
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,220
Even now, he's got many at home.

28
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,650
No, no, no. There's nothing.

29
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,650
He's got a bomb, really.

The rules are this:

40
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,640
Without knowing the circumstances of what you did,

41
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,160
you first apologize.

42
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,550
From there, the apology press conference begins.

43
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,570
Improvise a response to the reporters' questions.

44
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,830
Aim to up your popularity.

45
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,680
Ok, Tanaka let's go.

46
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,140
We're starting with me, got it.

47
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,500
First up to bat is Tanaka.
The details of his uneasy apology are?

48
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,980
Ah, there it is.

49
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:44,310

53
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,760
We already know it, right? The theme.

54
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,760
It's because of that, huh.

55
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,910
Oh, it's that.

56
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,850
Well, it fits his gloomy look.

57
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,110
If you said someone got caught doing this,
Tanaka would suddenly come to mind.

58
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,110
Now everyone, Tanaka is first up.

59
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,850
Let the apology press conference begin.

60
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,850
This kind of vibe, huh?

61
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,370
There's a lot more people than I expected.

62
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,460
This is pretty good. As expected.

63
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,340
His face is good!!

64
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,340
His face is good.

65
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,540
That's an "I messed up" face.

66
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,770
At this time,

67
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,540
I caused a lot of trouble and

68
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,540
I am truly and deeply sorry.

69
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,880
Oh, this is good.

70
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,880
Good, isn't it?

71
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,720
This is amazingly realistic.

72
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,800
It's also about how much you bow.

73
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,800
Yeah.

74
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,360
Woah, they're coming.

75
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,360
Woah, what, what are they doing?

76
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,230
Makes your heart race.

77
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,230
Excuse me.

78
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,800
The crime took place in the middle of the night after 2 a.m. but

79
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,760
right before the crime, what on
earth were you doing there?

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,600
He still doesn't know, right?

81
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,040
Yes, ummm...

82
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,430
As usual, um...

83
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,610
work ended,

84
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,350
I was going home, um...

85
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,100
but I was doing so, slowly.

86
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,980
To exercise my body a little bit, um...

87
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,840
"I'll go out", I thought. Yeah.

88
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,840
We're told the scene of the crime was

89
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,080
the veranda of a second story apartment.

90
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,840
How did you get up on a second story veranda?

91
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,060
Yes, ummm, well...

92
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,410
This ummm... a little like...

93
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,440
There was this pipe thing. Ummm...

94
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,640
There was something like a pipe.

95
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,570
Once we watch Tanaka, is it okay if we stop?

96
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,430
We put him through it for about an hour and

97
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,820
then "Is it okay if we stop here?"

98
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,620
I put my feet on there and

99
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,390
entered the second floor.

100
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,890
It's said that you stole several pair of women's underwear that were drying on the veranda.

101
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,730
There were underwear drying that were to your liking?

102
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,670
In a nutshell, that's right.

103
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,080
Ummm...

104
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,660
It's better not to say in a nutshell.

105
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,060
Of course, um... well, you can't take it.

106
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,010
I know that but...

107
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,870
As a result, um...

108
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,870
What was that just now?

109
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,440
I became unable to control myself.

110
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
No good, you're no good!

111
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,830
The worst!

112
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,690
That comment was the worst!!

113
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Incidentally, was this the first time?

114
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,770
That is, how many times have you done this?

115
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,570
Ah, this is the first time.
This is really the first time.

116
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:24,120
Previously, I've not done this sort of thing even once. Yeah, yeah.

117
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,380
What were you going to use those underwear for?

118
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,060
This is important.

119
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,570
The truth is, um...

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,490
It's important.

121
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,300
My... my own use, so to speak.

122
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,920
For your own use?

123
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,920
They'll take pictures for that.

124
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,640
Do you want to increase your popularity?!!

125
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,310
It's sliding down.

126
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,310
Yeah.

127
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,710
On that note, Tanaka-san, at your house,

128
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,560
we've heard several thousand pairs of
women's underwear have been discovered.

129
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,570
Were they all stolen?

130
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,570
Is it not the first time?

131
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,920
That's right.

132
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,390
Is everything stolen?

133
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,390
No, some of them I've bought.

134
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,250
Bought them?

135
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,560
He bought them.

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,190
But several thousand?

137
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,190
That's good.

138
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,390
In that case, do you have any final remarks to everyone?

139
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,190
At this time, um... well...

140
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,010
For my troublesome behavior,
I am truly and deeply sorry.

141
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,890
I've committed a crime.
Hereafter, as for work, um...

142
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,890
I'd like to return.

143
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,890
Not a chance!

144
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,050
At this time,
I am truly and deeply sorry.

145
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,050
Stealing underwear and putting it on, this guy.

146
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,050
Can you do that in the morning?

147
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,010
Good work.

148
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,010
Good work.

149
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,450
No, that's really...

150
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,040
You're done.

151
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,240
Your popularity is ruined.

152
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,180
You can't make a comeback.

153
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,180
Eh?

154
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,850
That wasn't an apology to the person you stole from.

155
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,860
Ahhh! That's true, isn't it!?

156
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,560
Because there's a victim more or less.

157
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,280
But I stole several thousand pairs.

158
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,550
Who do I apologize to?

159
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,200
Yeah, because you took it.

160
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Well, that's right.

161
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,720
The next challenger is Hamada.

162
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,630
Apology Reason:

163
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,630
Dine and Dashing

164
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,630

166
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,630
The apology reason is dine and dashing.

167
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,850
Wow, it's really realistic.

168
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,560
Wow, wait a minute. This is super realistic.

169
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,350
At this time,
for the trouble I've caused,

170
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,310
I am truly and deeply sorry.

171
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,210
Ah, but he's giving a good face.
As expected.

172
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,450
His looking down is good.

173
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,640
That's right.
In any case, you can't really see his face.

174
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,530
Hamada-san, this time,

175
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,530
Yes?

176
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,400
it's said this was a midday crime,

177
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,990
at roughly what time did it take place?

178
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,050
Eh...

179
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,050
Well, my memory is a little unclear but

180
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,810
That sort of thing isn't good.

181
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,820
midday, 2 p.m. or around 2 p.m.

182
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,880
Why did you dine and dash
at a Kawasaki family restaurant?

183
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,490
From here, he already understands.

184
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,040
If you laugh, you're horrible.

185
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,950
Just now, he smiled a bit.

186
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,080
He smiled?

187
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,750
He smirked.

188
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,800
His lips loosened.

189
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,840
Sorry.

190
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,080
Ahhh, no good, no good.

191
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,720
He's smiling.

192
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,150
That's not crying.

193
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,550
He's thinking. During that time.

194
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,590
No good. If he laughs, it's no good.

195
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,650
Well, I didn't have that feeling.

196
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,500
You call it dine and dashing but

197
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,690
it's not really that.

198
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,370
This is the worst denial.

199
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,040
Hamada-san, this your second arrest for dine and dashing, isn't it?

200
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,800
Eh!?

201
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,960
He's done this before.

202
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,100
He's done it before.

203
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,100
I deeply regret this.

204
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,470
This guy is the worst.

205
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,060
Do you recognize that your actions were wrong?

206
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,260
Um, well, I think what I did was bad, but

207
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,760
dine and dashing? In this era,

208
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,580
you can do it?

209
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,510
You!

210
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,600
You did it in these times! You did.

211
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,780
Objectively, he did. Objectively.

212
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,920
No...

213
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,370
I'll pay.

214
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,120
You still haven't apologized to the store owner.

215
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,000
You, where are you?!

216
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,490
Yeah, no good! No good, no good.

217
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,630
He's getting fed up.

218
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,770
No, what's really going on here?

219
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,060
There's a few differences of opinion, but

220
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,970
I dine and dashed at a family restaurant.

221
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,280
I promise to never do it again and

222
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,840
from the bottom of my heart,
I'd like to apologize.

223
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,680
Honestly, I am deeply sorry.

224
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,610
Is that so?

225
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,760
I'm already dumbfounded.

226
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,040
I'm not convinced.

227
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,840
He's no Miyane-san. (newscaster)

228
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,320
I couldn't follow anything.

229
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,440
You couldn't follow it.

230
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,680
I'm not satisfied with that.

231
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,720
You ending this press conference.

232
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,300
I can't accept that.

233
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,520
What the heck.

234
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,640
He's getting fed up.

235
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Already... hahaha!

236
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,610
I hate it, wow.
That place is rough.

237
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,900
Ehhh?

238
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,410
What was that?

239
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,000
Terrible.

240
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,970
They said I dine and dashed.

241
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,690
Your apology...

242
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,690
But you didn't apologize.

243
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,230
You turned back like this and
unexpectedly started complaining.

244
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,960
A lot.

245
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,740
What are you saying?
Do you even understand?

246
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,970
He's laughing too much!

247
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,140
Third up is Endo.

248
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,270
Apology Reason:

249
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,270
Falsification of
Resume

250
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,270
m 0 0 l -20 -1.1 l -20 10 l 20 10 l 20 1.1 l 0 0

251
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,270
m 0 0 l -20 0 l -20 7.6 l 20 10 l 20 0 l 0 0

252
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,270
The apology reason is falsification of his resume.

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,790
It's like he's kind of making a face.

254
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,440
That's the face he does for his "Ho ho hoi" gag.

255
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,310
Ahhh, I hate this face.

256
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,580
I also hate this face.

257
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,410
At this time,
for the trouble I've caused,

258
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,920
I am truly and deeply sorry.

259
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,900
He's being theatrical.

260
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,570
Ah, is that so?

261
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,770
For your "Bus Hijacking" performance, huh.

262
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,870
It was smelly, smelly.
Really smelled.

263
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,760
It's been 27 years since
you entered show business.

264
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,840
You've been deceiving the
public for a long time but

265
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,520
how are you feeling right now?

266
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,160
To the members of the public

267
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,360
and everyone it has affected, my seniors,

268
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,440
of course my partner, my family, my juniors.

269
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,850
To everyone that loves me.

270
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,000
Juniors that love you?

271
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,010
Well, it's a problem caused by my own actions.

272
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,280
I made it from nothing, so I'm deeply remorseful.

273
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,970
Endo-san, you took up being a sportscaster.

274
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,380
I think that was a new challenge but

275
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,330
that's dead now. How do you feel?

276
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,170
Ah, so that's how it is.

277
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,520
That's right. Um, well...

278
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,440
Since childhood, I've always played baseball and

279
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,760
been involved in sports.

280
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,520
Well, to have done this

281
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,640
it's really frustrating, I think.

282
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,460
Frustrating?

283
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,460
It's frustrating.

284
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,210
Endo-san, what is "frustrating"?

285
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,650
That's going to be asked.

286
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,650
It's going to be asked.

287
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,390
What's frustrating?

288
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,160
Well, rather than myself

289
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,880
everyone that has cared about me,
wherever they are in society.

290
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,080
About those people that I've betrayed,

291
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,690
it's really frustrating, I think.

292
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,200
"Wherever they are in society."

293
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,020
This controversy.

294
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,560
We're told this originates with Endo-san's last academic career.

295
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,840
Because you say your high school alma mater was in Shikoku but

296
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,330
no school record of you
was able to be found.

297
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,560
You're not a high school graduate but a middle school graduate, is that it?

298
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,830
He's laughing.

299
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,830
Yes.

300
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,000
It's my own inadequacy, but just a little bit,

301
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,970
I wanted to look good, that's what I felt.

302
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,990
It was selfish, but I did it.

303
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,700
On that note, you've told the story that during your high school senior year,

304
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,930
you served as captain and were
scouted to play professionally but

305
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,450
was this also a lie?

306
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,250
He's sweating a lot.

307
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,740
That's right. Um...

308
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,070
Yeah... it is.

309
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,410
Yeah... yeah it is.
That's right.

310
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,240
What about you being a
Hanshin (baseball) fan?

311
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,580
That too, even now, won't change but

312
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,770
on the other hand, the other people...

313
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,620
On the other hand?

314
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,310
What do you mean "on the other hand"?

315
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,420
It came up. There.
It came from the crowd.

316
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,490
On the other hand...

317
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,680
He laughed! He's laughing!

318
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,140
He laughed.

319
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,140
He's laughing!

320
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,710
Just now, he clearly laughed.

321
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,240
Hanshin fans...

322
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,240
The worst thing you can do.

323
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,380
Answer the previous question.

324
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,430
What is "on the other hand"?

325
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,430
Yes?

326
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,460
It's coming from the crowd.

327
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,210
I say on the other hand. That...

328
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,380
For people like me,

329
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,600
when it comes to supporting the Tigers,

330
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,100
it creates problems and

331
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,600
it will create problems for everyone supporting the Tigers, I think...

332
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,140
What are you saying?
Do you even understand?

333
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,640
Exactly.

334
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,480
He's laughing too much!!

335
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,260
Excuse me.
Do you have any final words for everyone?

336
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,550
From now on, I'll reflect and

337
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,280
I really want to do my best with the opportunities that I've been given.

338
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,700
This situation is really serious.
I'm deeply sorry.

339
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,430
As somewhat expected...

340
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,560
A lot of Endo's roughness was apparent in that conference

341
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,280
You! Don't laugh like that.

342
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,760
I didn't understand what they were asking at all.

343
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,630
So that's why you were laughing.

344
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,630
That's right.

345
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,910
You could do that laughing
over and over on "Good Day!"

346
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,160
Is that good enough? I'm sorry.

347
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,500
I'm sorry! Really.

348
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,950
Are you running away!?

349
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,420
Apology Reason:

350
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,420
Neighborhood

Fourth up is Housei.

354
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,420
The apology reason is a neighborhood dispute.

355
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,610
His face is...

356
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,980
What face is that?

357
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,480
Well, the feeling isn't good but

358
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,490
he's making one.

359
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,480
Eh, at this time,

360
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,230
Everyone, I'm sorry for the
great troubles I've caused.

361
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,440
I am truly and deeply sorry.

362
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,480
Well, his hair isn't thinning very much.

363
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,780
Would you like to apologize
to the victims of this affair?

364
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,520
Yes. Since then, I've thought
about it a lot and I'm really

365
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,910
deeply apologetic.

366
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:00,710
From here on, whatever
I'm able to do, I want to do it.

367
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,120
To go on for 3 years,

368
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,250
I think it has been a long and difficult time for your victim.

369
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,250
He's been doing it for 3 years!?

370
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,040
That's pretty long.

371
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,040
Yes.

372
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,510
For myself too, thinking about it now,

373
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,900
it feels like it's been so long.

374
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,550
No, he's playing the victim card.

375
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:22,430
What was your grievance with your
neighbor that started all of this?

376
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:30,130
It was probably the
neighbor's dog's poop.

377
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:34,780
Then, at that time, I cleaned
up whatever there was but

378
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,800
that became a frequent occurrence.

379
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,980
I gave them a slight warning and

380
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,200
there was a bit of a quarrel
because of that. Yes.

381
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,190
That's the origin of it.

382
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,580
Early in the morning,
you open your window and

383
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,470
play a boombox at max volume but

384
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,730
what sounds were you playing?

385
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,670
Well, usually

386
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,650
enka.

387
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,650
Enka?

388
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,140
So it was enka?
In addition to the music,

389
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,610
it's said you were making strange noises.

390
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,840
I thought by making strange noises,
I could intimidate the other party.

391
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,830
What were the strange noises?
Could you be more specific?

392
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,160
Eh... the strange noises I did then?

393
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,160
Yes.

394
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,980
While the music is blaring,

395
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,050
"Gyaaa~!!" is what I'd do.

396
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,950
What was that just now?

397
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,950
After he said it, he went "pfff".

398
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,460
At times, on the neighbor's
walls and garage

399
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,240
it seems you did graffiti in poop but

400
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
what did you write?

401
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,270
"Never erase this."

402
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,030
Hmm.

403
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,310
What was that?

404
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,700
What's that supposed to mean?

405
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,290
What does that mean?

406
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,510
Are you laughing a little?

407
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,510
Is this a joke to you?!

408
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,760
What do you think this press conference is?

409
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,800
Ah, he's laughing again.

410
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,120
I'm deeply sorry. Truly.

411
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,480
He apologized!

412
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,720
I'm deeply sorry.

413
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,120
Is that good enough?

414
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,540
No, no...

415
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,480
I don't feel you're being sincere.
Don't end this on your own.

416
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,200
He said "Is that good enough?"

417
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,870
Saying "Is that good enough?" is terrible.

418
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,240
I'm deeply sorry!

419
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,730
I'm deeply sorry. Really!

420
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,680
Is that good enough? I'm sorry.

421
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,280
Finally, a few words to everyone please.

422
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm sorry! Really.

423
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,600
Are you running away?!

424
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,260
I'm sorry.

425
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,810
He's ran away.

426
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,600
You can't run away.

427
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,270
He ran away. He ran away.

428
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,890
That was no good. As expected,

429
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,820
he laughed and ran away.

430
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,030
He laughed for a long time.

431
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,030
He did.

432
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,340
That was the worst.

433
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,440
No, what is this?

434
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,590
No, it's your own remarks.

435
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,290
Ending the press conference yourself,
that's definitely no good.

436
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,200
Saying "Is that good enough?"

437
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,000
"Is that good enough?"

438
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,440
Tie your necktie properly!

439
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,660
That's right.

440
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,900
They're going to say that.

441
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:22,410
Apology Reason:

442
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:22,410
Indecent
Exposure

443
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:22,410
m 0 0 l -20 -1.1 l -20 10 l 20 10 l 20 1.1 l 0 0

444
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:22,410
m 0 0 l -20 0 l -20 7.6 l 20 10 l 20 0 l 0 0

445
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,590
Last is Matsumoto, who also
has a job as a commentator.

446
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,410
The apology reason is indecent exposure.

447
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,740
He's looking somewhat self-important.

448
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,630
Wait a minute.
Shouldn't he straighten his tie?

449
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,430
Why did he loosen his collar and necktie?

450
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,430
At this time, for the trou...ble I've caused,

451
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,980
I'm truly and deeply sorry.

452
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,260
He stuttered!

453
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,950
Hamada, he fumbled over his words.

454
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,340
His tie is loose and he's fumbling his words.

455
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,200
Pay attention to your tie.

456
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,210
Matsumoto-san, when you were arrested, it seems you were hiding your face.

457
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,050
Yes, ummm...

458
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't get his face.

459
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,080
"That was embarrassing", I thought. My own actions, those were embarrassing, so

460
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,120
"I can't show my face to everyone", I felt.

461
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,060
That's what I thought. Yes.

462
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,870
This time, you were naked
hanging around in a park

463
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,680
and a passing couple reported you,
resulting in you getting arrested, but

464
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,040
why did you do those things?

465
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,480
Yes. Well...

466
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,870
Publicly, that definitely isn't

467
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,720
acceptable, I understand that but

468
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,710
in regards to being naked... to do that um...

469
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,020
I had no ill intent.

470
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,400
About that, my thoughts on
being naked are, that happened.

471
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,620
Huh? Huh?
I don't really understand what he means.

472
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,840
He hasn't apologized at all.

473
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,810
He's losing his composure.

474
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,040
You're a celebrity so
what you did was okay!?

475
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,720
Ah, here he is.

476
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,810
Sorry, ummm...

477
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:03,480
Yes. I'm a celebrity so, of course, I need to use common sense and

478
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,720
I always have those feelings but

479
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,170
perhaps those feelings became
too strong and due to stress

480
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,770
I did those things.

481
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,080
That's an excuse!

482
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
Yes, sorry.

483
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,900
Apologize sincerely.

484
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,370
The one you were arrested
at was Komazawa Park but

485
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,180
At Komazawa Park, we've heard that you decided on a circular route but

486
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,630
what route was that?

487
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:33,810
Generally, that was the marathon course.

488
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,110
The marathon course?

489
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,110
There's a marathon course, but

490
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,300
I was going in the opposite direction around it.

491
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,480
When passing by the people doing the marathon...

492
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,060
According to the information
from when you were arrested,

493
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,280
We're told that Matsumoto-san had phimosis.
Is this true?

494
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,400
Yes. I, um...

495
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,650
Tightly.

496
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,750
Tightly?

497
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,310
He laughed!

498
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,310
Ah, he laughed!

499
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,010
Yeah, he's laughing.

500
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,580
He's laughing.

501
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,790
Is there anything you'd like to say to your partner Hamada-san?

502
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,880
Yes, um, we've really been
together since elementary school,

503
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,720
at Yoshimoto...

504
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,990
Since he was also the one that proposed we work together, really in regards to him

505
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,420
I'm really, deeply sorry about that.

506
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,280
I really hope everyone can get past this, despite what Hamada's done.

507
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,590
Hey, what was that?

508
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,540
This means you're going to quit too?

509
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,170
You're going to quit show business?

510
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,460
Hamada

511
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,640
must stop...

512
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,220
That's really the worst.

513
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,620
It's the worst.

514
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,560
What the heck.

515
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,390
He's laughing so much.

516
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,280
Wait, if I think about Hamada's
feelings, I can't say anything more.

517
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,590
I don't know. Please ask him.

518
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,170
What the heck.

519
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:02,820
Finally, is there anything
you'd like to tell everyone?

520
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,190
Yes, well, people after all

521
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:13,080
can't exactly go out without
wearing clothes, I've learned.

522
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,280
That I really understand and

523
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,040
I hope to let Hamada know as well.

524
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,830
Sorry, about that last thing you said,

525
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,310
does that mean Hamada-san
also often goes out in the nude?

526
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,250
No, sorry. I have no comment about that.

527
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,050
No, no, no.

528
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,170
Something like "no comment" isn't
okay at an apology press conference.

529
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:31,780
Yeah.

530
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,470
It's an apology press conference! You can't say no comment at an apology press conference!

531
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,030
That's right.

532
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,570
What about Hamada-san?

533
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,650
That guy is really

534
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,530
that sort of guy.

535
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,300
No, what sort... what sort of stuff?

536
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,520
He's laughing.

537
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,520
He's a good guy.

538
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,380
He's laughing.

539
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,000
He's a good guy.

540
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes...

541
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,270
Yes.

542
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,170
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

543
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,170
I'm sorry.

544
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,040
Stop already.
After all that, bowing that deeply.

545
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,180
Take care of that necktie already.

546
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,020
That really is...

547
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,110
Tie your necktie properly!

548
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,300
That's right.

549
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,130
They're going to say that.

550
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,840
That's no good. This is no good.

551
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,910
Come on, like that guy says.

552
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,000
Ah, this is no good.

553
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,600
That's right.

554
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,600
That was terrible.

555
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,950
Remarkably bad.

556
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,670
He was laughing.

557
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,850
He laughed, yeah.

558
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,520
He laughed the most?

559
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,520
That's right.

560
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,430
Completely worthless.

561
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,360
Ummm...

562
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,910
Amazing, eh? People's energy.

563
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah, it's amazing.

564
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,000
Amazing, right?

565
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,170
It's intense. It's intense in there.

566
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,140
This strange sweating started.

567
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,000
After that...

568
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,160
The one always heckling was director Takahashi.

569
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,990
That guy got me mad.

570
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,240
Takahashi... Takahashi did it.

571
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,240
Ah, is that so?

572
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,240
It was Takahashi.

573
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,860
That was Takahashi.

574
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,860
Ehhh!

575
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,160
Halfway through, I suddenly saw, Takahashi?!!

576
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,190
Because I was thinking
"What's this guy doing?", I got angry.

577
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,850
I thought it was wonderful.

578
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,840
It's a chimpanzee.

579
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,840
It's a chimpanzee.
