00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,530
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,290
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,820
Hello everyone

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,710
It's Shimofuri

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,930
Hello everyone

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,450
Amazing!

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,980
This is Shirofumi's first time, nice to meet you

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,630
Isn't this the declining-in-popularity-Shimofumi?

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,960
Wait, Matsumoto

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,060
What the hell?
Matsumoto, where did you hear this?

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,410
Never heard of it.
-Seems wrong

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,860
We're on the rise.
-We're still on the rise

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,680
I was wrong

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,840
We're just getting started!

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,400
Stop this, Matsumoto!

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,990
So, this time

17
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,260
When it comes to Wednesday Downtown

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,710
There are horror-oriented pranks

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,260
Among these, Hamada's favorite is

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,220
The "Somebody Series"

21
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,600
Ahhhh interesting

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,460
I heard that Hamada enjoys this the most

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,900
Really likes it!

24
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,040
He watches it with his whole mouth open

25
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,630
That wide?

26
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,110
Previously, it was said that the most frightening thing is to open the door and find someone

27
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,460
Indeed

28
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,150
"Someone in the back seat of the car"

29
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,200
"Wake up and find someone"

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,240
And others like "someone's in the bed"

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,960
Every time Hamada smiles very happily

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,600
But there should be none left

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,490
Well

34
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,330
This time, the "Someone Series" is twisted slightly

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,060
It will be used to validate a relatively novel theory

36
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,160
Even if a foreigner has lived in Japan for a long time, the first words that come out of their mouth when they are surprised will be their native language

37
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,720
What is this?

38
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,800
They'll react

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,130
A slightly different scenario

40
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,510
"GOD DAMN" or something like that?

41
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,410
Eh?

42
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,480
"GOD DAMN" and the like

43
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,930
Seriously, just leave

44
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,740
Takada really made us nervous too

45
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,390
This volume is the that of the ring announcer

46
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:49,930
Sorry

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,870
Shortly, a verification involving foreigners

48
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,240
Also

49
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,630
How long with Rossy go along with suspicious things?

50
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,140
Little girl selling matches?

51
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,100
Men with scary faces have been told "I won't give you my daughter"

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:31,260
Even if a foreigner has lived in Japan for a long time, the first words that come out of their mouth when they are surprised will be their native language

53
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,770
So, this time, we are testing foreign people who are active in Japan

54
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,800
With an approach that has a 100% rate of scaring people

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
The dependable "Someone Series"

56
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,530
The initial target is

57
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,790
Girolamo has been here for 32 years?

58
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,780
This time the setting is

59
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,870
A locker room in the lounge

60
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,080
Japanese still isn't great

61
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,730
This is the man

62
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,920
It's this guy every time

63
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,110
I Love you baby

64
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,070
I Love you…

65
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,210
@%#$!!!

66
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,910
Seems like he said something

67
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,950
What did he say?

68
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,000
I Love you…

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,390
@%#$!!!

70
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,620
Asshole, what the hell!

71
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,730
The second sentence is "asshole" but

72
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,450
The first sentence sounds like Italian

73
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,550
What exactly did he say?

74
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,100
There's a strange man here, a stalker

75
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,340
We confirmed

76
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,680
There was a particularly... particularly strange person in...

77
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,350
How are you feeling?

78
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,850
It was a shock!

79
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,920
What did you say when you saw this male?

80
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,160
Ah, it's "die!"

81
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,590
Ah... Japanese...

82
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,370
Not his native language

83
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,130
Yes, Japanese

84
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,520
Will it change back to speak Italian when you are scared?

85
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,940
You usually speak Japanese.
-But... but...

86
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,470
I really like "die!"

87
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,610
From time to time, i'll say it

88
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,010
What should you have said in Italian at this time?

89
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,250
Mamma Mia would be better, right?

90
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,660
But, for me, the usage of "die!" is the same

91
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,030
Die!!

92
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,790
Asshole, what the hell!

93
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,190
Why "die!"?

94
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,330
So, the next target is

95
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,380
Who would say "die!"?

96
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,020
Wrong way to use it, right?

97
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,120
In Japan for 23 years: Caiya

98
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,350
Caiya is really scary

99
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,980
The setting is "someone is in the back seat of the car"

100
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,060
Might get hit

101
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,730
While a fictitious interview was in progress

102
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,640
The person is placed on standby in the back seat of the private car she drove in

103
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,420
Preparations complete

104
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,890
Really could be hit in the chaos of the situation

105
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,930
After this

106
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,010
Caiya, who was talking to someone while returning to the car

107
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,030
Definitely not in a happy phone conversation

108
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,450
It's true, a lot has happened

109
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,070
Who are you talking to on the phone?

110
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,700
Already in English

111
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,840
If she is scared like this

112
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,500
There should be a sound like "Oh my God"

113
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,080
What'll happen?

114
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,490
OK  see you soon  bye

115
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,110
A simple reaction

116
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,860
And due to too much fear

117
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,360
She escaped from the car with full force

118
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,020
Here we revealed the truth

119
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,250
How are you feeling?

120
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,020
I'm sorry, I'm not thinking straight right now

121
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,230
Seeing someone in the car

122
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,800
This is already trauma, trauma!

123
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,900
Oh my God, I'm scared to death, oh my god

124
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,380
When calming down, she spoke English from time to time

125
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,710
But the first reaction was a horror movie-like scream

126
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,520
The next target is

127
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,690
In Japan for 13 years, Nwala

128
00:06:53,470 --> 00:07:01,730
This time, he was set up to sleep in a hotel and "wake up to find someone"

129
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,240
So

130
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,310
We first confirm he's asleep

131
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,010
Before an older man enters

132
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,990
This guy is awesome!

133
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,020
This is so scary

134
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,080
Oh wow, this is so bad

135
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,330
This would definitely be scary

136
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,970
The next thing to do before he wakes up naturally is just to wait

137
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,390
This job is also not easy

138
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,070
Then after two hours

139
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,390
So

140
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,020
This is a normal reaction

141
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,120
Who?

142
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,930
Who?

143
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:17,410
So scared that he fell out of bed, but the first sentence was in Japanese

144
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,000
Who?

145
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,650
Who?

146
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,210
Scared the hell out of me!

147
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,980
No English at all

148
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,760
Give me a break, really

149
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,010
Authentic Japanese

150
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,700
Definitely won't sleep tonight

151
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,970
Indeed

152
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
How could you do this? Seriously

153
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,100
I can't sleep. He's still here!

154
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,310
I have to get up at four o'clock to go to "Good Morning Studio"

155
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,240
This program is live!

156
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,480
I can't sleep anymore

157
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,010
Angry

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,780
And I locked the door

159
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,890
How could you still come in?

160
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,590
Do you know what a master key is?

161
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,890
Master Key

162
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,530
What kind of timing is this?

163
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,010
The next target is

164
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,370
In Japan for 33 years: Dave Spector

165
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,050
This time it was in Dave's dedicated cloakroom

166
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,950
Where the man with a high success rate is lurking

167
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,420
So, we start immediately

168
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,190
Terrifying

169
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,660
Eh, what's this?

170
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,430
What? Who is this?

171
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,180
Eh, what's this?

172
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,280
Completely in Japanese

173
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,220
What? Who?

174
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,420
Who the hell is this?

175
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,550
Scared the hell out of me

176
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,020
It's really "oh my godou!" this one

177
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,930
He even says "oh my god" in Japanese

178
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,280
33 years of living in Japan were not in vain

179
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,670
It's really "oh my godou!" this one

180
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,910
Not even here

181
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,060
The last target is

182
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,270
Really want to here them speak English

183
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,340
Yeah

184
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,450
21 years in Japan: Bobby Ologun

185
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,100
Bobby is also very timid

186
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,950
The set up is "someone in the bed" trick

187
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,380
This time we let the family go out first

188
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,220
A verification of an isolated single person in his own house

189
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,540
When he gets home, he first performs the daily task of checking stock prices

190
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,510
Now he's ready for bed

191
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,440
So

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,970
Unbelievably he doesn't notice there's someone next to him

193
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,980
Will he sleep with an older man he doesn't know for a whole night?

194
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,350
Bobby didn't notice the man hiding under the blanket and went to sleep

195
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,990
However

196
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,990
What the hell--

197
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,640
What the hell--

198
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,570
Bobby who felt a sense of dissonance from his back when he turned over

199
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,380
What the hell--

200
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,620
The first sentence was clearly in Japanese

201
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,820
Immediately after

202
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,450
He fell into a state of panic with the dramatic effect of frantically pressing the wrong switch

203
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,670
And

204
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,740
Who!?

205
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,140
It hurts...it hurts...it hurts

206
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,350
He knocks down the sliding door in one move

207
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,560
The truth is revealed

208
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,360
What the hell?

209
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Crying crying crying

210
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,100
Someone has died

211
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,000
I... I don't know anything

212
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,440
Did you sleep in the bed?

213
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,980
I got in

214
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,440
Did you not pay attention at all at that time?

215
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,110
Yeah

216
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,380
I was sleeping on my side the whole time

217
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,590
By the way, what do you say when you are frightened in Nigerian?

218
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,630
In summary
Japanese pranks will always end in Japanese

219
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,500
The result turned out to be this

220
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,950
Yes
-No native language spoken

221
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,040
This is too much, not good for the heart

222
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,020
It's scary to watch

223
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,900
But, how to put it?

224
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,940
They'll calm down eventually

225
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,400
Then they'll speak their native language

226
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,250
Yeah, at the time they won't

227
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,920
They must be dreaming in Japanese, right?

228
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,350
Stayed too long, have become completely Japanese

229
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,000
Are there such people? Only dreaming in the native language

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,430
If you live too long, your dreams become Japanese, right?

231
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:23,390
I want it to keep going like this until Bobby speaks his native language

232
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,020
Poor thing
-Its enough for him to hit the door

233
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,160
The doors of their house will be all gone

234
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,200
Incredible, the energy

235
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,580
The lights in the living room also flickered as if they were about to break

236
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,490
Lights and doors are running out

237
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,420
The light is the same as lightning

238
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,210
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

239
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,080
Savannah's Takahashi

240
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:59,060
This time, I bring a project about the world's most innocent and gentle man

241
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:06,020
He is literally the most innocent and gentle man in the world

242
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,610
Please take a look

243
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,160
Rossy's acceptance of everything has gone so far that its scary

244
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,080
You must all know Rossy, right?

245
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,390
He is really gentle, innocent, and tolerant of all things

246
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,010
Totally non-angry, non-doubting

247
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,430
A man who feels nothing is out of place

248
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,400
Indeed

249
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,700
Do you still remember the "Strange Man Contest" project that was conducted for him?

250
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:41,020
In a project such as, persuading a child to continue to be a shut-in

251
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,860
On the way, he suddenly became furious with the mother of the child

252
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,460
Loudly scolded the mother "how can you do this to your child"

253
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,270
This is also a reflection of his gentle caring nature

254
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,530
The ending was that Rossy became shut in the room and couldn't get out

255
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,340
Even at that inexplicable point, he accepted it without question

256
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,330
He's really an incredible man!

257
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,820
That part was scary

258
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,080
We did all kinds of tricks on this gentle Rossy

259
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,390
To what extent will he accept them?

260
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,430
This is worrying

261
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,510
Rossy's acceptance of everything has gone so far that its scary

262
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:26,630
So, we first asked the person who knows Rossy best

263
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,140
Rossy's acceptance of everything has gone so far that its scary

264
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,380
His wife

265
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,710
He tolerates everything, basically

266
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,640
I think it will be incredible for everyone to witness

267
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,980
I really feel like that

268
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,520
Have you encountered any strange things lately?

269
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,820
Recently...

270
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,550
For example, the entrance to a convenience store

271
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,590
The ruler they measure the approximate height of a thief

272
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,590
※It is also available at financial institutions, amusement parks, etc. It is used for witnesses to recall the approximate height of the possible culprit.

273
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,730
Rossy he...

274
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,700
He thought it was normal to measure his own height and happily did so

275
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,470
And also

276
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,140
He has very bad eyesight

277
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,410
If he doesn't wear contact lenses, he is completely blind

278
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,780
Sometimes he will forget to take off his contact lenses and go to sleep

279
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,480
And still put another pair on the next morning

280
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,350
Won't even notice he's wearing double contact lenses

281
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,350
So, we spent several days watching Rossy closely

282
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,450
The first day

283
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,360
Rossy, he is really gentle

284
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,730
Help with incredibly heavy luggage

285
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,320
Feels like it will be very interesting

286
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,470
What happens if he's told, "Please can you take this luggage that cannot be put on the floor"?

287
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,770
Uh, well, I think...

288
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,970
He will always hold it

289
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,040
They'll say "Don't put it on the floor", right?
-That's right

290
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,570
Then he won't put it on the ground

291
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,540
So, we called out Rossy for a fake job

292
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,310
So at this point

293
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,880
Sorry

294
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,490
Can you take this for me, please?

295
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,990
I forgot something, I need to go back quickly

296
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,130
Wow, so heavy

297
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,030
Sorry, this can not be put on the ground

298
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,760
Because inside are very valuable things

299
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,300
Is it okay if I leave for a little bit...for a little bit?

300
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,970
I'm very sorry.
-No problem

301
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,540
Sorry, obviously you're so busy. I'm very sorry. I'm sorry...

302
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,030
It looks so heavy!

303
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:25,430
As you can see, Rossy calmly agreed to carry a full 20kg box of sand

304
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,330
There is no difference with the sand on the ground

305
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,620
We also inexplicably added a requirement that prohibits putting it on the ground

306
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,100
Normally you'd put it on the ground

307
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,380
So far there is no doubt that the luggage was not put on the ground as agreed

308
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,570
Are not curious about what'd happen if put it on the ground?

309
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,670
Then

310
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,270
Sorry, sorry.
-It's okay, it's okay

311
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,940
Thank you very much. It's a big help.
-Don't mention it

312
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,410
Where are you going?

313
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,680
I'm going to go around to the back of the area

314
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,720
Because this luggage is very heavy

315
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,690
Does it mean...?

316
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,950
We'll walk a little bit, there might be a place to take a cab

317
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,920
If the pick-up point is close, you might as well take one

318
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,090
Let me walk you to the cab

319
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,050
So gentle

320
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,200
Thank you so much!

321
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,230
Kindly helped to carry the sand to the loading point

322
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,170
Next is

323
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,060
The cab drives to the wrong destination but charges as normal

324
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,440
He wont get angry

325
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,610
When paying...

326
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,550
Well...probably will hesitate a few times

327
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,820
Thank you

328
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,250
Um... please send me to TBS

329
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,250
TBS？

330
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,520
The one in Akasaka.
-Oh, it's in Akasaka, isn't it?

331
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,660
Ok
-Okay, thanks for the ride

332
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:47,640
The work destination from Shinbashi is Akasaka, about 3km away

333
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:53,630
However, the cab went to Shinagawa,  the opposite direction of Akasaka

334
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,220
The result?

335
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,920
You'd surely be angry

336
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,480
Mr. Driver, excuse me?
-Yes.

337
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,210
I'm wondering if we're going in the right direction

338
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,350
The wording is so gentle

339
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,650
I'm driving in the direction of Akasaka, TBS, so its fine

340
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,080
Really? What...

341
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,190
I feel like you are driving towards Shinagawa

342
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,220
Can you drive towards the centre?

343
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,820
If you drive in the direction of the sun

344
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,230
I think it will be closer to TBS

345
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,980
Relying on the afternoon sun and the position of the sun, the driver was directed to drive west

346
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,840
It's over there, over there

347
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,570
In terms of direction

348
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,710
No...that...
-Hahaha no no no

349
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,090
He's not angry

350
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,770
It's that way

351
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,850
I can get off here and transfer if you don't know the way

352
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,650
No need to...

353
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,080
Please stop for a moment

354
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,190
We're heading to Shinagawa now

355
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,940
Too gentle, right?

356
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,020
Uh... I don't think there's anything wrong with that

357
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,530
If I don't arrive, it's not good

358
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:55,470
Rossy started to get anxious about being late because of his serious personality

359
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,000
Now we are in the direction of TBS

360
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,940
No, no, that's not the right direction, although I'm taking the liberty of making that judgment

361
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,280
Maybe it's my fault

362
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,110
Please let me off here

363
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,980
I will get to the destination in some other way

364
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,920
Can I get out of the car now, please?

365
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,510
I can't say this

366
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,850
Here?

367
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,350
Just drop me off here. It's close to Shinagawa

368
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,850
Here, a little to the side

369
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,490
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
-We've already passed Shinagawa Station

370
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,330
Excuse me, can you let me out?

371
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,560
Mr. Driver, you've already driven past Shinagawa Station

372
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,260
Is this the direction of Akasaka?

373
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,000
No, no, Akasaka is in the opposite direction

374
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,430
You've got it wrong, Mr. Driver

375
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,670
However, this time the driver is determined not to let him off

376
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,290
What the hell is this setup?

377
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,450
So

378
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,840
I may have to do something not so good

379
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,880
I may contact the police

380
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,080
If you don't let me out

381
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,020
You may be held criminally liable

382
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,730
Hearing these 3 numbers the program team immediately softened

383
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,120
So we stopped here

384
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,230
I'm sorry I made such an arbitrary request

385
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,590
Arbitrary request?

386
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,530
Sorry, the fare is 2010 yen

387
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,530
Thank you

388
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,760
Despite being pulled further away from his destination

389
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,880
He is nonetheless thankful and paid the fair

390
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,810
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
-It's okay, it's okay

391
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,580
I'm sorry for making arbitrary demands

392
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,180
Sorry about making arbitrary demands?

393
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,780
What is this?

394
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,460
Day 2

395
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:45,740
Verification ③ Stranger asks to borrow his cell phone

396
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,870
A request from a complete stranger to "borrow a cell phone"

397
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,870
You'd surely want to refuse

398
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,320
He rightfully lends it

399
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,410
Hello?

400
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,780
Hey...

401
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,750
Hung up?

402
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,920
What is your unlock code?

403
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,990
Unlock code? What is it?

404
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,290
Is there an unlock code?

405
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,500
Can I call again?
-Yes, of course

406
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,020
Sorry about that

407
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:07,390
Doesn't even know of the existence of the unlock code and the phone doesn't have a lock screen

408
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,500
What about personal privacy...

409
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,740
3rd Day

410
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,990
Cookie asks him to look after his son for a while

411
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,640
If strongly requested

412
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,910
Probably would agree

413
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,990
During a meeting

414
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,430
A staff member leaves momentarily

415
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,420
Where do you live? Have you moved?

416
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,920
Is the room very spacious?

417
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,990
No, the room is not very spacious. 2LDK

418
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,030
You have two children?
-2, 2

419
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,230
Can the toys be packed up to make room?

420
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,170
Hmm?
-Can you make room by packing up their toys?

421
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,170
Toys can be packed to make room for almost one person's space

422
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,340
Can it sleep two children?

423
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,140
Two children?

424
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,510
Yeah probably

425
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,550
My wife always had a dream to study language abroad

426
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,860
But I don't have time to take care of children

427
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,260
Uh-?

428
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,460
Really?

429
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,290
When the time is confirmed can you please

430
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,360
Take care of my child for about 3 months

431
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,930
It is not something that can't be done

432
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,540
Because of a variety of reasons its not impossible, not impossible

433
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,340
But for example, going to school

434
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,440
And stuff like that

435
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,940
Taking them there and stuff

436
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,450
I don't mean transferring them my child's school

437
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,450
I mean parents and such

438
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,520
There are still many things that need to be adapted

439
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,520
If its stable then its fine

440
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,130
If the child is not given a happy experience

441
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,730
If they just suffer

442
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,870
So you can't take care of them?
-I'm not saying that

443
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,930
Although it is not impossible to take care of, but I can not go to your home to take care of them

444
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,040
But since you entrusted me with the care of a life

445
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:57,250
Rossy, who is very sensitive about human life and children's matters

446
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,140
Unexpectedly and carefully thought out and answered carefully

447
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,180
Well you can look at it as just an extended sleepover

448
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,910
No, 3 months is a little...

449
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,180
3 months is a bit... uh

450
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,220
Probably because someone else's kid is staying here

451
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,260
You'd feel a sense of responsibility, right?

452
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,100
You wouldn't say yes so easily

453
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,460
If the mood is "ah yeah fine"

454
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,670
It's just like borrowing something

455
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,600
"Then you can borrow it next time" or something like that...

456
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,970
3 months is a bit...
-I don't understand you, for example

457
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,140
3 months is a bit too long

458
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,310
1 week and 2 weeks is quite manageable

459
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,450
Then help me look after them for two weeks

460
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,420
That's perfectly fine!

461
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,050
2 weeks is perfectly fine!

462
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,290
But 3 months is a bit...

463
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,120
You take care of them for 2 weeks and then I pick them up for a day and then give you them back for another two weeks

464
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,130
It can be up to 3 months repeatedly

465
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,400
Eh?

466
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,290
Why does he look accepting of the length all of a sudden

467
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,460
Yeah... yeah

468
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,560
He is successfully convinced thanks to Cookie's sophisticated argument

469
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,240
Slowly ground into agreement

470
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,640
He is really gentle with children, no matter what children

471
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,840
We added something for Rossy, who is very gentle with children

472
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,290
Then I will contact you when I have the chance.
-Ok thank you

473
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,070
Thanks for your hard work

474
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,390
Big brother.
-Scared the hell out of me, yes?

475
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,000
Do you want to buy some matches?

476
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,400
The little girl who sells matches

477
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,000
Verification ⑤ The little girl who sells matches in 2019

478
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,000
Please.
-No, right?

479
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,900
Can you buy it?

480
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,340
How much, how much, how much, how much, how much, what to say?

481
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,510
How much? What should I say?

482
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,910
I can buy one

483
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,250
Okay, then 1000 yen, please

484
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,880
A little expensive

485
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,550
Just buy one, one

486
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,760
Here, here's your money. Give me the matches.
-Thanks

487
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,390
Go for it!
-Yes

488
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,560
Go for it!

489
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,290
Although a high price

490
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,050
He still accepted the scene with equanimity

491
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,880
Normally you'd be looking for a camera here

492
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,970
The unreasonableness of the tests slowly escalate

493
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,640
4th Day

494
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,500
Abandoned dogs on the roadside

495
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,350
Please be kind enough to take her in, she's a little bitch named Mocha

496
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,670
However this dog is

497
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,420
AIBO？

498
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,590
AIBO might be adopted by him

499
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,130
I'm not sure about that either

500
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,860
Would he be afraid?

501
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,770
May say "what is this?"

502
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,560
As you can see, after a short glance, he walks past

503
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,750
However

504
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,410
Immediately after this, he sent his wife this LINE

505
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,660
Do you want AIBO?

506
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:06,060
If you do at XX elementary school there's one, we could take it

507
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,800
AIBO? AIBO is the robot dog! Haha

508
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:18,300
There's an abandoned AIBO dog in a box named Mocha

509
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,210
It says "AIBO"

510
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,210
The kids will probably like it

511
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,380
Because of rushing to work

512
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,960
Although not personally taking it

513
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,040
As the abandoned dog is an electronic dog his feelings are less strong

514
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:41,810
Next was a verification as part of a fake health program

515
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,050
Firstly

516
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,740
Sorry, this microphone

517
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,070
The micro-mic has changed to coin operated

518
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,280
Coin-operated?
-Yes, coin-operated...

519
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,450
Verification ⑦ If you don't use a 100-yen coin the microphone wont work

520
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,390
How is this possible?

521
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,090
Rossy-san, could you please put in 100 yen first...

522
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,420
I know, I know, I'll get the money.
-You have some?

523
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,290
I'll go and look

524
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,290
Should have change, right?

525
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,430
His acceptance has reached ridiculous heights

526
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,170
How long does it last?
-How long does it last?

527
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,810
100 yen will last about an hour.
-That's great!

528
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,010
The more words you say, the faster the battery drops

529
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,410
Haha new type of microphone

530
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,980
It's perfectly fine!

531
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,430
No suspicion at all

532
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,820
Finally Rossy's over-acceptance is at the point of being frightening

533
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,850
Regardless, he puts on the micro-mic with 100 yen invested first

534
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:44,290
First of all, the physical strength test

535
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,450
Then

536
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,450
Ready ~ Start

537
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:56,610
The sound of 100 yen completely affects the important sound recording of the program.

538
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,180
Putting the cart before the horse

539
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,410
End

540
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,410
56th

541
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,650
There are so many?
-Yes

542
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,350
Ah, really?

543
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:08,610
However, Rossy did not care about this at all

544
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,950
So tired
-Well done

545
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,990
Thanks for the compliment

546
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,090
After this also

547
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,850
Round trip running

548
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,560
Above average

549
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:27,050
Accompanied by the sound of the mic he completes the seven physical tests

550
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,960
Next is the health diagnosis

551
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,850
So, without further ado

552
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,110
Let's have a health check

553
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,110
Yes, please

554
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,820
So please strip down to your underwear

555
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,820
Okay, understood

556
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,120
Then put your clothes in this basket

557
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,290
As you can see, Rossy took off his shirt

558
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,890
Now lets start the vision check

559
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,730
Please look at the table over there

560
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Verification ⑧ Stripping isn't necessary for the tests

561
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,480
Please stand in the white line

562
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,640
This

563
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,210
What? Ah, its a little hard to see it

564
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,710
To the left, ah, sorry

565
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,600
After that, these tests that had nothing to do with nudity

566
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:15,940
Finally, he gets dressed and goes to receive the results

567
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:20,790
The x-ray image is done
-Ok

568
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,090
Let's take a look.
-Ok

569
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,500
Can you see this part?
-No

570
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:31,640
You have a seed sprouting in your stomach.
-No, really?

571
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:42,580
Verification ⑨ Watermelon seed germinating in stomach

572
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,740
I presume its a watermelon seed

573
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,540
You've been...
-I've been eating watermelon lately

574
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,840
Do you swallow seeds?

575
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,580
Ah that's really watermelon seeds

576
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,850
Yes, two days ago

577
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:52,030
Karateka Yabetaro asked Rossy to eat some watermelon

578
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,990
Yes, i'll be careful in the future

579
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,600
I'll have to take all the seeds out in future

580
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,900
It's very rare

581
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,970
I'm also worried about Yabe, I ate it with him

582
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,750
He is still worried about others

583
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,370
Watermelon seeds sprouted in the x-ray image

584
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,840
I think he'll believe it

585
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,110
He still quite likes this kind of fantasy things

586
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,480
Has there been anything before? Something fantastical?

587
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,380
Fantasy - well - for example...

588
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,620
Isn't there a knife skill called "Chikiri" that cuts cabbage?

589
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,460
He felt that a more superior knife technique, "Ten Thousand Cuts", also existed

590
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:33,560
Another example is the Romance Car, which he thought was a train for the elderly.

591
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:33,560
※Romance Car: The term "Romance Car" was originally used to refer to a train with a Romance Seat, i.e., a couple's seat in a group of 2. In 1991, Odakyu Electric Railway registered the term as its own trademark, so it now refers specifically to the special trains operated by Odakyu Electric Railway

592
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,270
It's sprouting

593
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,940
It's like a bean sprout. Will it grow?

594
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,270
If there is enough nutrition in the stomach, it may grow

595
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,970
Although it was the first time I saw

596
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:48,410
This will not be a problem if left unattended

597
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,680
But what if?

598
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,820
If it grows into a watermelon fruit in the stomach, it's a big deal

599
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,520
This is really amazing, if it'll grow into a watermelon

600
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,990
There is medicine to make this bud wilt. I'll bring it to you now

601
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:05,230
This bottle is the medicine that makes the buds wilt

602
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,430
This bottle is the medicine that will destroy it

603
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,700
Please pay attention to the order of taking the medicine

604
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,900
If you don't germinate and drink this bottle of blight medicine, your stomach will be perforated

605
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,180
This is the end of the shoot

606
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,760
However, there is one last thing

607
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,980
The last verification is?

608
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,390
This is our first meeting

609
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,920
I'm the new AD Shino

610
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,560
Ah, the same last name

611
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,660
What?
-My name is Shino too

612
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,360
Is that so?
-Yes

613
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,230
Ah, sorry, my name is also Shino...

614
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,430
Which characters?

615
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:41,770
The city and vegetables

616
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,640
Yasei?

617
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,530
Yes, Yasei

618
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,640
I would say the "word" town with "wild" in Nogahara

619
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,740
Same word, same word, right?
-The same word!

620
00:33:49,910 --> 00:34:01,120
Verification⑩ Received a request from AD to borrow money

621
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:56,770
The fake AD has been present all day

622
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:01,320
He puts forward a request for money

623
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:07,920
Will Rossy lend money to someone he has just met and has no relationship with?

624
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,590
How much do you need?

625
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,600
I need 3 million

626
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,530
This is a little tough, and I don't have that much money

627
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,370
3 million, I can't get it by tomorrow

628
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,470
Tell me your contact information

629
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:23,370
I'll let you know if its possible

630
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,380
If you give up because of this it'll be difficult for you

631
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:34,570
Although he could not immediately come up with the loan because of his own financial problems...

632
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:41,960
Rossy nonetheless listened gently and carefully to the AD troubles

633
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,330
Work hard

634
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,430
We have to work together

635
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,490
And for some reason he makes the promise to "work together"

636
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,930
What the hell is working together?

637
00:34:52,150 --> 00:35:00,270
At this point, we move to ask him about the strange events over the past few days

638
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,590
So, we got him in under the guise of a fake program

639
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,990
Have you encountered anything unusual lately?

640
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,460
Recently? Is there a limit to what kind of thing?

641
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:19,060
Did you encounter any strange or unbelievable things in your daily life?

642
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,410
There are a bunch of them

643
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,200
The year number changed, something like that?

644
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,810
Say the watermelon thing!

645
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,100
I see.
-Different from the past

646
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,540
Within the last week

647
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,310
Something unusual, anything?

648
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,680
The weather is colder than expected, right?

649
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,650
I recently went to the dentist

650
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:44,120
Now I have dentures and need to get a new tooth or something

651
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,220
It's not about those things

652
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,830
Just 30 minutes ago things like this happened

653
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,810
Completely ignored

654
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,060
As we fear he will be unable to realize it himself

655
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,670
This is actually Wednesday Downtown

656
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,710
Oh-

657
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,880
Ah, scary!

658
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,450
Rossy's acceptance of all things is scary

659
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,290
No way

660
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,390
You accepted a lot of strange things

661
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:21,760
No, no. Is there someone else named Rossy?
-No, no, no

662
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,250
In summary
He's really scary

663
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,840
What's going on? What's going on?

664
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,890
Did you see the final conclusion?
-What's happened?

665
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,130
Sorry, I'm a little confused

666
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,800
He thinks there are a lot of Rossys, thinks its verifying different Rossys?

667
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,730
He didn't think anything weird happened to him, did he?
-That's probably it

668
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,960
Ah... I see

669
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,150
What did the other Rossys encounter

670
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,840
He himself hasn't encountered anything
-Thinks he hasn't

671
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,620
So other people named Rossy experienced lots of weird things

672
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,730
This is what he thinks it is?

673
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,360
So he thinks that nothing happened to him

674
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,850
To Rossy...
-He thinks it was all normal

675
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,980
You are now the closest to Rossy's mindset

676
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,970
Is that so?
-Seems like it

677
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,670
What do you think, Matsumoto?

678
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,510
The driver

679
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:18,240
This part is good, he didn't get angry at all

680
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,000
Using Rossy as a comparison

681
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,420
I would like to see the Hamada version of this same scenario

682
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,710
If it were Hamada...
-I'm sure he would have been furious

683
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,410
He'd probably kick the kid selling matches

684
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:40,940
Next is everybody's theories

685
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,820
Tonight's presenter is

686
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,780
Tamura Kenji!

687
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,920
The theory I have brought this time is this:

688
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,480
Men with scary faces have been told "I won't give you my daughter"

689
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,490
Won't give them

690
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:08,400
This is about people with scary auras meeting parents

691
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,130
Yes

692
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,400
If they go to meet the parents, they'll will be told that they won't give their daughter to someone like them

693
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,770
What do you think, Matsumoto? You have a daughter, right?

694
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,160
Me in the position of parent?

695
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,480
If someone with a scary look comes

696
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,520
Well... definitely not if they have swastika on their face

697
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,680
It's not really that far

698
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,020
Well, if the attitude is not good, it'd be impossible

699
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,320
Did Hamada meet the parents?

700
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,280
Of course

701
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,840
What happened? Did they say, "I won't give you my daughter"?

702
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,040
No not at all

703
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,540
Did you go with a fake pinky finger?
-No pinky?

704
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,260
It's very convincing
-No pinky?

705
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,560
You tug it, it won't fall off

706
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,600
It will come off
-You tug at it!

707
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,010
It will fall off

708
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,000
My dad is also a strange man

709
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
So I was curious to have them meet

710
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
Why?

711
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,510
What will be the reaction?

712
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,510
What would your father do?

713
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:17,200
Men with scary faces have been told "I won't give you my daughter"

714
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,800
The first interview was with this man

715
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:29,000
Both arms embroidered with tattoos and huge ear lobes

716
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,560
His head is also full of tattoos

717
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,890
Its Bam Bam Bigelow!

718
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,040
Not caring about being poor

719
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,400
Would someone be fearful that their daughter was going to suffer?

720
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:50,130
Do you have new tattoos?

721
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,830
This one

722
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,740
A large piece

723
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,880
This is it.
-That's it?

724
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,450
It's a "gout" tattoo.
-What?

725
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,550
It says gout

726
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,050
You had gout?
-I had gout

727
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,550
And then got a gout tattoo?
-Got the tattoo

728
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,160
Why?

729
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,590
I drank too much, so I got it to make sure I don't forget I had gout

730
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,960
This scary-looking guy is controlling his purine intake

731
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,170
Have you met a girlfriend's parents?

732
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,100
Twice

733
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,440
Twice?
-Yes

734
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,810
How did it go?

735
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,980
She told me that "my father is very strict" and "be aware of it"

736
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,180
I went there and was ignored

737
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:41,720
Ignored?
-Yes, ignored. Didn't say anything at all

738
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,590
How did that meeting with the parents end?

739
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,520
Nothing, I couldn't say anything, I was completely ignored

740
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,130
Have you ever heard the words "I won't give you my daughter"?

741
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,630
Isn't being ignored the same?

742
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,280
Next is this tattooist

743
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,540
Have you met a girlfriend's parents?

744
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:09,150
Once, I did my hair nicely and wore a smart suit

745
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,680
Neat and tiday

746
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,590
But the tattoo...
-You could see the tattoos still

747
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,160
I also shaved my beard

748
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,460
They said "Are you a drug addict, are you a gangster, do you have a relationship with that kind of people?"

749
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,560
The door was closed

750
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,670
They said "Don't talk to me, get out" and "Get out of my house"

751
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:38,320
Despite the closed door, they had a child and married

752
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,780
Super opposed to me, still are

753
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,320
And this fierce-looking man too

754
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,650
It is possible that the tattoo wasn't seen as it was covered

755
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,460
Why is it hated?

756
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,660
Did you wear long sleeves?

757
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,500
No, this is the kind of tattoo that will show even if you wear long sleeves

758
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,030
The other party said, "Are you kidding me?" "That's ridiculous"

759
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:10,080
It's true that the parents' generation still has a strong aversion to tattoos

760
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,880
In the midst of all this, this tattooed guy

761
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,310
"Please let me marry your daughter" like this

762
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,520
I said, "Please let me marry your daughter"

763
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,720
Then what did the other side say?

764
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,490
The person said, "Well...okay," and that was the end result

765
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,690
I was told to "pay the insurance properly"

766
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,560
Isn't there a national health insurance and an insurance certificate?

767
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:38,130
Something like "just make sure you pay that"

768
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,720
In such a way, occasionally someone hits the jackpot and meets a low threshold family

769
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,280
This next guy

770
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,250
Didn't like my appearance

771
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,450
How did you dress?

772
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:57,920
Wore a suit, but my hair color and earrings were the same

773
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:02,090
Told me "dye your hair black and take out the earrings"

774
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:07,160
But I don't want to do things other people tell me

775
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,070
So we argued

776
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,070
My father-in-law did not come to the wedding

777
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:20,010
It seems that it is not only the appearance that makes an old man angry

778
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:28,640
Next is this red-haired man with earrings

779
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,620
The other party is a single-parent family, only her mother

780
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:36,390
I was welcomed very warmly and

781
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:39,730
After meeting me she also began to wear earrings

782
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:45,100
She originally did not have ear holes, but them pierced her ears and became funky

783
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,140
My own parents are very strict

784
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,040
I can't go to funerals on my side

785
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,210
I was shocked to be refused

786
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:04,290
And this fierce-looking man sipping whisky on the street

787
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,490
This one's interesting

788
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,120
Is this still Japan?

789
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,990
Where do you want to get a piercing next?

790
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:13,860
Here

791
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,930
Why do you want it on your forehead?
-Because it's cool, like this on the center line

792
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,170
I like the kind of left and right symmetry

793
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,200
This man has a total of 20 openings on the left and right side symmetrically

794
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:31,710
My mother-in-law doesn't like this

795
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,920
I was told to "take them all off" so I did when we met

796
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,350
Did the parents of the other party say anything?

797
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:43,160
No, they were very nice, didn't say anything in particular

798
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,300
Quite understanding, I was a little surprised

799
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,130
So how do you deal with your piercings in front of your mother-in-law now

800
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,540
Although I was told to take it off, I still have them

801
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,370
That's me

802
00:44:55,540 --> 00:45:00,610
I told her that piercings is not makeup but my armor

803
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,580
And I don't want to be judged by my appearance

804
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:10,420
Although no tattoos and no piercings, this one has a strong sense of weirdness

805
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,690
Have you met a prospective wife's parents?
-Parents?

806
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:17,360
When meeting the parents, did they say anything about you?

807
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,900
Well, said the hair is so long

808
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,470
And it was pink

809
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,270
One of em seemed to be a teacher or something

810
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,520
One of em?

811
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,740
I got pushed down the stairs

812
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,570
Really?
-Yes

813
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,010
They said "I won't give you my daughter" and then bang, I was pushed down

814
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:38,330
Probably feeling words were useless, he was rejected physically

815
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,920
Then this senior fierce-looking man

816
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,720
He said something really bad to me

817
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:50,890
They said "What are you doing here?"

818
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:53,900
He said, "First of all, look at the way you're dressed."

819
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,700
I said "I'm a musician"

820
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,630
Then he said, "It doesn't matter, just shave it"

821
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,240
"Why would I give my daughter to you?"

822
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,870
Then I said "yes"

823
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,410
It was like that

824
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:08,980
How about it? Do you want a more exaggerated story?

825
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:14,380
How about "How can I give my daughter to someone like you? Come back tomorrow when you're shaved! What?"

826
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,750
How to say... tell the truth is fine

827
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:23,590
In summary
Daughters wont be given to people who like to exaggerate stories

828
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,240
This VTR is a with a lot of piercings and tattoos

829
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,470
Fierce looking

830
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:39,600
It's true...
-The kind of type that will get rejected

831
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,440
It is true that the degree of tattoo coverage is also a determining factor

832
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,920
The first few people are very impressive

833
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,650
They should just have have a tattoo on their backs, like Hamada

834
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,630
This way you can't see it with clothes on
-No, that's wrong

835
00:46:53,630 --> 00:47:24,950
