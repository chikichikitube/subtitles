00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,930
And can I just say one thing?

19
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,310

Hamada

21
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,140
Isn't it really basic!?

00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,510
What the hell!

23
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,450

Well then Matsumoto

26
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,590
What do you think of these shoes?

27
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,590
Ah Tanaka's shoes?

28
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,360

Of course they do!

33
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,030
Did they just come out with these at Yoshimoto Goods?

34
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,900
I'm sorry but

35
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,340
You said you don't understand the rules

36
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,340
This isn't the time for free talk!!

37
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,980
This feel's like it's gonna be awful!

38
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:17,420
"to feel pain". Once in the cafe you must act it out

00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:17,420
You will recieve a Garu card with word's such as "to feel hot"

00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,790
Act it out?

44
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,420
That's right

45
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,060
When you mean "act" you mean completely?

46
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,360
Like over reacting

47
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,500
We'll trust you to do what you'd like

48
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,840
Shouldn't Tanaka be aware of Kouki Mitani?

It wasn't good!? You put a lot into it!

54
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,790

55
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,850

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,650
The maid will enter and then

57
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,690
Once the maid delivers the coffee and bow's you start

58
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,690
Rules

59
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,760
We'll determine who did it the best

60
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,500
And decide who was the worst

61
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Well, who's deciding it?

62
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,800
Everyone is

63
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:12,810
Finally, After a discussion the worst and best will be chosen

64
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:12,810
Rules

65
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,970
Everyone decides?

66
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,910
You'll decide between everyone who's the worst

67
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,340
Why the hell can't it be decided by one person?

68
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,910
Well

69
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,910
Who would decide?

70
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,850
Me!

71
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,850

There isn't enough cream

143
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
"Cream" you said?

144
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,370

Hamada

147
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,940
Aren't you putting in a little too much?

148
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,410
"Too much"?

149
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,120
Isn't it a little too much?

150
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,650
It's fine with this much

151
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,060

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,890
It's so shallow!!

159
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,390
Is it normally this shallow?

160
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,460

It's so shallow!!

172
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,600
Have you ever seen it so shallow?

173
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,570

174
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,570

Please don't show me!

182
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,290
If the employee's hear you

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,290
They'll be really upset!

184
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,460

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Weren't you just sleeping?

194
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,810
Matsumoto

195
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,810
To feel sleepy

196
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,810
That wasn't "to feel sleepy"

197
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,910
It's "to feel"

198
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,750
Before that

199
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,020
The one that was the worst

200
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,020
is this one!

201
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,020
What the hell!

202
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,820
I had no idea what you were doing!

203
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,820
Hamada

204
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,820
Prideful

205
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,690
I was saying that I found this

206
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,820
I've never seen

207
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,820
Shallow?

208
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,820
Syrup this shallow before!!

209
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,460
You and you were fine!

210
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,160
But you!

211
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,960
You were awful too!!

212
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
It's "to feel sleepy"!!

213
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,230
I was frequently waking up!

214
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,230
But was your card "to feel like waking up"?

215
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,300
Your wrong!

216
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,840
Even though it's the first Cafe have you decided?

217
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,480
Who was the worst?

218
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,480
You ask us!

219
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Was Tanaka the worst one?

220
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,340
Were voting on the worst huh?

221
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,180
The one who did their "Garu" the worst!

222
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,610
Raise your hand

223
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,610
Well, He wasn't the worst

224
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
0 Votes

225
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,620
Your safe

226
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,850
Those who thought Matsumoto was the worst raise your hand

227
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,560
3 Votes

228
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,850
3 votes huh!?

229
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,560
That's terrible you shouldn't put me on the bottom of the list!

230
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,530
Well, Let's continue

231
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,530
Who think's Housei was the worst?

232
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,040
0 Votes

233
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Not the worst huh?

234
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,870
Well then who thought Hamada was the worst?

235
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,870
Of course!

236
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,340
2 votes?

237
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Of course

238
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,580
I tried to do it!

239
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
So who thought Endo was the worst?

240
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,920
0 Votes

241
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,050
0 Votes

242
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,920
That's suspicious

243
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,190
If you were part of it who would you pick?

244
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,790
Me?

245
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,420
Who was the worst?

246
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,090
Endo then!

247
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,420
Your lying!

248
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Seriously why!?

249
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,260
He was the worst?

250
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,090
Why'd you say that?

251
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,890
Well compared to everyone else

252
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,000
Your's was the easiest challenge

253
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,000
I thought that was the biggest point

254
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,300
Everyone was challenging each other!

255
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,670
This is the first time I've seen this!

256
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,910
Were being absurdly stretched by Inomoto!!

257
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,840
Are you serious Inomoto!?

258
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,410
What about you Fujiwara

259
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,450
Me?

260
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,880
Hamada

261
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,880
You agree huh

262
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,180
I couldn't understand

263
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,180
It was this!

264
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,180
what you were prideful about

265
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,650
I know that but

266
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,020
Why were you prideful

267
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,020
about the Syrup's Shallowness?

268
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,030
There was no pride from Hamada huh

269
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,760
Well, Yea.

270
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,600
Hamada isn't the syrup

271
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,270
Well everyone shall we go to the second building?

272
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,370
Here after they go to the next stage

273
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,000
The second Cafe

274
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,670
Picking out new "Garu" card's

275
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,670
Sure enough, The five's pick's are

276
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,670
This one!

277
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,010
Let's start from Tanaka

278
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,810
Please show us!

279
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,450
"To feel cold"

280
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,450
Feel Cold

281
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,180
There was this "Garu" card huh?

282
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,320
Alright Endo!

283
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,550
"To want"

284
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,650
To want

285
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,490
This is perfect for Endo

286
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,490
Alright Hamada!

287
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,790
"Wanting to know"

288
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:49,600
"Want to know"

289
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,790
"Want to know"

290
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,930
This is pretty different from before huh

291
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,530
It's like a Changeup in baseball

292
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Now you Matsumoto

293
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,340
"To smell stink"

294
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:57,610
TL Note: Basically everything he smell's is awful

295
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,610
"To smell stink"

296
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,610
Well compared to last time...

297
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,610
Finally, Housei!

298
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,280
"To feel pain"

299
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,280
"To feel pain"!?

300
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,650
To feel pain

301
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,650
That's not too bad

302
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,660
The 5 have brand new "Garu" card's!

303
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,890
After some reflection and thought

304
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,760
They go into the second Cafe!

305
00:10:18,760 --> 00:12:17,080
Endo

306
00:10:18,760 --> 00:12:17,080
Hamada

307
00:10:18,760 --> 00:12:17,080
Housei

00:10:18,760 --> 00:12:17,080
To Want

311
00:10:18,760 --> 00:12:17,080
To feel cold

312
00:10:18,760 --> 00:12:17,080
To feel pain

313
00:10:18,760 --> 00:12:17,080
To smell stink

314
00:10:18,760 --> 00:12:17,080
To want to know

315
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,980
That's definetely not Ice Coffee!

316
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,750
We didn't get a chance to order

317
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,550
"Garu" Start!

318
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,250

319
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,990
Thank you~

320
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,590
If you don't need it Hamada,

321
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,590
Can I have it?

322
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,760
Well, I'm not gonna drink it but...

323
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,130

325
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,700
When was this place built?

326
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,170

327
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,170

What's wrong?

332
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,610

333
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,610

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,340
What do you mean?

336
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,450
I took a sip and I felt really cold!

337
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,450

385
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,840
What did you eat!?

386
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,470
OW!

387
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,470
OW!

388
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,470
OW!

389
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,210
OW!

390
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,210
OW!

391
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,550
OI! Wait a second what's going on!

392
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,450
Endo

393
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,450
Hamada

394
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,450
Housei

395
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,450
Matsumoto

396
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,450
Tanaka

397
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,380
"Garu" complete

398
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,450
Good Work!

399
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,090
Everyone was up on this one

400
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,360
This one was totally different than the first one!

401
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,860
How did you think about yourself this time Hamada?

402
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:38,270
Hamada

403
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,530
This time I did really good!

404
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,360
You really wanted to know thing's huh?

405
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,530
I really did want to learn!

406
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,270
I wanted to know about the camera

407
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,270
and I wanted to know about everything!

408
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,310
Well, When you were over there with Yamazaki what was that about?

409
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,010
Why does your stomach hurt?

410
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,010
What did you eat?

411
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,010
What's wrong?

412
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,010
Oh you were asking him that?

413
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,010
At that time I felt a sharp pain!

414
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,720
Rather than "to feel pain"

415
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,720
It just hurt!

416
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,720
Seriously? It hurt?

417
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,620
This time I thought it's was Housei who was "Wrong"

418
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,620
No, No wait!

419
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,060
Well actually

420
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,500
Everyone was really moving around!

421
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,100
Originally the pain was very small

422
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,300
And so I looked around!

423
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,640
Hamada really want's to know!

424
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,340
Tanaka looks pretty cold!

425
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,410
Endo really wanted things

426
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,310
Matsumoto

427
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,310
didn't really stand out

428
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,910
At last,

429
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:30,720
Matsumoto

430
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,120
I separated myself from the others

431
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,720
I was the only one alone on this stage!

432
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,720
I see!

433
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,560
For the time being should we just decide this by majority again?

434
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,560
Like the first cafe

435
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Alright let's do it

436
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,530
Put your hand up if you thought Endo was the worst

437
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,530
2 votes

438
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,500
2 votes

439
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,740
Alright then

440
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,000
Who thought that Housei was the worst?

441
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I did sorry!

442
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,670
Your lying!

443
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,280
Once again 2 votes

444
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,670
2 votes

445
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,850
Well, the cameraman didn't really give you much attention as everything was going on

446
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,050
Even though you say that, I was alone till the end

447
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,220
I was alone on this stage

448
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:09,790
0 Votes

449
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:09,790
Hamada

450
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:09,790
Matsumoto

451
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:09,790
To smell

452
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:09,790
To want to know

453
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:09,790
And finally, Hamada and Matsumoto got 0 votes

454
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,060
Raise your hand if you thought Tanaka was the worst

455
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,400
1 vote

456
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,600
Well you weren't the worst

457
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,600
1 Vote

458
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,600
Tanaka

459
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,600
To feel cold

460
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,610
Coincidentally what would you two vote?

461
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,610
I see, Well...

462
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,510
Personally

463
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,510
Endo

464
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,080
Wait a second Inomoto

465
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,780
Matsumoto said it before but

466
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,720
Supposing there was a pattern change that I did but

467
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,090
If there was a pattern change it was you!

468
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,660
Are you being serious?

469
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,660
I'm being serious

470
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,430
I think

471
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,430
you went too far with it

472
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,700
Like you were taking other's things

473
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,700
What do you mean?

474
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,670
You were going as far

475
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,670
as to take other's things

476
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,100
I was really wondering what stunk

477
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,710
It was because

478
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,710
Endo's acting normally stinks!

479
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,680
I thought this smell and that smell was different!

480
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,310
It really was the difference between our acting

481
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,320
Alright, Let's go to the 3rd cafe!

482
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,520
While Endo is calm and composed

483
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,020
They go to the third and final cafe!

484
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,220
Well, You guy's know this is the last one

485
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,830
We leveled up the "Garu" cards!

486
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,300
Special Rule

487
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,300
The "Garu" topic has been leveled up!

488
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,300
So it's gotten harder

489
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,470
Finally, The leveled up "Garu" card's are!?

490
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,470
Starting from Tanaka!

491
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,780
"To want to be Antonio Inoki"

492
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,780
He can do what he want's right?

493
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,650
Want to be Antonio Inoki

494
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,580
Perform it however you want to

495
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,650
We're not bothered by the quality of it

496
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,650
Now Endo!

497
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,420
"To want to randomly notice your surrounding's"

498
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
So to notice thing's about the Cafe?

499
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:56,500
To want to randomly notice your surrounding's

500
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,530
This one's a little...

501
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,530
I want to see his tearful face from this

502
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,470
No, You won't see it!

503
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,500
Alright Hamada!

504
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
"To want to use Nori Tsukomi"

505
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,740
Tl: Nori Tsukomi is when the Tsukomi play's along with the Boke before pointing out the joke

506
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,250
To want to use Nori Tsukomi

507
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,140
THIS!?

508
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,350
It's gonna be difficult!

509
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,350
Matsumoto!

510
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,850
This is bad

511
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,620
"To want to be Mori Shinichi"

512
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,850
This one is perfect for Endo!

513
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,890
"To want to be Mori Shinichi"

514
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,890
This one would of been good for me!

515
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,890
Now you Yamachan

516
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,700
"To want to praise the other member's"

517
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
I have to praise the other's cards?

518
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:32,300
Want to praise other member's

519
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,300
Yeah this one is pretty bad

520
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,310
And now the tour with the leveled up "Garu" card's!

521
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,250
Finally, The last Cafe!

522
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,180
So this place has this kind of feel to it

523
00:16:46,180 --> 00:19:02,750
"To want to
be Antonio Inoki"

524
00:16:46,180 --> 00:19:02,750
"To want to
be Mori Shinichi"

525
00:16:46,180 --> 00:19:02,750
"To want to
praise the other's"

526
00:16:46,180 --> 00:19:02,750
"To want to
use Nori Tsukomi"

527
00:16:46,180 --> 00:19:02,750
"To want to notice
the surrounding's"

528
00:16:46,180 --> 00:19:02,750
Endo

529
00:16:46,180 --> 00:19:02,750
Hamada

530
00:16:46,180 --> 00:19:02,750
Housei

531
00:16:46,180 --> 00:19:02,750
Matsumoto

532
00:16:46,180 --> 00:19:02,750
Tanaka

533
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,460
This is definetely not Ice Coffee!

534
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,930
What's with this "bring your own" program

535
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,570
Garu Start

536
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,350
Aren't you putting

537
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,350
too much?

538
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,090
Isn't it too much?

539
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,320
That's really good!

540
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,260
Good evening

541
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
We entered there right?

542
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,530
Delicious!

543
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,030
Tanaka that's really good!

544
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,030
What floor is this!?

545
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,100
This is delicious huh!

546
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,130
This is underground right?

547
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,600
We entered from the first floor and went downstairs right?

548
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
That's good!

549
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,310
But it's a little different huh!

550
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,310
So we entered through here!

551
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
Amazing right!

552
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,150
This is so good!

553
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,150
Now I feel really good!

554
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,420
I drank Ice Coffe and

555
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,420
now I feel really good!!!

556
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,860
That's so good!

557
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,860
The best!!

558
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,830
It's good right?

559
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,790
GOOD!

560
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,260
GOOD!

561
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,260
GOOD!

562
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,030
HOUSEI!

563
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,260
Over there!

564
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,870
If you go to the back

565
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,870
It looks like it becomes a room!

566
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,600
Your right!

567
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,270
This is great~

568
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,310
♪ WINTER'S~

569

This is great~

574
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,520
This is impossible!

575
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,760
Did you create this loft?

576
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,030
This is impossible

577
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,770
I cant do anything beyond a doubt

578
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,270
No ones setting me up

579
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,270
♪ WINTER'S~

580
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,640
He's said that too much!!

581
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,640
Is it delicious?

582
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Is it delicious?

583
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,940
Goood!

584
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,680
♪ WINTER'S~

585
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,180
Enough already!

586
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,180
Garu Complete!

587
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,050
This was impossible for me!

588
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,260
Everyone was amazing huh!

589
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,800
I brought it all out!

590
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,130
Hamada was horrible!

591
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,640
How was I?

592
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:24,780
Want to praise
other members

593
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,640
All that praise

594
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,640
Well to be honest you were in the way

595
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
But there was nothing else you could do

596
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,010
My partner

597
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,010
was pitiful!

598
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,180
What exactly did you do?

599
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:51,700
Hamada

600
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,120
You were all doing as you pleased

601
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,320
Everyone was just focused on themselves

602
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,760
You guy's wouldn't look this way once for me!

603
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
With him going all "Winter's~"

604
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,970
And you all like

605
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,700
I couldn't do anything!!

606
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,910
Because this is the last one we will vote

607
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:02,610
I think

608
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,610
we should discuss about

609
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,610
who was the worst out of all 3...

610
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,780
This one isn't related!

611
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,780
It's for everone of them!

612
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,850
I dont think we can figure it out between us

613
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,890
Can't License...

614
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,430
We have no other choice but to trust License

615
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,800
Please tell us the winner as well!

616
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
You want us both to decide?

617
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,540
Give out a name on "3"!

618
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,540
Both at the same time!

619
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,540
First the winner...

620
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,570
If you say it at the same time there will be no complaints

621
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,570
Alright then we will decide the winner

622
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,770
3,2...

623
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,110
The winner of the "Garu" tour is!?

624
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,380
Alright then we will decide the winner

625
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,310

634
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,660

00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,660
Thanks!

637
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,270
The reason Matsumoto is the winner is because

638
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,870
He properly did

639
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,870
all of the "Garu"'s!!

640
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,370
I was great huh!

641
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,170
Now let's

642
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,170
do the worst person

643
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,810
Yes, The worst

644
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,170
Do it on 3

645
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:03,670
Well,

646
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,580
Because I won can I decide as well?

647
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,580
Ah, I see!

648
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,580
By the way have you decided?

649
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,450
Yes I have

650
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,450
So have I

651
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,750
Alright, got it!

652
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,220
Should all 3 of us say it at the same time?

653
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,750
Yea

654
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:16,690
On 3?

655
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,220
On 3

656
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,720
1,2...

657
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,060
Finally, The worst person is!?

658
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,230
So we're gonna all say it at once right?

659
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,500
Yes

660
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,700
Endo

661
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,700
Endo

662
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,700
Endo

663
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,210
Cocorico Endo Shozo

664
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,210
The worst "Garu"

665
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,210
What about Hamada!

666
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,380
Well Hamada got "Nori Tsukomi"

667
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,510
He never got a chance to use it

668
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,180
For me, Endo and Hamada were real close

669
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,180
It was at then end that I decided it

670
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,090
When I looked at it for the third time

671
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,090
I really thought you were pitiful!

672
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,890
"Garu" right

673
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,230
"To feel Pitiful"

674
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,630
Seriously it seemed like you were pitiful!

675
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,630
I really thought I was pitiful huh!?

676
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,400
Why!?

677
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,080
Endo get's the working overtime "Garu" medal!

678
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,080
Punishment

679
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:39,000
"To smell stink"

680
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,300
Doesn't it stink?

681
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:47,580
"To feel pain"

682
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,580
It hurts!

683
00:22:48,010 --> 00:23:00,960
"To feel sleepy"

684
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,420
He's sleeping now

685
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,790
I almost fell!

686
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,920
He taking a really raw personality!

687
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,030
"To feel hot"

688
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,030
Excuse me!

689
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,030
Can you put on the AC!?

690
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:11,300
"To feel cold"

691
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:11,300
Sorry, I meant do you have a blanket?

692
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:20,910
"To want to know"

693
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,910
Is this Brazilian?

694
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:46,670
"To want to be
Mori Shinchi"

695
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
Ah It's out!

696
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,020
He's really good at this!

697
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,890
Delicious~

698
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
As expected from him!

699
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,470
Delicious!

700
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,680
I'm really sorry!
