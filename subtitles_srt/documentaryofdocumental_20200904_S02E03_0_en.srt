00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,900
Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!

2
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,910
Look at his mouth.

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,210
What?

4
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,310
What's wrong, Jimmy-san?

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,750
Look at his teeth.

6
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,050
He laughed.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,820
What's this?
Balls.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Can I touch them?

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,990
I wouldn't recommend it
but if you wanna.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,830
I want to touch,
just a little.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,700
There we go.

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,900
So fluffy!

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,440
It was pretty decent.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,780
Compared to past versions.

15
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,250
It was
incredibly good.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,480
It was a good Documental.

17
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,550
For real, yeah.

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,560
Okay,
so maybe what comes next.

19
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,990
I wonder...

20
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,930
Let's continue.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,070
Alright, here we go!

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,870
Can I use this?

23
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,210
He can?

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,610
Can we use the tofu like that?

25
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,510
Yeah, for sure.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,320
What's that?

27
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,120
It's a brush... a brush.

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,790
That's pretty overkill.
Is it for dogs?

29
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,260
No, no. It's a woman's
brush, I think.

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,800
About 2000 yen.

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,300
Okay, wanna play Karuta? (Editor's Note: 1)

32
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,470
I made an original Karuta.

33
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,670
Let's do that!

34
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,410
Me too!

35
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,510
Okay, we have to look first.

36
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,280
This is "A".

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,550
"Anal and shrimp?
Raw or cold?"

38
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,550
This is "I"

39
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,720
"I came, so I opened my eyes."

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,790
That's crazy.
"I came, so I opened my eyes."

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:17,820
"I came,
so I opened my eyes."

42
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,920
It's too much.
"I came, so I opened my eyes."

43
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,020
"I came,
so I opened my eyes."

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,590
Wouldn't you normally close them?
"I came, so I opened my eyes."

45
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,060
Just a face.

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,530
"If you squint a little,
the mosaic disappears."

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,970
Right, right.

48
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,770
"E"

49
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,840
"Eguchi Yosuke?
He'd look good with some lipstick on."

50
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,510
Next. "O"

51
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,110
"Oh, pussy."

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,750
"Ca" ("Ka")

53
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,320
"Can you get me some of that
sweet shit?"

54
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,330
Damn, who was it?

55
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,770
Wasn't it you?

56
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,370
Weren't you talking
while smiling?

57
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,770
This is pretty serious.

58
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,140
No, but I was just smiling
to make others smile.

59
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,210
Like inviting us?

60
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,010
Exactly, I'd say
that I'm in the clean— clear.

61
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,680
Clean?

62
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,080
Clean clear?

63
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,650
Okay, so!

64
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Who was it?

65
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,820
Uh... Koba!

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,620
Huh?!
I wasn't smiling!

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,160
—For real?
—Yeah!

68
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,660
—You sure?
—Take a look!

69
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,760
—Totally sure?
—Yes.

70
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,430
You were already on a tight rope
with Cookie's Karuta game.

71
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,700
It was pretty serious.

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,740
I think I was holding it.

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,940
Really?

74
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,210
"Ka"

75
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,310
Can you get me some of that
sweet shit?

76
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,250
You were smiling!

77
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,950
He was smiling!

78
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,420
That counts as smiling?!

79
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,120
You were smiling!

80
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,020
—No way!
—Yeah, yeah, yeah.

81
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Have mercy.

82
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,030
You should be out for lying.

83
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,330
He was totally smiling.

84
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,600
Jimmy was smiling as well
at a weird time.

85
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,670
All along, yeah.

86
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,140
I can't even count anymore.

87
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,440
That's just my face.

88
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,810
No, no, not at all.

89
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,580
Right, we're following the rules.

90
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,990
Okay, here we go.

91
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,960
Everyone left.

92
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,700
Feels lonely in here.

93
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,230
I want to look at this.

94
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,400
Let's wait until
everyone's back.

95
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,040
Let's just do it a little

96
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,070
"Anal and shrimp?
Raw or cold?"

97
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,740
That's good.

98
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,680
"I came, so I opened my eyes."

99
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,550
That's pretty good.

100
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,920
This is great.

101
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,820
"If you squint a little,
the mosaic disappears."

102
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,120
Great, great.

103
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,820
Are you imitating
Master Daisuke?

104
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,660
I am, Kansai style.

105
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,860
"Eguchi Yosuke?
He'd look good with some lipstick on."

106
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,530
"Oh, pussy."

107
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,770
Can you get me some of that
sweet shit?

108
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,440
Amazing.

109
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,480
"My balls are hot.
My balls are hot!"

110
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,280
Wa-wa-wait.
Just once.

111
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,650
Don't waste it now.

112
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,090
We should wait.

113
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,120
Let's look at them together.

114
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,290
Together, yeah.

115
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,660
Call them over.

116
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,660
Let's look at them together.

117
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,730
What?

118
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,930
Cookie's Karuta.

119
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,400
Can I show you
something in the meantime?

120
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,640
It's a prejudice book I made (Prejudice/Stereotype/Bias)

121
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,840
Prejudice?

122
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,040
What should we do?

123
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,180
Just ask for one
and I'll say it.

124
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,980
All my prejudices
are right here.

125
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,920
Give me a prejudice!

126
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,590
Alright, what number from the top?

127
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,290
The first one!

128
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,260
Alright...
People who look like Inagawa Junji

129
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,160
hit women.

130
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,800
"Cha!" (Kenji Tamura (Tamuken) - "Ciao")

131
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,970
The "cha" isn't necessary.
I was close.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,240
I was about to laugh
but it brought me back.

133
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,140
I pressed the wrong button.

134
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,010
Give me another one.

135
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,340
What number from the top?

136
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,280
Number six, let's do that.

137
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,050
Grannies

138
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,020
Grannies that gossip
in spring

139
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
get cancer.

140
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,790
Don't joke about that, man.

141
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,360
It's a prejudice...

142
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,760
Prejudice?

143
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,630
It won't open!

144
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,900
It's already dented
just open a hole.

145
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,870
Koumoto-san look at this.

146
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,970
Damn it

147
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,510
Whoa, your back...

148
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,010
What happened to your back?

149
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,550
What's that, man?

150
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,380
I was playing with my hamster.

151
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,320
Those bangs are too short.

152
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,720
Who are you?

153
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,190
I'm Mito Natsume. (EN: 2)

154
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,860
Ah, Mito Natsume.

155
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,560
-Ouch!
Not Masami Hisamoto's sister?

156
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,800
-What was that?
There we go.

157
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,700
Mito Natsume-san?

158
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,440
Wait,
I'm a little thirsty.

159
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,410
No, no, no!

160
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,510
Watch out, watch out!

161
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,550
That's not for your eyes!

162
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,850
My eyes hurt.

163
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,990
Remember these.

164
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,420
Remember the Karuta.

165
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,700
What's this Karuta?

166
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,750
Master Daisuke sure has
a foul mouth, huh?

167
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,320
He doesn't say much, though.

168
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,420
Read them.

169
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,660
What?

170
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,290
Read.

171
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,330
I slipped up and told the story of how
I got beat up by Nakabo at a festival.

172
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,170
The manager... couldn't come out...?

173
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,910
You shouldn't be reading this!

174
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,810
Too fast!

175
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,650
-It was Koumoto!
-Definitely Koumoto!

176
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,320
-No way!
-This is serious.

177
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,250
Koumoto!

178
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,590
That was just hilarious
come on...!

179
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,090
This is how I managed to hold on.

180
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,460
With this.

181
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,330
That's how you do it?!

182
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,770
You can't be doing this!

183
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,900
It definitely wasn't me!

184
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,670
Is it so wrong
to use this?

185
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,140
Well, yeah,
this time it wasn't Koba.

186
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,380
I think he knows,
but it was Koumoto.

187
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,680
For real...?!

188
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,680
Read.

189
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,620
I slipped up and told the story of how
I got beat up by Nakabo at a festival.

190
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,490
The manager... couldn't come out...?

191
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,160
You shouldn't be reading this!

192
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,270
Here you go, Koumoto.

193
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,470
That's rough!

194
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,210
-Second one!
-Ah, right!

195
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,010
Was it this?

196
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,810
That was dirty, really.

197
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,680
You took that picture?!

198
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,220
Here we go!

199
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,690
Whoa!

200
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,460
What's wrong?

201
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,330
You're Mito Natsume, right?

202
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,400
What's going on?

203
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,570
What's that sticking out?

204
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,770
It's just in there, chill.

205
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Is that the head?

206
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,540
Not the head. Just how it looks.

207
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,640
That's embarrassing.

208
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,910
That's Mito-chan's?

209
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,480
Definitely Mito-chan's.

210
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,610
You're too hard!

211
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,180
Mito-chan's is that big?

212
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,380
The head?

213
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,450
The head, yeah.

214
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,790
That's how it looks.
It's not even that hard.

215
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,090
It's hard.

216
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,390
Take it out, man.

217
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,430
There's something there.

218
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,330
What did you do to your dick?

219
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,300
His balls are red.

220
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,000
You pulled on your balls?

221
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,270
What's that?

222
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,610
Wa-wa-wait!

223
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,880
Kubota too!

224
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,050
I'm fine, I'm fine.

225
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,020
This is just-

226
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,020
That's not normal!

227
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,490
That's an STD!

228
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,360
It's far too red!

229
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,560
He has red-ball disease.

230
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,430
No, this is just tight
and kinda hot.

231
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,700
He laughed out loud, right?

232
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,200
This was pretty bad, yeah.

233
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,870
We didn't get that much
on camera, don't worry.

234
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,010
An STD?

235
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,310
Kinda

236
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,750
Not really, but it just
looks a bit like it.

237
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,420
This is pretty normal.

238
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,550
That's red!

239
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,790
No, no, no!

240
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,320
He has red-balls disease, ,man!

241
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,160
That's just what happens when it gets hot
so I use a towel and-

242
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,230
I pack one of these.

243
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,500
You were gonna use that later?

244
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,670
What's that?

245
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,470
It gives it shape.

246
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,640
What's going on?

247
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,550
Wa-wa-wait!

248
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,990
Yeah, right.
I couldn't hold it at all!

249
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,190
Well, this is a point for Nadal.

250
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,290
Yeah!

251
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,490
A point for his balls.

252
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
A ball point.

253
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,060
Ah damn!

254
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,700
We're in a rough spot.
And it's all at a bad time.

255
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
Alright!

256
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,110
Only two hours.

257
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,410
Still four left.

258
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,610
I thought it had been more time.

259
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,080
There you go again, man!

260
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,050
What?

261
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,390
What's wrong?

262
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,490
No, come on!

263
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,890
We can do this.

264
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,630
We can laugh right now.

265
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,160
No, man...

266
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,830
I have to do it again...
Can't be helped!

267
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,200
I haven't done anything!
Huh? What?

268
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,670
Don't know?

269
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,770
Show us.

270
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,510
What's wrong, senpai?

271
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,340
Is this it?

272
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,910
Why d'you take the matches?

273
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,180
-Those are matches!
-What's with you?

274
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,250
Are you mad?

275
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,950
No man! It's in my phone!
You guys are so unfair!

276
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,220
What? Huh?

277
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,690
Wanna look?

278
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,190
No, I won't loog.

279
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,090
"Loog"?

280
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,460
Wanna watch it all together?

281
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,260
Look at this.

282
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,630
Like this?

283
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,840
"My cock?
It has high level phimosis!" (EN: 3)

284
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,070
There's the "wa" karuta.
"My cock?
It has high level phimosis!"

285
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,670
There's the "wa" karuta.

286
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,410
Who put it there?

287
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,610
That's not good.

288
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,710
Jimmy-san?

289
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,010
No, not me.

290
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,580
-He really said that?
-He did.

291
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,750
What is it?

292
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,550
"Maybe I can chew the juice
out of a turd!"

293
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,890
Maybe? What?

294
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,890
He says this?

295
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,620
-What?
-Who says that?

296
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,390
He really said this.

297
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,690
"Wash me from top to bottom!"

298
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,100
"I haven't used soap
in about eight years!"

299
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,400
He said that too

300
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,570
"Sypu!"

301
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,640
Huh?

302
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,270
"Pussy sypu!
Pussy sypu!"

303
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,480
"Maybe I can chew the juice
out of a turd!"

304
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,680
"Wash me from top to bottom!
I haven't used soap in eight years!"

305
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,550
"Nishioka Sumiko?
Don't know her!"

306
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,420
"Can you give me that
sweet piece of shit?"

307
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,890
"First year of Reiwa!"

308
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,960
"A girl I want to fuck?
Zawachin!"

309
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,360
"Detective Night Scoop."

310
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,670
"I don't watch it since
Nagahara Seiki isn't around."

311
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,070
I like it.

312
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,680
Did he say this "ne" one
to Master Hanako?

313
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,010
-What?
-Ne.

314
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,480
"Never look at that hag while she sleeps!"

315
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,480
I'm sure that made
Master Hanako angry!

316
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,450
He didn't say that to Master Hanako
so it's fine. It was Miyako Chocho

317
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,430
This is pretty fun!

318
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,730
More than metal, huh?

319
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,330
You tryin' to pull out your head?

320
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,940
So I've been doing reporting
on adult toys for a while, right?

321
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,840
And lately there are many
with like a good rhythm.

322
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,510
Yeah, they've kept evolving lately.

323
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,010
The rhythm is pretty incredible.

324
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,180
The rhythm?

325
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,880
They don't go just "bzzz"
like the other ones.

326
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,320
It's more like this...

327
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,120
I thought it could match to music.

328
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,290
I feel like you could
put music on this.

329
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,590
With the rhythm?

330
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,050
No way!

331
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,140
Isn't it great?

332
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,540
Really amazing.

333
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,510
What's that?

334
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,110
What's that over there?

335
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,280
Jimmy-san, right?

336
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,820
That's Jimmy-san, right?

337
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,150
You saw that?

338
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,220
Wanna try
how this one vibrates?

339
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,420
Whoa!

340
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,770
That's good, pretty good!

341
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,750
Yay!

342
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,220
Tokyo!

343
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,660
Who are you?

344
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,130
I'm Ujita Minoru. (EN: 4)

345
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,320
What's he doing?

346
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,190
A pretty old-fashioned idiot.

347
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,430
What about the sound?

348
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,040
Want some ice cream?

349
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Ice cream.

350
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,140
Ice cream? Really?

351
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,880
I made it myself.
It's homemade.

352
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,150
You sure?

353
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,450
It's all gooey.

354
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,750
What's this?

355
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,650
Ah, thank you so much.

356
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,820
Is that homemade?

357
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,490
Thank you.

358
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,490
Huh?

359
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,060
Hey! This is lube!
Are you trying to kill me?!

360
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,450
That must be bad for your body, man.

361
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,450
No, lube is fine.
Otherwise...

362
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,320
Workers would end up dying.

363
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,790
It's not something you eat, though.

364
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,790
-This is great!
-Let's do some sumo.

365
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,460
Why sumo right now?
Sumo with lube?

366
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,960
You still have some.

367
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,430
It's sticking all the way there!

368
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,100
Look at that thread!

369
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,500
Do something!

370
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,340
He's really eating it, huh?

371
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,210
I'm feeling sick.

372
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,040
That's gross!

373
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,810
That's too gross!

374
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,250
Stop it, man!

375
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,990
Too close, too close!

376
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,970
Gimme, gimme.
Just once, gimme.

377
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,540
Spit it out.

378
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,310
I want three bowls of rice with this.

379
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,720
Gimme, gimme.

380
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,750
This is awful.

381
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,020
I want four bowls. Five.

382
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,130
I'm gonna stir it all up.
All of it.

383
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,770
Sasaki-san!

384
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,340
Sasaki-san.

385
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,240
Welcome

386
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,010
You look scary!

387
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,480
Well, I'm... I'm Sasaki.

388
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,580
Welcome!

389
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,520
Sasaki-san! Sasaki!

390
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,620
Who the hell are you?

391
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,720
Welcome.

392
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,460
Welcome.

393
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,900
So you're worried
about your bad breath?

394
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,600
Well... yeah, kind of.

395
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,270
Okay, let's take a look then.

396
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,570
Yeah.

397
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,050
Ah, this is it.

398
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,650
Sasaki-san, your tongue
is all covered in moss.

399
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,050
Moss.

400
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,590
Moss on your tongue.

401
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,820
The green one?

402
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,360
Yeah, yeah. That's the smell
on your tongue.

403
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,690
Really?

404
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,260
So let's take it off.

405
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,960
-Right.
-It's for the best.

406
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,130
Thank you very much.

407
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,400
Look.

408
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,340
Don't you puke.
Don't start puking.

409
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,940
Don't do that!

410
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,040
No!

411
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,110
Hold it in,
like a big boy.

412
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,880
Okay?

413
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,980
Look

414
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,820
See? There's a lot of it.

415
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,090
This is what causes the smell. Okay?

416
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,230
Come on!

417
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,030
What did you eat?

418
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,640
No, just an onigiri.

419
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,940
An onigiri?

420
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,040
Definitely not an onigiri.

421
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
No, it's just-

422
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,410
This?

423
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,560
Not an onigiri.

424
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,830
It was an onigiri, man.

425
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,430
Is this an onigiri?

426
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,730
I also had some karaage. (EN: 5)

427
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,470
So you eat karaage too?
That's bad, man!

428
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,140
You're eating karaage?

429
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,740
Take that out, please.

430
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,740
Because the onigiri-

431
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,410
Doctor

432
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
Excuse me.

433
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,580
I farted earlier

434
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,320
and this came out
of my butt.

435
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,660
Could you take it out?

436
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,460
Please take it out, doctor.

437
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,460
Take a seat.

438
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,430
No, I just farted earlier.

439
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,200
Ouch ouch! What you doin'?!
Stop it, stop!

440
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,170
What're you doin'?!
Stop! Stop it!

441
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,470
What is it? What's wrong?

442
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,210
What happened?
Watch out!

443
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,010
He's for real, come on!

444
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Some random guy.
I barely made it out, though.

445
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,350
He got you in the head?

446
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,450
That was pretty close!

447
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,020
He was pretty serious!

448
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,620
He got you right here.

449
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,190
I'm Super Sansuke! (EN: 6)

450
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,560
No way.

451
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,900
He's here?

452
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,030
Not many people
try a Sansuke impression.

453
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,400
I saw him a couple days ago.

454
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,240
It's sloppy
and the hair's too short.

455
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,740
Too white, too.

456
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,240
You two match.

457
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,240
Nah, I'm fine.

458
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,540
I'm seriously worried.

459
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,510
It's a tiger.

460
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,450
That stinks, man.

461
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,450
That stinks, shit! It stinks!

462
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,720
It's that good old
summer stench.

463
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,120
What kind of smell is that?

464
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,190
For real,
who thinks that?

465
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,290
It smells too bad.

466
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,460
Whoa! Gross!

467
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,060
That stinks!

468
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,230
I'm sure it's not that bad, right?

469
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,500
Damn, damn, it stinks!

470
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
Too soon.

471
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,740
Your reaction was too soon.

472
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,710
What?

473
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,840
It just

474
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,480
It was an impulse.

475
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,150
Of course not.

476
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,080
Alright, smell it then!

477
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,850
It stinks!

478
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,750
Too soon.

479
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,850
It was too late.

480
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,950
Too soon.

481
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,620
Too late.

482
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,930
So it's no good?

483
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,500
Not Sansuke?

484
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Sansuke is in trouble.

485
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,040
Not Sansuke?

486
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,340
-It stinks!
Too late!

487
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,740
Too late, huh?

488
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,240
So late I could die.

489
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,210
Doctor...

490
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,280
In your mouth.

491
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,600
I'm sure Yoshimoto will tell us
to stop after eating shit.

492
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,590
Inada is
about to puke.

493
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,360
What's that?

494
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,460
He's just about to puke.

495
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,330
Are you okay, Inada-san?

496
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,570
What's that sound?

497
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,170
I'm trying to fool myself.

498
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,540
To not puke?

499
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,240
Doing that helps?

500
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,680
Nadal, let's do that.
The Nadal reverse.

501
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,520
The Nadal reverse evolution.

502
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,750
It's been a long time, huh?

503
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,490
It can evolve in any way.

504
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,720
Revolution.

505
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,690
If you say "pencil" I can go
"sharpen!" like that.

506
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,460
I can make anything evolve
in Nadal reverse evolution.

507
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,960
Anything goes?

508
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,330
Tissue!

509
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,970
Flowing tissue.

510
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,540
Nadal reverse: Flowing Tissue
Evolution!

511
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,170
It normally doesn't flow,
but this one does down the toilet

512
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,510
That doesn't feel like an evolution.

513
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,180
Okay, the table!

514
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,180
A rotating table.

515
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,150
Nadal reverse evolution!

516
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,920
What's a rotating table?

517
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,590
A table is a table.

518
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,660
Twisted intestines.

519
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,760
Twisted intestines?

520
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,960
Twisted intestines?

521
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,930
It's a disease in your intestines.

522
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,000
Okay... cancer.

523
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,300
Nadal reverse evolution!

524
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,970
So it gets worse?

525
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,040
I thought it would get better.

526
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,110
It's evolving.

527
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,740
So it gets worse.

528
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,110
Trophy!

529
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,580
Uh... gold medal.

530
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,280
What's over there?

531
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,120
What trophy?

532
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,820
No, I wasn't looking at anything.

533
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,220
Miyasako-san. (EN: 7)

534
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,690
Kiyohara.

535
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,960
Nadal reverse evolution.

536
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,360
He evolved?

537
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,530
Is that an evolution?

538
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,130
Criminally, yeah.

539
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,170
Criminally?

540
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,600
Not criminals!

541
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,670
Can you do me?

542
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,340
An evolution?

543
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,010
Something I'm aspiring to.

544
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,310
Let's do that, yeah.

545
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,180
Shimaki Joji. (EN: 8)

546
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,450
Huh? Why?

547
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,950
Evolution.

548
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,120
Gorgeous.

549
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,990
That's good.

550
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,890
Yeah.

551
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,690
Do Koba-san.

552
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,260
An evolution?

553
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,160
Sasaki Kensuke. (EN: 9)

554
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,530
Nadal reverse evolution!

555
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,500
I kinda get it, though.

556
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,240
Why, though?

557
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,040
Okay, Jimmy-san.

558
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,710
Sato Jiro. (EN: 10)

559
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,480
Nadal reverse evolution.

560
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Is that good?

561
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,350
I think so, yeah.

562
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,420
Yeah, I think so.

563
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,090
It's not an evolution, just a lookalike.

564
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,390
Is there like a devolution?

565
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,530
I've never done that.

566
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,460
He might go off the deep end then.

567
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,730
Let's go with a devolution!

568
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,170
Pencil!

569
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,170
Uh... trash.

570
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,940
Trash?

571
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,340
That works with everything.

572
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,780
It's the same for everything.

573
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,050
It's kinda like philosophical.

574
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,750
Okay, Jimmy-san.

575
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,250
Uh...

576
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,030
Matsuo Bannai. (EN: 11)

577
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,030
Yeah, we don't look alike.

578
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,130
Isn't Bannai-san older?

579
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,830
We're contemporaries.

580
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,700
Then it's not a devolution.

581
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,200
It's not a devolution!

582
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,970
That's not a devolution.

583
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,870
Bannai-san is way better.

584
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,580
A sekitori? (EN: 12)

585
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,080
Where are you going?

586
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,620
You can't go that way.

587
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,720
No way.

588
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,990
What was that?

589
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,890
Huh?

590
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,990
What are you a grandpa?

591
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,390
Where are you going?

592
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,090
A grandpa?

593
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,730
Um... so...

594
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,800
The strobes?

595
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,400
Yeah, I want to project...

596
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,600
This way. This way.

597
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,700
Ah, that way?

598
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,970
And then turn left.

599
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,470
What's this all of a sudden?

600
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,840
I want you all
to see something.

601
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,240
Ah you wanna do something?

602
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,240
We'll watch

603
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,340
I'm gonna do something.

604
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,980
Show you something.

605
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,780
Of course,
just do it.

606
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,380
Okay, I'm gonna show you.

607
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,280
Maybe we'll learn something.

608
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,550
You can go this way?

609
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,490
That way.

610
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,520
This way.

611
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,860
Devolution? Devolution...

612
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,130
What is Nadal reverse evolution
devolved?

613
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,860
It'd be Nadal reverse.

614
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,470
-Do it with a better voice.
-What about Nadal reverse?

615
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,300
If it devolved?

616
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,770
"Nanno"

617
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,810
That's Nadal reverse devolved?

618
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,410
"Nanno"

619
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,450
-What's that?
-Nanno

620
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,890
That's not funny.
Who does that?

621
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,920
Cashew nuts

622
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,620
No, pistachio.

623
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,190
"Nanno"?

624
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,860
What are we going to eat?

625
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,730
He's pretty serious, huh?!

626
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,300
You're impressive.

627
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,870
I'm hungry. Wanna order something?

628
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,700
Take that.

629
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,270
I'm starving.

630
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,040
Let's choose.

631
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:11,780
Look at that. Ina-chan.

632
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,590
Rock paper scissors
Rock paper scissors

633
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,960
What can you make?
What can you make?

634
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,530
Right hand is a claw.
Left hand is a claw too.

635
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:34,100
We go shrimping.
We go shrimping. We go shrimping.

636
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,170
What's that?

637
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,510
Rock paper scissors
Rock paper scissors.

638
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,010
What can you make?
What can you make?

639
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,980
One on the right
One on the left

640
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Eye crushing,
eye crushing, eye crushing.

641
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,790
Rock paper scissors
Rock paper scissors

642
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,960
What can you make?
What can you make?

643
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,570
Right hand goes here
Left hand goes-

644
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,700
Feeling empty

645
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,640
Feeling empty

646
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,040
He can keep a straight face?

647
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,580
Feeling empty

648
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,480
Do that here!

649
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,550
What about the strobes?

650
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,850
I wanted to see the strobes.

651
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,490
Should've done that here.

652
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,590
Jimmy-san!
Use the strobes!

653
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,060
I think he's getting serious
so don't start nagging!

654
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,560
You didn't use the strobes.

655
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,430
Do it with the strobes
one more time.

656
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,000
Didn't you go to check
the strobes back there?

657
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,870
I'll do it again with the strobes.

658
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,080
He was looking for them.

659
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,210
That would be a dramatic change.

660
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,090
I'll do some ventriloquism.

661
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,260
Good day!

662
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,500
This would've been better
with no strobes, definitely.

663
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,870
The rhythm is all off, too.

664
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,070
It should be faster.

665
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:19,340
This is probably the worst thing
you could do with strobes.

666
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,280
Jimmy-san is all wrong about this.

667
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,610
It's impossible to tell the movements...

668
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,980
My right hand!

669
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,680
My eyes...

670
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,150
My eyes hurt.

671
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,250
A question.

672
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,460
Who built Osaka Castle?

673
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,690
That's the end?

674
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:38,930
Jimmy-san.

675
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,860
Wait, that was too hard to see.

676
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,330
My eyes hurt.

677
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,200
You see, ventriloquism...

678
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,500
I was doing ventriloquism.

679
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,870
It was great

680
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,540
But we couldn't see your awesomeness
because of the strobes.

681
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,710
Yeah, yeah!

682
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,540
It was all wrong.

683
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,710
You should do it here

684
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,350
We could see if you did it right here.

685
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,680
Alright, then let's do it here.

686
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,720
Alright, can I do it?

687
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,750
Yeah.

688
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,490
Okay, one question!

689
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,990
Sure!
I'll answer anything!

690
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,790
His mouth is moving.

691
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,830
It's moving?

692
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,230
Who built Osaka Castle?

693
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,700
Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

694
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,700
And who built Edo Castle?

695
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,770
Yeah.

696
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,640
Tokugawa Ieyasu.

697
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,840
Yeah.

698
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,080
Tokugawa Ieyasu.

699
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,080
It's 8:45 right now.

700
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,050
How should I attack?

701
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,490
What's the right attack?

702
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,630
Eight...

703
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,900
Beep

704
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,630
Beep...

705
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,970
Eight...

706
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,270
Forty five...

707
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,210
One minute

708
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,010
One minute

709
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,750
It's 8:46.

710
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,820
Huh?

711
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,220
What?

712
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,820
I should've attacked instead.

713
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,790
Well, it's just...
What's going on?

714
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,130
He'll answer correctly.

715
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,060
Ah, he hasn't answered yet?

716
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,730
No, not yet...

717
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,300
He's gonna answer correctly then?

718
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,600
He hasn't yet.

719
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,370
Ah, he's gonna?

720
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,440
I see!

721
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,870
Don't stop him halfway there.

722
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,540
Answer quickly.

723
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,680
How should I attack at 8:45?

724
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,010
I don't know
about that...

725
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,580
Not by the hourglass

726
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,190
I see, that's true.

727
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,690
Eight... wait...
What's this about?

728
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,000
The hourglass looked
just like 8:45

729
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,400
The hourglass looked like 8:45?

730
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,800
Because it's two circles?

731
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,270
Yeah yeah

732
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,670
The eight

733
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,140
The shape's like an eight? Then 45?

734
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,840
The 45 is on its side.

735
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,010
Where? What's that about?

736
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,750
I don't get it.

737
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,280
Did you smoke some pot back there?

738
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,950
Huh? Pot?

739
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,650
You're fucking crazy.

740
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,590
You've been weird since then.

741
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,190
Pretty insane.

742
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,130
That's some clean posture.

743
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,660
You did ballet or something?

744
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,930
Baseball.

745
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,370
Your leg posture is clean.

746
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,600
Hello

747
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,100
Ah damn it!

748
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,970
This is serious!

749
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,540
I'll answer anything about
the show business! (EN: 13)

750
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,240
Show business?

751
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,710
You curious?

752
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:44,980
Yeah!

753
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,680
You too?

754
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,250
That's not really great.

755
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,390
What's the future of
Johnny & Associates?

756
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,990
Who should answer?

757
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,360
Kubota-san's...

758
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,860
Why do I have to-

759
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,630
Makoto, Makoto.

760
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,430
What?
Makoto.

761
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,000
The name's Makoto.

762
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,110
What's gonna happen to
Johnny & Associates?

763
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,140
It's gonna collapse.

764
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,210
It collapsed yesterday.

765
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,180
Yesterday?

766
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,680
It didn't, though!

767
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,280
Is that true, Makoto-kun?

768
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,120
They replaced their windows.

769
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,390
What?
They replaced their windows.

770
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,490
Windows?

771
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,560
Ask any question! Go on!

772
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,860
Okay, so about the entertainment industry...

773
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,960
what actor likes to pretend
they're an MC?

774
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,200
Pocaskajan.

775
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,570
Huh?

776
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,000
Pocaskajan!

777
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,470
Pocaskajan? The trio?

778
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,270
From Wahaha Hompo?

779
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,540
Pocaskajan will take over
the world of comedy.

780
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,240
You agree, Makoto-kun?

781
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,980
Makoto-kun does, yes.

782
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,380
Yes.

783
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,020
You think so?

784
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,850
Okay, go ahead!

785
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,190
What woman could I hit on
in the show business?

786
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,490
Kudo Shizuka.

787
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,490
Huh?!

788
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,960
Kudo Shizuka-san!

789
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,960
No way!

790
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,630
No way, man!

791
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,400
What big couple's
gonna get married soon?

792
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,300
Let's ask Makoto-kun.

793
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,640
Married soon?

794
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,110
A big couple...

795
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,180
Can I say?

796
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,750
Mihara Junko-san and...

797
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,550
Hashi Yukio-san.

798
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,020
That's unexpected.

799
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,290
Weird choice.

800
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,090
Who's the strongest
performer out there?

801
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,290
The strongest fighter.

802
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,960
The strongest fighting performer.

803
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,260
I'm curious.

804
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,760
They're asking you.

805
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,500
Makoto-kun.

806
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,070
The strongest performer.

807
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,070
Eh... the strongest performer is...

808
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:54,410
Um... Giant Baba

809
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,880
What should I say?

810
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,180
Makoto-kun, what do you mean?

811
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,550
He's dead,
Makoto-kun.

812
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,250
I'm sorry!

813
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,790
Nadal, can you
borrow Makoto-kun?

814
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
What?

815
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,970
What what?

816
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,180
Ventriloquism.

817
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Hello. I'm Jimmy.

818
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,080
Jimmy-kun...

819
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
He's not talking at all.

820
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,250
Hello, I'm Jimmy.

821
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,020
Who's talking?

822
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,760
I'm sorry. This is my doll
Jimmy-kun.

823
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,360
I can do ventriloquism
without moving my mouth.

824
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,930
Ask anything
and he'll answer.

825
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,900
I'll answer anything!

826
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,130
Even anything about you?

827
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,100
Yeah, of course! Go on!

828
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,070
Jimmy-kun, what's the worst thing
you've done so far?

829
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,140
Okay. Pyromania.

830
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:07,850
That's cute.
Pyromania is cute.

831
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,550
You lit things on fire?

832
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,820
Yes!

833
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,890
Where?

834
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,060
All over the place.

835
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,290
You're evil!

836
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,260
He's pretty serious!

837
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,160
What's the most fun
you've had so far?

838
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,200
Okay

839
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,800
The first time I peeled my skin off.

840
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,970
Huh?

841
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,340
Skin

842
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,570
Your dick's?
Yes!

843
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,340
You like touching your dick?

844
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,940
I love it.

845
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,610
It didn't hurt
when you peeled it off?

846
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,580
It hurt

847
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,150
but it felt really good later.

848
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:45,120
So it feels great
after it hurts a little.

849
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,020
Did something come out?
Yes!

850
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,290
What came out?
Okay...

851
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,630
Tell us!
Yes!

852
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,330
Maracas.

853
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,130
What do you mean maracas?

854
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,000
It's over it's over.
We're done here.

855
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,370
It's over once
maracas show up.

856
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,840
This is for training.

857
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:06,040
Ina-chan, you have
any complexes?

858
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,040
He does?

859
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,980
Well you see... it's about my nipples.

860
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,050
Many people have complexes
about their nipples.

861
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,950
I can see something.

862
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,420
A complex?

863
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,190
Jimmy-san, Inada says
he has a complex.

864
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,490
They're too dark

865
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:26,660
and huge.

866
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,130
Dark and huge?

867
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,000
It's so ugly, I've turned down
all nude job offers so far.

868
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,940
Show us.

869
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,370
It's probably not so bad
if you can show other people.

870
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,740
Take a close look.
It's serious.

871
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,180
All of a sudden...

872
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,710
Here we go.

873
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,580
Here we go?

874
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,150
Huh? What?

875
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,290
They're pretty.

876
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
Huh?

877
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,020
How are they dark and big?

878
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,360
They're pale!

879
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,430
Pale!

880
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,330
I can't tell them apart!

881
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,370
Those would look good
on a girl!

882
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,170
They're good looking!

883
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,570
Your mom's tits
were pretty, right?

884
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,510
No, my mom's normal.

885
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,540
Normal?

886
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,180
I'm sure they're pretty.

887
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,580
Are they inverted?
Those are pretty tits.

888
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,080
They have no color.

889
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,720
Completely transparent.

890
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,420
That's unusual.

891
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,020
They're really light.

892
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,360
That one's getting hard.

893
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,390
Hard?

894
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,060
Well, I haven't done anything.

895
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,260
They're probably inverted nipples.

896
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:36,730
They're not.

897
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,570
It's hard with your hands.

898
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,300
Okay,
wanna use some lube?

899
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,470
Don't be so reckless
with Ina-san, okay?

900
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,170
Wait, wait. Stop.

901
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,740
It's fine.
Lube is a natural product.

902
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,010
Is your skin okay?

903
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,250
Can you get it even harder?

904
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,960
It's not getting harder.

905
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,360
Not like this?

906
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,260
Make it get harder!
Like a real man!

907
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,760
Koumoto-san...

908
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:09,600
Is this too weak?
I'm gonna do it harder.

909
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,370
Koumoto-san, make him a man.

910
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,400
It's getting harder.

911
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,140
For real, it is!

912
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,470
For real!

913
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,640
Hurry hurry!
Do it more!

914
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,980
How is it?

915
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,350
I'm close!

916
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,890
You came?

917
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,420
I'm feeling more sensitive.

918
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,290
Look! No way!

919
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:39,860
This one's different!

920
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,030
He came?

921
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,600
Not so slow?

922
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,940
Turn it
and open like a screwdriver.

923
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,070
Like a screwdriver...

924
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,640
Turn right.

925
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,810
Can I turn it around?

926
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,410
I'm closing it?

927
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,580
Ouch! Ouch!

928
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,980
I'll open up, sorry.

929
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,350
Open open open!

930
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,520
It's getting loose
It's getting loose!

931
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,820
There it is!

932
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,390
It's hard for sure!

933
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,390
Just twist it!

934
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,490
Thank you very much!

935
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,930
Thank you!

936
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,030
Sure!

937
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,460
Huh?

938
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,330
There we go!

939
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,470
That's it!

940
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,940
He smiled naturally.

941
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:25,810
There we go.

942
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,550
Don't fuck with me, Kubota.

943
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,450
Someone's finally out.

944
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,020
Took us long enough.

945
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,020
Took you long enough, huh?!

946
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,290
It was practically
a stalemate!

947
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,060
So Cookie smiled
naturally, right?

948
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,160
He smiled naturally.

949
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,230
Like it was obvious.

950
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,400
He smiled like it was obvious.

951
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,770
Of course I'd smile
with that face in front of me.

952
00:45:58,810 --> 00:45:59,940
Open it.

953
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,310
I'll open it up. Sorry.

954
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,610
Open open open!

955
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:06,580
It's getting loose
It's getting loose!

956
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,080
There we go!

957
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,650
It's hard for sure!

958
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,650
Just twist it!

959
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,720
Thank you very much!

960
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,190
Thank you!

961
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,420
Sure.

962
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:15,590
Huh?!

963
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,460
It's pretty obvious!

964
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,030
Just like a regular helper!

965
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,040
So Cookie!

966
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,040
You're out!

967
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,880
Damn it!

968
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:41,180
But Cookie might still
come back as a zombie.

969
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,050
It could happen.

970
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,950
I'm gonna take you all down!

971
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:49,590
I was surprised by
Ina-chan's nipples.

972
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,160
It was impressive.

973
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,290
For sure, yeah.

974
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,430
They've been like that forever.

975
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,060
Like a nordic girl's.

976
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,430
For real!

977
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,130
An eastern block country.

978
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:01,200
Thank you all!

979
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:02,870
Nine left.

980
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,410
It's hard, for sure.

981
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,940
I tend to forget the feeling.

982
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:11,110
I also laughed a lot my first time

983
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,480
but when I won,
I somehow managed to hold it.

984
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,050
But I completely let go

985
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,050
of that holding back feeling.

986
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,490
Thank you very much.

987
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:25,730
Sure.

988
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,130
It's rough to have comedy be
like all or nothing.

989
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,870
Though I guess I got nothing this time.

990
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,570
I think it's perfectly fine!

991
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,310
It's fine, yeah!

992
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,510
No problems.

993
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,180
No problems, right?

994
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,110
And the nudity too

995
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,250
It was relatively tame

996
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,820
Compared to previous seasons?

997
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,290
For real, yeah!

998
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,620
There was almost no nudity.

999
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:58,990
We just battled with pure laughter
that's what it feels like.

1000
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:01,560
Nudity like that
is tamer than idol pictures.

1001
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,430
You could even sell it.

1002
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,470
Who'd wanna look at that?!

1003
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,670
Strip more!

1004
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,670
That was the complaint?!

1005
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,670
They wanted more skin?!

1006
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:11,940
That was it?

1007
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,910
Because Ina-chan's nipples
looked so good!

1008
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:17,480
They didn't want something
so clean!

1009
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,850
They wanted filth!

1010
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,150
We didn't need this!

1011
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,350
Amazon has their bar too high!

1012
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,020
That's true, yeah.

1013
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,120
There was nothing wrong.

1014
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,590
Nothing, right?

1015
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,490
I don't get it at all!

1016
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:33,960
It was as fun as
a Jackie Chan movie.

1017
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,200
The action of laughter.
