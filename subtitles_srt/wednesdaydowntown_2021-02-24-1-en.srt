Let's get started. Please welcome our first presenter.

10
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,420
Who's there?

11
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,930
It's Kamaitachi!

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,900
Pleased to meet you.

13
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,810
We brought back a past theory that was well liked, here it is:

14
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:35,910
If an angry caller says "I'm heading over right now so you better stay put!",

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,490
you can't point them out no matter how ridiculous they look.

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,760
Very interesting.

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,690
Yamauchi played a big role in this one.

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,690
Yes, I did this last time.

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,360
I went over to GAG's Fukui

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,500
completely soaked and pissed off.

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:03,210
Round 1 OA last year 12/23

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,810
He disregarded everything for the entire three minutes.

00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,810
GAG Fukui Shuntaro

24
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,210
I was dripping all over the floor!

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,840
Last time the result was

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Yamauchi was the only one who succeeded.

65
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,150
Oh that's right.

66
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,250
Most of them noticed and said something.

67
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,250
They commented.

68
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,820
Right.

69
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,660
By the way, if people saw the episode

70
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,690
firsthand, they might get suspicious

71
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:28,000
(This theory was filmed before airing to avoid suspicion.)

72
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,460
and guess the theory, so we already

73
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,000
filmed today's theory before the episode aired.

74
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,170
I kind of have something to say, though.

75
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,910
It was super cold that day.

76
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:40,310
If I'm going to get soaked, the water could've been warm.

77
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,720
So I asked for warm water, and they said "of course".

78
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,250
Then filming started and I poured it on me.

79
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,690
It was super cold water!

80
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,290
I was so upset!

81
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,130
That's upsetting.

82
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,790
That kind of trick isn't necessary!

83
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,070
I would understand if they included a "mini-prank" in the episode.

84
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,040
But no, they just made me dump cold water on myself for nothing!

85
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,270
I was SO upset for a quick second!

86
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,570
Yeah, the staff here

87
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,380
are all psychos.

88
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,380
Yeah they're insane.

89
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,720
After this, we test if the ridiculous appearances will be pointed out once again.

90
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,620
Furthermore,

91
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,250
Special project!

92
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,960
Something where 100% of males but 0% of females know of exists!

93
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm seriously going to kill you.

94
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,000
Noooo stop!

95
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,310
Theory: If an angry caller says

96
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,290
"I'm heading over right now so you better stay put!",

97
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,660
you can't point them out no matter how ridiculous they look.

98
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,960
Jichō Kachō Kōmoto Jun'ichi

99
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,960

102
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,960
Yukipoyo

103
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,830
These five are up for the challenge today.

104
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,500
Otake!

105
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:12,640
Junior comedian

106
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:12,640
Junior comedian

107
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:12,640
Junior gal model

108
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:12,640
Junior wrestler

109
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:12,640
Singer mentee

110
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,870
They each pick their closest juniors

111
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,640
and start the challenge without looking suspicious.

112
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,550
Endo Mizuki

113
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,550

Panther
Ogata Takahiro

117
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,980
That being said, we invite them for a fake meeting.

118
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,550
We begin after leaving them alone.

119
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,690
Why did he go "Shh"?

120
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,790
Ah, thank you for your hard work!

121
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,790
Mogura?

122
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,190
Last time remember you slept over?

123
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,190
Yes.

124
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,900
And remember my Yogibo pillow?

125
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,900
Yes.

126
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,140
You slept on it and

127
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,140
Yes.

128
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,870
it was drenched in sweat the next morning.

129
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,840
Right.

130
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,540
Then after that it got moldy.

131
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,880
Mold...?

132
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,880
Yeah it grew mold. What are you gonna do?

133
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,250
I can't even use it anymore.

134
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:02,050
Otake-san...I think the mold is from the room's humidity.

135
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,050
That's irrelevant! It's not humid.

136
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,660
Are you seriously mocking me right now?

137
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,660
No no, I'm not.

138
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,460
Next, Kandori

139
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,360
targets his assistant junior wrestler.

140
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,730
Ah, Kandori.

141
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,370
about getting his meeting times mixed up.

142
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,600
This is pretty scary.

143
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,600
The time for my meeting is different!

144
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
So it's not 4 o'clock?

145
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,510
Yeah! What are you doing?!

146
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:27,110
I'm going to clarify with Kameda-san real quick.

147
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,110
You don't need to go check!

148
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,250
So upset.

149
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,580
That must be so scary.

150
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,780
Scary!

151
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,520
Then, Yukipoyo

152
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,920
targets her junior gal model.

153
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,250
How do gals get
angry at each other?

154
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,890
Like when we went out for some grub. It was last time but

155
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:37,890
Yes

156
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,960
Say "dinner".

157
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,290
You said "Yukipoyo-san, if you were skinny you'd be pretty cute."

158
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,730
You kept calling me "fried chicken" or "fried chicken bento".

159
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
She's probably looking
down on her so much.

160
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,730
I apologize, I was just joking.

161
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,100
Seriously? Are you mocking me?

162
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,610
Meanwhile, Lady Dewi

163
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,210
Scary.

164
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,210
Yeah, scary.

165
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,310
You arrived immediately

166
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,250
Singer mentee
Kawana Rumi

167
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,980
A singer she's mentoring?

168
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,280
And you...

169
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,940
What is she upset about?

170
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,980
took up "associate"-san and "associate"-san's

171
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,320
offer quickly and left.

172
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,320
Who?

173
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,320
Ah, yes yes.

174
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,150
You know, I really think that was very rude of you.

175
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,160
There's one person who's in another realm.

176
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,160
So funny.

177
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,030
She lectures on the singer's poor interaction with an important affiliate.

178
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,630
Lastly, the 5th member Kōmoto.

179
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,600
What the heck did you do now, huh?

180
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,600
That's scary.

181
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
So upset!

182
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,270
I'm serious here, you hear?!

183
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,270
He's mad.

184
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,510
Wait a minute, hold on.

185
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,940
That's so scary.

186
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,680
Seriously...

187
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,110
I really don't understand what you mean.

188
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,750
I heard from another junior about it.

189
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,750
Scary.

190
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,780
What?

191
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,750
That's terrifying.

192
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,850
You told people things I told you not to speak of again.

193
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,860
Here it comes.

194
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,220
About what? The Korea thing?

195
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,220
What is it?

196
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,700
I didn't say anything. I only talked about myself.

197
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,370
I never said that you went.

198
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,400
It boomeranged on him.

199
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,440
I only told my side.

200
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,440
This is really not good.

201
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,850
Kōmoto planted this on himself.

202
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,650
Don't laugh, man.

203
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,250
You can't laugh.

204
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,250
Yeah, hold it in.

205
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,850
Wait, or is it about Osaka?

206
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,090
Another one?

207
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,090
That's awful.

208
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,890
Is it Osaka then?

209
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,790
I'd be busted too, so I didn't say anything about that one.

210
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,590
He did something too?!

211
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,590
What did they do?

212
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,990
Don't laugh!

213
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:27,900
That was the sneak peak of the five challenger's angry calls.

214
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,570
Kōmoto's got
something going on.

215
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,230
Where are you right now?

216
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,170
I'm in the meeting room....uh at TBS waiting for the producer.

217
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,170
She's panicking.

218
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,170
Nervous, yeah.

219
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,310
Waiting here, yes.

220
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,040
I see.

221
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,940
And you being able to work with TBS is thanks to me, right?

222
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,940
Yes of course, of course.

223
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,610
I'm nearby right now.

224
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,420
I'm going to go over to you right now, so wait.

225
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,380
I need to talk to you in person about this.

226
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,950
You better wait for me, bastard.

227
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,620
You wait there, I'm coming right now!

228
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,020
Kōmoto-san I'm really sor-

229
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,560
Okay, well I'm going to go over now.

230
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
I don't care that you're in a meeting.

231
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,960
Send me your location right now.

232
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,360
This I really can't let go.

233
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,170
I'm going to head over right now.

234
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,170
It's just a Yogibo right?

235
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,700
Whatever...you..

236
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,270
I'm gonna mess you up. Seriously.

237
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,810
I'm not gonna wait. You wait.

238
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,040
Otake is so weak!

239
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:19,250
Now that we've sent an angry aura, stand-by is complete.

240
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,250
That said,

241
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,990
first up for the challenge is Kōmoto.

242
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,160
And his transformation is...

243
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,160
Oh, he chooses now.

244
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,630
Covered in mud.

245
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,340
Please go to Ogata-san completely covered in mud.

246
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,470
I'm going to distract him from all this mud

247
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,980
with my words.

248
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,280
So if he looks away even once, I'm going to yell "Look at me!"

249
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,950
He was only supposed to act upset,

250
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:56,050
but ends up getting actually upset from getting his secret spilled.

251
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,690
Kōmoto now heads over filled with rage and mud.

252
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,830
He goes for the kill.

253
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,830
That's a good
amount of mud!

254
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,300
Yeah it's a
good amount.

255
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:09,630
Same as last time, the target has to clear 3 minutes without commenting.

256
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,830
Three minutes
is so long!

257
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,300
What will await?

258
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,610
What the heck did you do?!

259
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,370
I'm sorry.

260
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,610
I'm sorry.

261
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,680
What is wrong with you?

262
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,680
I'm sorry.

263
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,310
You're so full of crap.

264
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,310
I'm sorry.

265
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,790
Full of anger, Kōmoto was able to keep the target from commenting.

266
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,650
He looks concerned
though.

267
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,360
Everyone knows everything all because of you.

268
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,360
I'm sorry.

269
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,630
I trusted you. What the heck?

270
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,270
And you don't even remember because you were drunk.

271
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,900
My eyes are up here!

272
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,440
Where are you looking? Look here!

273
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,440
I'm sorry.

274
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,940
He can do this.

275
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,670
Your junior

276
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,510
on YouTube and a bunch of other people.

277
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,810
I got together with them

278
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,610
and I treated them out for dinner and drinks

279
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,080
and they told me "Ogata-san told me"

280
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,720
and I doubted them saying "no, you're bluffing" so many times.

281
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,720
I'm sorry.

282
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,520
I can't trust you or talk to you anymore.

283
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,990
Look at me!

284
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,520
I said look over here!

285
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,130
He's laughing a little.

286
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,130
Kōmoto-san...

287
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,530
Stop screwing around, seriously.

288
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,990
Oh no.

289
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,630
Because of the multiple "look over here,"

290
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,140
Ogata can't help but to start laugh.

291
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,870
That's understandable.

292
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,040
I trusted you and Kanada so much.

293
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,010
Kōmoto-san, is everything okay? That...

294
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,040
Stop screwing around seriously!

295
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,040
Kōmoto-san wait a minute please.

296
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,480
Why did you tell them? Tell me why you said it.

297
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,480
Kōmoto-san...

298
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,090
What happened to you?

299
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,050
I said look this way.

300
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,020
Forget about "what happened".

301
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,450
I said look over here!

302
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,450
What is all of this?

303
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,860
What happened?

304
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,290
What is all of this?

305
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:47,370
Jichō Kachō Kōmoto Jun'ichi:  1 min 7 sec

306
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,630
Ogata unusually notices that this is a prank.

307
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,370
Kōmoto at 1 min 7 sec, fails.

308
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,970
Prank reveal.

309
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,970
I told you everything!

310
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,970
See, I knew it

311
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,500
I knew something was up.

312
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,640
See!

313
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,140
There's no way this is normal.

314
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,140
I said look here.

315
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,440
Saying "look here" so many times.

316
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,440
"Look here."

317
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,880
While explaining our theory,

318
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,780
we ask the to clarify the other incident.

319
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,050
I have something I want to ask.

320
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,790
The other thing.

321
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,190
What were you talking about the Osaka thing?

322
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,390
Why did you say that?

323
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,390
Osaka...

324
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,390
I swear...

325
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,390
Please let the Osaka thing go.

326
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,060
What happened?

327
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,870
Right, Kōmoto-san?

328
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,870
But you should make it clear that you didn't cheat on your wife.

329
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,370
I didn't cheat, I promise!

330
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,940
It's kind of... like a brothel.

331
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,640
No that sounds confusing.

332
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,580
If you say "it's like a brothel" then they'll think something else.

333
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,580
It was a brothel.

334
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,980
Next up, Otake's challenge.

335
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,590
Is Otake gonna be ok?

336
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,750
Barefoot.

337
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,550
Following Daiyan Tsuda's barefoot from last time,

338
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,520
a second barefoot challenge.

339
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,530
He has such a
funny face.

340
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,290
"Mogura's sweat made my pillow grow mold"

341
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,660
was Otake's reason of rage, but

342
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,370
how will it turn out?

343
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,370
I mean he looks
funny but...

344
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,810
You're totally being condescending towards me.

345
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,810
No no no.

346
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,770
Wait a minute.

347
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,380
This is not right, don't you think?

348
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,750
This is wrong.

349
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,250
Please, hold on.

350
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,250
This is outright wrong.

351
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,810
The mold on Yogibo.

352
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,750
Wait wait wait.

353
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,750
You used it didn't you?

354
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,650
Uh, no. Let's calm down for a sec.

355
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,220
I'm calm.

356
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
He got closer
to his feet.

357
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,220
No, no you're not calm.

358
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,990
I'm calm. I mean what can I do?

359
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,060
But the...

360
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,730
What are you gonna do then?

361
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,370
What are you gonna do about the mold on Yogibo?

362
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:35,240
Mogura smoothly goes into defensive position.

363
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,070
He's used to
apologizing.

364
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,140
His line of sight is clearly at his feet,

365
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,710
but for some reason doesn't comment.

366
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,020
You were the one that grew the mold.

367
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,020
The mold...

368
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,880
"Grew it."

369
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,590
What are you gonna do if it molds?

370
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,590
But mold forms because of the humidity.

371
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,520
Humidity isn't the only thing, seriously.

372
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,590
He disagrees.

373
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,260
The bacteria is reacting to YOUR sweat.

374
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,930
It doesn't happen from just humidity;

375
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,860
it's a scientific reaction from the bacteria.

376
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,170
But mold...

377
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,470
Explanation on mold.

378
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,270
But mold feasts on moisture and humidity...

379
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,270
Humidity? Why do you keep...

380
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,410
...why do you think my house is humid?

381
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,070
Okay fine, Otake-san.

382
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,070
There is no moisture!

383
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,540
Otake-san, there's moisture everywhere.

384
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,540
Well there's none in my house!

385
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,280
I make a conscious effort to not have moisture!

386
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,450
No room is moisture-free.

387
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,120
I open windows!!

388
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,180
Okay okay.

389
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,120
Okay, I get it.

390
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:23,520
They continue to have an argument about humidity and mold like idiots.

391
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,620
They're really idiots.

392
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,060
Can he make it?

393
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,560
Even after one minute has passed since starting,

394
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,890
he shows no sign of commenting on being barefoot.

395
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,890
It's going good.

396
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,890
I see.

397
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,700
You're completely looking down on me.

398
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,770
Please, calm down.

399
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,770
Don't say "humidity" anymore.

400
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,640
Then don't say "mold".

401
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,670
You grew the mold!

402
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,510
So stop mentioning "humidity".

403
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,510
Well I'll stop mentioning "humidity" so stop saying "mold".

404
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,540
Otake-san it doesn't make sense.

405
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,540
This prick is so condescending.

406
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,040
A conversation between two idiots.

407
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,480
The argument continues on the mold growing incident.

408
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,950
Oh he made it.

409
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,520
He passes the three minute mark without getting his bare feet noticed.

410
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,420
Prank reveal.

411
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,160
I'm always keeping my windows open so there's no moisture at all.

412
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,590
But moisture exists outside too.

413
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,590
NO THERE ISN'T!

414
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,930
What's this?

415
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,930
This was a tough battle.

416
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,900
This guy, seriously.

417
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,000
He looks down on me so much.

418
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,310
Did you notice something unusual?

419
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,240
Uhm...

420
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,610
Mold will grow...

421
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,550
Are you still on that?

422
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,220
You're still on that!

423
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,320
There's nothing strange going on with him?

424
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,320
With him?

425
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,120
Take a good look.

426
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,660
He never noticed.

427
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,970
Bare....you're barefoot!

428
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,930
No way.

429
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,330
He was barefoot this whole time?

430
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,100
Seriously...this guy man.

431
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,140
He didn't notice.

432
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,510
He's mocking me.

433
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,210
You don't really look down when getting yelled at.

434
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,180
I don't think that's the case.

435
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,280
Next challanger is Yukipoyo.

436
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,790
This is going to be fun.

437
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,890
Party glasses.

438
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,530
This?

439
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,960
This looks super stupid.

440
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,630
Ah okay.

441
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,630
She'll definitely say
something.

442
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,800
Get mad? With this?

443
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:21,340
She'll be lecturing on her over-friendly attitude.

444
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,810
Complete opposite from the rage.

445
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,210
she flaunts this celebratory appearance.

446
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,980
She'll think she came
from a party.

447
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,980
Yeah true.

448
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,820
She'll say it.

449
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,250
And then...

450
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,220
There's no way.

451
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,090
See she's laughing.

452
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,090
She laughs from the contrast.

453
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,260
Or so we thought...

454
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,600
She's crying?!

455
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,260
What are you crying for?

456
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,770
You think I'd forgive you just because you're crying?

457
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,770
I'm so sorry.

458
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,330
Huh?

459
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,570
Unforeseen real tears.

460
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,410
Maybe she's actually scary?

461
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,640
This is definitely not the first time this has happened.

462
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,050
You took advantage of me staying quiet.

463
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,080
That's so ridiculous, speaking like that to your senior.

464
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,780
Saying stuff like "you're fat" or "if you were skinny, you'd be cute."

465
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Can you say the same thing to other seniors?

466
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,890
I was messing around and I misspoke.

467
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,460
This is unforgivable. You're mocking me aren't you?

468
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,730
You can see the history
between them.

469
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,660
"There's no way" and "mocking" is clearly her but

470
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:26,370
the sobbing junior seems to be in no position to comment on her seniors' appearance.

471
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,770
That's expected.

472
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,770
Wow, that's crazy.

473
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,770
She's been crying
the whole time.

474
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,210
Yukipoyo, easily cleared.

475
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,540
Prank reveal

476
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,710
I thought she'd
comment right away.

477
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,710
Is she okay?

478
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,950
Why is there a camera here...

479
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,750
She gently explains that she's not upset.

480
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,480
I'm so sorryyyy.

481
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,920
and reassures her. And then...

482
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,130
Did you notice something unusual while getting lectured?

483
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,200
Right now?

484
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,430
Well... this.

485
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,730
So she knew.

486
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,730
But was too upset.

487
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,970
Let's still be close during 2021.

488
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,970
Yes please, I'd like that.

489
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,340
That was so terrifying!

490
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,610
Since there were more instances of non-commenters this round,

491
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:16,420
next up we used his normal transformation instead of assigning a random one.

492
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,920
And thus,

493
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,060
Alrighty!

494
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,030
You ready?

495
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,030
Yup, ready!

496
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,300
Kandori has transformed into Great Muta with his makeup.

497
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,030
Great Shinobu

498
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,840
Hello? I'm gonna hang up, you bastard!

499
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:39,240
He enters the ring, completely on a different level than the others.

500
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,710
He's a maniac.

501
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,550
What the heck do you think you're doing?

502
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,790
Why is the time so wrong?

503
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,130
Why did you tell me the wrong information?

504
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,660
I'm always telling you "time is important!"

505
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:04,170
The junior stays silent despite this ridiculous circumstance.

506
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,070
I'm always saying "time is important".

507
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,310
Hey!

508
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,210
Why can't you comprehend "time is important?"

509
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,750
What about eating?

510
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,550
Eating?

511
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,550
If I said I was gonna eat now,

512
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,750
and couldn't, then my food would get cold!

513
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,920
Am I wrong?

514
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,190
He's not used to lecturing people?

515
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,090
Why does the food get cold?

516
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,030
Why did the time change?

517
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,000
A lot of stuff would get ruined!

518
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,470
The food is gonna get cold, too.

519
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,800
He sticks to that
so much!

520
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,240
Where did his main point of rage go?

521
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,470
That's his only point.

522
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,670
His point shifted, yeah.

523
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:47,580
For some reason he starts lecturing his junior about food.

524
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,280
I won't be able to eat fresh cooked rice!

525
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,280
Still?

526
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,280
This is not good.

527
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,480
Hey!

528
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,850
I won't be able to eat fresh cooked rice!

529
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,560
I'm very sorry.

530
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,330
It's almost as if she's getting lectured.

531
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,170
about not cooking rice.

532
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,170
He can't eat fresh rice!

533
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:13,670
Sticking to this point, he clears the 2 minute mark.

534
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,370
False charges.

535
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,340
Prank reveal

536
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,170
False charges.

537
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,740
Maybe she's relieved.

538
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,050
She was holding
it in I guess.

539
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,080
She's crying.

540
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,250
This is wrong.

541
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,520
Why didn't you think anything after seeing this face?

542
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,520
I thought maybe you rushed over here.

543
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,330
The last challenger is Lady Dewi.

544
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,660
And her transformation is:

545
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,800
Here's Matsumoto's suggestion from the last round...

546
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,410
Like with a parrot on their shoulder.

547
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,910
That being said,

548
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,380
It looks good on her.

549
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:04,260
"you embarrassed me in front of an affiliate" will be her lecture.

550
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,760
She arrives with rage and a parrot on her shoulder.

551
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,960
What will happen?

552
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,000
I wonder.

553
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,640
Good morning.

554
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,640
Sit down.

555
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,570
Did you even think anything through?

556
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,570
Yes.

557
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,610
Go sit down.

558
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,140
She completely notices the parrot on her shoulder

559
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,210
but remains silent.

560
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,550
Well yeah.

561
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,190
"Associate"-san has the capability of gathering 500 people.

562
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,520
Who is she
talking about?

563
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,490
And that person likes music and is a good singer

564
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,490
and kindly offered to co-star with you.

565
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,160
What do you think is more important?

566
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,000
You should have come with us.

567
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,960
Yes of course.

568
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,030
"Associate"-san came out to see us

569
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,170
She makes her
sit down.

570
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,400
so don't you think you should take care of that first?

571
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,270
You can't just show up only when it suits you.

572
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,970
They give you some connections

573
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,140
and you become affiliated with them.

574
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,480
You were with a very important business customer

575
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,450
so you definitely should have come with us.

576
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,650
Ouch!

577
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,820
You need to be more aware of that.

578
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,820
I'll be more careful.

579
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,820
She didn't laugh.

580
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,820
It bit her.

581
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,830
Though surprised at Lady Dewi getting bit,

582
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:23,130
she doesn't comment about the parrot.

583
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,070
Ah I see.

584
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,770
And after,

585
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,970
since you're going to be doing business as "Mini Dewi",

586
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,340
you need to

587
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,540
take this seriously and be more careful.

588
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,910
That's not good.

589
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:40,450
Three minutes go by without any mention.

590
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,950
She couldn't, huh.

591
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,120
As a result, most people will stay quiet, unless they're a comedian.

592
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,990
That's how it is.

593
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,460
So we incorporated more intense transformations this time.

594
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,070
What did you guys think of it?

595
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,700
Kawana-san was pretty interesting to me.

596
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,800
She's gonna be "Mini Dewi"?

597
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,370
As "Mini Dewi"?

598
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,370
She said so, yes.

599
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,310
I think she already debuted as of now.

600
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,850
Really?

601
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,410
Doing impersonations, yes.

602
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,410
What the heck is "Mini Dewi?"

603
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,280
Kind of like "Mini Inoki."

604
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,850
Like Mini Inoki.

605
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,620
Also don't forget that Kōmoto-san went to a brothel in Osaka.

606
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,720
Yeah I almost forgot.

607
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,960
I wonder if you lay hands on them?

608
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,960
What do you mean?

609
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,360
Like since I'm angry,

610
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,830
He quickly uses his fists.

611
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,900
Like getting upset and kicking them would seem more authentic.

612
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,300
Well, not really authentic.

613
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,670
That's would just be you getting upset for real.

614
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,670
Well yeah but...

615
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,210
It wouldn't be a prank anymore.

616
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,040
But then I'd look funny.

617
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,040
That doesn't matter.

618
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,820
Getting upset in a strange costume.

619
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,820
Yeah just plain getting upset in a strange costume.

620
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:05,500
Let's test out our theory: There are things that 100% of men know but 0% of women know.

621
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:11,310
Which means this special quiz starts now.

622
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,880
Presenter
Kawashima Akira
(Kirin) [comedy duo]

623
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,010
First off the male team.

624
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:20,420
Hamada-san, Matsumoto-san, Bakarhythm-san, Kamaitachi Hamaie-kun and Suzuki Fuku-kun.

625
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,750
And then the female team

626
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:28,830
YOU-san, Ohashi-san, Haruna-chan from Harisenbon, Fuwa-chan, and Inoue Sakura-chan.

627
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,690
In this quiz we test

628
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,670
for things that men will know that women don't.

629
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:40,340
And the opposite too. Both teams should aim for this situation.

630
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,040
The two teams will take turns asking questions.

631
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,850
And the winner will be the team with most 100% vs. 0% wins.

632
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:56,220
To ensure we focus on topics advantageous for each gender instead of generation, these are our team member selections.

633
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:02,630
So Hamada remembers that Fuku is too young to know certain things from previous eras.

634
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,630
That's right.

635
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,030
And dirty jokes and sexual differences are prohibited.

636
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,000
Since it's Reiwa-era now.

637
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,830
That's right.

638
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,830
Otherwise the male team would use those.

639
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,300
It's what men excel at to begin with, right?

640
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,300
That's right.

641
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,540
We will start with the male team. Who will go first?

642
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,710
The important role of starting.

643
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,710
Then I will.

644
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,850
Bakarhythm-san!

645
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,420
I'm entrusting you.

646
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,420
To start.

647
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,750
What is the real name of Kinnikuman?

648
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:43,000
What is Kinnikuman's real name?

649
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,220
And the question is: "What is Kinnikuman's real name?"

650
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,090
Full name?

651
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,990
Huh?

652
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,260
No no no no no.

653
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,000
Don't ridicule us.

654
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,970
We're not from the Kinnikuman generation!

655
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,870
That's right

656
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,310
But you definitely should've heard it.

657
00:23:47,970 --> 00:24:25,280
What is Kinnikuman's real name?

658
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,640
It's definitely a manga that's popular among men.

659
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,750
It's a very elaborate universe.

660
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,880
It's still being serialized.

661
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,780
Young...

662
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,160
Since it's still being produced even the young would know.

663
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,050
Yes, I think it's a well-balanced question.

664
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,690
Let's see the answers from the female team first.

665
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,430
Reveal them at the same time.

666
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,800
Motomiya Seichi

667
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,370
Like a regular dude.

668
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,900
Ohashi-san wrote: Kinnukuman Taro

669
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,640

Kin Nikutaro

671
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,110
Sato Hanamichi

672
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,780
Bakarhythm, are there any correct answers here?

673
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:49,200
What is Kinnikuman's real name?

674
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,320
There are not.

675
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,820
That's how it turned out.

676
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,620
If all male team members get it right they will score a point.

677
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,560
I didn't see my answer in theirs so that means...

678
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,030
Me too.

679
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,730
Let's have a look. Reveal your answers!

680
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,540

Kinniku Suguru

684
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,150
And Fuku wrote Kinniku Taro

685
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,280
No points rewarded since the answers don't match up.

686
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:09,990
Answer: Kinniku Suguru

687
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,990
This is really difficult.

688
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,990
Perhaps our generations are too different.

689
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,820
Next up is the female team.

690
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,590
Who will do it?

691
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,660
Can I?

692
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,590
Ah, Ohashi-san

693
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,560
Ohashi-san will pose the question.

694
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:29,970
When painting our fingers it's called a manicure. What is it called when it's the toes?

695
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:48,390
What is it called when you paint your toe nails?

696
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,910
I think the girls can answer this.

697
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,910
This is nice.

698
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,250
You all appear so confident.

699
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,250
What a great question.

700
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,920
From the male team: reveal your answers!

701
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,690
Pedicure, pedicure, pedicure, pedicure, foot nail.

702
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,360
Oh no, Fuku!

703
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,290
Hey! Stop messing around!

704
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:59,800
Answer: Pedicure

705
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,500
Quit it you bastard!

706
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,500
I'm sorry.

707
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,830
I love you, Fuku!

708
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,340
He wrote "foot nail."

709
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,370
It's fine that he didn't know.

710
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,870
Do you want me to end you, lightly?

711
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,870
Please stop!

712
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,880
He will be taken off the job,

713
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:22,830
What is it called when you paint your toe nails? Answer: Pedicure

714
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,280
forcing him to quit.

715
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,850
Let's see the girls' answers.

716
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,620
Pedicure, pedicure, pedicure, pedicure, peeeeediiiiiicure.

717
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,320
But it should be 0% vs. 100%

718
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,830
Since four got it right you do not get any points.

719
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:28,830
And on the male team Kamaitachi will ask the next question.

720
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,440
What is the name of the company that uses this logo?

721
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,680
Red on the left and blue.

722
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,850
It's the squares that are colored

723
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:46,850
What is the name of this company?

724
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,850
What surrounds the white stars, right?

725
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,350
Hamada is looking like...

726
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,050
He's watching his own house burn down

727
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,690
I'm begging you, Hamada!

728
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,690
He's trying to remember.

729
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,230
No no no. You know this.

730
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,160
What does the logo signify?

731
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,400
Eh, what?

732
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,640
This is no good.

733
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,640
It's the logo of a company...

734
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,500
Men should know this one.

735
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,940
And now Hamada...

736
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,340
No way.

737
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,240
Looks like you've warped through time

738
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,810
Hold up

739
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:35,600
What company is this?

740
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,810
Based on this it's impossible for him to get it.

741
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,150
He asked it because men should be able to answer.

742
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,150
That is indeed the theme of this quiz.

743
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,250
I KNOW THAT!

744
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,130
So it's red there and blue there.

745
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,030
If it had colors you would immediately remember.

746
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,030
That's right.

747
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,100
Please try to imagine that part.

748
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,100
That's right.

749
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,440
Tanabe's catchphrase?

750
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,440
How come?

751
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,440
A Borujyuku reference.

752
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:50,010
What company is this?

753
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,410
There it is!

754
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,240
Did it come out, Hamada?

755
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,640
From deep inside!

756
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,910
He's choking.

757
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,780
He started choking.

758
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,180
He choked cause he let out a loud voice.

759
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,420
But if this is wrong I would look so lame

760
00:27:53,180 --> 00:28:10,800
What company is this?

761
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,590
First you need the opposing side to answer entirely wrong.

762
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,230
With that reveal your answers in one go.

763
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,700
Converse and Tamiya

764
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,800
Haru-chan and Fuwa-chan said Tamiya and then... TENGA!

765
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,710
Are you messing around?!

766
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,870
Stop that!

767
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,370
We made the promise, remember?

768
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,140
No dirty jokes!

769
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,240
I said to not include dirty jokes!

770
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,750
Everyone has kept it inside!

771
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,820
But I thought it was something that only men would know.

772
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,820
You went there!?

773
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,420
Let's see the answers from the male team.

774
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,690
What company is this?

775
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,690
Hamada-san Tamiya. Matsumoto-san Tamiya. Tamiya. Tamiya. Tamiya

776
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:46,300
Answer: Tamiya

777
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,060
We did it!

778
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,160
Ah, but they also got it.

779
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,160
That's right.

780
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,900
Ohashi-san, Haruna-chan and even Fuwa-chan got it

781
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,570
Which means that you get no points.

782
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,300
Why do you know?

783
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,870
I have a younger brother.

784
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,710
Yeah, I have a male sibling.

785
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,640
I have a big brother and he used to make them.

786
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,710
Why did you write that?

787
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,120
I heard it was something that guys would get.

788
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,590
It's a toy that your **** will get.

789
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,590
Talking about men.

790
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,590
Next up from the female team Haruna from Harisenbon will ask the question.

791
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,130
About KinKi Kids

792
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:17,730
Before they became KinKi Kids what were they called?

793
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:33,580
What was the group KinKi Kids named before their debut?

794
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,510
It's a well-known name.

795
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,510
I've heard it before.

796
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,140
Looks like the male team is struggling.

797
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,880
And with that...

798
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,750
Are you ready? Reveal your answers all at once.

799
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,350
Hamada-san: Osaka Brothers

800
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,590
Matsumoto-san: Kansai Young Boys

801
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,720
Bakarhythm-san: Kansai Boya

802
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Hamaie-san: Kansai Boys

803
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,430
Fuku-kun: Doumoto Brothers

804
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,160
Now, we're all divided.

805
00:29:46,160 --> 00:30:02,980
The group name KinKi Kids had before their debut is?

806
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,170
Female team. Reveal your answers in one go.

807
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,270
YOU-san: Toukai Bro

808
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,940
Ohashi-san: Kansai Boys

809
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,040
Haruna-chan: Kansai Boya

810
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,870
Fuwa-chan: Doumoto Brothers

811
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,810
Sakura-chan: Buunboobun

812
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,950
That's something they did.

813
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,950
Yeah, the band, right?

814
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,080
It was Kanzai Boya.

815
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:08,290
Answer: Kanzai Boya

816
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,420
Bakarhythm got it right.

817
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,290
Eh?

818
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,490
And the female team...

819
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,050
only Haruna got it right,

820
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,560
which means that you do not know your teammates.

821
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,360
Which is a larger problem at play.

822
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,360
That's right. This is no good.

823
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,260
It can't be helped if this side doesn't get it.

824
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,430
It's so incomprehensible that only the questionee gets it right so...

825
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,700
We have prepared a penalty.

826
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,700
Nice!

827
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,470
Go ahead.

828
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,470
For whom?

829
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,110
It hurt.

830
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,110
The worst.

831
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,380
This is also part of it?

832
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,880
It hurt.

833
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,880
I don't like it.

834
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,380
Hold up...

835
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,380
I don't like it.

836
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,760
Why are you doing these things?

837
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,560
Like a divorce conversation.

838
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,560
How it is in the park at night.

839
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,860
Even...

840
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,930
It's been 30 years since this kind of thing has happened to me.

841
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,930
It hit hard.

842
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,670
So...

843
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,670
That's right.

844
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:02,610
It really hurt.

845
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,610
So you end up getting an electric shock.

846
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,140
I'm scared.

847
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,810
That's no good when only the questionee knows the answer.

848
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,810
That's right.

849
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,280
I think it's a topic that would be fine if no one knew the answer.

850
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,280
Indeed.

851
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,280
No need to know.

852
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,990
Can you clearly walk us through the rule?

853
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,190
If only the questioner on your team knows the answer,

854
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,560
or if all of the opposing team get the correct answer then there is a penalty.

855
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,960
So if the opposing team all get the answer right we will also be punished?

856
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,930
And it goes both ways?

857
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,600
Yes, both sides. If only you know it.

858
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,940
If it's not common knowledge then that points to a bigger problem.

859
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,940
Well, something like that won't happen very often.

860
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,580
Ohashi, do you have any experience?

861
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,010
I was like...

862
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,920
Why did I quit my job for this?

863
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,980
So please be careful, Haruna.

864
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,820
I was asked to sit here

865
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,490
and put out a quiz

866
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,930
and now the mood has turned sour.

867
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,300
It's not only about me but now my teammates are wrapped up in this.

868
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,800
Collective responsibility.

869
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,400
My apologies.

870
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,400
Please stop those things.

871
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,840
It's fine.

872
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Please think of your team.

873
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,240
Let's get to the male team.

874
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,940
Can I do it?

875
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,940
And the penalty rules also exist for you.

876
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,140
Oh no wait...

877
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,350
Does Hamada have to do it?

878
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,520
But every team member needs to have a question ready.

879
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,490
So everyone has to go at least once?

880
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,490
That's right.

881
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,120
So Hamada HAS to go once.

882
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,120
That's right.

883
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,220
Of course. Everyone will ask.

884
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,460
Then it can't be helped.

885
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,830
If we could've avoided it I wouldn't want him to pose a question.

886
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,370
Please be good friends. I feel sorry for him.

887
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,270
But he failed the boat race exam.

888
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,770
He failed immediately.

889
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,700
Before you moved to Osaka?

890
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:44,700
I didn't fail immediately.

891
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,210
I even went to the interview part.

892
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,310
You failed at the interview part?

893
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,310
So the interview didn't go well?

894
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,280
Even though you have the proper knowledge.

895
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,920
What type of person would fail when riding the boat?

896
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,990
And yet he failed the interview part.

897
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:03,060
The third questioner on the male team will be Hamada.

898
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,830
Fuku plays baseball.

899
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,060
Yes.

900
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,400
So it could be baseball related.

901
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,570
So if we try that they might not know the answer.

902
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,740
Girls are usually weak in that area when it comes to sports.

903
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,740
That's right.

904
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,180
In pro baseball,

905
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,810
Good one.

906
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,180
who and who is ON?

907
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:47,100
In pro baseball, who and who is ON?

908
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,590
In pro baseball, who and who is ON?

909
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,860
We've got this.

910
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,690
In pro baseball, who and who is ON?

911
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,530
What does it mean? ON?

912
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,530
Do you understand?

913
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,900
They are called ON.

914
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,270
This is hell.

915
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,270
Don't give too much away.

916
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,100
They are totally talking it out.

917
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,340
Were you discussing it?

918
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,340
That's no good.

919
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,960
I didn't.

920
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,060
Please stop it!

921
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,680
That's a penalty!

922
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,650
Stop it!!!

923
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,350
I wasn't.

924
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,320
You again?

925
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,390
I wasn't!

926
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,390
You again?

927
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,420
Stop it. I wasn't!

928
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,560
This happened last time too!

929
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,730
I was just confirming what the question was!

930
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,070
That's confusingly similar.

931
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,770
That's ambiguous.

932
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,400
You should refrain from these whisperings.

933
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,400
It's no good.

934
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,270
I was only saying "who and who!"

935
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,680
That's right.

936
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:35,590
In pro baseball, who and who is ON?

937
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,610
Let's see the answers from the male team first.

938
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:36,950
(O)u and (N)agashima.

939
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:56,810
Answer: Ou, Nagashima.

940
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,660
How splendid.

941
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,090
As expected from Hamada.

942
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,990
Nice question.

943
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,990
This is exemplary.

944
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:47,130
Fuku did well too. You knew it.

945
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,130
Thank you. This made me go: "ah, I know this one".

946
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,260
That's right.

947
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,260
However...

948
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,730
Unless everyone in the female team gets it wrong you won't get points.

949
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,840
Reveal your answers in one go.

950
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,510
Ou and Nagashima...

951
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,380
I hurriedly wrote it.

952
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,980
I wrote it in a hurry.

953
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,680
It's Nagashima, right.

954
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,790
No no no.

955
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,790
But it says Naka.

956
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,090
No, it's Nagashima.

957
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,650
I was hurrying.

958
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,650
You were trying to cover it up.

959
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:18,390
Answer: Ou, Nagashima.

960
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,420
Ohashi knew this one.

961
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,130
Makes sense. Ohashi would know this one.

962
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,060
Ohashi, you know a lot about baseball.

963
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:22,100
I refuse to answer this during the quiz.

964
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,730
That makes sense...

965
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,100
We ask because we know it.

966
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,270
Huh. Is that so?

967
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,270
Don't turn this into a court proceeding.

968
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,040
We are asking rhetorically.

969
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,410
Huh?

970
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,880
There's tension between us now.

971
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,880
Please stop.

972
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,480
Let's all have fun.

973
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:42,490
And on the female team Inoue Sakura will ask the next question.

974
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:53,560
Around Christmas a seasonal variety box of makeup is sold. What is it called?

975
00:35:53,900 --> 00:36:17,790
Around Christmas a seasonal variety box of makeup is sold. What is it called?

976
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,170
If only one of you get it right then they won't score a point.

977
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,440
Bakari, please get this right.

978
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,240
Do you know, Bakarhythm?

979
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,240
This is so tough.

980
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:09,510
But no one in the male team was able to get it.

981
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,280
If everyone in the female team gets it right they will get a point.

982
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,050
Please reveal your answers.

983
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,490
Cosmetic kit.

984
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,290
Christmas coffret (makeup set).

985
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,690
Haruna: Event gift.

986
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,130
Fuwa: Holiday Assorted Bag.

987
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,870
Sakura: Coffret.

988
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,670
Since Ohashi was able to answer this one...

989
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:36,410
Answer: Coffret

990
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:36,310
You barely escaped the penalty.

991
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,740
That's not the point of this game!

992
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,140
You've mixed up the gist of it.

993
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,280
Answer: Coffret

994
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,280
How great. Yaaay.

995
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,610
What the heck are you doing?

996
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,290
Next up on the male team Fuku will pose a question.

997
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,720
We are relying on you, Fuku.

998
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,520
It will be in the same vein as last one.

999
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,120
In the same vein?

1000
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,990
I can't hear at all, Fuku!

1001
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:01,700
In the same vein, right?

1002
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,700
I'm sorry.

1003
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,700
Let's have fun.

1004
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,740
In baseball...

1005
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,240
How nice.

1006
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,210
What other katakana word is there for "double play?"

1007
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,380
I see.

1008
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:31,790
What's another katakana word for "double play?"

1009
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,380
Double play.

1010
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,510
Another way of saying it.

1011
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,280
But "double play" is also katakana.

1012
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,250
For real.

1013
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,390
Another saying.

1014
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,650
There was another one.

1015
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,520
There definitely was.

1016
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:29,630
The male team please reveal your answers at once.

1017
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,530
Hamada: Get two.
Matsumoto: Horseplay.

1018
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:38,270
Bakarhythm: Get two.
Hamaie: Get two.
Fuku: Get two.

1019
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,370
And the answer is of course: Get two.

1020
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,310
The female team.

1021
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,510
They won't get it.

1022
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:52,450
Answer: Get two

1023
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,710
Since Ohashi is there it's interesting to see.

1024
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,610
Get twoo. Ohashi: Get two

1025
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:55,050
Catch and release.

1026
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,050
Yep. Worst answer of them all.

1027
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:00,990
Fuwa: Second game.
Sakura: Second.

1028
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,990
Does it count when she mispelled it with an added "u"?

1029
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,390
But since Ohashi got it right...

1030
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,360
In that case you did not earn a point.

1031
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,770
Answer: Get two

1032
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,770
Their team is so strong.

1033
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,530
Matsumoto.

1034
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,030
Isn't...

1035
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,840
"catch and release" just horrible?

1036
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,840
That's right. The meaning is wrong.

1037
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,840
That's right.

1038
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:16,840
You're just messing around.

1039
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,310
Punish them.

1040
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,310
If that's the case then...

1041
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,080
Then what about your "Kinnniku Nikuo?"

1042
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,150
No no no.

1043
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,150
Or "Mantaro?"

1044
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,720
That's right.

1045
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,950
It's completely off.

1046
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,760
Isn't "catch and release" just terrible?

1047
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,760
It's completely wrong.

1048
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,960
That's a fishing term.

1049
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,960
No no no.

1050
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,000
It's not that kind of thing!

1051
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,230
If she was horsing around...

1052
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,000
She is clearly fishing for laughs.

1053
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,000
If I was...

1054
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,170
I would've written something funny!

1055
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,170
If I was horsing around.

1056
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,270
That's a penalty.

1057
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,740
Only she got it.

1058
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,780
Only me?

1059
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,050
That's right.
As is should be.

1060
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,180
Makes sense.

1061
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,180
That's how it is.

1062
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,090
Everyone else was doing it seriously.

1063
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,660
Are you okay?

1064
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,090
This kind of option was available?

1065
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:15,100
Next on the female team Fuwa will ask a question.

1066
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:21,700
For people that are dieting there is a single superfood...

1067
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,440
which looks like this.

1068
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,180
Alright. What is it?

1069
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:50,470
What is the name of this superfood?

1070
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,910
Please write down your answers.

1071
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,720
Is it really dotted like this?

1072
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,720
This is indeed how it looks.

1073
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,320
I drew it perfectly.

1074
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,320
What a mischievous act from her.

1075
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,860
Will the female team know this one?

1076
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,630
Female team, reveal your answers.

1077
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,700
You, please put your answer forward.

1078
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,700
I see...

1079
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,370
You: Omega 3.

1080
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,240
That's right. That's also a thing.

1081
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,240
There is also Omega 3.

1082
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,310
Ohashi: Chia seeds.

1083
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,340
Haruna: Quinoa.

1084
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,880
Fuwa: Chia seeds.
Sakura: Chia seeds.

1085
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:13,260
And if everyone on the male team gets it right then you will be punished. Please reveal your answers.

1086
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:16,430
Answer: Chia seeds.

1087
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,430
Hamada: Foam.

1088
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,530
Matsumoto: Super thingy.

1089
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,170
Bakarizm: Açaí

1090
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,330
I hear it said often.

1091
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,330
In smoothies etc.

1092
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,940
Hamaie: Açaí .

1093
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,740
Fuku: Chia seeds.

1094
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,770
Amazing amazing.

1095
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,410
I knew this one.

1096
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,410
Amazing, he blocked the team from earning a point!

1097
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,150
You knew it?

1098
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:38,780
Answer: Chia seeds.

1099
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,150
Yes, I did.

1100
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,780
For real?

1101
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,050
No one is getting any points.

1102
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,050
No points given.

1103
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,290
Zero vs. zero.

1104
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,290
It's difficult.

1105
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,330
This is the result so far.

1106
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,760
Neither team has been able to get a 100% vs. 0% win.

1107
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,800
How will it turn out in the last round?

1108
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,270
What kind of question should I ask?

1109
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,310
Probably shouldn't be baseball related.

1110
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,310
Yeah, because she's there.

1111
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:08,010
Please do ask a baseball related question.

1112
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,010
Don't mind that at all.

1113
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:08,680
Go ahead.

1114
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,350
Kamen Rider...

1115
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,950
Yes, Kamen Rider.

1116
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,490
Can Fuku answer that?

1117
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:20,790
What is the name of the third Kamen Rider in the series?

1118
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,590
This is good.

1119
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,590
What type of Kamen Rider?

1120
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,890
Alright.

1121
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:45,620
What is the name of the third Kamen Rider?

1122
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:24,890
Thank you.

1123
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:25,830
Fuku...

1124
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,600
Fuku, you actually love Kamen Rider, right?

1125
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,570
I love Kamen Rider to bits.

1126
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,470
Hamaie, no way!

1127
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,740
No way.

1128
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,670
Hamaie, no way.

1129
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,180
There it is! No problem.

1130
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,140
No but...

1131
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,180
All of the names came to me all at once so let me think about it.

1132
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,950
He said that it's the 3rd one.

1133
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,920
He gave a hint by saying that!

1134
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:57,630
What is the name of the third Kamen Rider?

1135
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,950
That's not it.

1136
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,160
Does that call for a punishment?

1137
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,160
It was the question.

1138
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,630
I was just repeating the question. What Matsumoto already said.

1139
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:03,630
I will kill you for real!

1140
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:04,730
Stop it! It's been years since you've threatened my life.

1141
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,840
My last one has been valid the entire time.

1142
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,900
Oh no no. I hate this.

1143
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,560
Scary.

1144
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,870
"Valid" as if he has "accommodated" the threat the entire time.

1145
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,870
Please stop.

1146
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:27,320
What is the third Kamen Rider?

1147
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:18,610
If everyone gets it right you might get a point.

1148
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,180
Yes, we can.

1149
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,380
There's no way the opposite team

1150
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,610
Yeah.

1151
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,280
Male team. Reveal your answers.

1152
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:27,290
V3.

1153
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:45,940
Answer: Kamen Rider V3.

1154
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,430
Well done Matsumoto.

1155
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,000
Amazing.

1156
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,500
With this we can do it.

1157
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,370
Matsumoto hit the jackpot.

1158
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,030
What a great question.

1159
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:41,840
But if even 1 person gets it right then you won't receive any points.

1160
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,940
But if they all answer wrong then you will get a point.

1161
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,060
Did you just fart?

1162
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,420
That caught me off guard so much!

1163
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:58,080
But uh... he's a good guy. Can't stay mad at him.

1164
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:48,800
Answer: Kamen Rider V3.

1165
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:05,560
The male team all answered correctly.

1166
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,630
However...

1167
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,400
Reveal your answers at once.

1168
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,540
You: V3.

1169
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,440
Ohashi: Kamen Rider Taiga.

1170
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,110
Rider Rider and Kamen Rider Megaton.

1171
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,650
But there was a correct answer.

1172
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,580
That's right. She's an old hag so she would know.

1173
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,090
She's an elder sister.

1174
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,790
As expected from YOU to know it's V3.

1175
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,020
This is not good.

1176
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,760
No, it was a good question.

1177
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,730
It was good.

1178
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,730
Hamaie, you recalled it?

1179
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:43,700
I did recall there was no "No. 3".

1180
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,770
While there was a No. 1 and No. 2.

1181
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,800
Well remembered.

1182
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,810
Which means that YOU from the female team will ask the last question.

1183
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,780
The kind of accessory that you put here is called a bracelet.

1184
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,290
It's a bracelet but...

1185
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:42,460
What is the name of the accessory that you put around your ankle?

1186
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:11,260
What is the name of the accessory that you put around your ankle?

1187
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,200
What is the name of the accessory that you put around your ankle?

1188
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,800
Please think about it.

1189
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:18,770
Will you remember?

1190
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:21,200
What was it now...

1191
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,840
Of course you have heard it before.

1192
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,840
I wonder if Sakura is fine.

1193
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,110
If you get a point then the female team has won it all.

1194
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,110
It might be this.

1195
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,110
Since it's the last both teams reveal your answers simultaneously.

1196
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:31,780
For real?

1197
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,420
I hope I will get this one.

1198
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,420
I think I got this one right maybe.

1199
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,590
Are you ready?

1200
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,760
Both teams, reveal your answers.

1201
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,460
Hamada, Matsumoto, Bakarizm: Anklet.

1202
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,200
Hamaie: Ankle.
Fuku: Thread.

1203
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:54,040
You: Anklet.
Anklet.
Haruna: Leglet.
Anklet.

1204
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,310
Misanga.

1205
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,940
So old-fashioned.

1206
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,680
But you can indeed put it around your ankles.

1207
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,680
I'm so sorry.

1208
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,680
How old.

1209
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,480
Which means that neither team managed to get 100% vs. 0%.

1210
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:09,290
Answer: Anklet.

1211
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,290
I see.

1212
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:13,420
If you count the most correct answers it must've been the male team, right?

1213
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:17,230
Why are you trying to win in such a cheap way?

1214
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,460
Please tell us.

1215
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,060
Let's count the correct answers.

1216
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,370
The male team got 30 correct answers.

1217
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:27,070
And the female team got 24.

1218
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,070
So the male team won.

1219
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:31,370
Thank you.

1220
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:38,080
Since we finally have arrived at a victory somehow it means that the female team will be punished.

1221
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,480
Go ahead.

1222
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,090
That one looked like it hurt.

1223
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,290
She looks so pissed.

1224
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:51,290
Looks so handsome.

1225
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,460
Rokudenashi Blues​ [Boxing themed manga].

1226
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,100
Amazing.

1227
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,800
What a rough look.
