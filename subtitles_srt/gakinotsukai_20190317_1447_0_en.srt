1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,500
What?

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,920
Endo Shozo

3
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,920
Hamada Masatoshi

4
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,920
Matsumoto Hitoshi

5
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,920
Tanaka Naoki

6
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,920
You know, from my experience I can tell

7
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,830
When we start an episode in small parks like this

8
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,020
Yeah?

9
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,830
It's not going to be fun

10
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,640
It's a matter of fact, you know

11
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,000
I can explain

12
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Is it a sign?

13
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,130
That's what I personally think

14
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,780
Tanaka seems to know about this

15
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,970
Does he?

16
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,980
Yes, I've been told actually

17
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,960
Do you remember last year's year-end party?

18
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,960
Yes

19
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,150
Remember it started with that character, Freddie?

20
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,650
You remember him?

21
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,650
We do

22
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:39,520

25
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,700
Freddie, the man who sang for this year's year-end party

26
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,800
We got a certain suggestion from him

27
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,300
Mr. Freddie said he wants to do a walk-around-the-city show

28
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,880
Aaand denied

29
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,520
Alright, let's wrap this up

30
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,240
Wanderin' around with Mr. Freddie

31
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,240
We'll have Mr. Freddie join us as a guest and we'll stroll around the city!

32
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,520
We're not done

33
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,400
I don't get what's the point of this

34
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,400
We're not done, come on

35
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,240
Who the hell is mr. Freddie?

36
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,620
We're in hurry so let's go

37
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,660
Are these things still around today?

38
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,260
Let's call him here with us, please!

provided by

40
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,800
Is he singing?

41
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,300
Oh, is this a live performance?

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,460
It is

43
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,060
Oh, is it?

44
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,060
You're right

45
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,110
Sorry

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,910
I'm talking to that man watching us

47
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,000
Sorry

48
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,000
Sorry for this

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,060
Sorry for the bother

50
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,060
We're going to leave soon

51
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,440
We're just playing around

52
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,880
Haha, sorry

53
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,940
Here's mr. Freddie

54
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,420
Mr. Freddie

55
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,420
Mr. Freddie

56
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,420
Today's guest

57
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,820
Good morning

58
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,820
Mr. Freddie

59
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,420
Good morning!

60
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,420
It's the real deal

61
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,640
It's a pleasure

62
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,640
Sure...

63
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,790
What are y'all doin'?

64
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,790
What a voice

65
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,900
What do you mean?

66
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,600
You look so full of energy today

67
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,600
What are ya doin', huh?

68
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,070
We just got here

69
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,140
His volume is really something

70
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,140
It is, it comes from his stomach

71
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,200
Aren't you cold?

72
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,340
I'm hot

73
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,340
Is that so?

74
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,640
Aren't y'all hot?

75
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,640
Well, not really

76
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,940
You sure you're not cold? Mentally?

77
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,680
Look at this face, wow

78
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,480
He's so energetic

79
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,490
S-so, today's plan...

80
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,500
We're all going to visit the shop district
from Freddie's hometown

81
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:24,690
While Freddie recalls his best memories we're going to visit his hometown

82
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,500
"Hometown"...?

83
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,360
That's right

84
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,690
It's really close to where we're now

85
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,140
It's his hometown, you can take a look at it here

86
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,820
Right here

87
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,100
What's this?

88
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,740
You can read here he's this town's tourism ambassador

89
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,260
Is he?

90
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,560
He is

91
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,860
Oh, you're right

92
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,310
That's how influential he is

93
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,440
Is this the same sheet?

94
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,160
Oh, no

95
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,480
It's a different one

96
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,480
I see

97
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,740
Oh, what's this?

98
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,040
It's a leaflet

99
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,020
Looks like a Freddie stamp rally

100
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,020
The winner gets rice, huh

101
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,120
Eh?

102
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,680
Are you a comedian?

103
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,990
I'm not

104
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,530
I'm Freddie, dontcha know who I am?

105
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,730
No I mean, I know, but...

106
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,780
From Queen

107
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,700
Sure...

108
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,500
You just told us

109
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,500
Is that true?

110
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,520
It is

111
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,240
Dontcha know?

112
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,240
No, no

113
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,260
I do know about Freddie from Queen

114
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,560
It's me, Freddie Mercury from Queen

115
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,560
He's mr. Freddie

116
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,460
Are you that exact same person?

117
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,460
Of course I am

118
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,360
This is so crazy...

119
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,780
Let's go

120
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,600
He ignored you

121
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,080
Feels like he wanted to cut it

122
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,480
It was so sudden

123
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,480
Let's move to the shopping district

124
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,280
Are you walking all day like this?

125
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,040
He's so lively...

126
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,040
At this point I think

127
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,230
By the time he loses this spirit, it'll be over

128
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,640
True

129
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,640
That's right

130
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,980
He just has to do it

131
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,980
Yeah...

132
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,230
He knows it'll be over as soon as he slows down

133
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:42,170

Gaki no Tsukai

138
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,170
ya Arahende!

139
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:52,180
Mr. Freddie's beloved hometown's shopping district

140
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,880
They finally arrived to mr. Freddie's beloved hometown shopping district

141
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,380
Let's explore Freddie's memories of this place

142
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,440
What do you like about this town?

143
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,880
I think that yeah, it's easy to walk

144
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,150
Easy to walk...?

145
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,150
Yeah

146
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,420
Is there any hard to walk town to begin with?

147
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,920
Do you usually go to kakuyasu?

148
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,560
I do actually, love it

149
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,930
What do you buy there?

150
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,480
I like sparkling wine

151
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,900
Sparkling wine, huh

152
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,500
It figures

153
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,840
I really like Mitake

154
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,080
Maybe it's been displayed 'cause I like it?

155
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,310
How should I know this?

156
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,680
So friggin' loud

157
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,360
His voice is really something

158
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,810
I have no idea, man

159
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,460
We don't

160
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,960
But man, his voice

161
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,120
I wish he'd be quieter

162
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,120
And I have no idea what he's talking about

163
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,140
Hey pops

164
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,700
What now?

165
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,700
Oh

166
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,160
Freddie?

167
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,390
Boy, it's been so long!

168
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,390
This is so stupid

169
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,480
How many years?

170
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,020
I wonder...

171
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,000
Can I...?

172
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,840
Man, the memories!

173
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,700
What's wrong?

174
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,700
Can I ask you one thing?

175
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,340
As seen on "Freddie's stroll", it says...

176
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,380
Oh

177
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,840
Is this show a thing?

178
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,160
This is mr. Freddie

179
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,960
I did that, yes

180
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,960
You're right

181
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,220
Before?

182
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,420
It's like Jun Sanpo, right?

183
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,150
Those kind of shows

184
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,900
I used to run this show

185
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,800
Oh, in the past?

186
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,250
Any recommendation here, Freddie?

187
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,250
I'm gonna have the usual

188
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,990
The usual? Coming up

189
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,160
Does he have an "usual" here?

190
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,160
Well, it's his town...

191
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,690
But he said "it's been so long" before

192
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,690
True

193
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,000
Maybe it's because he's always busy doing stuff

194
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,000
That's right

195
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,360
Oh boy...

196
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,630
This episode makes me suffer

197
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,940
Come on

198
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,620
Such a bother

199
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,180
Well, if I had to describe this somehow...

200
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,660
It would be "bother", wouldn't it?

201
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,360
Yeah, kinda

202
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,660
Something like that

203
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,700
I wonder which croquet we're gonna eat

204
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,700
Boss?

205
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,140
These are croquet, right?

206
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,310
They are

207
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,310
Where's the boss?

208
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,680
It's taking him forever 'cause he's not the real shop owner

209
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,780
It's taking him forever 'cause he's not the real shop owner

210
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,360
Sorry for the wait, they're freshly done

211
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,720
Thanks

212
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,020
They're hot, be careful

213
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,080
Thank you

214
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,200
Take it, but careful

215
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,200
Thanks

216
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,740
Oh, nice

217
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,820
Here, careful

218
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,820
Thanks

219
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,520
It's pretty big

220
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:46,430
Mr. Freddie's beloved croquet

221
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,660
Their size is what makes em popular here

222
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,760
They're delicious

223
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,620
I'm diggin' in

224
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,850
Really good

225
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,520
They are

226
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,130
The boss here wants to...

227
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,900
It's kinda sweet, isn't it?

228
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,680
You like it?

229
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,170
It's good, yeah

230
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,180
Thank you

231
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,680
I was saying, the boss here has a
request for Freddie, am I right?

232
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,340
That's right

233
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,830
You know, he made a song based off this croquet

234
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,970
You remember it, don't you?

235
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,650
Which is it?

236
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,650
I do

237
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,340
You did...?

238
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,380
Based off a croquet?

239
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,380
Huh?

240
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,290
A famouos song?

241
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,250
It's based off this?

242
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,160
Yeah, that's what I've been told

243
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,860
Uh? Really?

244
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,720
I wonder which one is it

245
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,720
That's how he wrote most of his songs

246
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,060
Here!

247
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:30,840
provided by

248
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,320
You heard this one before?

249
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,320
No, it's my first time

250
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,420
He just said "croquet"

251
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,040
I clearly heard that

252
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,100
Radio gaga~♪

253
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,280
Radio gaga...

254
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,280
Hey!

255
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,620
What does it mean?

256
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,240
I'm not sure what's going on

257
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,240
So Radio Gaga is based off croquet

258
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,320
It's hard to grasp

259
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,210
Who would have thought?

260
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,210
Incredible

261
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,420
Alright, shall we go?

262
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,800
Already going elsewhere?
How about a photo before?

263
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,060
Ok ok

264
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,080
He just wants to go

265
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,080
Let's take a pic, folks!

266
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,320
We're lucky we got to hear him singing live

267
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,320
Yeah

268
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,300
Take care!

269
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,200
Sure, see ya next time!

270
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,200
Thank you

271
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,540
I'm gonna come back soon for more croquettes!

272
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,960
With everyone!

273
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,040
Ok

274
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,460
Nice

275
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,900
There's a lot of people here 'cause we're filming

276
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,740
But I swear not a single one of them was laughing

277
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,270
Ah, is that so?

278
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,270
Yeah...

279
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,230
Oh

280
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,230
What?

281
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,380
Here's another shop he's very fond of

282
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,450
Mr. Freddie's beloved jazz bar

283
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,450
bon appétit​

284
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,450
Really?

285
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,450
It seems that way

286
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,760
You know...

287
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,760
Yes?

288
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,320
This is the place where I formed my band

289
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,340
Eh?

290
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,330
Huh?

291
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,600
It's the place which gave birth to Queen

292
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,200
Let's get inside!

293
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,340
Like that...?

294
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,280
Does it mean that...

295
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,880
Yes?

296
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,000
We're gonna meet the owner?

297
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,720
Probably yes

298
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,960
It feels like a jazz bar, doesn't it?

299
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,280
Please come in

300
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,360
Look how big it is

301
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,880
Huh?

302
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,880
Wait---

303
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,780
The members

304
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,950
Queen Band Members

305
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,950
Queen Band Members

306
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,950
surprise appearance

307
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,840
Wha-?

308
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,950
Freddie! It's been a while

309
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,090
Oh, come on!

310
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,740
Just a moment, just a moment!

311
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,740
It's Freddie!

312
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,260
Are you kiddin' me?

313
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,020
We're here for you!

314
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,660
What the?

315
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,260
It's been so long

316
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,260
You tricked me, didn't you?

317
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,820
Was this your plan?

318
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,380
Oh, no, no, we didn't plan this

319
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,680
I bet ya called 'em here

320
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,680
That's not true

321
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,700
C'mere!

322
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,460
My boy!

323
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,760
Where have you been?

324
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,760
Oooh!

325
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,320
It's been so long, man!

326
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,880
You played me a nice lil trick, didntcha?

327
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,100
Y-yeah, a little surprise

328
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
You didn't know?

329
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,100
I did not

330
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,960
Sorry about that

331
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,600
It's a nice surprise, isn't it?

332
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,840
We didn't even know

333
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,330
That's right. Hey, how about you introduce them to us?

334
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,330
Alright, I'll start

335
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,020
I'm Brian and I play guitar, yaaaay!

336
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,640
Brian, huh

337
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,020
I'm John, my pleasure

338
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,380
I'm Roger, I play drums

339
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,800
Come on, sit down

340
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,800
Sure thing, Freddie

341
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,980
Please

342
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,320
No need to be so reserved

343
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,640
We're gonna sit too

344
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,920
There's no need, ya know

345
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,920
We're not

346
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,120
You're one to talk

347
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,400
Has it really been that long since you last met?

348
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,400
Just a few minutes ago...

349
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,720
Mr. Freddie told us the band was born in this very place

350
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,860
So you got the idea here?

351
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,440
At first it was just me and this guy here

352
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,240
I see...

353
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,800
Who and who?

354
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,800
Me and him
- That's not it

355
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,060
It was me and him, then Brian lured us in

356
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,640
That's not how it went, that's another story

357
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,240
He already forgot

358
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,680
- He really did, duh

359
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,550
Cut the bullshit, guys

360
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,080
This is no place for talk sessions

361
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,900
Ohh

362
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,890
'Cause we're all talking, huh?

363
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,170
Always thinkin' about sessions, aren't ya?

364
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,760
Got any questions for them?

365
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,300
Well, since we're here...

366
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,680
Any questions?

367
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,980
Not about me

368
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,340
Yeah, I mean, we got all the members here

369
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,600
Do you have, like...

370
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,070
Any failure story to tell us now that Freddie's here?

371
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,280
We have loads of those!

372
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,140
- We do have 'em

373
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,140
- Right?

374
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,280
Remember when he wet his pants?

375
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,040
Eh?

376
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,420
Yeah, he couldn't help it

377
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,980
Huh...

378
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,480
So pathetic!

379
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,620
During which song?

380
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,020
Which song was it...?

381
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,020
- Eh? Song?

382
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,820
A song...

383
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,260
It was a copy, wasn't it?

384
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,880
We were doin' a cover

385
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
A copy?

386
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,720
Uh, yes

387
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,440
You did covers too?

388
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,930
Not an original song?

389
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,230
What the heck

390
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,100
I could be wrong

391
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,020
A copy, huh

392
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,160
Oh, here it is! Our pizza!

393
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,510
A pizza?

394
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,200
Eat up, please

395
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,200
Grab a slice

396
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,610
Mr. Freddie's beloved mixed pizza

397
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,900
This is really good

398
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,340
Are there any memories related to this?

399
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,340
We used to eat this all the time

400
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,380
What do you like about it?

401
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,560
Well, I think...

402
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,610
You'll get it just by looking at it

403
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,880
First off, I really like pizza

404
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,180
But if you look at this one

405
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,820
You know

406
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,220
I hate square-shaped pizzas

407
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,200
It's not really a thing

408
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,200
They're usually round all the time

409
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,480
But which is the most unique feature to it?

410
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,460
See--- listen, ok?

411
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,820
Yeah

412
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,920
You can see there's a lot of salami here and there

413
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,820
Yes

414
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,400
There's also corn, and cheese...

415
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,020
Mhh

416
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,400
Mh-mh

417
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,410
Well, I love it

418
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,140
It's your pizza, to put it simply

419
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,640
Yeah, that's the pizza I always think of

420
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,650
Your first choice

421
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,980
You guys like it too, right?

422
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,120
We do, yeah

423
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,120
Right?

424
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,660
Are those guys Queen?

425
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,660
Yes, it's them

426
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,420
So in other words... Sorry, I don't know much about them

427
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,200
Yes?

428
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,420
Yes, yes...

429
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,430
You did several tours around the world, right?

430
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,920
Of course we did

431
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,980
World tours and stuff?

432
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,980
Yes

433
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,400
Which country did you like the most?

434
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Maybe something around the Mediterranean Sea

435
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,400
- I think-- yeah, that

436
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,800
Eastern Europe, maybe? I liked that

437
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,800
- I liked the Mediterranean area too

438
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,410
Ya know, we started with steps

439
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,240
Steps?

440
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,100
Steps, right?

441
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,100
Yeah

442
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,180
How was it?

443
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,180
That's incredible

444
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,880
[bohemian gibberish]

445
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,740
What are we looking at?

446
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
[gibberish]

447
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,970
How long is this gonna take?

448
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,220
It's so bad

449
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,920
What is this?

450
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,560
Gotta appreciate it

451
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,240
Thank you, thank you, enough

452
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,240
[still gibberish]

453
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,560
Thanks for this

454
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,550
We just witnessed a rare session

455
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,560
We're so lucky we got to listen to it

456
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,720
So that's how you do it?

457
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,610
Was it ad-lib?

458
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,940
That's how they do it and why they're so famous

459
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,940
Whatever

460
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,360
I was just wondering how it could have been

461
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,720
I always wondered how

462
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,720
We still got it guys

463
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,060
This is a bit unexpected...

464
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,420
But today

465
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,100
Mr. Brian

466
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,700
Yes?

467
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,540
Brought with him a letter of gratitude for Freddie

468
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,440
I know it's out of character, but whatever, boy!

469
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,910
Oi

470
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,890
What the-

471
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,980
A letter of gratitude for mr. Freddie

472
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,500
Dear Freddie,

473
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,140
At the beginning of our debut

474
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,890
I didn't have any confidence in my own guitarist skills

475
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,240
And one time

476
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,320
I told you I wanted to quit the band

477
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,160
But when I did

478
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,500
You told me, "Brian... I was born...

479
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,920
You told me, "Brian... I was born...

480
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,780
...to love you!

481
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,580
So why don't you play for me?"

482
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,780
Had you never told me that at the time...

483
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,980
I would probably be rotting in prison by now

484
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,900
Thank you, Freddie!

485
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,620
Come on, don't cry...

486
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,330
Let's cheer up!

487
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,430
Look at 'em, the wig boys

488
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,330
Look at 'em, the wig boys

489
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,330
Wigs

490
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,640
You're the wigs

491
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,340
But we have something from Freddie too

492
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
Yes

493
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,340
Huh?

494
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,520
He wants us to listen to something

495
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,580
Really?

496
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,410
A surprise gig?

497
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,410
That's right

498
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,850
What the...?

499
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,480
Maybe we won't get it as much as them

500
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,780
That's right

501
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,720
We're not musicians after all

502
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,640
Yeah, that's it

503
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,720
Yeah, sort of

504
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,770
Okay

505
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,570
provided by

506
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,400
Was it like this?

507
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,430
Sure

508
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,850
We all know this one

509
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,930
It's his most famous song

510
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,190
We all know it

511
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,190
It's not really a surprise

512
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,430
Huh?

513
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,730
What do you--

514
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,730
That sucked so bad

515
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,900
What do you think of Freddie's performance?

516
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,380
Outstanding

517
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,940
As expected

518
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,610
You're a rakugo artist, aren't you?

519
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,880
We're going to Freddie's house

520
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,620
Where are we going next?

521
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,620
Yeah, where?

522
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,080
I've been pranked all day by you

523
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,160
Why are you doing this?

524
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,860
Oh

525
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,160
We--- we just wanted to surprise you

526
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,160
Why do you enjoy surprising people?

527
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,620
I'll be surprised when I feel like being it

528
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:32,510
I know it was a surprise but... it was a good one, I guess?

529
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,960
Yeah, it was nice

530
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,610
There are people I don't wanna meet, ya know

531
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,610
Huh?!

532
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,610
Wha-

533
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,180
I hate him!

534
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,620
Who...?

535
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,620
The croquet guy

536
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:49,930
croquet shop boss

537
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,650
The shop owner?

538
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,630
You should have know I hate him

539
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,340
We had no idea, you even sang for him

540
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,910
I used to be bullied by him

541
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,000
Ah, when you were a kid?

542
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,000
That's right

543
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,230
I was the only one to receive half-sized croquettes by him

544
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,300
Well, we---

545
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,300
Why are you trying to surprise me?

546
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,440
He's getting so angry

547
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,810
But we---

548
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,780
I'm going home!

549
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,880
Come on, mr. Freddie

550
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,880
Oh, sorry about that

551
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,840
We're sorry

552
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,840
I really hate them

553
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,620
Uh? You what?

554
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,620
I hate surprises

555
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,950
He really hates them

556
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,050
I really do

557
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,050
We got it

558
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,160
Oh we--- we arrived?

559
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,320
Ah- oh no

560
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,090
We're here

561
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,220
What?

562
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,220
Come on, we're here

563
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,860
Here

564
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,610
Come on

565
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,800
I think this is his house

566
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,800
Where are we?

567
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,920
Is this your house?

568
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,920
That's right

569
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,410
Look at the dog house, its name is "Quinn"

570
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,410
Ohhh

571
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,580
Wow

572
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,060
This is impressive

573
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,400
He has lots of the same outfit

574
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,280
He really likes this style

575
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,280
Yeah

576
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,240
It's barking like crazy

577
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,240
It is

578
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,290
Sorry doggy

579
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,290
It's getting familiar

580
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,190
Can you pet it a bit?

581
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,190
Sure

582
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,880
Come here, boy

583
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,580
Good boy

584
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,280
Here

585
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,280
What the hell are you doin'?

586
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,280
They don't know each other

587
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,480
They're both on guard

588
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,900
What the hell is this

589
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,900
Alright then

590
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,800
I can't feel any mutual trust out of this

591
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,500
Let's go

592
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,810
Meeting face-to-face with mr. Freddie's family

593
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,560
Let's just go

594
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,810
Ok

595
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,810
Woah, amazing

596
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,120
I'm home!

597
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,560
Welcome back

598
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,640
I'm back, baby

599
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,690
Please get in

600
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,690
Thanks, are you busy?

601
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,100
Come in

602
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,740
Excuse us

603
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,560
Is this his house?

604
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,560
Yes

605
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,460
Good morning

606
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,460
Nice to meet you

607
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,830
Thanks for always taking care of my Freddie

608
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,080
Who's this?

609
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,400
His wife?

610
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,400
Yes, I'm Freddywife

611
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,780
It's a pleasure to meet you

612
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,510
Freddywife

613
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,510
Freddywife

614
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,640
Freddywife...?

615
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,510
Is that your name?

616
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,120
Yes

617
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,160
This is...

618
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,280
Please, come in

619
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,360
Please

620
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,840
Today's been--- are you sure we can?

621
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,840
Make yourself at home

622
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,980
Dont' worry

623
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,980
With all the cameras?

624
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,980
I can see a resemblance

625
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,340
Want some tea?

626
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,980
Yes

627
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,370
Please get in

628
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,090
Who

629
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,420
Who's that?

630
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,420
That's

631
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,120
My son, Freddyson

632
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,260
Freddyson

633
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,260
Freddyson

634
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,260
He's going through puberty

635
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,540
Oh, I see...

636
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,180
You can tell

637
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,540
That's why he's ignoring us

638
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,540
Yeah

639
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,980
Go say hello to our guests

640
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,170
Freddyson...

641
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,170
Freddyson

642
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:12,720
It's ok

643
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,560
Sorry

644
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,670
Have a seat, please

645
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,580
We get him

646
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,680
Let him enjoy it

647
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,740
Please make yourself at home

648
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,740
I'm surprised he didn't run to his room

649
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,300
You can tell it's his house just by looking at it

650
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,750
Yeah, I agree

651
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,750
Of course you can

652
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,120
Did you do kendo?

653
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,880
Huh? I'm interested

654
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,980
Yeah I used to

655
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,680
There are lots of pictures there

656
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,680
You see

657
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,420
They've been taking photos of me since I was born

658
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,420
Since you were born?

659
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,560
Like this one?

660
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,560
Is this...?

661
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,830
You looked like this when you were born?

662
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,830
Of course I did

663
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,500
You were a newborn here?

664
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,700
Yes

665
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,700
Incredible

666
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,400
It is

667
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,840
I really wasn't a showy baby

668
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,200
I think it's... about time we leave?

669
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,200
Already?!

670
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,600
You just got here

671
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,350
Yeah but---

672
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,350
You still haven't seen them

673
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,180
My family

674
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,140
But--

675
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,540
We just met your son

676
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,540
Hey!

677
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,120
Come here Freddaughter

678
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,760
He has a daughter too?

679
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,760
Freddaughter? Come here

680
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,660
A daughter

681
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,660
Papa Freddie!

682
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,560
Freddaughter

683
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,560
Freddaughter

684
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,140
His daughter...

685
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,560
What were you doing?

686
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,780
I was playing

687
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,120
Which game?

688
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,640
Tag with my plushies

689
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,370
Tag with your plushies!?

690
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,370
Today

691
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,760
We all played tag at the kindergarten

692
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,820
You played tag? Was it fun?

693
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,740
It was fun

694
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,820
Ohh, tag

695
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,820
Which oni were you playing as?

696
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,200
Mhh...

697
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,810
The oni of ice!

698
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,440
The oni of ice, huh...

699
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,440
The oni of ice?

700
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,600
They seem really...

701
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,820
Yeah

702
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,560
They get along

703
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,560
Seems like it

704
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,460
I think it's time to...

705
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,160
Yes

706
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,960
What's with the hurry?

707
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,800
No---

708
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,060
I mean, we met your son and daughter...

709
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,060
You wanna go home that bad?

710
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,160
I told ya you haven't met 'em all yet

711
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,300
Huh?

712
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,300
My family

713
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,270
But we saw 'em, wife and kids

714
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,270
It's a nuclear family, right?

715
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,540
Daddyfreddy! Mamafreddy!

716
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,980
He looks normal

717
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,980
Thanks for taking care of our Freddie

718
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,680

Mamafreddy

724
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,820
It's a pleasure to have you here

725
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,260
This is horrible

726
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,820
I'm having a horrible time

727
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,240
I hate this

728
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,240
The pleasure is ours

729
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,680
Your parents are here too, huh

730
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,530
Do you all live together?

731
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,960
Ah, is that so...

732
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:24,300
Daddyfreddy looks like a normal person

733
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,730
You're right, it doesn't feel strange on him

734
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,060
Alright

735
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,370
It's still early to leave

736
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,320
You came like 5 minutes ago

737
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,320
That's not true

738
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,080
It's way more

739
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,510
It's been way more than that

740
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,510
It felt like a year to me

741
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,820
What now?

742
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,120
Actually...

743
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,120
Yes?

744
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,760
I wanted to do today's gig for this too

745
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,500
It's been 30 years

746
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:54,860
Mr. Freddie wrote a new song after 30 years Its title is "We Will The Champions"

747
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,180
A new song?

748
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,180
Yep

749
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,260
Is it new?

750
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,860
It is

751
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,860
Oh my

752
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,300
Papa is going to sing

753
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,740
Freddie's new song's performance

754
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,420
Wow

755
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,740
Is it really a new song?

756
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:30,030
We will the champions

757
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,920

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,480
I heard this before

760
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,460
It's a bit wrong here

761
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,040
It went down

762
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,260
Huh? It's changing

763
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,500
