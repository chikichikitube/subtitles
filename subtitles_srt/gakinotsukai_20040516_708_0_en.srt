00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,070
Yeah...

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,640
Gaki No Tsukai Green Room

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,670
What would be good?

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,470
Radio? Yes, that'd be nice.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,080
Radio? Yes, that'd be nice.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,810
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

9
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,110
Hello.

10
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,210
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,110
Hello.

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,540
Hello.

13
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,810
Hey. Hey. Hey.

14
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,250
Hey. Hey. Hey.

15
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,250
Hey. Hey. Hey.

16
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,750
You get it, right?

17
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,620
Well, in the past you have come to the green room in that outfit.

18
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,220
Well, in the past you have come to the green room in that outfit.

19
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,220
Right?

20
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,090
If I've come in this outfit from the start, you get it, right?

21
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,260
Well, it has been a while since the last time.

22
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,830
Well, it has been a while since the last time.

23
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,760
Right?

24
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,860
When it's about this,

25
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,830
you get a call directly on the previous day, right?

26
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,830
From Matsumoto?

27
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,130
Right, right.

28
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,140
By text!

29
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,740
Text? By text?

30
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,340
Text? By text?

31
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,340
At the end, there's a

32
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,580
At the end, there's a

33
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,580
smiley face.

34
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,180
A smiley face.

35
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,410
The first one, that's at the top. It's easy to use.

36
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,220
Right, right.

37
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,380
The first one, that's at the top. It's easy to use.

38
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,050
He's in a good mood.

39
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,050
Yeah, he's in a good mood.

40
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,620
The dream that Matsumoto has envisioned!?

41
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:56,650
The event that Matsumoto set his sights on this time is

42
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,520
The event that Matsumoto set his sights on this time is

43
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,620
The event that Matsumoto set his sights on this time is

44
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,620
Limbo Dance

45
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,620
the limbo dance.

46
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:09,130
His challenge is a limbo dance of fire!!

47
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,060
Furthermore, not being satisfied with a regular limbo dance, the bar will be set on fire.

48
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,330
Furthermore, not being satisfied with a regular limbo dance, the bar will be set on fire.

49
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,300
Furthermore, not being satisfied with a regular limbo dance, the bar will be set on fire.

50
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:09,400
(Move) The height!?

51
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,630
(Move) The height!?

52
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,630
And the height of the bar will be...

53
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,370
He says he wants to do it at 50 centimeters.

54
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,370
He says he wants to do it at 50 centimeters.

55
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,270
That's crazy low.

56
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,270
50 cm is really...

57
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,740
50 cm is...

58
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,970
I know, right?

59
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,310
I don't think we can do this one, right?

60
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,980
I don't think we can do this one, right?

61
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,810
But it depends on you guys. And I've been entrusted to do this. I need you with me on this, you know?

62
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,920
What if he called you? You'd be desperate for help, too.

63
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,020
But you're apparently

64
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,020
already intending on doing this, right?

65
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,060
You're already dressed as a kuroko*.

66
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,060
Note*: Kuroko is a traditional Japanese theater stagehand. Kurokos dress in all black to imply to the theater audience that they are supposed to be invisible and not part of the onstage action.

67
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,760
Don't just say that

68
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,930
Yeah, but...

69
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,160
So we'll do it for you, Hamada.

70
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,900
Well, right, that's right. That's why we'll do it.

71
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,070
I see. Thank you. Really.

72
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,830
We'll do it for you, Hamada.

73
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,230
Well, right, that's right. That's why we'll do it.

74
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,230
I see. Thank you. Really.

75
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,370
From the kindness of their hearts, the men have stepped up again.

76
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,240
From the kindness of their hearts, the men have stepped up again.

77
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,940
Matsumoto Hitoshi - The 50cm Limbo Dance of Fire Challenge.

78
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:57,240
Challenge!!

79
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:57,240
Matsumoto Hitoshi

80
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:57,240
The 50 cm Limbo Dance of Fire

81
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,240
Matsumoto Hitoshi - The 50cm Limbo Dance of Fire Challenge.

82
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,510
Let's say what we have to say to him.

83
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,510
Let's say it, seriously.

84
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,510
Let's say it, seriously.

85
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,750
He needs to put in some effort. Otherwise, there's a limit to what we can do.

86
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,980
Yes.

87
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,150
He needs to put in some effort. Otherwise, there's a limit to what we can do.

88
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,620
We can't do it.

89
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,620
Right? We should tell him that.

90
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,020
Right? We should tell him that.

91
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,020
He's coming.

92
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,050
Huh?

93
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,890
Hey.

94
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,890
Hello.

95
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,530
Hello.

96
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,330
Hello.

97
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,100
Hello.

98
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,200
Um, I did explain it to everyone.

99
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,740
Um, I did explain it to everyone.

100
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,540
And we're ready.

101
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,240
Everyone showed up, huh?

102
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,680
Yeah.

103
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,680
Yes.

104
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,680
Yes.

105
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,680
Sorry for the trouble.

106
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,650
Why don't you tell him?

107
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,140
Um, it's the same thing as last time,

108
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,850
Please, thank you.

109
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,950
Um, it's the same thing as last time,

110
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,550
Matsumoto, we need you to put some strength into it.

111
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,490
Matsumoto, we need you to put some strength into it.

112
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,820
or we

113
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,590
I don't know what you're talking about.

114
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,190
No,

115
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,190
I don't know what you're talking about.

116
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,560
Matsumoto, if you could... I'm not saying put in some effort, but if you could put in some effort.

117
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,160
Matsumoto, if you could... I'm not saying put in some effort, but if you could put in some effort.

118
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,200
If you could put in some effort.

119
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,130
Matsumoto, if you could... I'm not saying put in some effort, but if you could put in some effort.

120
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,200
I am putting in effort.

121
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,700
I see.

122
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,470
I think I'm putting strength into it, too.

123
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,800
I think I'm putting strength into it, too.

124
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,840
But there, aren't you the ones who are to realize my potential?

125
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,870
But there, aren't you the ones who are to realize my potential?

126
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,210
Aren't my juniors and my classmate the ones to do that?

127
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,480
If you were my seniors, maybe I'd describe it differently. But,

128
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,250
If you were my seniors, maybe I'd describe it differently. But,

129
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,820
you're my juniors and my classmate, so I want you to unders...tand that.

130
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,020
you're my juniors and my classmate, so I want you to unders...tand that.

131
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,420
Then, let's give it a go.

132
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,420
Then, let's give it a go.

133
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,020
Yes, let's do it.

134
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Yes, let's do it.

135
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,390
Yes, let's do it. The fire is really something, though.

136
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,030
Let's try lighting it up. Let's try lighting it up.

137
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,030
Let's try lighting it up. Let's try lighting it up.

138
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,730
Just as before.

139
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,860
Matsumoto, you should really get vigilant.

140
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,630
This is pretty scary.

141
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,640
His 1st Attempt!!

142
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,640
Matsumoto Hitoshi

143
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:27,970
Matsumoto's 1st attempt.

144
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,640
Matsumoto's 1st attempt.

145
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,270
This is good. It looks like we'll get some really thrilling footage.

146
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,700
One mistake and you'll get injured.

147
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,940
This is good. It looks like we'll get some really thrilling footage.

148
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,940
You need to be on your A-game.

149
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,780
Let's go.

150
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Let's go.

151
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,740
Ok, go.

152
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,440
This way a little more.

153
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,180
Watch out.

154
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,650
Can you...

155
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,920
Stand up!

156
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,650
Could you stand up?

157
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,850
Hey.

158
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,350
He's completely limp.

159
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,020
He's completely limp.

160
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,620
Matsumoto?

161
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,620
Matsumoto.

162
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,620
Hamada, tell him.

163
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,890
He's completely limp.

164
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,430
Just stand him up. Stand him up.

165
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,960
Just stand him up. Stand him up.

166
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,290
Stand him up. What are we supposed to do with this?

167
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,300
Move him this way.

168
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,900
Stand him up. What are we supposed to do with this?

169
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,260
Forward a bit. Let's go over here.

170
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
What are we supposed to do with this?

171
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,300
Yeah.

172
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,300
This is awful.

173
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,800
This is just... This is just...

174
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,470
This is just... This is just...

175
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,400
What the hell? What the hell?

176
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,400
Could you not go limp? Could you... Could you...

177
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,010
Could you not go limp? Could you... Could you...

178
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
What the hell? What the hell?

179
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,010
Could you not go limp? Could you... Could you...

180
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,810
This is no good.This is no good. This is no good.

181
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,610
This is no good. This is no good. This is no good.

182
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,610
This is no good. This is no good. This is no good.

183
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
What...?

184
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
What the hell?

185
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,880
Huh?

186
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,880
Huh?

187
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,820
Matsumoto gets angry and leaves

188
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,250
No, come on.

189
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Wait. Matsumoto?

190
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,250
We haven't done anything.

191
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,160
That's messed up.

192
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,190
Let's go see him. What the hell is wrong with him?

193
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,120
Let's go see him. What the hell is wrong with him?

194
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,490
Please talk to him, Hamada.

195
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,660
Seriously. Just like that?

196
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,700
Wait, we didn't do anything wrong, right?

197
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,700
No.

198
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,700
Nothing at all.

199
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,630
I think that's what it is.

200
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,640
The group go to Matsumoto's dressing room to see how he is doing

201
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,630
Completely, right?

202
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,630
That's right.

203
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,770
Hi, Mr. Matsumoto.

204
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,770
Hi. Hi, teacher.

205
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,440
Hi. Hi, teacher.

206
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
Hi. Hi, teacher.

207
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,310
How are you, how are you doing?

208
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,880
How are you, how are you doing?

209
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,410
Matsumoto was doing an English speaking lesson

210
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,310
How can I go to Shiodome Site?

211
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,310
How can I go to Shiodome Site?

212
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,110
How can I go, what? Huh?

213
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,650
How can I go, what? Huh?

214
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,020
How can I go, what? Huh?

215
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,550
How can I go, what? Huh?

216
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,120
How can I go, what? Huh?

217
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,420
How can I go to Shiodome Site?

218
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,020
How...

219
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,120
How can I go to Shiodome Site?

220
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,360
Could you...

221
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,660
One more time.

222
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,320
Sorry to... while you're in the middle of your lesson.

223
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,660
How can I go-

224
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,370
Uh, teacher, sorry. What?

225
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,200
Uh, teacher, sorry. What?

226
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,030
Uh, teacher, sorry. What?

227
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,930
Uh, teacher, sorry. What?

228
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,830
The way we see it... right?

229
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,830
Yes. We did as you requested of us.

230
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,500
... is what we think we did.

231
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,910
Mr. Matsumoto

232
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,440
Could you just...

233
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,170
Mr. Matsumoto?

234
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,970
Well, the teacher doesn't know the situation here.

235
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,140
Right, right.

236
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,010
OK, Shiodome Site

237
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,680
OK, Shiodome Site

238
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,320
How can I go to Shiodome Site?

239
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,650
OK, Shiodome Site

240
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,320
OK, Shiodome Site

241
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,290
You see,

242
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,960
what I'm thinking is,

243
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,730
why would you make the fire that big?

244
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,360
why would you make the fire that big?

245
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,730
It wasn't...

246
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,730
Well...

247
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,000
So, I'm a beginner at this, right? And so I'm just, I'm just doing this so that I can feel like I've done it a little bit.

248
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,970
So, I'm a beginner at this, right? And so I'm just, I'm just doing this so that I can feel like I've done it a little bit.

249
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,900
So, I'm a beginner at this, right? And so I'm just, I'm just doing this so that I can feel like I've done it a little bit.

250
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,170
I want to do this as if I just came by and happened to do it. So when you make the fire that raging,

251
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,710
I want to do this as if I just came by and happened to do it. So when you make the fire that raging,

252
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,140
it's like the heart shrivels, or the heart withers, you know. Who would think it'd be that hot?

253
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,310
it's like the heart shrivels, or the heart withers, you know. Who would think it'd be that hot?

254
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,150
I thought it'd be around 20 degrees Celsius.

255
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,550
I thought it'd be around 20 degrees Celsius.

256
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,820
How can I go to Shiodome Site? Mr. Matsumoto?

257
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,790
As long as it isn't hot, it's fine, then?

258
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,590
As long as it isn't hot, it's fine, then?

259
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,920
As long as it isn't hot, it's fine, then?

260
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
How can I go to Shiodome Site? Mr. Matsumoto?

261
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,650
Let's think about that.

262
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,460
The fire is a bit dangerous, so, yeah.

263
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,460
The fire is a bit dangerous, so, yeah.

264
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,900
Think about that a bit.

265
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,900
His 2nd Attempt!!

266
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Matsumoto Hitoshi

267
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,030
Matsumoto's 2nd attempt.

268
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,900
Matsumoto's 2nd attempt.

269
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,030
So at least the heat is totally...

270
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,030
So at least the heat is totally...

271
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

272
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,740
So that should be fine, right? As long as he makes it under 50 cm.

273
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,040
Right.

274
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,710
So that should be fine, right? As long as he makes it under 50 cm.

275
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,740
That's the thing, yes.

276
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,740
That's the key.

277
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,740
Right?

278
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,910
I mean...

279
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,310
Here he comes.

280
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,310
He's here.

281
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,490
So we're ready.

282
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,490
Yes.

283
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,490
Yes.

284
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,660
In general, as you can see, it's with the fire.

285
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,420
In general, as you can see, it's with the fire.

286
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,960
Right. The visual aspect.

287
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,060
Yes. I think it satisfies the visual aspect.

288
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,290
Yes. I think it satisfies the visual aspect.

289
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,160
Ok, then.

290
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,480
Ok. Let's go.

291
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,460
Ok. Let's go.

292
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,630
Are you ok?

293
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,630
Are you ok?

294
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,630
Let's go, already.

295
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,830
Should we start?

296
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,070
Let's go, let's go.

297
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,500
Let's go.

298
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,070
Why don't we start.

299
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,070
Let's go.

300
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,220
Hey.

301
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
What's he doing?

302
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,510
That's dangerous.

303
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,100
What do we do with this?

304
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,510
Let's go, let's go.

305
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,250
What's he laughing about?

306
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,280
What's so funny?

307
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,940
Who the hell knows.

308
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
What's so funny?

309
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,250
What's he laughing at?

310
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,190
Ready and go.

311
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,690
Attempt with an office chair

312
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,260
Here. Like this.

313
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,390
Here. Like this.

314
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,090
Got that attached.

315
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,090
Tanaka, this side.

316
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Let's make this work in one shot.

317
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,260
Let's go.

318
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,070
3, 2, 1,

319
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,070
3, 2, 1,

320
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,070
3, 2, 1,

321
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Go!

322
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,810
The bar was a bit...

323
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,110
The bar was a bit low, wasn't it?

324
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,440
Why'd that happen?

325
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,010
According to our plan, it should've been fine, but...

326
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,380
The bar...

327
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,440
But that was 50 cm, right there.

328
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,010
According to our plans, it should've be fine.

329
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,080
Let's try it again, with something different.

330
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,520
Oh, should we go at it with a different way?

331
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,520
The next one will definitely work.

332
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,880
Let's make it work with this one.

333
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,920
Here we go.

334
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Ok, let's go.

335
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,720
Here we go.

336
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,720
Here we go.

337
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,890
Ready and... Ready and...

338
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,660
Attempt with rolling pins

339
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
Put him on top.

340
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,020
Ready and... Ready and...

341
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,600
Now if everyone can go to their positions.

342
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,870
Good, good.

343
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:51,870
Yeah, let's go.

344
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,770
Ok.

345
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,770
Ok.

346
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,570
3, 2, 1.

347
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,330
3, 2, 1.

348
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,030
3, 2, 1.

349
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,030
Go!

350
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,030
Ok!

351
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,570
No, no.

352
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,440
This isn't it.

353
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,480
No.

354
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,770
This isn't it.

355
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,850
Let's just go to the last one.

356
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,850
The last one.

357
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,850
The last one, the last one.

358
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:05,850
The last one.

359
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,080
This will work.

360
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes.

361
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes.

362
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,410
Hey, that's wrong, Tanaka, it's the other... yeah.

363
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,580
Hey, that's wrong Tanaka, it's the other... yeah.

364
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,720
Attempt with a bar with casters

365
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,800
Hey, that's wrong Tanaka, it's the other... yeah.

366
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,250
This'll work. This'll work.

367
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:11,720
This'll work. This'll work.

368
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,990
Yama-chan, you play the part of the horse.

369
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,060
It should be higher. This way more. He's soaked in sweat.

370
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,290
Ready and...

371
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,020
It should be higher. This way more. He's soaked in sweat.

372
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,260
He's sweating like crazy.

373
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,760
Ok.

374
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,830
Here we go.

375
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,830
This should be good.

376
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,500
3, 2, 1,

377
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,060
Ok, 50 cm limbo, go!

378
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,230
3, 2, 1,

379
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,500
3, 2, 1,

380
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,800
Ok, 50 cm limbo, go!

381
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,800
Go!

382
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,800
Go!

383
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,000
We got it?

384
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,540
Completed!

385
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,640
Cleared! It was cleared!

386
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,810
Success!

387
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,810
Cleared! It was cleared!

388
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,300
Yes!

389
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,290
Matsumoto gets angry and leaves again

390
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,960
What was that, is he angry?

391
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,390
What, is he angry?

392
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,900
His attitude seemed a little angry, yeah.

393
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,900
Yeah, he wasn't happy.

394
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,930
No, he can't be angry.

395
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,670
I don't think he can be angry.

396
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,670
Well, we cleared it.

397
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,670
Right?

398
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,940
Let's go meet him in a good mood. Like, "How was it?"

399
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,700
Yeah.

400
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,370
Let's go meet him in a good mood. Like, "How was it?"

401
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,670
In a plain and normal way. Just plainly, like "How was it?" That's fine, right?

402
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,470
Yes. Yes. Yes.

403
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,840
In a plain and normal way. Just plainly, like "How was it?" That's fine, right?

404
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,440
Yes. Yes. Yes.

405
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,570
In a plain and normal way. Just plainly, like "How was it?" That's fine, right?

406
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,570
Yes. Yes. Yes.

407
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,570
Yes.

408
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,210
All right.

409
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,340
The group go to Matsumoto's dressing room to see how he is doing, again

410
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,270
Hey.

411
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Great job.

412
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,380
Great job.  Thank you.

413
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,380
Great job.

414
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,210
How was it?

415
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,710
That was great.

416
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,210
Accomplishing it?

417
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,350
Matsumoto was doing an oil painting of yakisoba (fried noodles)

418
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,620
It's too close.

419
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,060
Hmm?

420
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,720
What?

421
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:26,730
Well, I mean we...

422
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,130
Well, I mean we...

423
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,430
Yes. Congratulations.

424
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,130
accomplished what we wanted.

425
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,300
Yes. Congratulations.

426
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,300
Congratulations.

427
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,300
Congratulations.

428
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,300
Why is it that it's always like that? That I always get wounded.

429
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Huh? Wounded?

430
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,640
Your bumpy boards that you set up,

431
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,810
Your bumpy boards that you set up,

432
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,480
they were pinching my flesh. The flesh. See?

433
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,110
they were pinching my flesh. The flesh. See?

434
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,210
they were pinching my flesh. The flesh. See?

435
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,210
Oh.

436
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,920
Don't give me "Oh."  It was grinding me.

437
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,880
But with the one after the one that pinched you, we did clear it.

438
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,390
But with the one after the one that pinched you, we did clear it.

439
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,420
But with the one after the one that pinched you, we did clear it.

440
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,090
Yes, we did.

441
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,560
The— what "cleared?"

442
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,490
Well, going under the 50 cm bar...

443
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,500
I'm not talking about getting through a 50 cm bar or whatever.

444
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,370
Make it so that

445
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,700
when you see it, you go

446
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
"Matsumoto is really doing it!"

447
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,680
You're getting paid for this, right!

448
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,040
Every week.

449
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,040
You're getting paid for this, right?

450
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,620
Do your jobs!

451
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,450
But, what you mean by, "Matsumoto is really doing it..."

452
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,450
But, what you mean by, "Matsumoto is really doing it..."

453
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,360
Uh, no, no, I don't need to hear your ways of

454
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
shutting people down.

455
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:34,760
I don't need that.

456
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,360
Now, everyone say how you're going to work hard henceforth

457
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,360
and your zodiac sign.

458
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,300
In the end, say that.

459
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Hurry up.

460
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Ok, well, well, I'll think about how to make it look like "Matsumoto is really doing it," and work towards that.

461
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,270
I'm a rabbit.

462
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,010
I, also, will give it my best.

463
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,510
I, also, will give it my best.

464
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,840
I'm a monkey.

465
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,410
I, also, will give it my best and make sure you don't get injured.

466
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,050
I, also, will give it my best and make sure you don't get injured.

467
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,380
I'm a boar.

468
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm hoping to make it happen in our next attempt.

469
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
I'm hoping to make it happen in our next attempt.

470
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,850
I'm a boar.

471
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,850
Excuse us.

472
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,160
Excuse us.

473
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,160
We'll give it our best.

474
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,160
His 3rd Attempt!!

475
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Matsumoto Hitoshi

476
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,290
Matsumoto's 3rd attempt.

477
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,160
Matsumoto's 3rd attempt.

478
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,760
Well, in the next one we just gotta pull him.

479
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,730
Yes.

480
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,730
And I think it'll look like "He's really doing it."

481
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,370
It does.

482
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,370
Visually, right?

483
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,370
I think it'll work.

484
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,740
It quite looks he's really doing it, right?

485
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,740
Yes.

486
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,170
Where is he looking?

487
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,240
How is he managing to walk straight?

488
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,310
Ok, we're ready, so... over here.

489
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,780
Yes. Thank you.

490
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,780
Ok, we're ready, so... over here.

491
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,380
Yes. Thank you.

492
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,780
Please come this way.

493
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,780
Thank you.

494
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,320
This is amazing.

495
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,650
This is great.

496
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,650
This will work.

497
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,650
This is perfect.

498
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,020
Visually, this is really,

499
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,660
Attempt with a huge swing set

500
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,360
um, the feeling of "really doing it" is pretty great.

501
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
um, the feeling of "really doing it" is pretty great.

502
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,290
We think it will work.

503
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,930
Yes.

504
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,290
It'll work?

505
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,030
It will work. This will work.

506
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,230
It will work. This will work.

507
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,030
Over here.

508
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,030
Thank you.

509
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,030
Thank you.

510
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,670
Higher up.

511
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,670
Yes.

512
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,000
Ready and... there we go.

513
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,040
Ready and... there we go.

514
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,040
According to the plan, he'll go like this.

515
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Right underneath.

516
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,180
Zoom!

517
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,450
Then let's have the staff help us a bit here.

518
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,750
Thank you.

519
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,180
Thank you.

520
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,950
Ready and...

521
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,550
All right.

522
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,950
Ready and...

523
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,350
Ok. It's good, it's good?

524
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,790
That's good.

525
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,190
We're good.

526
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,790
Is it straight?

527
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,660
It's straight, yes?

528
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,260
Ok, we're ready.

529
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,530
All right.

530
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,390
3, 2, 1, go!

531
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,060
3, 2, 1, go!

532
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,490
3, 2, 1, go!

533
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,490
3, 2, 1, go!

534
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,790
Go!

535
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,130
Go!

536
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Go!

537
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,730
Go!

538
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,030
Go!

539
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,640
That was close. Should we try raising it a bit?

540
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,640
That was close. Should we try raising it a bit?

541
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,940
Should we raise the bar? Yes, for the next one. Yes.

542
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,640
Let's raise the bar. We'll raise it.

543
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,040
Should we raise the bar? Yes, for the next one. Yes.

544
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,150
Raise the bar.

545
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:36,450
Let's make it the highest one.

546
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,210
Yes, yes. Let's do that.

547
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,750
Ok, we'll go with this for Matsumoto.

548
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,450
Yes, yes. Let's do that.

549
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,450
Ok, we'll go with this for Matsumoto.

550
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,450
Who cares about how many centimeters or whatever.

551
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,450
Who cares about how many centimeters or whatever.

552
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,620
Yes.

553
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,550
Yes, that's true.

554
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,550
Can you raise this?

555
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,090
Ok. Ok.

556
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,490
Thank you.

557
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,590
Ok. Be careful there. We're going.

558
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,990
Straight, ok?

559
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,530
Ok. Be careful there. We're going.

560
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,890
3, 2, 1, Ok!

561
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,730
3, 2, 1, Ok!

562
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,630
Ok. Be careful there. We're going.

563
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,260
3, 2, 1, Ok!

564
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,630
3, 2, 1, Ok!

565
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,100
Ok!

566
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,860
Ok!

567
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,730
Ah, that was close.

568
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,830
Ah, that was close.

569
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,830
That was close.

570
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,370
Ok!

571
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,800
Ok!

572
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,470
Ok!

573
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,800
That was close.

574
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,470
Man, that was close.

575
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,940
That was close.

576
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Why'd that happen?

577
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,810
Yes, why?

578
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,850
The feeling of "really doing it" is there. Yeah.

579
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,150
Yes, it is.

580
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,350
The feeling of "really doing it" is there. Yeah.

581
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,820
Maybe it'd be better closer together?

582
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,650
The bar, right?

583
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,650
50...

584
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,260
Matsumoto gets angry and leaves, yet again

585
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,260
Wouldn't it have worked if we attempted it a few times?

586
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,590
Yes. I think if we could move it a bit

587
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,100
Yes. I think if we could move it a bit

588
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,130
further this way, it would've worked.

589
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,170
Make the lowest point a bit that way.

590
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,170
Make the lowest point a bit that way.

591
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,200
Oh, I see. Then let's just tell him that.

592
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,800
Oh, I see. Then let's just tell him that.

593
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,370
Oh, I see. Then let's just tell him that.

594
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,370
Yes.

595
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,370
If we put it close by, it'll go right through.

596
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,040
The group go to Matsumoto's dressing room to see how he is doing, yet again

597
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,980
Great job.

598
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,340
Great job.

599
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,250
Matsumoto was fixing a punctured tire of a bicycle

600
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:48,420
Matsumoto, we got it.  The bar was a bit far out, right?

601
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,420
If we, like, put it closer in...

602
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,760
It will work fine.

603
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,700
You three were fine this time.

604
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,700
You three were fine this time.

605
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,530
Yes.

606
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,530
I did feel you were trying pretty hard.

607
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,710
So I'm not really angry at you three or anything.

608
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,910
Wait, wait, why is that?

609
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,110
You said "Who cares about the height," right?

610
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,410
That...

611
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,290
we don't need to care about the 50 cm, you said something like that, right?

612
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,290
That completely put me off.

613
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,720
That, well, was a slip of the tongue.

614
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,960
Do you want to let me do this or not?

615
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Is this like a rush job? You just want to get it over with? What?

616
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,370
No, that's not true.

617
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,240
Every one of you, say this.

618
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,710
Every one of you, say why you want me to do the limbo dance,

619
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,410
and at the end, say your mom's name.

620
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,810
and at the end, say your mom's name.

621
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,380
Everyone say that. Go.

622
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,380
Everyone say that. Go.

623
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,850
Well,

624
00:14:49,850 --> 00:15:00,430
well, you said you wanted to this and we're on, you know, we're doing a TV show together, so I'm doing this with the hope that we can work together as a team and succeed at this.

625
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,290
Um, my mother is Nobuko.

626
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,290
Um, my mother is Nobuko.

627
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,030
My senior has told me that he wants to do this

628
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,400
so, um, I hope to assist him as much as possible.

629
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,400
so, um, I hope to assist him as much as possible.

630
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,770
Um, my mother is Aya.

631
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,510
Um, my mother is Aya.

632
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,510
Um, my mother is Aya.

633
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,080
In the same way,

634
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,250
I am not thinking about this as a rush job at all.

635
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,580
I will henceforth give it my very best.

636
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,160
My mother is Kiyomi.

637
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,160
My mother is Kiyomi.

638
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,590
Yes,

639
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,100
I'm giving it my best. To realize

640
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,600
I'm giving it my best. To realize

641
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,500
what my senior wants to do,

642
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
I will henceforth give it my very best.

643
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,970
My mother is Akiko.

644
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,940
What?

645
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,870
What?

646
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,180
Akiko.

647
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,510
It's the same.

648
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,520
My wife and my mom have the same name.

649
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,850
My wife and my mom have the same name.

650
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,390
My wife and my mom have the same name.

651
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,890
And I don't want to insistently say the same thing over and over.

652
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,160
One last time,

653
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,760
I'll bet on you guys.

654
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,430
Yes.

655
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,830
Thank you.

656
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
My mother is Akiko.

657
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,670
His 4th Attempt!!

658
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,670
Matsumoto Hitoshi

659
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,010
Matsumoto's 4th attempt.

660
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,670
Matsumoto's 4th attempt.

661
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,680
Um

662
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,460
to create that feeling of "really doing it,"

663
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,660
we thought up something that's different from the previous ones.

664
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,690
Yes.

665
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,430
We also think it will be

666
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,500
quite impressive visually.

667
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Yes, we do think it will be.

668
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,600
We are confident it will succeed.

669
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,400
We are confident it will succeed.

670
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,440
All right, let's go.

671
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,910
Let's go.

672
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,910
All right. Let's do this as if it's our last chance.

673
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,380
Let's really try to make it happen with this one.

674
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,380
Let's make this happen.

675
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,580
Whoa, wow.

676
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
Whoa, it's pretty large.

677
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,450
Attempt with an extra large slide

678
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,450
The view does look different from here.

679
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,590
This will be great.

680
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,460
All right.

681
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,460
If you could, please.

682
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,960
Let's go!

683
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
Yes! Let's go!

684
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,800
Was it at the waist?

685
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,800
The waist...

686
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,640
This should be good. Yeah.

687
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,210
Looks good.

688
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,210
This should be good. Yeah.

689
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,240
Make it absolutely sure.

690
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:33,950
We're good.

691
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,880
Ok, 3, 2, 1, go!

692
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,280
Ok, 3, 2, 1, go!

693
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,520
Ok, 3, 2, 1, go!

694
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Ok, 3, 2, 1, go!

695
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Go!

696
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,560
After overcoming many trials, finally,

697
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,930
Matsumoto has accomplished the 50 cm limbo dance of fire.

698
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,610
Matsumoto Hitoshi

699
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,610
Success!!

700
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,610
The 50 cm Limbo Dance of Fire

701
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,930
A true congratulations to you!
