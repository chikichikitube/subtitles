Toos!

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,030
Alright, today I want to show you---

10
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,730
Already? It's too early

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,400
I don't want to waste time

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Have you ever experienced a booby-trap?

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,370
Oh yes
- Booby-traps...

14
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,540
He really started already...
- That's right

15
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,510
'Cause I want to show you the VTR

16
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,510
Booby-traps? I think Tanaka had

17
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,310
Oh yeah, I've fell down in like 10 of those

18
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,310
That's a fair bunch

19
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,650
How about you, Matsushino?
- Never

20
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,480
Oh, never before?
- No

21
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,920
How about you, Downtown?

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,790
I don't think we haven't, right?
- Yeah, i guess so...

23
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,660
Most likely yes
- I think so too

24
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,130
Alright, about the booby-traps...

25
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,330
They're fun to watch, right?
- They are

26
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,200
It's fun to see them work

27
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,100
So, here's the theory I've brought with me today

28
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,810
Booby-traps Battle Royale

29
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,340
"Booby-traps Battle Royale"

30
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,780
What's this about?

31
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,410
It's basically a booby-trap-your-opponent game

32
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,580
It's basically a booby-trap-your-opponent game

33
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,620
It's basically a booby-trap-your-opponent game

34
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,750
You have some booby-traps yourself

35
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,520
And you have to lead your opponents inside them

36
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,790
Yes, it requires strategy

37
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,560
To a degree
- Sounds fun

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,400
It's also about psychological warfareâ€‹
- I see...

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,700
But it's not a theory at all

40
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,700
Well, yeah, it's not

41
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,700
It's fine, we don't need them

42
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,970
Are we done with theories?

43
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,970
Yes, today it's not a theory

00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,620

52
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,260
We tricked them into thinking
this was a camping episode

53
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,360
Get closer

54
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,360
Professor Kitano
(Beat Takeshi)

55
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,860
It's Takeshi...
- Where...?

56
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,670
What's going on?!
- What the--?

57
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,740
What was that?

58
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,310
Wait, what's that?

59
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,310
- Listen

60
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,380
The entertainment industry has hit rock bottom

61
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,550
The entertainment industry has hit rock bottom

62
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,720
The entertainment industry has hit rock bottom

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,120
Wha-?

64
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,350
What are you talking about?
- That's why...

65
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,050
Wait a second, this is getting scary

66
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,660
Wait a second, this is getting scary

67
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,260
That's why I thought of this game

68
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,530
That's why I thought of this game

69
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,960
Booby-trap Battle Royale

73
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,230
Give me a break!

74

Who are thos--- aaah!!

75
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,500
So goddamn loud!

76
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,670
This is scary!

77
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,670
I'll have you booby-trap each other

78
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,980
I'll have you booby-trap each other

79
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,110
I'll have you booby-trap each other

80
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,110
Booby-trap each other...?

81
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,110
- W-wait

82
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:55,820
Boobie-trap battle until only one will be left!!

83
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,080
On today's plan, only one of them will be left

84
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,520
It's time for Booby-trap Battle Royale

85
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,820
This is incredible...

86
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:05,600
Each one of them knows two trap locations

87
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,030
There's a total of 10 holes dug up in this camping site

88
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,130
Each member knows the location of two of them

89
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:13,270
A psychological game about luring your opponents

90
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:12,740
It's a psychological game in which you have
to lead your opponent inside your own trap

102
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,740
Their holes have been chosen by lottery, here they are

103
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,820
They all receive a map with their own holes

104
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,050
And they received a map
which only shows their two holes

105
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,420
I think that... this one must be my hole

106
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,590
I think that... this one must be my hole

107
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,490
I think that... this one must be my hole

108
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,520
So you fell inside your own hole, huh...

109
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,890
So you fell inside your own hole, huh...

110
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,390
That's a shame

111
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,860
No, Matsuno, you don't have to dig it yourself

112
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,530
No, Matsuno, you don't have to dig it yourself

113
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,400
Are you sure about...

114
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,560
I g-g-g--gg-guess so?

115
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,500
They're already there?

116
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,500
- Yeah, I think so

117
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,030
An idiot shouldn't speak with another idiot!

118
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,370
An idiot shouldn't speak with another idiot!

119
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,370
An idiot shouldn't speak with another idiot!

120
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,570
Are the holes in there already?

121
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,570
- Yes, they are

122
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,380
Tracking their own traps

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,940
They all went to check their own booby-traps' location

124
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:58,020
Booby-trap Battle Royale: start
11:16 A.M.

125
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,210
And now the game finally begins

126
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,580
Alright guys, now go get ready for lunch

127
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,020
Sure
- Got it

128
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,920
Should we walk this close to each other?
- Well, there could be a trap...

129
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:08,060
11:16 A.M. - Going to the cookhouse to prepare lunch

130
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,060
Oh, that's right
- This looks like one     - Watch out

131
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,760
Hey look, there's... like, over there...

132
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,500
Hey look, there's... like, over there...

133
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,060
- What's going on?

134
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,830
Hey look, there's... like, over there...

135
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,570
There's some kind of flower, let's go see it

136
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,670
- A flower?

137
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,530
There's some kind of flower, let's go see it

138
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,270
We should eat first...

139
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:18,770
Come on, it's Spring

140
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,040
Come on, it's Spring

141
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,140
Let's go see the flower sprouts

142
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,040
Flower gazing?

143
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,650
That's right, flower gazing

144
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,550
But lunch...

145
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,450
We gotta make it first

146
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,850
She's just revealing her moves
- Right...

147
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,250
What Matsuno is plotting is...

148
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,150
How can I put it...

Objective

153
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,550
She sucks so bad!

154
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,350
This way!

155
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,920
Matsuno? You suck at this

156
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,920
- What?

157
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,130
Matsuno? You suck at this

158
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:40,590
No way we're falling for that

159
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,660
No way we're falling for that

160
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,700
There's a trap over there, right?

161
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,600
No, that's not...

162
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,600
- Already?

163
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,600
Her plan failed because of her poor acting

164
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,940
Her plan to lure them failed because of her poor acting

165
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,670
Oh boy...

166
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,740

Matsuno

169
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,740
Objective

170
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,740
She only revealed where her trap was

171
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,980
In the end, she only let them know where her trap is

172
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,810
That was too quick, Matsuno

173
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,110
This is the cooking area

174
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:06,050
Cookhouse

175
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,820
How nice, it's all set up

176
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,450
Come on, let's get ready

177
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,220
11:21 A.M. - Time to start the barbecue

178
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,450
Again?!

179
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,490
There she goes again

180
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,590
Matsuno..?

181
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,960
She's so bad at this!

182
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,220
Where are you going?

183
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,360
We gotta get ready

184
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,260
We gotta set everything up, right?

185
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:24,040
Matsuno's trap

186
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,430
- She sucks so bad...
I mean, it's so obvious

187
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,430
You're really bad at this, Matsuno

188
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,000
Come on, let's get ready

189
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,040
Alright, let's get ready then

190
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:31,880
Cookhouse

191
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:31,880
Matsuno

192
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,610
They all know there's another hole nearby

193
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,880
Another poor act reveals her second hole

194
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:31,880
Current location

195
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,510
But...

196
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,580
Matsuno's trap

197
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,980
This is incredible

198
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,650
We gotta move this

199
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,450
Over there

200
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,050
But...

201
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,480
Let's take this thing over there

202
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,150
Why...?

203
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,650
Where are you trying to go?

204
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,390
Come on, I'm not scheming anything! Let's go

205
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,420
Come on, I'm not scheming anything! Let's go

206
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,760
What are you--
- It's heavy

207
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,190
Let's just move it ov---

208
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,900
How could he fell for that?

209
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,020
Whaaat?!

210
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,420
"What" my ass, it was so obvious

211
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,650
"What" my ass, it was so obvious

212
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,160
So quick

213
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,160
- That can't be

214
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,030
It was crystal clear

215
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,030
Was it?

216
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,030
- Of course

217
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,830
Your act sucked the whole time, Matsuno

218
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,970
Yeah, I was like "it's here, isn't it"?

219
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:40,280
Miyazon eliminated after 7 in-game minutes

220
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:40,280
[4 people left]

221
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,670
Her acting was poor, but one person didn't notice it

222
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,870
And so, Miyazon drops out

223
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,610
I really had no idea

224
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:48,650
Defeated contestants monitoring space

225
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,650
How come everybody knew that?

226
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,820
As expected from Miyazon

227
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:54,230
They regain composure and start the barbecue

228
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,190
Back to the camp, they're getting the bbq ready

229
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,790
And then...

230
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,830
Everything ok in there?

231
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,430
Takashi alone leaves the cooking area

232
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,470
Takashi leaves the area alone

233
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,440
Oh, hey Takashi

234
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,900
Oh, hey Takashi

235
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,010
He pays a visit to the eliminated Miyazon

236
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,540
He goes to see the eliminated Miyazon

237
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,340
I was worried about you so I came here

238
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,280
I was worried about you so I came here

239
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,910
Why, thank you

240
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,550
You know, just that...

241
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,050
Miyazon is
looking for something

242
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,550
And while exchanging a casual conversation...

243
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,220
Look, a dog

244
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,550
Takashi takes something out from his backpack

245
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,090
A dog? Where?

246
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,420
Creepy...

247
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,660
Over there?

248
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,430
He just stole his booby-traps

249
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm going to avenge you, Miyazon

250
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,230
Right?

251
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,700
Takashi!!

252
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,670
He's clever

253
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,070
See ya later

254
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,740
No way!
- He stole it

255
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,970
He's so dumb he didn't even realize it

256
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,910
He stole Miyazon's map

257
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,910
He successfully stole Miyazon's map

258
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:51,120
Miyazon

259
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:51,120
Miyazon

260
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,120
Miyazon's booby-traps: GET

261
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,910
And he managed to steal the holes
near the logs and in front of the dog house

262
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,220
Takashi-san... We can't start the fire

263
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,220
- Sorry

264
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,220
Takashi-san... We can't start the fire

265
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,220
- Huh?

266
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,920
We really can't

267
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,920
- Not even a spark

268
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,760
Charcoalâ€‹ won't do it

269
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Charcoalâ€‹ won't do it

270
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,760
- What do we need?

271
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,160
Some wood or something

272
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,160
- You think so?

273
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,000
A chance to lead them in towards the new area

274
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,060
Here comes his chance to lead them
towards the logs area trap

275
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,000
Current location

276
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,000
Miyazon

277
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,730
Whoa, he's evil

278
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,500
Oh, isn't that a firewood pile?

279
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,970
Oh, isn't that a firewood pile?

280
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:19,910
Logs

281
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:19,910
Miyazon's trap

282
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,770
It is
- You're right

283
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,510
Aren't those too much?

284
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,440
There's actual firewood!

285
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,010
Want me to go get them?

286
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,910
Yeah, please

287
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,050
Yaguchi is lead by Takashi to go get the logs

288
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,520
Tricked by Takashi, Yaguchi goes towards the logs

289
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:37,660
Miyazon's trap

290
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,890
She's stepping aside...

291
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,790
Grab some logs, will you?

292
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,120
Grab some logs, will you?

293
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,120
- Please

294
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,630
Sure

295
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,430
- Looks safe enough...

296
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,660
Safe

297
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,060
She's safe

298
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,930
Maybe she sensed something,

299
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:45,570
But Yaguchi chose to grab the farthest ones,
instead of the closest ones

300
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:48,670
She grabs the farthest ones

301
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,740
Oh boy, I'm scared!

302
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,670
Oh boy, I'm scared!

303
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,240
And in that moment...

304
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,240
- That's too much sauce...

305
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,340
Hey guys!

306
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,410
Hey guys!

307
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,310
Huh?!

308
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,380
Good morning, folks!

309
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,750
It's your partner

310
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,820
Hi guys, do you have any trouble with anything?

311
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,490
- Nishimura, why are you...?

312
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,850
Hi guys, do you have any trouble with anything?

313
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,590
Hi guys, do you have any trouble with anything?

314
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:04,390
You... need help?

315
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,560
- What's going on?

316
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,260
You... need help?

317
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,890
Why is him here?

318
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,890
11:44 A.M. - Nishimura (Viking) enters the camp site

319
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,590
We have a guest acting as their camping teacher

320
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,630
It's Nishimura (Viking),
the comedian who loves camping the most!

321
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,700
Number 1 camping-loving comedian!

322
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,430
I didn't know that

323
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,630
What's with the military?

324
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,830
What's with the military?

325
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,340
They're visiting us

326
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:18,940
It's nothing, don't worry about them

327
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,210
It's nothing, don't worry about them

328
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,210
- Yeah, let them be

329
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,270
- Why is him here?

330
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,270
You ok with the fire?

331
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,810
Let me just...

332
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,650
What is that?!

333
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,650
- Stop it, we don't need this

334
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,710
I never saw that in my life!

335
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,710
- The hell is that?!

336
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,520
It's a fire breather

337
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,520
- What?!

338
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,150
Don't worry, we're good

339
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,120
- It's fine

340
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,990
Don't worry, we're good

341
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,820
It's lit

342
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,350
- Enough with that

343
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,350
It's lit, see?

344
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,630
He doesn't know anything

345
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,630
This man doesn't know anything, but they can use him

346
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,500
To make him go around to check suspicious spots

347
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,630
They can use him
to check suspicious areas

348
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,930
But they don't want him to fall into one of their own traps

349
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,930
He could fall into your own trap

350
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,640
A complex man

351
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,070
That's what Nishimura is: a complex being

352
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,340
Delicious!

353
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,940
- I told you!

354
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,280
- Very good!

355
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,710
It's good

356
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,010
What the hell is this? It's so thick.

357
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,750
What the hell is this? It's so thick.

358
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,980
It's my personal fork

359
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,980
- Tastes good

360
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,320
This is pretty good!

361
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,690
It's very good

362
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,420
Really, really good

363
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,690
Your fork is amazing!

364
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,620
The hell is he eatin'?!

365
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:21,630
12:38 P.M. - Free time

366
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,330
After the barbecue, they have some free time

367
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,130
They all decided to pick their favorite object
and playin the field

368
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,270
It's pretty wide around the dogs' spot

369
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,300
It's pretty wide around the dogs' spot

370
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,670
Maybe that area should do it, is there any other wide field?

371
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,340
Maybe that area should do it, is there any other wide field?

372
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,080
You sure? Looks narrow to me

373
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,080
- It's not really the best spot

374
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,180
There are too many trees, they'll get in our way

375
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,080
There are too many trees, they'll get in our way

376
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,080
Let's go over there that spot

377
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,250
Let's go over there that spot

378
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,180
But there are trees in there too

379
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,080
Are there? Really?

380
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,180
Are there? Really?

381
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,590
How about that place?

382
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,590
- Yeah, that spot is pretty wide

383
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,590
- Here?

384
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,060
Choosing the right place while suspecting each other

385
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,960
The four are trying to find the right spot,
while suspecting each other

386
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:56,500
Take an advantageous position

387
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,730
They want to lead them near to their traps' area

388
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:56,500
Overdo it, and you'll be exposed

389
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,930
But if they're too open about it, they might reveal their place

390
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,270
So they keep on questioning each other

391
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,900
- How about this spot? Pretty wide, huh?

392
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,900
Isn't this spot good?

393
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,170
Let's do it here, then

394
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,840
- Sure

395
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Why are you all so hesitant to choose a spot...?

396
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,040
Why are you all so hesitant to choose a spot...?

397
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,940
'Cause we want a wide spot

398
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,940
- That's it

399
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,640
This spot is good, let's play here

400
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,380
This spot is good, let's play here

401
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,550
As a result of their debate,
which even Nishimura felt it was strange,

402
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,920
They chose a place near Kotohge's trap

403
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,850
Current location

404
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,850
Kotohge

405
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,990
Will Kotohge make the most out of this chance?

406
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Will Kotohge make the most out of this chance?

407
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,430
Wanna play some baseball?

408
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,430
- Oh, nice idea

409
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll be the pitcher

410
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,500
The pitcher?

411
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,500
The pitcher

412
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,970
Who's the batter?

413
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,970
One of the girls?

414
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,900
Please, Matsuno, you go first

415
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,770
Alright, Yaguchi-chan, or anyone, it's fine

416
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,370
Alright, Yaguchi-chan, or anyone, it's fine

417
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,940
Sure

418
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,080
I'll guard the base

419
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,680
Isn't that a little suspect?

420
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,010
Over there, over there

421
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,340
I'll be the pitcher

422
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:47,920
Kotohge's trap

423
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,180
Right there, yeah

424
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,250
That should do it

425
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,920
Yaguchi is lead by Kotohge right in front of the trap

426
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,520
Yaguchi is lead by Kotohge right in front of his trap

427
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,790
Right in front of it

428
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,250
Can I? Shoot it back over there

429
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,420
Can I? Shoot it back over there

430
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,520
Here I go

431
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,120
Here

432
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,590
Oh shoot

433
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,190
Sorry about that

434
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,360
Ah, so she has to go get it...

435
00:11:54,190 --> 00:12:01,630
Kotohge's trap

436
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,490
Wait

437
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:55,790
We still have some balls here, it's fine

438
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,730
We still have some balls here, it's fine

439
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,500
Don't worry

440
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,430
There's still more

441
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,200
Other balls?

442
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah, right here

443
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,900
Oh shit, sorry!

444
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,270
Kotohge's trap

445
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,240
You have more?

446
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,070
I don't

447
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,010
What just happened?!

448
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,310
He's clever

449
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,310
What's this?!

450
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
He's good

451
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,690
She totally fell for it

452
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,630
Oh?

453
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,090
You got me!

454
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,030
What are you doing?

455
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,900
You set it up so naturally!

456
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,800
You set it up so naturally!

457
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,800
He has no clue

458
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,370
What...

459
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:36,970
That was mine

460
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,440
Nishimura is so clueless!

461
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,440
That was mine

462
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,240
Such a nice trap, well done

463
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,640
Such a nice trap, well done

464
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,840
He's like "what's going on?"

465
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,840
Does that mean, you planned to make me the batter all along?

466
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,470
Does that mean, you planned to make me the batter all along?

467
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,510
Does that mean, you planned to make me the batter all along?

468
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:45,880
That's right, that's my hole after all

469
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,280
That's right, that's my hole after all

470
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,450
That's right, that's my hole after all

471
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,280
"My hole"?

472
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,290
What's "my hole"?

473
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,290
"My hole"...

474
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,050
His presence is such a burden!

475
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,320
His presence is such a burden!

476
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:07,470
Yaguchi eliminated after 1 hour and 35 minutes

477
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:07,470
[3 people left]

478
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,390
Yaguchi got caught up in Kotohge's plan and is eliminated

479
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,400
She completely disappeared

480
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,970
Kotohge is really good at this

481
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,140
Kotohge is really good at this

482
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,140
The other three contestants and Nishimura

483
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:21,750
Current position

484
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:21,750
Miyazon

485
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:21,750
Yaguchi

486
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:21,750
Yaguchi

487
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,810
Are close to the holes of the two eliminated

488
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,880
It's full of holes in there

489
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,980
This field is swarming with traps

490
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,280
Yaguchan can't take part in this anymore?

491
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,280
That's right

492
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,420
What's with this rule? Hahaha

493
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,350
What's with this rule? Hahaha

494
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,850
Eh? No more baseball?

495
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,850
Yeah, that's it

496
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,620
After seeing Yaguchi in that state...

497
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,560
He still believes they're doing a camping episode

498
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,560
He still thinks this episode is about camping

499
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,860
Nishimura is a freak

500
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,300
Really...

501
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:49,240
Miyazon's trap

502
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,200
What's that? There's two of them, so cute!

503
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,570
What's that? There's two of them, so cute!

504
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,670
What's that? There's two of them, so cute!

505
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,200
What's that? There's two of them, so cute!

506
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,670
He then proceeds to walk near a trap

507
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:49,240
Incredibly close to a trap

508
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,010
Wanna play frisbee? Or badminton?

509
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,710
Wanna play frisbee? Or badminton?

510
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,380
"So cute", he said...

511
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,510
Let's play frisbee

512
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,510
Frisbee
- Sure

513
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,850
Let's go

514
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,850
I'm really good at frisbee

515
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,120
Is that so?

516
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,220
Throw it over there...

517
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,530
What the hell is going on...

518
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,700
Booby-traps are really fun!

519
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,600
He completely disappeared

520
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,240
Why is there a pitfall in here?

521
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,970
Why is there a pitfall in here?

522
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,270
He hasn't realized it yet!

523
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,180
Come on!

524
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:26,680
Who was it?!

525
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,610
Who was it?!

526
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,210
Hey, hey!

527
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,380
It's one of the staff

528
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,090
It can happen, alright

529
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,490
Who was it?!

530
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,000
Are you kidding me?

531
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,130
Makes sense

532
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,900
Who was it?

533
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,030
That's a tv show for you

534
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,870
It can happen

535
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,310
Who was it?!

536
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,310
The staff isn't immune to traps

537
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,310
A cameraman fell into a trap?

538
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,580
This is incredible
- Yeah...

539
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,380
A cameraman fell down?

540
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,980
Are you kidding me?

541
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,550
What the hell?

542
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,820
I'm amazed

543
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:03,650
We are in the middle of a trap rush

544
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,480
We are in the middle of a trap rush

545
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,450
It's a rush, a rush

546
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,020
Why is there a pitfall in this place?

547
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,320
It's a booby-trap rush

548
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,320
All in the same place?

549
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,720
Is this "my hole"?

550
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,020
No, that's not your hole

551
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,720
No, that's not your hole

552
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,090
But you said "my hole" before

553
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,190
But you said "my hole" before

554
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:27,340
Cameraman

555
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:27,340
Eliminated after 1 hour and 39 minutes:

556
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:27,340
Nishimura

557
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:27,340
[3 people left]

558
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:27,340
[3 people left]

559
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,530
After Nishimura,

560
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,730
The cameraman is eliminated

561
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,370
The game isn't progressing at all

562
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,800
- It says "cameraman"
- A lot is going on

563
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,470
Only people unrelated to the game are falling down

564
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,840
It's a total mess

565
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,340
It's a complete mess

566
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,370
Oh my...

567
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,340
Now that Yaguchi and Miyazon are out...

568
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,140
Now that Yaguchi and Miyazon are out...

569
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,680
We don't know where their holes are...

570
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,910
We don't know where their holes are...

571
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,910
Right...

572
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,880
I used both my holes, I don't have any more

573
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,420
- We don't know

574
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,420
I used both my holes, I don't have any more

575
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,350
staff) Maybe you shouldn't have say that aloud...

576
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,650
-He's right

577
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,390
- Exactly
- Right

578
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,820
Kotohge ended up revealing he ran out of holes

579
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:47,260
Kotohge revealed he doesn't have holes anymore

580
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,660
Nishimura may be an idiot,

581
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,960
But so is Kotohge

582
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,700
By the way, Matsuno is an idiot too

583
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,670
- Come on...

584
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,130
And the same goes for Miyazon

585
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,130
Come on!

586
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,770
Matsuno hasn't accomplished anything yet!

587
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,500
Matsuno hasn't accomplished anything yet!

588
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,240
I shouldn't have said it when Yaguchi fell down my trap

589
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,310
I shouldn't have said it when Yaguchi fell down my trap

590
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,380
A man without any holes is going somewhere...

591
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,950
The place where this man who lost all his holes is going to...

592
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,650
I'm sneaking into Yaguchi's bag, it feels exciting

593
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,820
I'm sneaking into Yaguchi's bag, it feels exciting

594
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,680
Makes sense

595
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,920
Yaguchi's map: GET

596
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,690
And so, he steals Yaguchi's map from her bag

597
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,550
That's a basic move

598
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,290
Now he's got some holes

599
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:29,400
Miyazon

600
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:29,400
Yaguchi

601
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:29,400
Yaguchi

602
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,760
One of them is the one Nishimura fell in

603
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:29,400
Yaguchi's booby-trap: GET

604
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,170
But he got the other one inside the tent, he's got a chance

605
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,140
And his plan is the following...

606
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,810
His trump card: baseball plan

607
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,810
It's his trump card again: playing baseball

608
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,140
Again?

609
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:44,150
He aims for a strike-and-miss by Matsuno to lead her inside the tent

610
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,710
He wants Matsuno to miss the ball,
so he can lead her inside the tent

611
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,450
However...

612
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,190
Here goes!

613
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,320
Whoa! Nice!

614
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,360
That was incredible!

615
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,160
That was impressive!

616
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,260
She hit it perfectly and sent it back

617
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,690
She striked it back at him

618
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,990
Well, she's an athlete after all

619
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,830
And not only once...

620
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,230
She's incredible!

621
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,560
Why are you hitting it?

622
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,970
"Why are you hitting it"?

623
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,500
Why are you hitting it?

624
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,500
Matsuno shows an unexpected talent

625
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:07,410
An incredible baseball talent

626
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,370
That's something

627
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,410
But...

628
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,440
Where is it?

629
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,610
It went inside

630
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,450
Oh shi-

631
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,380
No you didn't!

632
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,790
Come on!

633
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,490
Oh man!

634
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,800
Come on!!

635
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,500
You should have expected it

636
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,330
Hey you! Come on!

637
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,600
Hey you! Come on!

638
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
The hell is this?!

639
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:42,740
Matsuno eliminated after 2 hour and 8 minutes

640
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:42,740
[2 people left]

641
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,740
With Matsuno gone,

642
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,510
From now on is a 1-vs-1 match between Kotohge and Takashi

643
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,740
Come on!

644
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,010
I know for sure you don't have any more traps

645
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,280
I know for sure you don't have any more traps

646
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,040
I'm not sure about that

647
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,610
There are only Miyazon and Matsuno's trap, 1 of each

648
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,880
There are only Miyazon and Matsuno's trap, 1 of each

649
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,550
And Matsuno, yeah

650
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,250
There are only Miyazon and Matsuno's trap, 1 of each

651
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,150
And two of mine

652
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,090
You have two of them?!

653
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,090
That's right

654
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,490
You still have two?!

655
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,490
Yep

656
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:07,030
Cookhouse

657
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:07,030
Kotohge

658
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:07,030
Kotohge

659
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:07,030
Matsuno

660
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:07,030
Matsuno

661
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:07,030
Miyazon

662
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:07,030
Miyazon

663
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:07,030
Takashi

664
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:07,030
Takashi

665
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:07,030
Yaguchi

666
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:07,030
Yaguchi

667
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,490
With this, if we exclude Matsuno's trap

668
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:07,030
Everyone
knows
about
this one

669
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,460
which everyone got right at the beginning, there are only 3 traps left

670
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,160
Kotohge doesn't have his traps anymore

671
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,870
But he wants to know where Miyazon's trap is

672
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:18,210
Miyazon

673
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:15,770
I can still get Miyazon's trap

674
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,940
But actually, that trap too

675
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,210
He knows where it is

676
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,780
Is controlled by Takashi, who got it at the beginning,
so it's actually 3 vs 0 traps

677
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,050
Kotohge's situation is tragic, but...

678
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:26,650
Kotohge's situation is desperate

679
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,980
What will happen?

680
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,990
Here

681
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,990
Oh, thank you

682
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,830
You poured that much?

683
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,930
You ever saw anyone drinking that much tea before?

684
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,460
You ever saw anyone drinking that much tea before?

685
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,060
You ever saw anyone drinking that much tea before?

686
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,500
Well, we moved a lot...

687
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,400
Now that it's 1 vs 1, there's not much action

688
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,840
It's hard to have some action now that they're only two

689
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,040
And so, this situation of stall goes on

690
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,470
What are they going to do?

691
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,340
What the? What if they don't do anything?

692
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,510
It's gonna get dark!

693
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,520
2:46 P.M. - 3 hours and 30 minutes since the game started

694
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,520
I have no clue where your traps are...

695
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,520
It's gonna take a while

696
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,880
They examine each other's movements

697
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,760
Exploring the field while checking each other out

698
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,020
While they go around to explore some more

699
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,520
But then...

700
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,090
I'm making a quick toilet break

701
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,560
Really, I gotta go

702
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:14,000
Kotohge moves towards the toilet

703
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,000
Kotohge is going where the toilet is

704
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,330
This is scary...

705
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,200
This place is fine, no wonder

706
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,600
This place is fine, no wonder

707
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,800
Yeah it's fine, thankfully

708
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,340
Yeah it's fine, thankfully

709
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,570
That one's out of order

710
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,670
Hey, you can't use that, it's out of order

711
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,810
- That's so suspicious
- Sounds fishy

712
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,080
Hey, you can't use that, it's out of order

713
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,110
But it says it's out of order...

714
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,220
Unbelievable!

715
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,620
He did it!

716
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,390
I see, so Takashi knew it...

717
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,360
Of course he did

718
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,230
Huh? Kotohge?

719
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,000
Huh? Kotohge?

720
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,770
No way!

721
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,530
I've waited all the time for you to pee!

722
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,640
I've waited all the time for you to pee!

723
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,170
That's why I poured you that much tea!

724
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,510
That's why I poured you that much tea!

725
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,210
Now I understand!

726
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,480
It makes sense

727
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,210
I told you we should get a break for that

728
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,980
Also, I'm the one who wrote "out of order"

729
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,410
Also, I'm the one who wrote "out of order"

730
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,080
Also, I'm the one who wrote "out of order"

731
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,080
Eh?! This guy...

732
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,550
I had no idea!

733
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,950
"Out of order"

734
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,190
I had no idea!

735
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,950
Are you kidding me?!

736
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,120
Honestly, I was ready to wait up to two hours

737
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,620
Honestly, I was ready to wait up to two hours

738
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,590
Honestly, I was ready to wait up to two hours

739
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,990
Man...

740
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,260
That's impressive...

741
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:22,530
Game over

742
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:22,530
Time: P.M. 2:53

743
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:22,530
Winner: Takashi

744
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,500
He's so sly!

745
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,230
Really

746
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,070
I see

747
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,970
And that was it

748
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,870
I still don't get what's the point of Nishimura

749
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,710
I still don't get what's the point of Nishimura

750
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,710
Really, what's his deal?

751
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,910
They said they could "use him somehow"

752
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,180
But he fell down so quickly, so...

753
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,380
Even the cameraman

754
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,550
Yeah, that's true

755
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,550
I've never seen someone from the staff falling down a booby-trap

756
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,550
Yeah, me neither

757
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,790
What do you think about it, YOU?
- Well...

758
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,190
After the first half, it kind of... well, sucked

759
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,190
After the first half, it kind of... well, sucked

760
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,900
After the first half, it kind of... well, sucked

761
00:20:51,900 --> 00:21:03,170

00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,940
He walked away quicker than I expected

764
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,770
He walked away quicker than I expected

765
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,770
Yeah, I thought he would have been slower
