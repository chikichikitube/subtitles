Gaki no Tsukai's dressing room

5
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,150
I have a bad feeling about this

6
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,850
You do?

7
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,450
Yeah, like...

8
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,450
Like, you just feel it? A premonition?

9
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,550
Downtown

Yamazaki Hosei

12
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,320
Yeah, just a feeling

13
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,320
I see, I see...

14
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,160

17
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,520
As if someones's about to come here

18
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,130
Yeah that...   I guess there's no doubt it's going to happen

22
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,790
You can easily guess it by looking at us right now

23
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,130
Exactly, I can tell!

24
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,800
I feel like Gaki's gradually becoming easy to foresee!

25
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,370
It is!

26
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,270
'Morning  See? He came

Downtown Manager

Oda Naoya

29
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,070
Just as we thought

30
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,900
We already felt like someone was about to come here

31
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,470
Right

32
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,810
So we kinda expected you to come

33
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,740
Uhm... This is a gain from our Matsumoto, you know, for everyone

34
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,780
"Our Matsumoto"

35
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,010
He kind of is

36
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,080
"Everyone"?

37
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,250
Do I have to read it?

38
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,120
Yeah

39
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,760
"The sexual performances of you scumbags can't even amount to 30"

40
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,930
"Such comedians with such a tiny weiner"

41
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,830
"Can't even imagine to take a woman to ecstasy,

42
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,830
* Matsumoto wrote the final section in a archaic-sounding fashion,

43
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,400
What the hell?

44
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,840
It came out, that style

45
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,410
"So I, the sex emperor, a true technician..."

46
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,410
* Pun between "sei-naru" [聖なる,"holy"] and "sei-naru"[性なる,"sex","sexual"]

47
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:08,880
"Shall make clear once more who's the best-willy-billy between you"

48
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,250
"Come forth towards the places signeth on the map"

49
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,250
* Again, messed up archaic forms. Also, there's Matsumoto Hitoshi's sign at the end of the letter

50
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,450
There's a map drawn in here

51
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,390
What the hell is this?

52
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,320
Let's see...

53
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,190
* On the map, from bottom to top: "shop Mizutani Yutaka
goes often to", "shop Nishida Hikaru goes often to", "here".
Nishida Hikaru is a J-pop singer and actress, Mizutani Yutaka is an actor.

54
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,190
It's right after the "shop Nishida Hikaru goes often"

55
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,460
Where is it?!

56
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,030
As if someone could know all of this!

57
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,030
How can we tell its distance?

58
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,130
Does anyone know those places?

59
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,070
I'm not searching for this

60
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,470
It's impossible for us today

61
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:34,840
Yeah but

62
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,110
Our Matsudok... he's waiting for you guys

63
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,470
Eh?!

64
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,370
He just stuttered!

65
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,480
You straight up stuttered! " Our Matsuko", what was that?

66
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,590
Bra hooks unhook challenge

67
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,980
So fast!!

68
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,180
Here's the technician challenge! Matsumoto already had 4 of those previously

69
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,960
Nipple fondling match

70
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,190
Its aim is to question the authenticity of one's manliness as a man

71
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,330
Panties removal championship

72
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,230
And so, several furious and incandescent challenges were unleashed!

73
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,900
Speed Kiss Match

74
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,760
What will we see on today's challenge?

75
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,000
Enough...

76
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,900
We're doing this here!?

77
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,500
Just down there

78
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,270
Yeah, after all

79
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,170
Hey!

80
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,280
Hey!

81
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,580
Downtown

82
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,580
Matsumoto Hitoshi

83
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,540
He was waiting for us

84
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,010
He's there

85
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,340
'Mornin-

86
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,210
You could tell it was me?

87
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,810
We got that immediately

88
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,950
We were brought here

89
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,080
What is that?

90
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,690
What?

91
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,690
Me?

92
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,860
It was you who called us here!

93
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,690
You just call us here and now you'r-

94
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,820
Anyways!

95
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,220
Yessir

96
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,460
The reason why I summoned you here is

97
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:31,900
Mhh...

98
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,900
You know, right here we also have guys who divorced...

99
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,500
Right?

100
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,200
I mean, those who can't even satisfy their own wife

101
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,800
He keeps on telling us the same thing every time

102
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,800
Just what have you been doing?!

103
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,070
You know, that guy over there, the last one

104
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,140
Fujiwara

105
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,740
Come on,

106
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,640
You've been cheating your girlfriend for quite a while now

107
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,180
God, you're just hopeless

108
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,010
He did it again?

109
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,850
"Again"?

110
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,910
E? " Again?!

111
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,520
It's a thing from the past

112
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,620
If there was an "again" to this story, I think
that's something I'm discovering only right now

113
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,520
Why does Matsumoto-san know all of this?

114
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,690
Whatever you're just...

115
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,990
In short..!

116
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,620
Yeah?

117
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,990
I've been thinking that maybe you guys don't
know anything about how to use your hips

118
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,000
I thought that by moving them at high speed...

119
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,100
You can manage to satisfy a woman someway or another

120
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,140
Yeah...

121
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,370
Well even if I said so...

122
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,440
* As you may know, Speedo is a famous trademark for professional swimmers' swimsuits

123
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,440
You are not allowed to put a swimsuit produced
by the Speedo company around your d*ck

124
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,510
I don't get it...

125
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,510
Don't worry, just ignore what he says - Ok

126
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,180
I think that's what he means

127
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,790
What?

128
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:28,790
Me?

129
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,950
Enough with this bullshit already!

130
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,790
The hell is that supposed to mean!

131
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,790
Excuse me, can you be clearer if you please

132
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,790
If you please

133
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,890
Anyway!

134
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,030
That's how I came up with this system for today

135
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,900
We don't really car-

136
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,800
Let the curtains down!

137
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,210
Woah! Amazing!

138
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,210
In short..!

139
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:49,670
Uh...

140
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,540
That's what we'll use to make your hips move!

141
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,110
Ascension! Hip-shaking Match!!

142
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:04,720
Compete by promptly send the inside pipe higher

143
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:04,720
Equip the belt of the machine and send out air by shaking your hips

144
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:04,720
In a set amount of time until it reaches the doll on the top

145
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:04,720
Rules

146
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,090
The point is to shake your hips with all your love!

147
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,630
The one getting the right speed and pouring his soul on his hips will win the challenge!

148
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,630
Just listen carefully, everybody

149
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,060
When you move your hips back and forth

150
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,130
Please do not do it by laying your hands over here

151
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,200
Oh,I see. Yeah, yeah.

152
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,570
Because if you do so

153
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,200
The audience ratings will drop

154
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,710
No good
I see... - We have to be careful then

155
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,080
So you can just use this to avoid placing your hands over here

156
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,680
Rules

157
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,680
The match will be done while holding maracas

158
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,880
So that's why those were there

159
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,080
Yeah, but even if we hadn't these we would have find a way to have them anyways

160
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,320
Guess you're right

161
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,250
Wouldn't it be better if we quit this?

162
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,490
Of course a harsh batsu-game has been
prepared for the one who'll lose this match

163
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,960
If you lose, you'll face a batsu-game!

164
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,460
Enough with these batsu-games...

165
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,330
Can we practice with this thing first?

166
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,030
No training allowed!

167
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,830
Eeeeh?! - So we have one shot...

168
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,500
Aren't we having a test round?

169
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,830
By the way we had out AD manager, that... uhh... who was him again?

170
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,070
Is it #@"%$/&=-san?

171
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:57,240
* I don't know what's the censoring beep for

172
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,770
Who's @"$!#¨&]?

173
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,240
[censor beeps festival]

174
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,780
Tetsuo

175
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,310
He's our Johnny Depp

176
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,450
Or maybe our Jack Bauer

177
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,520
It took him around... 30 to 40 seconds to clear it

178
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,420
Eh!? It takes THAT long?

179
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,660
I said "Jack Bauer" but I meant to say "Jack Sparrow"

180
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,640
Come on, hurry up and take turns

181
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Come on Endo, you go first

182
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,340
Should I go first?

183
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,840
Yeah...

184
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,940
You guys should look carefully at the first one...

185
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,210
So we could learn from him?

186
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,810
This thing of me being first one is getting old

187
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,890
Our first challenger is our usual Endo

188
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,850
What will his true strength be!?

189
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,520
Ok, so, just take a look on what  this all is about

190
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,760
Right, right

191
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,790
Producer Nakamura

192
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,790
Starter

193
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,460
Are you ok Endo?

194
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,130
I'm good

195
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,060
All right, then Endo, give it a try!

196
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,400
Endo's challenge

197
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,730
Endo's challenge

198
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,060
Endo's challenge

199
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,870
Endo's challenge

200
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,530
Ready...

201
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:17,860
Ehh?! - What?!

202
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,740
That's bullshit! - Not going that well

203
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,210
No progress so far

204
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,910
Wait, what the hell?!

205
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,880
Nothing's happening

206
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,880
Stronger, stronger! - Wait a minute!

207
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,320
Ah! - It's rising!

208
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,320
That's absolutely AMAZING!

209
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,890
Woah!

210
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,690
So how was I?

211
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,390
How was-- eh?!

212
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,830
You know it kind of... it stored up heat up to a certain degree

213
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,530
What do you mean?

214
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,900
Yes? - Oh, and it went up all at once

215
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,130
Yeah, it went up all at once just now

216
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,870
Is that what happened?

217
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,300
I see, I see

218
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,170
I think it changes from person to person

219
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,270
Oh, I got it!

220
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,170
So, how did the first one score went?

221
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,840
Let's find it out

222
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,570
Here!

223
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,410
Woah! - WOW!!

224
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,250
Pretty fast, huh! - Yeah, he was fast - I think that too

225
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:49,320
ENDO'S RECORD

226
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:49,320
SEC.

227
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,250
Our staff's record was around 40 seconds - Yeah, he's right

228
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,120
So you have to do it lots of times to get it higher - That's the point

229
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,990
But really, with 23 seconds...

230
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,190
We're all about to fall miserably, right?

231
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,660
Tha`s because we had Endo going first, he made a nice show

232
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,000
So next up we'll have our catcher mitt going next

233
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,270
* The first one going to have a challenge is called "top batter". "catcher mitt" is a joke on this saying.

234
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,270
Wait wh-- Oh, it's Hamada-san

235
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,070
Am I doing this?

236
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,980
Hamada, a sadistic man

237
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,980
Will he show us a proper hip-shaking?

238
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,980
Is everything alright?

239
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,680
Yeah...

240
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,780
Ok, with that being said, it's Hamada's turn!

241
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,320
Ready...

242
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,820
Let's go!

243
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,490
Hamada's challenge

244
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:23,820
Hamada's challenge

245
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,160
Hamada's challenge

246
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,060
Hamada's challenge

247
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,490
Ready...

248
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,170
See? - Look at him!

249
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:41,610
See? It got up! - It is!

250
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,910
It's falling! - Watch out!

251
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,240
It's friggin' exhausting

252
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,350
Hamada is exhausted!

253
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,420
Oh! Here it goes!

254
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,220
I think I'm dying!

255
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,220
Do you want to get your batsu-game, Hamada-san?

256
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,220
That's no good! No good at all!

257
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,220
This is really exhausting!

258
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,020
Okay, it got to the top!

259
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,700
I think he was pretty fast

260
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,100
Eh? Wasn't that long? - I don't really think so

261
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,870
So, for how much did he...?

262
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,370
It's hella tiring

263
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,410
23 sec.

264
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,410
BEST RECORD

265
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,410

For now I think we're actually doing well

269
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,870
Yeah but it's risky - He took a risk

270
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,840
Here's his timing!

271
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,510
Wow, 30 seconds! - So it took me 30 seconds, uh

Just 30 seconds...

275
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,710
I think it differs from our difference experiences

276
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,210
Yeah - I think he's right

277
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,080
I mean, like the way you look at this

278
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,550
After 30 times it starter to get higher faster

279
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,420
Oh, I've scored better than him!

280
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,790
Yeah

281
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,120
I couldn't understand why, I was shaking my hips all the time

282
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,620
Yeah, you just don't know why (it doesn't go higher)

283
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,060
Yeah, no idea

284
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,960
Inomoto, the youngest of the group

285
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,960
Are his hips ready for this challenge?

286
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,160
Don't we just have before our eyes the fastest hips-shaker?

287
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,970
Ok, Inomoto!

288
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,330
Yes!

289
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,470
Give it a shot!

290
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,740
Inomoto's challenge

291
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,070

Inomoto's challenge

294
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,040
Ready...

295
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,440
Woah! - He's fast!

296
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,510
It gets hard from this point on

297
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,650
Oh, it's going down

298
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,320
This segment is the worst, you just have to overcome it

299
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,090
Yeah

300
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,220
He's right

301
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,460
You just have to go through this

302
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,160
You're failing us, Inomoto!

303
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,330
Maybe it's better if you move faster

304
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,400
That way you pump much more air

305
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,840
Woah, back to the start!

306
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,340
Not a single inch!

307
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,170
It's not getting higher at all!

308
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,540
This might be impossible giving how much he's moving...

309
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,210
Oh, he's going!

310
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,280
Oh, here it is! Go go go go go!

311
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,350
Almost there!

312
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,890
He endured pretty well I must say, that alone deserves praise

313
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,690
That was harsh!!

314
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,990
Another important thing is the space of each movement

315
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:47,830
23 sec.

316
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:47,830

My body lower half is aching

324
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,090
Yeah but to be honest I think the timing was pretty bad for this one

325
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:44,860
Are you serious?!

326
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,600
I think he did pretty well, actually

327
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,000
Here's his record!

328
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,640
Woah! - Long! - No bad, not bad... - That's 'cause it moved only by the end

Oh yeah! - Oh shit!

333
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,380
Yessir!

334
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,980
Okay so, Fujiwara, your turn

335
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:58,980
Show us what you can do

336
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,680
Here comes our Fujiwara

337
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Here I come!

338
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,350
Our incredibly idiot Fujiwara

339
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,150
There!

340
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:10,090
Fujiwara, the idiot

341
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,780
Will Fujiwara's hips movements will be worthy of attention

342
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,090
Which type of hip-shaking will he show us?

343
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,090
Even though he's facing this challenge with pants, for some reason?

344
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Uhm, guys a minute, what I wanted to say is that the thing that's bugging me...

345
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,420
Yes?

346
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,890
Yes?

347
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,190
Is the fact that I find disturbing how almost no one's shaking the maracas at all

348
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,590
Ah... - Well, he's right

349
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,970
If you don't shake your maracas more, you won't make your woman satisfied at all

350
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,200
I understand

351
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,430
Wouldn't she be just bad about it?

352
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,170
Ok, Fujiwara...

353
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:23,800
Come on!

354
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,430
It's your turn!

Go!

362
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,540
Yeah yeah, like this!

363
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,710
That's the right speed!

364
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,380
That's it!

365
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,580
That's the right way!

00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,380
He nailed it

367
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,050
He got this

368
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,420
It gets hard from now on!

369
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,150
He's not shaking them (the maracas) at all

370
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,560
Just a bit more! Come on!

371
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,890
Come on, almost there!

372
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,900
He was fast!

373
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,270
What was that?! You were amazing!

374
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,300
That was flawless

375
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,330
Incredible

376
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,370
You were moving so lightly!

377
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,700
That's the right spot, just right there

378
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,170
Oh I see

379
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,570
There's no need to go that behind

380
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,710
Oh I see! - So that's it

381
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,470
Just doing this, really

382
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,710
So you made short movements

383
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,110
Precisely

384
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,310
Now I see...

385
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,780
He managed to complete it with it

386
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:12,350
23 sec.

387
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:12,350

I think he may surpassed Endo in terms of speed?

396
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,710
I think so - He was fast!

397
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,880
This is a new record - Yeah - I'm sure of it - Right?

398
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,380
Here's his record! - Yes

399
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,890
Oh yeah!

400
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,250

Ok, so...

419
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,060
Our lil' champion Yama-chan

420
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,500
Yeah!

421
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,300
Oh! - Are you going?

422
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,560
Alright, alright

423
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,730
I got this

424
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:35,740
Yamazaki seems to have grasped something

425
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,740
But how will his outcome be!?

426
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,770
You have like a timing you're aiming for or something like that?

427
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,010
Yeah actually for this

428
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,010
I just saw how Fukiwara was doing...

429
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,240
Yes?

430
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,680
I think I can go around 10 seconds too

431
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,650
For real? - Yeah

432
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,250
That's impossible, no doubt about it

433
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,580
Okay Yamazaki, are you ready?

434
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:47,920
Ready

435
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,820
Then let's go!

436
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,050
Yamazaki's challenge

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,390

440
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,620
Ready...

441
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,230
Why did it immediately lift?

442
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,470
It didn't before

443
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,770
He's fast

444
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,470
It stopped!

445
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,700
It has stopped

446
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,340
He's not shaking his hips at all!

447
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,610
Not a single movement!

448
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,580
That's why it stopped

449
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,180
Come on, shake them! - Thrust them more!

450
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,550
You have to pile up more heat!

451
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,380
You're about to lose!

452
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,190
Don't give up! - It went all the way down!

453
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,690
Put your hands up! Shake the maracas!

454
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,330
Didn't help at all!

455
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,490
What?!

456
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,830
He was doing so well

457
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,430
Yama-chan!

458
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,670
Get it higher! - That's impossible

459
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,170
Yama-chan, higher, higher!

460
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,540
The maracas! - Maracas!

461
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,380
This is bad

462
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,980
Yama-chan! Come on!

463
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,850
It's all in the maracas! Shake them properly

464
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,650
Yama-chan!

465
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,650
Maracas!

466
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,650
It's falling down, it's falling down

467
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,060
He made it!!

468
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,060
That was bad

469
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,460
It took him way too much time

470
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,630
There's no way this is going to be good

471
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,500
That was miserable

472
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,570
I'm safe, right?

473
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,070
I think there's the possibility he went over a minute

474
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,570
It felt like a difficult delivery

475
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,440
Why did it stop?

476
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,740
Well it's that - It wasn't enough

477
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,710
You took away too many breaks

478
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,950
That's where it fell down all at once

479
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,480
Why

480
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,450
His face became really something terrific

481
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,090
* "Kaigen" is a brand of medicines against cold

482
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,090
It became just like the old guy drawn on "Kaigen!

483
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,690
Yeah he was frightening

484
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,590
His face was really scary

485
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,160
Here's his record!

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,590

487
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,760

He's holding a record

511
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,610

By the way, huh...

513
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,880
We had Tanaka's manager check the location of the batsu game

514
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,710
Ahead of time?

515
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,380
Before even attempting

516
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:04,390
Tanaka, the man who lost 3 of 4 matches

517
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,390
Will he be able to redeem himself!?

518
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,190
come on Tanaka, I'm counting on you! Please lose!

519
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,490
I'm sorry, not this time Zaki-san

520
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,360
Come on, I don't want to be the last

521
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,930
Also I've already said this countless times

522
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,000
The fact you all are not shaking the maracas...

523
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,000
Got it

524
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,030
Is extremely unpleasant

525
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,530
Actually if you start shaking them

526
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,000
You'll lose like, 20 seconds

527
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,340
What the hell?

528
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,340

535
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,750
What? That-- - That's not going so well, isn't it?

536
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,820
What is he doing?

537
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,690
This is awful

538
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,360
Shake your hips more! Your hips!

539
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Come on!

540
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,360
This is bad... - Just like Yamazaki

541
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,930
But look, it's getting higher!

542
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,030
He's not shaking the maracas at all!

543
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,400
He's doing it even with his head!

544
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,800
Shake those hips!

545
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,470
His head might fall off

546
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,140
Well, at least he can shake the maracas properly

547
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,140
Back from the start again

548
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,940
Shake them more!

549
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,910
Maracas! More!

550
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,080
Tanaka!

551
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,380
Tanaka!!

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,380
Tanaka, man, for real...

553
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,720
It's back

554
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,090
Tanaka!!!

555
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,990
Tanaka!

556
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,560
Tanaka-san!

557
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,860
Oh, here it comes! It's going, it's going!

558
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,930
Shake the marac-

559
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,510
He surely shook the maracas

560
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,840
You made it

561
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,710
Dude

562
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,350
In the end the air piled up and it wen all the way up at on

563
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:38,950
It skyrocketed

564
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,980
How was it?

565
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,450
Was it hard?

566
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,220
You were too delicate

567
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,420
Is my score worse than Yamazaki's?

568
00:15:45,620 --> 00:16:00,240

It'll be a great match

583
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,360
This one really is an epic fight, isn't it?

584
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,060
For real

585
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,900
His way of shaking his hips was really horrible at the beginning, wasn't it?

586
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,730
Yeah, it was awful

587
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,700
Skon sko-kon sko-kon sko-kon sko-kon

588
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,500
All the others went like PAM PAM PAM PAM PAM

589
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,940
Yeah but I shook the maracas a lot, right?

590
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,540
You were like a chihuahua, a chihuahua I say

591
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,850
WE'LL SEE TANAKA'S RECORD LATER!

592
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,080
Before getting to see Tanaka's score, who's facing the risk of getting the batsu-game...

593
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,520
IT'S THE TURN OF OURS STAR MATSUMOTO!

594
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,250
Our star Matsumoto will finally join the challenge!

595
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:19,520
Matsumoto, the sex emperor

596
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,520
Let's take a look at his true power!

597
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,260
I'll warn you, it takes a lot of time

598
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,160
Yeah but really...

599
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,430
Don't worry about it, the meal I had before was balanced enough for this

600
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,400
You had a meal before this?

601
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,500
I had my dose of unmilled rice today

602
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,300
'cause I'm having unmilled rice for this whole week

603
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,370
The whole week?!

604
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,870
Matsumoto-san...

605
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,640
If you please

606
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,340
Let's go!

607
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:34,670
Matsumoto's challenge

608
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,010
Matsumoto's challenge

609
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,340
Matsumoto's challenge

610
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,140
Matsumoto's challenge

611
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,780
Ready...

612
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,980
* We just saw this before, therefore no subs

613
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:47,980
Oh!

614
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,720
The maracas, Matsumoto-san

615
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,420
You're not shaking them at all!!

616
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,520
The maracas, you're not s-

617
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,290
He got stuck!

618
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,360
Not moving!

619
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,730
His shoes slipped away! The shoes slipped away!

620
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,830
It's not helping at all!

621
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,500
This is bad, bad, bad!

622
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,770
This is bad, it's going so bad!

623
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,770
The maracas! The maracas! The maracas!

624
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,300
The maracas!

625
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,310
You're not shaking them at all!

626
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,140
He's in real danger!

627
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,480
This is not going to turn out good!

628
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,650
Something's wrong, something's wrong

629
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,880
This is wrong, so wrong!

630
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,150
I'm telling you that's not how it is!

631
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,350
This is wrong!!

632
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,760
This is bad!

633
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,930
That's impossible

634
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,590
Hey!!

635
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm telling you, something's wrong

636
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,800
Something's wrong

637
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,400
Come on let's go

638
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,960
What the hell, it's not moving!

639
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,100
Not a single inch

640
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,370
Matsumoto-san!

641
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,540
It stored up energy!

642
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,910
Look, his making a face just like Kaigen's!

643
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,180
He's the real Kaigen!

644
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,910
He became Kaigen

645
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,480
Almost there!

646
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,880
You're almost done

647
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,880
This is wrong, something's wrong

648
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,550
I think by now it's one of you three guys

649
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,350
That was deluding

650
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,920
THAT'S NOT HOW THINGS WERE SUPPOSED TO GO!

651
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,850
GIMME A BREAK!

652
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,490
This is so wrong

653
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,520
What is "wrong"?

654
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,220
The shoes, my shoes!

655
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,430
Well the shoes were

656
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,030
They slipped away because of my socks and I couldn't move back and forth at all!

657
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,300
That's a bit...

658
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,530
I did it without my shoes too, you know

659
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:07,930
He's right

660
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,100
Yeah, he's right

661
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,870
Fujiwara too wasn't wearing them

662
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,730
I'm dead tired

663
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,510
I think it's about time we...

664
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,670
With this I think now it's all about the three of you

665
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,340
Yeah you three guys! (Yamazaki, Tanaka & Matsumoo)

666
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,410
That's a really difficult situation

667
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:27,820
WHO`LL FACE THE BATSU GAME!

668
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,350
Surprisingly Matsumoto too is now part of a may-get-the-batsu-game triangle

669
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,350
What will the record of the remaining two members be?

(Staff) - From Matsumoto-san

675
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,880
Ok, got it

676
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,650
From Matsumoto-san?

677
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,820
Yeah, let's take a look...

678
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,820
Matsumoto-san's score is...  - Come on, this is so irritating

679
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,550
This!

680
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,720

I did it!

685
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,290
With a 2 seconds difference! - Still, it took you one minute...

686
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,490
That was risky!

687
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,230
You barely made it

688
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,090
The risk wa--

689
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,700
I barely friggin' made it!

690
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,570

This may be his special ability

710
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,470
Must be it

711
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,100
That's not a talent at all

712
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,810
Even if you say so... - So,

713
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,910
Finally we'll get to see Tanaka Naoki

714
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,470
So...

715
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,510
Alright, how about we hide the seconds displaying section?

716
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,880
Should we hide it? - Oh, I see

717
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,650
I think it'll be fine even if we cover it up until  1 minute and 0 decimal seconds

718
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,310
Yeah that's it

719
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,290
Ok so, let's reveal Tanaka's score timing, please!

720
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,920
Is this part ok?

721
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,490
Should we see the last one first?

722
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,460
Oh, the last one?

723
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,990
But if we see the last one we'll get it immediately - He's right

724
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,990
Show the minutes first - It's surely 1minute, so...

725
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,390
Okay, 1 minute - Oh, there it is

726
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,030
So it was it

727
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,160
Let's check if it's 1 minute and 0-something seconds - Yeah, let's

728
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,630
We just saw the 1, let's move on

729
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,030
This will be fine, it's surely a 0

730
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,740
Here I go

731
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,740
It's a zero!

732
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,640
There it is!

733
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
If now comes a 2 you're good

734
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,110
How is this going to end?

745
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,860

Just one second! - The hell, man! Only  1 second difference

768
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,800
So, what's the batsu-game for this challenge, Matsumoto-san?

769
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,800
Eehh, this time's batsu-game will be... - Yes?

770
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,970
The street corner hip-shaking punishment!

771
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:06,110
STREET CORNER HIP-SHAKING PUNISHMENT!!

772
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,810
I wonder what is it about?

773
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,440
It'll basically be like what we just did, but around public street corners

774
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:06,840
I see

775
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,840
You went to a lot of street corners, didn't you?

776
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,180
Yeah...

777
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,710
We'll have you dance in those

778
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,420
That's a pretty harsh punishment...

779
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,720
I see but... - Mmh?

780
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,750
Can we please stop this series? Please?

781
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,290
Is it okay to cancel it?

782
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,470
AFTER THIS...

783
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,470
TANAKA WILL FACE HIP-SHAKING STREET CORNER!

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,260
I'm here in Yuurakuchou

790
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,300
Uhh...

791
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,060
And this is my batsu-game

792
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,600
Why do I have to undergo this batsu-game, you ask...

793
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,270
I don't really know very well myself

794
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,010
But I can say for sure I'm full of feelings of shame for my wife

795
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,710
I'm going!

796
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:00,440

806
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,400
May we have your autograph?

807
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
Sure

808
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,110
Can you hold onto this please?

809
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,110
Done

810
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,550
Thanks a lot - No problem

811
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,910
Good luck for this! - Good luck!

812
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,680
Thanks

813
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,330
I think this one

814
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,930
May be the most exhausting

815
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,300
Among all the batsu game I faced

816
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,770
Finish

817
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,650
After the stage recording

818
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,650
was over

819
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,040
The performers and staff went back to the waiting room

820
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,820
The staff and performers go back to the waiting

821
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,950
However...

822
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,920
WHEN NO ONE WAS THERE THAT MAN CAME TO THE STAGE!?

823
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,720
A single man came on the stage everyone has left...!
