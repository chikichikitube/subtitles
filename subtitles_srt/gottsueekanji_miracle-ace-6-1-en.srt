00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,130
Not Yet

3
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,620
Mister

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,170
I'm returning this!

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,600
Why are you mad?

6
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,950
I don't need this!

7
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,150
What do you mean?

8
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,800
I had to pay for this!

9
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,650
What?

10
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,000
This thing doesn't even work!

11
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,620
Well... I...

12
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,800
Give me a break!

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,100
I didn't say that it would work perfectly

14
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,270
That's dirty!

15
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,900
I said "maybe"

16
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,650
Give me back my money!

17
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,470
What?
- Return my money!

18
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,120
I can't return your money, because...

19
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,620
it already went to charity

20
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,800
You liar!

21
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,720
Today, I have something...

22
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,150
Never mind!

23
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,600
Really, today I have something that every one wants!

24
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,370
I saved it specially for you!

25
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,350
I save it!

26
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,170
There's only this one!

27
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,750
I can't believe you

28
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,750
Really, and it's cheap

29
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:52,950
How much?

30
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:53,670
$50

31
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,320
Hmm, $50

32
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,350
I'm not lying

33
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,050
$50 and absolutely I won't get bullied, right?

34
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,120
That's correct!

35
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,550
See, today I didn't hesitate to say it would work

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,620
$50

37
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,470
You carry a lot of cash huh?

38
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,200
Well, actually

39
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,520
today...

40
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,270
"Miracle Camouflage Paper"

41
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,820
This is $50?

42
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,670
Of course! It will stop the bullying

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,450
This is $50?

44
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,570
When you wear this mask, you will blend into the pillar

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
No one will see you

46
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,200
If they can't see you, they can't bully you!

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,220
Even the bully can't punch the pillar

48
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,070
Well, that's true

49
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,520
Keep it, and everything will be fine

50
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,820
Really??

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,650
I really don't have any confidence in this...

52
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,750
You don't, right?

53
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,850
This mask should work, BUT just in case...

54
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,270
$80

55
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,020
What?

56
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,720
$80

57
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,100
For what?

58
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,620
$100

59
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,850
What??

60
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,550
Why did the price go up?

61
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,270
What?

62
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,450
What did the price increase?

63
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,100
Well, you know how the currency fluctuates... like the dollar

64
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,300
Hurry, it's rising!

65
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,720
That's suspicious

66
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,850
Hurry up!

67
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,270
$100?
- $100

68
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,320
I'll be safe?

69
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,100
Yes

70
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,020
Hurry

71
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,870
You'll be safe, definitely

72
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,820
Here it is

73
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,450
This is the main item

74
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,950
This is the main item?

75
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,400
"Miracle Mole"

76
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,800
When you wear this

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
No one will know it's you

78
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,000
That can't work

79
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,350
Trust me

80
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,870
Just that one thing will work?

81
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,770
For example...here

82
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,650
Excuse me do you know Masao?

83
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,770
What are you saying?

84
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,950
What are you saying?

85
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,670
I'm Masao!

86
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,850
Wow!

87
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,300
You surprised me!

88
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,350
You hair looked longer!

89
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,850
Stop saying stupid things

90
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,420
Are you stupid?

91
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,500
With this you will be fine

92
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,850
Definitely fine

93
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,500
Ok?

94
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going

95
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,270
Really?

96
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,220

97
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,920

98
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,270
Bye!

99
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,900
Will it really be ok?

100
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,700
As always, thank you!

101
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,600
Hey, Masao what are you doing?

102
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,570

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,670
Masao!

105
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,550
It's Masao!

106
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,350
Please look closely, I'm not Masao

107
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,400
I have a mole!

108
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,820
No, look, look well

109
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,820

110
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,850

112
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,570
Masao!

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,900
Stop it!

114
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,400
You are Masao!

115
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,050
I have a mole...

116
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,700
So that was Miracle Ace!

117
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,950
He still a lot of secrets!

118
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,300
Please look, I'm not Masao!

119
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,300
To be continued
