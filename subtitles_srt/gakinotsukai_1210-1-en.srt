1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:09,980
TRANSLATED, TIMED AND TYPESETTED BY KAIZEN SUBS.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:09,980
The first edition of "I understand you the best, I think you like this kind of thing don't you?" competition! (Stuttering)

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,040
Don't look at me like that.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,960
Are you a bit tired?

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,050
I can't really tell.

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,140
What happened?

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,680
Nothing happened.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,970
Please tell us. You're Gaki no Tsukai's leader!

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,230
What happened?

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,610
I'm not tired!

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,250
(TL note: Matsumoto is referring to the news about Hamada's affair.)

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,250
You know, when Hamada was on Yahoo! news, at the same time Tanaka was on for finding a new species of bugs.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,010
Why are you so happy with your life!?

14
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,010
Why are you doing this!?

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,320
No one wants to know your story!

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,130
Really?

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,770
Really?

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,040
Yes, the new species...

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,350
Also, no one probably wanted to read it because it was taken down straight away.

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,450
Because of this, I apologize like Chage.

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,450
(TL note: Chage and Aska are a famous Japanese pop duo. Aska was caught for drug use and Chage apologized on his behalf.)

22
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,450
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,920
But you know, even though Aska stopped doing drugs, Hamada wont stop drinking.

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,980
Are you alright?

25
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,050
Please stop.

26
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,120
Are you sure we should be shopping for girl's items?

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,010
The shop assistants will think we're creepy and desperate.

28
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,640
Yeah, you're right.

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,960
So everyone, before we did this with Kimura Yuuichi.

30
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:33,720
Last time, we had Kimura Yuuichi in the "I think you like this the best" competition.

31
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,970
This is a segment where gaki members buy items for Kimura that they think he'll like.

32
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,640
And tonight the special guest is?

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,580
Today's guest, welcome!

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,700
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

35
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,330
You look a bit different today.

36
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,960
It's a tight look.

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,940
Oh I see.

38
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,640
I am very sorry for your loss.

39
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:13,570
Our first ever female guest is the single celebrity, Tomochika.

40
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:20,550
Today the five will present a top, a bottom and a personal item to her.

41
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,130
Can the five pick the right presents for her?

42
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,220
Before the shooting, the members hit the stores to shop.

43
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,240
Matsumoto went to Ginza to find bottomwear that he thinks Tomochika likes.

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,970
Well...

45
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,010
So something like this would be good right?

46
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,510
Nah, this can't be the one.

47
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,280
Not these ones right? Nah, these definitely aren't the ones.

48
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,090
I know the ones she wont wear.

49
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,790
But I don't know the ones that she'll want to wear.

50
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,110
Ah, not this.

51
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,990
Matsumoto struggles, choosing for a female guest.

52
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:07,800
Meanwhile, Tanaka was in Shibuya to look for a personal item.

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,760
Personal items are difficult to choose because there are so many variations.

54
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,130
Oh I see, I see. I can choose bags as well?

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,960
Tanaka has difficulty with choosing a personal item. But...

56
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,500
Oh? I see, I see, I see.

57
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,670
This is a bit different. Isn't this good?

58
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,570
Oh I found it!

59
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,810
Are you going with this?

60
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,560
Yeah I'll be going with this.

61
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,970
But there are so many.

62
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,170
Hosei, goes to a shopping mall in Koyosu.

63
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,980
She is forty years old so,

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,190
that means that she is usually a calm and relaxed person.

65
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh she usually wears these types of clothes.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,220
Ah, these sorts are summer bags.

67
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,400
Those flowers, I mean dried flowers.

68
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,200
You can put those in these bags and Tomochika could walk around with it often.

69
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,210
And Endo, for some reason goes to a city for young people, Harajuku.

70
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,610
I'm going to a place that I go to quite often.

71
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,990
Endo is going to a place that he knows quite well.

72
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,160
Excuse me.

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,850
Is it ok for us to film?

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,570
Yes it's ok.

75
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,230
Actually, I'm not here privately today.

76
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,930
You're serious about this right? You think Tomochika-san will like these?

77
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,710
I'm serious.

78
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,970
Hamada is off to Ginza to choose a top.

79
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,360
I have a bit of information and I have an idea of what to choose.

80
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,830
Really? What is it?

81
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,340
I can't say that.

82
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,990
I can't say it here.

83
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,500
This probably wont fit you Tomochika-san.

84
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,820
I have never seen her wear this type of clothing.

85
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,870
This is hard... Tomochika, or women in general are difficult.

86
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,910
This time as well, Tomochika will be able to take home the item that she likes the most.

87
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,710
As for the one rated last, the gaki member who chose the item will have to pay for it themselves.

88
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,760
What type of style do you like Tomochika-san?

89
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,710
For me, I don't really care about the design but more the material.

90
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,250
The material?

91
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,160
I never thought about the material.

92
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,080
And also colors. I like vitamin colors (vegetables/fruits)

93
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,990
I have no idea what that is.

94
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,950
I didn't even know that existed!

95
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,040
All I can think of is a pizza delivery boy.

96
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,000
With the red jumper?

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,110
First to present the top that he thought Tomochika would like, Tanaka.

98
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,640
Since I do work with Tomochika often, I recalled a bit of the past and thought "Ah this is it."

99
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,880
Do you see her often in her own clothes?

100
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,140
From time to time at work.

101
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,080
Yes, but I'm pretty sure you don't really remember.

102
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,380
Yes that's true. I don't really remember.

103
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,110
What? That doesn't make sense!

104
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,850
You're just following Tomochika's pace!

105
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,670
Also, I think Tomochika has absolutely no interest in Tanaka.

106
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,290
Actually, I really like Tanaka

107
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,930
Really?

108
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,220
Don't you get the feeling?

109
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,940
No I don't get the feeling.

110
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,730
I say it often.

111
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,960
What the hell is this conversation?

112
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,910
Out of all of us, do you like Tanaka the most?

113
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,900
Yes I do.

114
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,930
Really?!

115
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:41,470
I'm actually happy right now. Because of this, I really want her to choose my present.

116
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,770
It's a top.

117
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,990
Ah it's quite simple.

118
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,660
When I see Tomochika in TV,

119
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,650
No no no.

120
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,450
This is bad.

121
00:06:53,450 --> 00:07:01,040
She doesn't suit tight clothing. I've never seen her wear any tight clothes.

122
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Just look.

123
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,840
You could see what she thinks from her face.

124
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,150
No no no.

125
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,250
That shirt should be for Lioness Asuka!

126
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,150
Her training shirt!

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,440
Next up, Endo with a top he thinks Tomochika likes.

128
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,970
Is that a famous store?

129
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,380
It's called 'merci beaucoup.'

130
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,380
Oh it has vitamin color.

131
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,720
The color is good.

132
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,050
It's kind of playful and um, the material...

133
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,250
Show it to us!

134
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,120
Just show it to us!

135
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,710
Will she wear that sort of cardigan?

136
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,390
Isn't is big?

137
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,130
You're meant to wear it loosely.

138
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,440
It's not meant to be tight.

139
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,600
Girls are all about first impressions.

140
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,260
That looks terrible.

141
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,650
That's horrible.

142
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,280
It's huge!

143
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,840
It's too big right?

144
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,980
It's like this.

145
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,960
You look fatter.

146
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,320
I do right?

147
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,180
You look a bit like Hashida Sugako

148
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,200
Third up is Hosei, who has a special connection with Tomochika.

149
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,790
Tomochika and I are diet partners.

150
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,740
Oh yes.

151
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,360
Oh right, you guys did that TV commercial together.

152
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,320
That's a very good brand.

153
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,790
Yes it is.

154
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,290
Oh I like this place.

155
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,600
It;s from Burberry, Blue Label.

156
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,120
Ah, this feels really good.

157
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,880
The material is good.

158
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,030
The way it feels...

159
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,340
It feels really good and it only has two sizes.

160
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,730
No no no no.

161
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,760
This doesn't suit her.

162
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,280
Doesn't it look like something a grandma would wear?

163
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,400
That's not the true. Look at the stripes at the back, they're so nice.

164
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,530
Endo, your one is too big. The boobs are hanging out of the cardigan.

165
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,530
It's freaking gross!

166
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,400
This is disturbing.

167
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,120
It's too big!

168
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,350
The different designs on the front and the back is quite nice.

169
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,440
Oh, thank you.

170
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Next is Hamada who's got special information.

171
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,590
Mine is very simple.

172
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:34,320
I tried to go for her likes and interests.

173
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,320
That's no good.

174
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,270
Ah, no.

175
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,120
No no.

176
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,760
Ah, you're for real.

177
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,800
It's an animal design?

178
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,970
I heard that Tomochika-san likes animals.

179
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,970
Yes I do.

180
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,000
Who did you hear it from?

181
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,000
That's dirty!

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,230
It's a nude colour.

183
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,530
Isn't that a bit small?

184
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,510
It's pretty small.

185
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,740
From behind she looks naked.

186
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,850
Looking at her from behind she does look naked.

187
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,720
She's naked.

188
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,210
She ain't naked!

189
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,620
Why was Tomochika smacked?

190
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,630
Last up, Matsumoto.

191
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,960
I think she fits this type of clothing.

192
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,300
That doesn't matter.

193
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,860
It's up to her to decide.

194
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,680
She'll like this for sure.

195
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,860
You want to see me happy don't you?

196
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,200
See!

197
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,800
What the hell is that?

198
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,210
That's for grandmothers!

199
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,980
This is definitely Tomochika or something!

200
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,190
No this is horrible!

201
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,670
Isn't this Tomochika?

202
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,660
This is the worst!

203
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,280
She wouldn't wear that!

204
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,000
This is a tribal outfit right?

205
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,670
I think its good for you.

206
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,310
It suits you!

207
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,170
I don't think so.

208
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,990
It really suits her!

209
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,840
I said that isn't good.

210
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,050
I look a lot older.

211
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,900
Yes yes.

212
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,960
This is not good.

213
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,270
Seriously?

214
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,480
I saw you wearing this in my head.

215
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,990
It was either you or Itami Juzo.

216
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,890
Which one is Tomochika's favorite top?

217
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,240
First place is...

218
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,970
this one.

219
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,870
YESSSSSSSSSS!

220
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,970
Now, which one is the worst?

221
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,020
Last place is...

222
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,150
this one.

223
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,000
Are you serious?

224
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,300
I was a bit sad when I saw this.

225
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,640
Really?

226
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,230
What would you rate it out of a hundred?

227
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,960
I would rate it 0.

228
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,420
I didn't expect this!

229
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,600
Matsumoto has to pay for his present.

230
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,960
This looks so good.

231
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
That's for women that go to theaters.

232
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,780
That's true!

233
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:24,280
"I think you like this" competition! Now it's Endo with bottomwear he thinks Tomochika will like.

234
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,910
I really want you to wear this.

235
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,330
Ah that makes me really happy.

236
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,630
Really?

237
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,440
Can you open it please?

238
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,250
I think she suits shorts.

239
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,960
Her face!

240
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,250
Do you wear shorts?

241
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,480
No no no no.

242
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,780
I often wear it.

243
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:53,520
I just heard her whisper "Uwaa."

244
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,490
You did right?

245
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,500
Yes I did.

246
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,990
What were you thinking Endo?

247
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,250
The ribbon...

248
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,120
This has a ribbon.

249
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,180
I'm not sure about this string though. It might make an awkward shape around here.

250
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,030
Don't worry. The material is thin so it wont.

251
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Don't lie!

252
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,030
No since the material is thin...

253
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,640
Is this something you wear at the circus?

254
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,400
Next is Hamada's chosen item.

255
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,960
I think this will fit Tomochika.

256
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,000
Thank you very much.

257
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,200
Although, I haven't really seen Tomochika in casual clothes.

258
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,890
I see.

259
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,520
Oh I can see it.

260
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,630
Wait it has a top part?

261
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,480
I think it would have been better as a skirt.

262
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,160
No no no no.

263
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,470
It would have been better as a skirt!

264
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,960
It's completely fine right?

265
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,530
It's not too bad right?

266
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,270
Is it an apron?

267
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,890
It's an apron.

268
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,700
It isn't an apron!

269
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,900
Just put it on the mannequin and see.

270
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,910
The design looks nice though.

271
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,800
What is that?

272
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,370
This is bottomwear right?

273
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,360
Yeah I think so.

274
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,680
The breasts on the mannequin are amazing.

275
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,600
Are you supposed to wear this without anything underneath?

276
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,180
No no no.

277
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,460
Since it's summer you can just wear a shirt underneath.

278
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,260
What material is it made out of?

279
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,990
It's like the material you use for curtains.

280
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,620
Curtains?

281
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,690
That's awful.

282
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,160
It's an apron made out of curtains.

283
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,400
It's not an apron!

284
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,400
Next, Tanaka's turn to present his chosen item.

285
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,880
I tried to be a bit creative.

286
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,920
This is no good.

287
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,010
Her ass will stick out of it.

288
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,180
You'll see her ass!

289
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,480
It's too young for her.

290
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,000
It'll make you look thin.

291
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,620
Thin?

292
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,620
You can show your body off.

293
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,130
She doesn't seem that happy.

294
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,980
It isn't really creative.

295
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,940
Really?

296
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,620
She doesn't seem that happy.

297
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,060
This'll suit you for sure.

298
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,070
Next is Matsumoto. Can he redeem himself?

299
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,960
I got her something that's sort of something like the vitamin color she mentioned before.

300
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,150
It's a bit hard.

301
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,630
Hard?

302
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,120
It's hard! That looks so hard.

303
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
It has pineapples.

304
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,510
It doesn't look that different to mine.

305
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,640
It's similar to Hamada-san's.

306
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,180
They have the same feeling.

307
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,010
Yes.

308
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,230
That's a child's apron!

309
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,900
I thought it looked good.

310
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,690
This is amazing.

311
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,910
You're right.

312
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,730
I think it will be nice if it was a bag.

313
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,630
Oh for the summer time?

314
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,790
A bag to put your stuff in.

315
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,320
Are you Maezono-san?

316
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,310
It's just my fashion today. I'm not Maezono-san.

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,300
Lastly, Hosei who is trying to get first place again.

318
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,360
Where is that from?

319
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,970
(TL note: Hosei says Rirandotooruu instead of Rirandochuuru)

320
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,970
This is from Rirandtoore.

321
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,330
Is that even correct?

322
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,640
Her facial expression doesn't look good.

323
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,490
She's looking pretty dull.

324
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,280
It's a long type.

325
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,940
Isn't that for grannies?

326
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,070
It's good isn't it?

327
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,930
It's so good right? This is so good.

328
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,980
That's for women who go to theaters.

329
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,410
That's true!

330
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,820
The type that makes dinner early then leaves so she can go to a performance at the theater,

331
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,690
and then leaves a note saying "just heat this up."

332
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,980
It looks like a joke.

333
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,460
No no, this looks so good.

334
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,110
What's the design?

335
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,770
Flower... Pressed flowers?

336
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,980
Yes, it's a pressed flower pattern.

337
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,690
Not just flowers?

338
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,180
Yes, it's pressed flowers.

339
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,180
What will be Tomochika's favorite bottomwear?

340
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,960
Come on, come on.

341
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,540
Hamada-san's one.

342
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,570
YESSSSSS!

343
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,970
Of course it was mine!

344
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,680
Really?

345
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,370
Just out of these 5 right?

346
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,370
No actually, if a shop assistant showed me this I would have probably bought it.

347
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,380
Really?

348
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,210
Thank you very much.

349
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,890
What's so good about it?

350
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,220
Truthfully, I was hesistating between this and Matsumoto-san's.

351
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,360
See?

352
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,280
I knew she liked it.

353
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,090
That means you like those kind of patterns?

354
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:19,980
Yes I do.

355
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,690
I don't understand. I don't understand you.

356
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,100
He is so hyped up.

357
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,620
Don't get too ahead of yourself!

358
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,640
She hasn't announced last place yet!

359
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,970
Which one is the worst?

360
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,370
Endo!

361
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,100
Seriously?

362
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,100
I agree with this.

363
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,960
This is what homeless girls wear.

364
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,220
That's a hopeless homeless.

365
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,060
This means Endo has to pay for his item.

366
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,520
Lastly, a personal item. Starting from Hamada.

367
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,970
I think you can even use this in the summer. At times when it's slightly cold.

368
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,900
It's not a scarf, it's a shawl.

369
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,220
I thought it would be weird if there were animal patterns on this.

370
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,050
Yeah. Look at her face though.

371
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,280
Do I look older?

372
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,320
No I don't think so.

373
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,000
The design looks like it was a drawing by my toddler.

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,300
Is that even relevant?

375
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,600
Don't you feel younger?

376
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,800
Next is Tanaka, who chose an item perfect for summer.

377
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,380
Please open this.

378
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,910
I think this one is perfect.

379
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,130
They said I didn't go for it enough last time, but this time I did.

380
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,980
Did you become adventurous?

381
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,460
Yes.

382
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,680
like Uemura Naomi?

383
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,090
Yes, of course.

384
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,850
We don't need that.

385
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,560
I'm going to climb this mountain!

386
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,680
And coincidentally, when Hamada-san gave her the T-shirt,

387
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,200
she said she liked animal designs.

388
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,170
Firstly, a fan!

389
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,400
You honestly have no sense.
(TL note: This was a pun. Sensu - sense, sensuu - fan)

390
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,700
I know you want this! This is good!

391
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,340
So it's like, oh this fan actually has an animal design when you open it.

392
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,310
Yes that's right.

393
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,620
I don't really need this.

394
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,980
Yeah she doesn't need it.

395
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,410
Next is the personal item that Hosei chose.

396
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,060
This is for the upcoming season.

397
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,160
Is the personal item you chose that big?

398
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,050
It doesn't look that good.

399
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,220
Is the color a vitamin color?

400
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,970
The color is good.

401
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,250
Yes, this'll fit with anything.

402
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,850
Nah... It's a bit wrong.

403
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,610
I think it goes well with Hamada-san's gift.

404
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,340
I don't think so.

405
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,980
Yeah maybe not.

406
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:07,000
Next is Endo. Can he avoid paying twice in a row?

407
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,540
Please open this.

408
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
The brand is called "6% DOKIDOKI."

409
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,920
It has a style similar to things like Kyary Pamyu Pamyu.

410
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,600
That type of style is too young for her.

411
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,890
So it's a unique shop?

412
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,020
It's quite adjustable.

413
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,140
That is horrible!

414
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,980
Stop freaking messing around!

415
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,480
Is that a party prop?

416
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,060
No not at all!

417
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,810
It looks like 'Mr. Okure.'

418
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,880
No that isn't right.

419
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,790
It is Okure-san.

420
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,620
You can put it on your hair.

421
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,300
Ah I see...

422
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,780
Endo, I really hate this.

423
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,850
For example, wearing it on your hair like this.

424
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,700
You made these girls over there laugh the most out of all of us!

425
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,420
The teens are laughing.

426
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,860
They're laughing the most!

427
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,250
"I think you like this kind of thing" competition! Matsumoto's chosen personal item is?

428
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,260
If you can I'd like you to try it on and show us.

429
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,460
Wait are there snacks in here?

430
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,800
No way!

431
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,560
When I saw this, I was pretty sure that you wore this sort of style.

432
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,140
Really?

433
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,930
Seriously?

434
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,210
Underwear?

435
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:25,940
Underwear?

436
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,340
That's so weird.

437
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,380
You just made me wonder what she would look like in those.

438
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,300
Don't you think she would wear this?

439
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,400
Will she wear that?

440
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,320
It doesn't give an erotic vibe.

441
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,780
Tomochika, do you have similar underwear to this?

442
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,450
Yes I do.

443
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,690
She definitely has it!

444
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,980
It's a very nice color.

445
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,580
Wait do you mean it's a bit erotic?

446
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,770
No, what I'm saying is are the panties meant to be that big?

447
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,490
Isn't it too big?

448
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,260
It's the big type.

449
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,960
Look at her putting it on casually.

450
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,250
But doesn't it look like Tomochika?

451
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:09,810
I'm bad with g-strings, so I like this.

452
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,960
I understand that.

453
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,560
I don't think she dislikes it.

454
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,820
Without any hesitation she just started trying it on.

455
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,960
Yeah I just started wearing it on my own.

456
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,970
Just which one is Tomochika's favorite item?

457
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,250
The best is...

458
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,330
this one.

459
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,240
YESSSSSSS!

460
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,010
I knew it!

461
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,130
I really like this.

462
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,420
Wear it straight away!

463
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,460
I will wear it after.

464
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,930
I can just imagine her wearing just that at home.

465
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,640
So you bought this right?

466
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,960
No I didn't because I thought it'd be weird. So I got my junior Onigiri to buy it for me.

467
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,560
Won't it be scary if some random dude over 2 meters tall came in and bought this?

468
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,390
And now for the worst item...

469
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,420
Last place is...

470
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,130
this one.

471
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,980
That saved me.

472
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,410
Again, Endo has to pay for his item.

473
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,290
Overall, how was it today?

474
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:24,530
I was expecting someone to push me to choose their items but no one did.

475
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,640
Wait there was someone!

476
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,970
There was? Who?

477
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,170
It's there! I wanted you to wear that!

478
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,500
It's our first female guest, so I think it was a bit difficult to choose today.

479
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,970
Well next time I see Matsumoto-san I'll wear this underwear.

480
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,240
So you can thank him right?

481
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,740
This is so embarrassing.

482
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,740
