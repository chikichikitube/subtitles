1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,430
Hamada's Holiday in Thailand.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,880
These six comedians
have researched about Pattaya...

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,360
...to pitch fun activities to Hamada.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,030
Inomoto's choice, ranked sixth by Hamada was...

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,260
Pattaya's popular attraction,
the floating market.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,230
The canals are the roads.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,130
It feels very Thai.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,060
This is great.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,700
Greetings.

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,550
This is relaxing.

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,000
-We have a local on board.
-Really?

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,600
Shall we get a drink?

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,820
Good idea.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,550
I wish they sold drinks here.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,300
That place looks good.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,550
-Where?
-To the right.

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,150
Tapioca drinks.

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,050
You like tapioca, Hamada?

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,280
No I don't!

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,580
-Tapioca suits the tropics.
-It doesn't.

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,530
Let's drink some.

22
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,250
-Let's go for tapioca.
-Okay.

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,030
He's taking us there.

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,830
Let's go there.

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,530
Since we are here...

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,100
We'll get tapioca?

27
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,850
Let's do it.

28
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,730
I guess we'll drink some.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,460
What technique.

30
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,560
We can buy it from the boat.

31
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,660
Let's go for it.

32
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,680
Can we order like this?

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,800
-Is someone serving?
-Hello.

34
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,400
Let's buy some!

35
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,630
Yeah, let's buy.

36
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,420
-Do you have cash?
-I'll pay.

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,520
I'll pay. It was my idea.

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,400
-I've got this.
-Taiki, you pay.

39
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,500
Thank you.

40
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,300
Excuse me...

41
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,060
Seshita and Masayoshi, you're going to
fan me from behind, right?

42
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,050
You brought a fan, right?

43
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,000
-Here.
-Thank you.

44
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,060
A fan...?

45
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,150
Here you go.

46
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,260
You didn't bring a fan?

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,600
Well...

48
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,500
-The fan?
-That works.

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,000
No, don't blow on me.

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
That's gross.

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,700
-Please don't blow on me.
-Least I can do.

52
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,550
It's lukewarm.

53
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,350
Don't blow on me.

54
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,960
-I can use this.
-That's good.

55
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,900
Thank you.

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,500
They cost...

57
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,700
240, free one.

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,100
One, two...

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,100
One's free?

60
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,850
-300.
-Thank you.

61
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,880
She thinks we're Korean.

62
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,800
We're Japanese. Arigato gozaimashita.

63
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,350
-Thank you.
-That's it!

64
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,160
Tastes like real tapioca balls.

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,820
Delicious.

66
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,430
Tasty rice balls.

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,800
It's tapioca.

68
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,400
I paid for it, so let me tell you, it's tapioca.

69
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,000
-Masayoshi, you wanted to come here?
-Yes.

70
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,720
I know we've got drinks,
but there's lots of food too.

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,200
-Thailand is known for seafood.
-Seafood?

72
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,200
-We can buy it from the boat?
-That's right.

73
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,360
They're selling T-shirts.

74
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,730
Durian T-shirts.

75
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,550
It says "durian" on it.

76
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,200
You should buy that.

77
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,530
Stop the boat, please.

78
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,830
Might be better to get off first.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,830
That'll be easier.

80
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,200
-That'll be fun to have.
-They even have those.

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,260
You won't get it anywhere else.

82
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,620
Remember where the shop is.

83
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,000
Look at the corn.

84
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,100
-The Dorians...
-Look.

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,230
Look, grilled corn.

86
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,260
Looks delicious.

87
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,360
What's this?

88
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,600
It's crocodile meat.

89
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,530
Crocodile? Wow!

90
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,380
30 bahts. That's about 100 yen.

91
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,100
Do you want to try it?

92
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,330
Hirai, try it.

93
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,750
Go back.

94
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,460
Go back.

95
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,260
Masayoshi didn't do a good job explaining.

96
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,030
-Hamada, Hirai will eat this?
-Yes.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,430
Let's eat some crocs!

98
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,250
I'm not too excited.

99
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,250
Seshita will eat crocs too!

100
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,260
Seshita too?

101
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,500
No spicy.

102
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,220
Who wants spicy?

103
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,900
Spicy for me.

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
Crocodile looks tasty.

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,130
-Do you want one?
-You try it first.

106
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,200
Here we go.

107
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,160
Let's try it.

108
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,360
You'll get hives!

109
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,600
-If it gets you sick.
-How was it?

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,520
-It's delicious.
-Really?

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,160
-What's it like?
-A cross between chicken and pork.

112
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,430
Only 100 yen a stick.

113
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,160
It doesn't taste funky.

114
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,730
It's good.

115
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Good, right? Tastes like chicken.

116
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,060
Delicious.

117
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,550
Good.

118
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,030
It's very tasty.

119
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,060
It is.

120
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,980
A genuine Thai vibe.

121
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,360
The Pattaya vibe.

122
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,420
The Pattaya ambience.

123
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,050
Everything looks tasty.

124
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,900
This is nice. Thanks.

125
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,220
-Thanks, Inomoto.
-We found this by chance.

126
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,160
Thank you, Inomoto.

127
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,900
-It was my idea...
-Can we stop by a store?

128
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,450
I've seen that on TV before.

129
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,100
It was an experience.

130
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,360
This looks like fun. This kind of shopping.

131
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,900
This market is great.

132
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,700
What's that?

133
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,760
Is it takoyaki?

134
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,420
-Takoyaki?
-A whole octopus on top.

135
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,930
Interesting.

136
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,060
Taiki. Buy some.

137
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,330
-Me?
-He told you.

138
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,120
I paid earlier.

139
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,060
Just buy some.

140
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,860
I want to taste the takoyaki here.

141
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,630
Three packs for 100 bahts.

142
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,400
Unusual takoyaki... very interesting.

143
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,600
Thank you.

144
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,100
Eating this is a bit...

145
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,220
Eat it.

146
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,530
I'm on a diet.

147
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
What?

148
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,900
Just eat it. We bought all this.

149
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,060
Don't tell me you're on a diet.

150
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,150
Dig in. It's the Hamada diet.

151
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,900
Yeah, the Hamada diet.

152
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,960
Go for it.

153
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,060
-It's delicious.
-Is it good?

154
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,200
It's heavy on the batter, but...

155
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,730
...the octopus has good texture,
and the sauce is nice.

156
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,350
It tastes like the Japanese sauce. It's good.

157
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,350
Maybe they use Japanese sauce.

158
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,800
I think the seaweed they use is better.

159
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,360
Go on, eat more.

160
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,100
-No, I had enough.
-Stop talking, eat.

161
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,400
The Hamada diet is about eating carbs.

162
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,530
It's very stodgy. Loads more batter
than the takoyaki you get in Osaka.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's octopus on top of a ball of batter.

164
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,930
It's good but very heavy.

165
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,720
So many unfamiliar things.

166
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,860
-There is.
-Is that duck?

167
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,860
-That's duck.
-It's the beak.

168
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,830
I thought it was a spoon.

169
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,400
Wow. Impressive.

170
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,160
Wonderful!

171
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,500
Who's eating?

172
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,580
Who's eating scorpion?

173
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,500
-There's scorpion?!
-Scorpion.!

174
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,400
Or grubs. Who's eating grubs?

175
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,060
What insect's larvae are they?

176
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,680
What insect do they turn into?

177
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,700
Hirai. You're up.

178
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,000
Which one? I'll let you choose.

179
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,500
Lucky, you get a choice.

180
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,600
Hirai, go for the scorpion.

181
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,260
Is it good?

182
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,450
Never been so close to a scorpion.

183
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,620
Not the eyes. I don't eat with my eyes.

184
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,800
-You start from the claws?
-Is it edible?

185
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,200
-This is scary.
-Go for it.

186
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,230
When you bite down, the legs move.

187
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,680
This is a new texture for me.

188
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,780
What does it taste like?

189
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,800
Can you eat it like that?

190
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,030
That's disgusting.

191
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,580
No way...

192
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,920
Oh, it's delicious!

193
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,330
-No way...
-Scorpion's too much.

194
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,400
I can't believe you ate it.

195
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,900
-It's not that bad.
-I can't take the smell.

196
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,360
-It tastes like liver.
-Seriously?

197
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,000
So it's soft?

198
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,960
You're sweating like a pig.

199
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,260
It boosted my metabolism.

200
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,280
You ate scorpion, and now you're all sweaty.

201
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,450
-Taiki, 200.
-I've paid.

202
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,250
Thank you.

203
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,960
We should have bought those T-shirts.

204
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,130
They're over there.

205
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,360
Oh yeah?

206
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,030
There it is!

207
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,950
I found it!

208
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,880
It's perfect for you.

209
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,200
This is really nice.

210
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,300
-Do they have my size?
-You're really into it.

211
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,320
-I want one.
-You should both get one.

212
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,700
Now?

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,660
You'll have to buy it.

214
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,560
Hey, it fits.

215
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,660
That's great!

216
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,160
I'm surprised they have his size.

217
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,460
-How is it, Hirai?
-It's the best!

218
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,760
Durian!

219
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,730
"Dorians!"

220
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,980
They'll both buy it.

221
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,650
He doesn't look happy about it.

222
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,450
-Taiki, what's up?
-What's with that expression?

223
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,130
Isn't it lame?

224
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,850
-Well...
-It's fine for Thailand.

225
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,650
We were looking for an outfit for our duo. Right?

226
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,460
No we were not!

227
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,750
Hirai, pay for it.

228
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, thanks.

229
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,700
Hamada, I'm like everyone's sponsor.

230
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,900
I've paid for everything.

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,450
You said you'd pay.

232
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,020
Yes, for the tapioca drinks.

233
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,300
But the shirts are for your duo.

234
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,930
It'd be odd for us to pay.

235
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,000
-What's that about?
-A laugh machine.

236
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,900
He pisses me off.

237
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,230
-That was good.
-Thank you.

238
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,430
That's a good buy.

239
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,000
You're not going to wear it, Taiki?

240
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,900
-What's that?
-Sandals.

241
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,400
Who'd wear that?

242
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,000
-Fish sandals.
-It's funny.

243
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,980
-They look fun.
-The first time I've seen one.

244
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,750
-Hirai's buying sandals.
-Really?

245
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,600
-Yeah.
-This, okay.

246
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,130
Looks like a plate at a Japanese restaurant.

247
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,400
Taiki, your partner is unbelievable.

248
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,520
It's too small.

249
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,320
It's the biggest size.

250
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,880
Don't force it.

251
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Take your socks off.

252
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,450
You look really fat now.

253
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,150
So tacky!

254
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,150
Your feet look fat.

255
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,980
Weird sandals.

256
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,030
You could never get them in Japan.

257
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,300
Can't get them in Japan.

258
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,520
That's about it.

259
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,300
There were lots of nice shops,
food, and drinks too.

260
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,350
-That's good.
-I enjoyed it. I'm glad we came.

261
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,560
Right? When you come,
you realize it's worth a visit.

262
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,630
Next up, Inomoto has arranged for
Hamada's favorite activity: golf.

263
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:29,150
Inomoto, thanks for taking us
to the floating market.

264
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,350
It was the best. It really feels like a trip.

265
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,100
Excuse me. Sorry for interrupting, everyone.

266
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,120
It was my idea.

267
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,280
-You did a good job explaining.
-Thanks.

268
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,430
I've got more information.

269
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,600
We're lucky that we got this taxi.

270
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,020
It was because Inomoto was facing this way.

271
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,100
The thing is, there's another beach back there.

272
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,230
Actually, I wanted to go there.

273
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,860
I see.

274
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,080
I thought it'd take us up to lunch.

275
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,250
There's a good restaurant there.

276
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,630
-"Cafe des Amis."
-I found that online.

277
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,300
It's really famous.

278
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,650
Right.

279
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,950
It's ranked number one
in the Pattaya restaurant rankings.

280
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,550
Yes, number one on TripAdvisor.

281
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,230
And it's ranked seventh in Asia.

282
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,320
Seriously?!

283
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,600
The idea was to suggest going for lunch there.

284
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,600
But we happened upon the market,
so we went there instead.

285
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,600
But it turned out well.

286
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,300
It happens.

287
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,200
Oh yeah...

288
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,930
-Remember how I bought these?
-Yep.

289
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,630
I was thinking...

290
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:57,200
And I bought a pair for Hamada's wife Natsumi.

291
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,960
She might like it.

292
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,860
That's nice.

293
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,820
It's better to buy gifts as we go.

294
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,820
A different color.

295
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,960
-Cute color!
-Pink!

296
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,030
She'll love it.

297
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,320
-She'd like this, right?
-Yeah.

298
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,000
She'd say, "I'm not wearing that, idiot!"

299
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,130
-You think she'd say that?
-Would she?

300
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,030
I got a different color for Hamada too.

301
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,450
-There's a blue one?
-Wow, a blue one.

302
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,500
Hamada likes blue.

303
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,620
No way. When would I wear that?

304
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,020
You and your wife.

305
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,230
"I'm not wearing that, idiot!"

306
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Natsumi, what do you think of these?

307
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,530
"No way, idiot!"

308
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,100
You're imitating your own wife?

309
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,000
-Does it fit?
-Perfect fit.

310
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,600
I had trouble finding his size.

311
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,260
-I'm so glad.
-Thank you.

312
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,180
Hamada and the group arrive
at Thailand's leading golf course.

313
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,500
Siam Country Club Plantation.

314
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,030
Stop that.

315
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,000
Cut that out. Sheesh.

316
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,600
That's too edgy, cut it out.

317
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,750
-You practiced?
-Don't act like him.

318
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,800
We're here.

319
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,430
-How is it?
-Great.

320
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,880
We've come all the way to Thailand,
so we should play.

321
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,160
Let's play.

322
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,720
Owing to its stunning beauty,

323
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,660
this world-renowned golf course
hosted the LPGA tour in 2009.

324
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,420
The course exploits the natural landscape,

325
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,160
allowing one to revel in
the beautiful and strategic course.

326
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,750
There are restaurant
and shop facilities on the grounds.

327
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,230
They are sure to delight all visitors.

328
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,100
This is a beautiful course.

329
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,020
They first head to the "Sugar Cane Course."

330
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,660
The sixth hole is a short par three.

331
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,460
What will they be doing here?

332
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,900
Closest to the pin
with Hamada against the other six.

333
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,250
-How was it last time?
-Last time...

334
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,930
-We got three on the green.
-Yes.

335
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,700
-But then Hamada won by two meters.
-What a superstar.

336
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,920
It was in Guam.

337
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,260
That's right. That was good.

338
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,450
Say it again. How many meters?

339
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,220
-Two meters.
-That's right.

340
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,600
You were closer.

341
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,080
We'll hit one each.

342
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,180
-And you get three.
-Okay, I understand.

343
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,750
If we win, dinner's on you.

344
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,120
Yeah!

345
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,030
OK? And if you win, you can slap us.

346
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,580
Understood.

347
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,380
I'll slap you as much as I like.

348
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,930
Isn't it one slap?

349
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,860
First up is Tsutsumi of Dorians.

350
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,250
Ah! I topped it!

351
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,660
Don't worry, we've got more shots.

352
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,300
Too much to the right!

353
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,660
The team of six isn't doing too well today.

354
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,650
That's no good.

355
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,550
-It's too short.
-Yeah.

356
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,160
-Looks good.
-It's too short.

357
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,500
Is that so?

358
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,230
No good.

359
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,500
After five shots,
no one has landed on the green.

360
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,680
Last up is Hirai of Dorians.

361
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,350
Nice!

362
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,460
It's going straight.

363
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,260
Is it on the green?

364
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,300
-Might be the collar?
-Yeah.

365
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,000
Wait! It's rolling back.

366
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,660
-I did it!
-Amazing!

367
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,000
Nice!

368
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,730
-Seriously?
-It rolled back.

369
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,860
Incredibly, Hirai's super shot got him
less than two meters from the pin.

370
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,320
It's going to be hard to beat that.

371
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,530
Hirai's shot was awesome.

372
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,700
Uh oh!

373
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,760
Uh oh!

374
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,620
-It's straight.
-No way.

375
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,900
Seriously?

376
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,430
No way.

377
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,550
-No!
-It's gone right.

378
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,650
No! It's gone over there.

379
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,780
It rolled so much.

380
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,830
Hirai is much closer.

381
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,020
Two more shots.

382
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,800
Hamada really is good. He got it on his first shot.

383
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,660
It went straight.

384
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,220
He's going to adjust his shot now.

385
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,320
Perfect distance.

386
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,650
He's got three chances.

387
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,300
This isn't good!

388
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,400
This isn't good!

389
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,350
-And it's a straight shot.
-Oh no!

390
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,400
Don't go there.

391
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,060
Go right, right!

392
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,560
It's rolling.

393
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,530
There it goes!

394
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,250
-That could have gone either way.
-It went slightly to the right.

395
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,600
-It was right or left.
-It was close.

396
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,160
Hirai's still got this.

397
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,950
-Your last ball.
-Hamada is good.

398
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,620
You keep saying that.

399
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,350
He'll adjust his shot even more.

400
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,880
He said it was off.

401
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,530
He adjusted slightly to the left.

402
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,420
Oh no!

403
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,900
It's no good.

404
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,520
Oh no!

405
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,530
It's no good. Too far left.

406
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,900
-I'm sorry.
-We win!

407
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,030
We did it!

408
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,500
We won!

409
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,500
He seems disappointed.

410
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
Thank you.

411
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,800
I'll tell you the truth now...

412
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,930
-I have a fractured bone.
-Really?

413
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,500
For real? Where?

414
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,450
My pinky. I can't grip the club.

415
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,550
Your right hand?

416
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,600
What's he saying?

417
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,050
-Just slap Iwahashi, and we'll call it even.
-Okay.

418
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,730
His pinky is broken.

419
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,330
What's that for?

420
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
What the heck?

421
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,760
My neck turned against my will.

422
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,530
What was that about?

423
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,300
That was too strong for comedy.

424
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,330
They continue on Sugar Cane Course.
First hole, par four.

425
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,600
A very tricky hole with an acute left curve.

426
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,380
We'll split into groups and set the rules.

427
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,660
We can keep adding one baht to the pool.

428
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,400
We'll use that for dinner or something.

429
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,280
The teams are:
Hamada and Iwahashi, Inomoto and Hirai,

430
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,700
and the last three are...

431
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,900
The numbers don't work.

432
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,600
Taiki and Seshita team up.

433
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,160
Hold on...

434
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,600
You're on your own.

435
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,730
What? That's not fair.

436
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,650
-Let me join a team.
-It's alright.

437
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,530
About the rules, we're in Thailand.

438
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,150
It's a country with many transgender women.

439
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,220
Normally we ban English,

440
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,430
but as soon as Hamada says to start,
we'll all talk like women.

441
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,720
-Like women?
-Since it's Thailand.

442
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,780
Instead of banning English.

443
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,800
We'll talk like women.

444
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,980
If someone doesn't, the team is liable
and will have to pay one baht.

445
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,220
Don't talk girly, pay one baht.

446
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,460
Masayoshi is like a transgender woman.

447
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,960
I guess so.

448
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,460
-That's an advantage.
-It is.

449
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,450
If he teams up, it'd be unfair. So he's alone.

450
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,930
I see. Thank you, honey.

451
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,850
He's good at it.

452
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,500
Hamada will start it.

453
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,000
Here we go...

454
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Get ready... go!

455
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,100
Yay! This is like so much fun!

456
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,330
Totally fun!

457
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,400
It's so pretty here!

458
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,160
-It's too much.
-Enough already.

459
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,000
Who's going first? Let's decide.

460
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,760
Let's pick the order.

461
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,260
-You decide.
-Really?

462
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,450
Rock, paper, scissors.

463
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,330
Seshita, you go.

464
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,660
Ready? Rock, paper, scissors.

465
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,780
Oh no, I lost! Can't believe it.

466
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,560
Why did I use scissors first?

467
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,920
Rock, paper, scissors.

468
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,880
Oh no, I lost!

469
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,430
Scissors are totally weak.

470
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,920
I wish I hadn't used scissors.

471
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,450
Let's pause a moment.

472
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,480
I think we've gone too far.

473
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,580
Is it too much?

474
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,260
You guys are going full throttle.

475
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,050
What was all that?

476
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,560
-Do that bit when you lost.
-Oh no, I lost.

477
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,450
-That's too much.
-Why did I use scissors?

478
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,000
That's unnecessary.

479
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,000
Start over. Go.

480
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,500
Rock, paper, scissors.

481
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,020
Ouch! Why did you kick me? You're mean!

482
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,530
Stop, think about her feelings.

483
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,220
Violence is wrong.

484
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,320
I'm leaving.

485
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,560
-Wait, wait.
-I can't do this.

486
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,130
It's taking too long.

487
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,030
Let's decide the order.

488
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,930
It took some time, but the order is as follows.

489
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,060
First up is Dorians Tsutsumi.

490
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,800
It got stuck.

491
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,450
Pretty good...

492
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,060
That wasn't girly.

493
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,380
Taiki is out.

494
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,830
Taiki! I can't believe it!

495
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,180
It got caught.

496
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,680
I'm up. It's my turn.

497
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,730
It flew too far.

498
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,250
-That wasn't girly.
-It was feminine.

499
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,780
It sounded masculine.

500
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,480
Yeah. Just hit the ball.

501
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,180
You're just talking normally.

502
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,380
Penalty for Hamada.

503
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,060
He's so brazen.

504
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,600
I have to watch my tics.

505
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,930
Will the caddies laugh at my tics?

506
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,700
What about the locals?

507
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,150
They're laughing.

508
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,680
-What are you doing?
-Take your shot.

509
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,300
Hurry, take your shot.

510
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,580
Might be too far.

511
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,960
That's too far.

512
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,250
Is it out?

513
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,230
-It's safe.
-Thank you!

514
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,860
It's safe!

515
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,860
The teams' positions are as shown.

516
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,000
After this, girly talking causes turmoil.

517
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,030
Was mine out? "Chaplin, bolin-bolin..."

518
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,160
What does that mean?

519
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,960
I'll pay one baht, so let me say this. You suck!

520
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,960
It's really bad. You suck at it.

521
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,430
-Masayoshi.
-Yes? Me?

522
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,920
You're over here.

523
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,820
I'm exposed. Forgive me.

524
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,420
I'm so embarrassed. Don't film me.

525
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,150
-All exposed. So embarrassed.
-You're great at this talk.

526
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,550
This ball is blushing.

527
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,600
Go get your club!

528
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,350
Amazing shot. It looks good.

529
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,450
Wow!

530
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,200
By the pin!

531
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,500
A bit far.

532
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,100
Good one! Yay!

533
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,620
Such high spirits.

534
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,450
How bendy is her spine?

535
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,400
-Hurry it up, girl.
-Hamada is mad.

536
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,330
Wait up! When we go, we go together.

537
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,550
Why does he sound like that?

538
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,030
That girl's so not funny.

539
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,960
Don't say that she isn't funny.

540
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,060
Don't say I'm not funny.

541
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,560
She's got good ears.

542
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,200
That's what I said.

543
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,030
-What are you saying?
-Hurry up.

544
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,130
-That's out, right?
-Not girly.

545
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,930
That's just scary.

546
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Really scary!

547
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,430
-You're scaring me.
-My tics are gone.

548
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,300
That was so weak.

549
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,160
That was weak.

550
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,760
Excuse, for that weak shot.

551
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,050
What's "excuse"? I might hit you.

552
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,480
-Oh girl, you're scary.
-That's the scariest.

553
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,060
She's seriously scary.

554
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,730
Looks good.

555
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,460
Almost!

556
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,220
You're good.

557
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,230
Just put it in.

558
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,660
Nice!

559
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,200
We did it.

560
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,220
Here's how much each team was penalized.

561
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,500
The money will be spent on dinner.

562
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,250
Though it was my idea, it wasn't a good one.

563
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,050
Agreed.
