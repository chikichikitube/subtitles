Gaki no Tsukai's Shichi Henge!

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,250
Put in rigorous situations which are too funny too fail,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,730
this series displays the true worth of comedians.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,720
And today's challenger is...

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,700
First time on Gaki no Tsukai - Kendo Kobayashi Shichi Henge!

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,040
Before that, congratulations!

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,300
Congratulations to Matsumoto on the birth of his first daughter!

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,610
Matsumoto Hitoshi has finally  become a parent

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,280
Matsumoto Hitoshi has finally become a parent!

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, it happened finally around this episode's airing.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,620
Honestly, about Koba's Shichi Henge today,
who gives a shit?

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,100
You want to go home to care for your new born.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,910
Yeah, makes no difference.

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,880
But, all the comedians that performed here so far

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,800
who had promising futures

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
have become good for nothings.

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,670
Why all the ones that came here?

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,500
They have sort of given up, lost potential opportunities

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,100
and their future looks grim.

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,040
Let's welcome today's performer!

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,820
Kendo Kobyashi

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,820
Not your normal self.

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,820
- Something's a bit changed.

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,360
It's the usual me. Though I have
really sour feeling in my mouth.

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,920
Since you came here, I saw you sitting there by yourself

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,860
just staring at a point here.

27
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,620
Just staring there by yourself.

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,360
T/N: Koumoto episode #753

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,360
Up to 30 people have tried, and Koumoto is still on top.

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,200
This shows the money if you get on here.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,660
That's some tight rankings. Gotta dream big.

32
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,300
I want to be around the ranks that are bold typed font.

33
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,200
Till here is bold typed.

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,640
Ah, so small!

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,360
Yama-chan, your typeface is so small!

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,260
We had less staff when I performed.

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,260
- It wasn't like that at all.

38
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,440
It was like 3 people, can't be helped.

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,440
That wasn't funny at all.

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:30,300
This is a fan sub for fans
do enjoy :)

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,480
Suga isn't here today.

57
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,610
Wait, who is this sitting here?

58
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,080
I was told to sit here since Suga isn....

59
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,080
Heipo

60
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,160
What did you say?

61
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,380
Since Suga isn't here, I was-

62
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,380
- Say it clearly!

63
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,480
What are you mumbling about?

64
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,040
Well, what to do about these?

65
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,280
Starting from the top is a good idea.

66
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,180
We can't do this live, can we?

69
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,180
Forget the excuses, just do it!

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,540
This marriage one is interesting.

73
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,300
In my 30s, I was with a Philippines woman and we dated.

74
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,070
In my 30s, I was with a Philippines woman and we dated.

75
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,720
In my 30s, I was with a Philippines woman and we dated.

76
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,940
You had one really?

77
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,720
You had your chance with a Philippine woman.

78
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,720
Yeah, I want to pursue someone else.

79
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,540
I went all the way to Cebu Island for her.

80
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,820
That really happened??

81
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,830
She must have been pretty.

82
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,930
- She was a dancer.

83
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,360
Dancer?

84
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,220
Please let me smoke a cigarette.

85
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,660
After the commercial break,
will Koba let out a puff like Nagira?

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,340
He's an idiot.

87
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,000
After the commercial break, will Koba
chug the leftover juice like Nagira?

88
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,440
My eyes are getting tired.

89
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,700
After the commercial break, Nagira tears up...

90
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:07,980
He really likes Nagira.

91
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,260
He really likes Nagira.

92
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,720
That was really close.

Yeah, lets tell him.

97
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,060
We'll address it later.

98
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,600
Not a transformation at all!

99
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,600
- Yeah, it isn't

100
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,000
He's just redoing his own gags.

101
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,940
Yama-chan, you're getting flack for this.

102

113
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Might be older than 40.

114
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,440
You there, athlete Endo.

115
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,480
Your ambition is unwavering. Thats what I see in you.

120

You seem composed and cool headed.

121
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,900
But your words are explosive, you see.

122
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,680
Thats your reality, your knees and lips are overused a lot.

But still, your ambition is unwavering.

126
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,860
Well, that's alright.

127
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,840
I gotta go back and make sure my wrestlers are in shape.

128
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,600

129

130

Yeah, laugh out loud.

141
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,030
It's 1000 Yen fine for a little smirk and for big laughter.

Let it out like a lumberjack.

Let it out like a lumberjack.

144
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,700

I'm cheerful though.

150
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,500
Shouldn't a nice woman like you
give me a kiss if I am down?

151

Also, Koba just left in the middle of the skit!

165
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,220
Leaving that much of the skit. Thats no good!

166

Thats dirty, Koba.

"Take Minami to Koshien late" is what she said.

172

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,860
Yeah, since he's not transforming.

176
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,660
Oh, come in.

177
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,920
Ah, we're going again.

178
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,990
Thanks for the coin.

179
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,080
What are you doing?

180
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,100
He's biting onto it.

181
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,800
Ok, all done.

182
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,960
Way different than yesterday.

183
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,060
Ok, go ahead.

184
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,900
Ah, that's a-alright.

185
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
MARVELOUS, MARVELOUS, MARVELOUS!

186
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,160
You won't get better doing it this way.

187
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,560
No room for potential.

188
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,800
You're just gonna keep doing that?

189
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,800
- This guy's an idiot.

190
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,630
Good. Good. Good.

191
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,160
I won't tell you that again.

192
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,340
You again? Go ahead.

193
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,080
Are you a pro out this?!?

194
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,230
Thank you for the meal.

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,180
That's my line. "Thanks for the meal" is for me to say.

196
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,860
Heipo and I got a front-row seat to all the licking!

197
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,140
Directly in front of us.

198
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:56,210
Ah, all the old dudes.

199
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,840
Directly head on. That's excessive!

200
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,540
Yes, just awful.

201
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,540
So gross.

202
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,540
- Gross af.

203
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,790
No one understood that scene just now.

204
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,310
No one understood that scene just now.

205
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,100
I heard a rumor that you were
attempting Rakugo recently.

206
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,060
Really?

207
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,810
You said Rakugo is no big deal during Endo's anguish shoot last month.

208
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,000
Like are you really going to do it?

209
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,210
Before you said you were being forced to do it with our resident Baldy.

210
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,010
Before you said you were being forced to do it with our resident Baldy.

211
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,100
Before you said you were being forced to do it with our resident Baldy.

212
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,480
Our Baldy?

213
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,480
- What was his name, again?

214
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,090
Who is Our Baldy?

215
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,880
He wears some make-up wig.

216
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Yeah, its Ounuma.

217
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,200
He's not Our Baldy.

218
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,500
Ounuma
Director

219
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,760
Stop this, it makes me laugh already.

220
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,580
We got to be serious here. Just stop it.

221
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,400
What the hell is with "Our Baldy"?

222
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,100
Naming a regular old dude...

223
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
I'm late.

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,600
Excuse us.

225
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,990
Are you Kobayashi Tomoharu?

226
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,620
Yes, that's me.

227
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,620
I'm Katagiri of Tokyo Police Search Unit 1.

228
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,390
7 years ago, were you working at uh-- Kanto um-- M-Medical Hospital?

229
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,330
7 years ago, were you working at uh-- Kanto um-- M-Medical Hospital?

230
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,520
7 years ago, were you working at uh-- Kanto um-- M-Medical Hospital...?

231
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,940
It's useless now.

232
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,710
You're aware of that, aren't you?

233
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,540
Yes.

234
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,280
Then, I'll get straight to the point. Will you come
with us to Tokyo immediately?

235
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,280
I understand, I'll be in your care.

236
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,260
Handcuff him.

237
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,960
Hey!! What are you doing?

238
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Stop it!

239
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,220
Please don't be unreasonable with our doctor.

240
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,300
Our doctor didn't do anything.

241
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,880
He's a potential suspect
in a murder case a few years ago.

242
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,400
Don't do anything!

243
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,100
Everyone, its okay.

244
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,520
Detective, please, take me.

245
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,040
Take you where exactly?

246
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,150
I came all the way to this village chasing the culprit.

247
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,820
I came all the way to this village chasing the culprit.

248
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,640
I came all the way to this village chasing the culprit.

249
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,710
However, in this village, there's no murderer...

250
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,700
But, free of charge, you provide care-

251
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,410
- This is so shitty.

252
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,410
for the livelyhood of the people here that depend on you.

253
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,040
A caring doctor among the village folk.

254
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,480
Spending lots of money, coming to this village.

255
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,700
If you do something like that again,
I'll come find you.

256
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,700
T/N: Unsure of what is being said here. I did my best :)

257
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,340
Uncuff him, Fujimiya.

258
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,400
Get outta here! Leave!

259
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,600
The skit ended in the first half.

260
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,000
Was this even Koba?

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,500
We gotta tell him that enough is enough.

262
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,540
It's like this on all the skits.

263
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,250
It's been a while since I saw someone so stunned.

264
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,960
It's been a while since I saw someone so stunned.

265
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,920
He's not even...

266
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,520
He's not doing anything on his own.

267
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,060
He only did Yamamoto Kotetsu skit. Everyone else does the rest.

268
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,200
Hey, come here!

269
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,300
Ace's Wakame, slurp it up quick!

270
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,100
T/N: Koba is mimicking an old Acecook
Wakame Ramen ad by Ishidate Tetsuo.

271
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,100
Where's this Wakame from?!

272
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,840
Where Wakame are you?

273
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,980
-Hollanda, California.

274
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,980
Its so old!

275
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,980
So old!

276
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,640
He left California.

277
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,420
Ohh, California!!

278
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,820
Ace's Wakame, slurp it up quick!
Where is this Wakame from?

279
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,200
Which you Wakame are you?

280
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,000
???, California.

281
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,000
T/N: I don't know what language he is speaking.
To me it doesn't sound like English. Perhaps EU?

282
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,200
He left California.

283
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, if you listen closely, its California??

284
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,540
Go!

285
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,060
He actually does that.

286
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
Who the hell remembers that old ad??

287
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,900
He's gutsy pulling that off.

288
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,960
I wouldn't be able to.

289
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,970
After this:
Last skit and results

290
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:22,840
He only did Yamamoto Kotetsu
and Ishidate Tetsuo by himself.

291
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,840
- Yup.

292
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,840
The rest for that matter...

293
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,840
- Yeah, the rest

294
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,840
The detective skit was questionable.

295
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,850
- Yeah, he got away with a lot on that one.

296
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,610
That one was the most awful.

297
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,360
Ah, I'm so hungry!

298
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
- Yeah, so hungry!

299
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,040
Some sushi!

300
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Looks delicious!

301
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Gimme some too, Hirochi.

302
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,300
Here have some.

303
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,940
GUTSY
NEGO6

304
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,900
Eating sushi is the best feeling!

305
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,600
Delicious!

306
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,820
Koyamada-Senpai.

307
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,380
What are you doing?

308
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,520
Oh Golgo, I'm eating sushi, don't you see.

309
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,280
You're filling up quite well!

310
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,380
Ah, thanks!

311
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,720
Thanks! More importantly, Golgo...

312
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,880
...what are you here for?

313
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,320
Oh yes, Senpai, something's happened.

314
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,480
The hell do you mean?

315
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:38,820
Mr. Bure is throwing a fit again.

316
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:38,820
T/N: Unsure of what is being said here. I did my best :)

317
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,590
What should we do?

318
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,620
Oh Whatever!

319
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,920
Wait up!

320
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,540
Its Nego6 again, he's used him before too.

321
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,940
He appears often.

322
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:13,180
Lets just tally up just in case.
We'll address our concerns afterwards.

323
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,640
51,000 Yen.

324
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,640
You're joking!

325
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,060
3rd place. No, 4th place actually!

326
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,460
4th Place?
51,000 Yen?

327
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,090
Koba!

328
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,440
We have something that needs to be brought up.

329
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,660
Really, brought up?

330
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,580
Verifying authenticity.

331
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,840
- Objection of your work.

332
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,680
So far, 51,000 Yen.

333
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,700
Hell yeah!

334
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,660
You're in here.

335
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,660
- Somehow got in Top 5.

336
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,450
First things first, you didn't transform.

337
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,150
First things first, you didn't transform.

338
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,180
Wait, I did transform though.

339
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,440
You didn't when you had the camera closeups.

340
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,180
Trying to impersonate Nagira Kenichi.

341
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,680
On the last one, when Nagira cries...

342
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,200
...I synced with Nagira's style.

343
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,320
What about the Tacchan's skit?

344
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,040
Well, I transformed as Tacchan.

345
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,970
That granny did all the work though.

346
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,980
And yet you left, leaving her there by herself.

347
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Does the laughs granny gets go toward you?

348
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,720
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

349
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
The worst one was the doctor and detective.

350
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,590
This one's hard to judge. What do you think, Koba?

351
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,530
I wonder if certain people in this world...

352
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,000
...might need to follow up on practice.

353
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,860
He told me he practiced it.

354
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,670
He did, didn't he?

355
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,570
- Thoroughly.

356
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,960
Also, he seemed like a respected veteran.

357
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,510
He causally turned me around during practice.

358
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,160
- Ah he did

359
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,520
Couldn't believe it that same person...

360
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,380
- Like a deer in headlights.

361
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,520
What will you do about that? You piled up lots of points there.

362
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,090
Everyone laughed.

363
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,280
- That was also derived from the results.

364
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,040
That was?

365
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,040
- I set it up.

366
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
But you also laughed as well.

367
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,720
Its no good if you laugh too.

368
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,400
It was derived from me.

369
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,440
We're thinking of not giving you the credit for the 5th skit.

370
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:21,080
(1) Camera before ad (2) Yamamoto Kotetsu (3) Touch
(4) Nipple Sucking (5) Doc & Detective (6) ACECOOK (7) Gutsy Nego6

371
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,960
Just the 5th one.

372
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Doc and Detective?

373
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,980
If we omit this skit from the total,
how much is left over?

374
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,060
Well its 11 people, so...

375
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,880
In that case, the total is 40,000 Yen.

376
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,380
Since Koba laughed at his own skit,
you take out your own 1000 Yen too.

377
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,500
During the Doc & Detective skit.

378
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
41,000 Yen.

379
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:49,010
8th Place Total Amount 41000 Yen!!

380
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,300
On the contrary, you're gonna put in your own money.

381
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,300
What do you mean "on the contrary"?
