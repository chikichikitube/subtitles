1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,600
Disturbance

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,940
Take the next integral...

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,670
...and the denominator...

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,170
...to get the rational number.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,400
Take the rational number and
apply it to the straight line...

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,370
So noisy.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:32,920
So, E equals mc
squared when light...

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,050
Loud as hell in there.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,350
Mr. Ueda!

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
Mr. Ueda!

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,470
Mr. Ueda!

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,960
Mr. Ueda, do you hear me!

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,430
What the!
