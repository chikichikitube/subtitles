First time on Gaki no Tsukai

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,060
Let's play with nostalgic retrogames: super famicom!

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,680
Famicom, huh?

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,680
Isn't it nice?

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,270
We already played famicom before

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,270

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,270

On the previous two episodes, they played nostalgic famicom games from their youth

13
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,540
Dig Dug

19
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,060
And today it's time for its successor

20
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:35,420
It's time to play some Super Famicom games!!

21
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:35,420
Released in 1990

22
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,080
They'll play with the Super Famicom, released in 1990

23
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,320
Now that I think about it, I used to play this more

24
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, is that so?

25
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,520
Cocorico

26
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,520
Endo Shozo

27
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,520
Tanaka Naoki

28
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,200
You must be an expert, then

29
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,360
Yeah, I had my own super famicom

30
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,430
Tsukitei Hosei

31
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,280
Amazing

32
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,820
But these guys here said they never played with the famicom

33
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,320
Yes, they did

34
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,600
I wonder how are they gonna deal with a super famicom

35
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,370
I have no idea

36
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,600
Look, if you wanna go home, it's fine to me!

37
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,340
Look, if you wanna go home, it's fine to me!

38
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,340
No way

39
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,440
Just take a bus

40
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,440
I'm not taking any bus, I'll stay

41
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,040
And for today's episode too

42
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,050
Game collector

43
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,050
Sakekan

44
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,840
We have 297 games from our game collector Sakekan's collection

45
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,650
Super famicom: 297 games

46
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,890
If Sakekan would die I'd cry so much

47
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,360
If Sakekan would die I'd cry so much

48
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
No you won't

49
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,840
No way you would

50
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,500
It'd be sad

51
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,380
Can't he just cry a bit?

52
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,530
Of course I would

53
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,930
Of course I'd cry

54
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,930
if Sakekan would get a game over, come on

55
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,600
That's not gonna happen

56
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,720
They choose to take a look at every game, starting from the ones published in 1990

57
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,880
Let's take a look at super famicom games

58
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,240
I really loved this one, "Wagyan Land"

59
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,040
Never heard of it

60
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,960
I don't know that

61
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,680
What is this game?!

62
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,120
When Wagyan shouted "WA" just like this

63
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,120
the "WA" (ãƒ¯) symbol appeared just as it is

64
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,120
And you can jump on them

65
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:52,430
An adventure game in which Wagyan (main character) uses his voice as a weapon

66
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:52,430
Bandai Namco Entertainment

67
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:52,430
Published in 1991

68
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:52,430
Super Wagyan Land

73
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,640
What?

74
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,600
What's this game?

75
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,430
Remember First Human Giatrus? How he made his shouts into stones? It's like that

76
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,800
Right

77
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,860
Oh, I remember that

78
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,270
But if you're not quick enough, your WAs start to fade

79
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,920
You have to be quick

80
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,770
Yeah, you gotta run

81
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,840
What a surprise!!

82
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,880
ActRaiser! He got it too!

83
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,600
No idea what that is

84
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,880
Never heard of it

85
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,700
This one is great

86
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:18,390
A game in which the player becomes a God and
fights magical beasts to help develop his town

87
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:18,390
ActRaiser: released in 1990

88
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:18,390
Available on virtual console

91
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,300
It is, right?

92
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,480
You become a God

93
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,320
This guy...

94
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,160
You play as a God

95
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,900
Yes

96
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,390
And you help the citizens around

97
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,390
And little by little, the town starts to grow

98
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,390
Exactly

99
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,460
Matsumoto told me he got worried for a whole week

100
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,460
Yeah...

101
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,900
'Cause his citizens

102
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,900
And by that I mean the humans inside ActRaiser

103
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,780
Yes?

104
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,660
Ok

105
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,900
That's right

106
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,200
All his humans were feeling gloomy all the time

107
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,300
The hell are these two talking about?

108
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,300
No idea

109
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,940
These two...

110
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,000
Is that the relationship you had?

111
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,940
Just what the hell are they saying?

112
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,210
I bet you know this one, right? R-TYPE

113
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,550
I bet you know this one, right? R-TYPE

114
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,550
Nope, never heard of it

115
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,680
Are you kidding me?!

116
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,350
I don't know any of these

117
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,680
That's literally my first time seeing it

118
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,420
It's the shooting game which best represents
the super-famicom era

119
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,420
Released in 1991: SUPER R-TYPE

122
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,680
We really don't know 'em

123
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,420
It feels like a bunch of virgins coming to a brothel for their first time

124
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,760
Just go home!

132
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:17,050
Today's plan

133
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:17,050

Each member is going to pick the one they want to try and they're all gonna play it

136
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,560
Let's start from the game Hamada has chosen

137
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,050
Hamada's

138
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,050
selected game

139
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,180
I really don't know anything

140
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,000
So what about this one you said it was great before?

141
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,860
Oh!

142
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,530
R-TYPE, right?

143
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,520
Yeah

144
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,330
I think I can show off at this one

145
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,600
Released in 1991

146
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,600

147
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,200
The game Hamada has chosen is the symbol of shooting games for super-famicom

148
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
SUPER R-TYPE

149
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,920
Its main characteristics are its wave motion and charged shooting system

150
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,940
Let's start from Hamada, who plays for his first time

151
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,480
Hamada's challenge

152
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:58,420
Hamada's challenge

153
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:58,420

154
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,300
Try to shoot

155
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,340
Like this, yeah

156
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,020
Like this?

157
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,600
At first is like this

158
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,340
What's this?

159
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,340
You just gotta move up and down

160
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
Look out, enemies are increasing

161
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,760
Oh shit!

162
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,420
Wh--- why did you clash into it?

163
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,940
He went through...

164
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,260
Man, your fingers are moving like an old dude!!

165
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:15,570
Hamada's challenge

166
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:15,570
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

167
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,480
Just move up and down, nowhere else

168
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,100
For now those are fine

169
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480
Keep on shooting 'em

170
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,140
You have infinite ammo, dude

171
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,140
Well done!

172
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,040
Counting on ya

173
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,040
That's right, that's right

174
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,480
See? You just fired a big one

175
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,880
Take that power-up!

176
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,380
He's doing better now---

177
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,660
What the hell!!

178
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,870
What a splendid crash!

179
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,220
Another clash

180
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,180
Such a beautiful crash

181
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,180
Why did you clash into it?

182
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,360
You did it again

183
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:44,400
Hamada's challenge

184
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:44,400
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

185
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,080
It doesn't make you immune

186
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,120
You told me to take it, so I went for it

187
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,420
Get back on track

188
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,480
I'm trying to

189
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Like that

190
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,140
I'm drawing back all the time

191
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,980
You have to move around

192
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,740
But if you go too far you can get trapped

193
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,780
Watch out

194
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,860
It's important to have space to move

195
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,620
Get that "S"!

196
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,480
Now he's fast

197
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,620
That's what it does

198
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,400
Look, if you advance too much...

199
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
You could get---

200
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,400
Oh! It came from above

201
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,040
Dude, don't die while I'm explaining stuff to you

202
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,600
You gotta be careful with your moves once you get that "S"

203
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,600
He died before you got to explain it

204
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,280
Endo's challenge

205
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,000
Next up is Endo, a first timer as well

206
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,860
You can move right and left

207
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:34,350
Endo's challenge

208
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:34,350
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

209
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,320
You basically have to move in every direction

210
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,240
The way you explain stuff makes me anxious

211
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,880
You're right

212
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,920
Sometimes you gotta move forward too

213
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,100
Grab that power-up!

214
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,380
Watch out!

215
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,380
Careful

216
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,460
Man...

217
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,060
Take it!

218
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,680
Come on

219
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,300
See? Now you're faster

220
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,300
Right

221
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Who needs this explaination now?

222
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,460
But those things keep on getting on screen---- ooh

223
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,180
Yes

224
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,000
Nice

225
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,740
You gotta take 'em all down

226
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,740
Be careful when they pop out from above

227
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,660
Get rid of those

228
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,660
Nicely done

229
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,820
Those things explode

230
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,560
Which?

231
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,920
The round ones

232
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,120
Which ones?

233
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,940
If you shoot 'em, they'll explode

234
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,940
I don't see them

235
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,350
You stick too much on the left corner, go forward!!

236
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,590
If you say it like that, he'd panick!

237
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,080
He's too behind

238
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:53,470
Endo's challenge

239
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:53,470
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

240
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,480
He gets too much on the left

241
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,620
But Endo's not bad at all, he's good

242
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,020
Ok, ok

243
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,920
Better than I thought

244
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
This...?

245
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,520
Did you learn how to play it?

246
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,520
I did

247
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm learning

248
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,800
He's good

249
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,800
He is

250
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,100
Really good

251
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,700
Get inside the circle!!

252
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,320
Inside it?!

253
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,320
You have to get inside

254
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
Why?!

255
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
I just told you so

256
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,680
You're all so goddamn noisy!!

257
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:14,820
Tanaka's challenge

258
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:14,820
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

259
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,100
Third challenger is Tanaka, another first timer

260
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,940
Go forward!

261
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,660
Move forward, you're gonna get hit

262
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,860
Nice, now get inside

263
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,980
Quick, quick!

264
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,420
Get inside the circle

265
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,500
Just get inside it like that, now stay still

266
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,160
Like that, nice

267
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,440
Spot where Endo died has been surpassed

268
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,280
Watch out--- you're done for

269
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,860
You panicked, right?

270
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,680
I did, yeah

271
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,500
Once you got in you went upwards in panick

272
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,500
That's right

273
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm unbelievably good at this

274
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,400
This is hard, really

275
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,000
I think I got to its final level

276
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,300
Hm?

277
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,000
for like 20 times so far, I think

278
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,000
What?!

279
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,270
You mean until its ending?

280
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,270
Really?

281
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,480
Matsumoto claims to be an expert at this game: will we see his skills?

282
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,480
Matsumoto's

283
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,480
challenge

284
00:06:33,480 --> 00:07:22,730
Matsumoto's challenge

285
00:06:33,480 --> 00:07:22,730
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

286
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,600
It's important to move constantly

287
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,060
He's going forward so much

288
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,020
Look, he's always moving around

289
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,280
You have to always move around, that applies to everything

290
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,580
You gotta think about the enemies, I mean---

291
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,880
Oh, watch out!

292
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,020
Nice

293
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,840
You don't like those who always move around, right?

294
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,570
You must always have the upper hand

295
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,470
I feel like I got it all back now

296
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,900
You're moving differently

297
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,000
Your control is amazing

298
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,340
Nice

299
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,740
Nice one

300
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,640
You can't kill those

301
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,900
Oh, is that so?

302
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,900
Yeah

303
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,490
Spot where Tanaka died has been surpassed

304
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,120
If you're not ready to move, you can get hit by sudden appearing enemies

305
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,960
Woah!

306
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,930
You even knew it was gonna pop out from above...

307
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,930
Endo!

308
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,470
We're having a talk in my dressing room later

309
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,280
Hosei is going to play next: can he clear stage 1?

310
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,640
Hosei's

311
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,640
challenge

312
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,480
Hosei's challenge

313
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,480
Man, it's been so long since I last played with a D-pad...

314
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,480
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

315
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,480
Yeah, I agree

316
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,720
I'm sure if the staff would have lend me this game yesterday's night

317
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,720
I could have make it so easily today

318
00:07:47,720 --> 00:08:25,820
Hosei's challenge

319
00:07:47,720 --> 00:08:25,820
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

320
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,820
But I didn't even know we were filming this today

321
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,440
That was a risky move

322
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,840
You almost hit that thing

323
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,940
Watch out

324
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,940
Go on

325
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
Here it comes

326
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,360
You gotta get rid of that

327
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,180
Just be careful not to hit any bullet

328
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,530
Spot where Matsumoto died has been surpassed

329
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,180
Yes

330
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,180
Load your gun...

331
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,080
And release it

332
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,580
Alright! Grab that

333
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,560
Ok

334
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,760
Woah, it came from behind!

335
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,640
Look

336
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,380
This one's tricky...

337
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,720
Huh? Is it an ally?

338
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,020
Huh? Is it?

339
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,580
An ally?

340
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,340
It is

341
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,500
I thought it was an enemy

342
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,620
It also serves as a barrier

343
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,060
If they get you, you're safe for one hit

344
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,060
I see

345
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,060
Alright!!

346
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,600
Now that stage 1 is finally done, it's time for a boss fight

347
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,160
It's time to battle against the 1st stage boss!!

348
00:08:30,160 --> 00:09:03,860
Hosei's challenge

349
00:08:30,160 --> 00:09:03,860
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

350
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,900
This is the first boss of this game

351
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,580
The first boss? Woah, it's fast!

352
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,580
Holy shit!

353
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,500
If it gets you, you're done for

354
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,240
You gotta destroy each of those parts

355
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,040
It's so fast

356
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,080
What is this?

357
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,840
It's so close!

358
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,840
Watch out

359
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,500
You're gonna get stuck

360
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,700
Didn't he get stuck?

361
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,080
It didn't hit him

362
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,860
There's only this one left, you can do it

363
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,080
You should try a charged shot

364
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,080
Watch out!

365
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,780
Don't you need it?

366
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,380
Look, these are time-bombs

367
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,200
Yes

368
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,530
Charge shot---

369
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,400
Oh man, but

370
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,630
If you would have switched with me,

371
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,630
I would have beat that boss so easily

372
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,630
Really?

373
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:26,650
Hosei's challenge

374
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:26,650
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

375
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,620
Matsumoto claims to be able to easily defeat the boss

376
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,430
So Hosei will play again and hand the controller over

377
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,540
What's that?

378
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,880
It depends... you got lucky there, Yamazaki

379
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,880
Woah!

380
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,840
Careful there

381
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,650
Hold that shot

382
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,650
Alright

383
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,990
And it's finally time for Matsumoto to face the 1st stage boss

384
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,990
Matsumoto vs 1st stage boss

385
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,990
Let's get over this already

386
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:59,820
Matsumoto's challenge

387
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:59,820
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

388
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,990
I wish

389
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,140
Alright! You did it

390
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,740
Nice

391
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,100
What was that?

392
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,080
I said "nice"

393
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,880
Look

394
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,260
You should try to blow up as many time bombs as you can

395
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,100
Watch out

396
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,780
Go for it

397
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,780
Those bombs are a pain

398
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,540
It's moving so fast

399
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,560
What!?

400
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,200
Huh?

401
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,420
You gotta be kidding me

402
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,420
Huh?!

403
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,800
No way

404
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,320
Alright, I'm done

405
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,320
You were so close

406
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,500
Hosei's

407
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,500
Now it's time for Hosei, who says to be addicted to super famicom

408
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,500
selected game

409
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,040
We don't know them

410
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,000
Looking forward to it

411
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,000
I think

412
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Oden would be a fun game to play together

413
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,500
Oden?

414
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,500
Yes

415
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,510
Kunio no Oden

416
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,510
Released in 1994

417
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,510
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

418
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,160
The game Hosei has chosen is "Kunio's Oden"

419
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,540
It's a falling puzzle game in which you have to stock up more than 4 pieces of oden

420
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,540
oden: japanese stew made of vegetables, eggs, konnyaku etc.

421
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:33,760
As you make them disappear, you get into higher levels, and both speed and difficulty increase

422
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,820
If you can't get rid of them properly, they pile up to the top and it's game over

423
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,400
Hosei starts playing from level 20

424
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,090
Hosei's level 20 challenge

425
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,090
I see

426
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,280
It's like tetris

427
00:10:45,090 --> 00:11:01,380
Hosei's challenge

428
00:10:45,090 --> 00:11:01,380
Kunio's Oden

429
00:10:45,090 --> 00:11:01,380
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

430
00:10:45,090 --> 00:11:01,380
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

431
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,980
Yup

432
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,020
Right

433
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,920
They call these "ochige" (falling games)

434
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,300
4 of them-- yes, it's an ochige

435
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,140
You have to pile up 4 of them

436
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,340
Four of them and then they disappear

437
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,340
Exactly

438
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,660
Ah, a square is ok too?

439
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,760
Yes, anyway you like

440
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,380
Poor Kunio has nothing to do with it

441
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,920
You're right

442
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,250
Hosei's challenge

443
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,250
Kunio's Oden

444
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,250
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

445
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,250
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

446
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,640
You used to play this?

447
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,640
Yeah

448
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,380
I really like ochige games

449
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:20,860
Hosei's challenge

450
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:20,860
Kunio's Oden

451
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:20,860
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

452
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:20,860
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

453
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,920
He's as good as he claimed to be

454
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,480
He makes more and more odens disappear and he gets into higher levels

455
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,860
Nice, look how stable the situation is

456
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,860
Wow, incredible

457
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,970
He entered his stable period

458
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,970
Amazing

459
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:45,190
Hosei's challenge

460
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:45,190
Kunio's Oden

461
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:45,190
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

462
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:45,190
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

463
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,120
But he couldn't keep with the raising falling speed, and odens start to pile up

464
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,310
They're piling up a bit

465
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,310
Are you ok?

466
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,400
Aren't those too many?

467
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,140
Doesn't look good to me

468
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,940
Yeah

469
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,920
Not good at all

470
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,820
You're in a pinch, the one you need is not coming

471
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,650
It's not coming at all

472
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,100
You could have placed an egg in there

473
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,080
You're losing it

474
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,400
The screen is so full-- ah

475
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,920
Level 20

476
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,120
Even though it's been a while since he last played Kunio's Oden

477
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,200
Level 20

478
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,200
Level 23

479
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,840
He manages to clear three levels of it

480
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,660
Following Hosei, Hamada will challenge level 23

481
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:58,800
Hamada's level 23 challenge

482
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:11,580
Hamada's challenge

483
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:11,580
Kunio's Oden

484
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:11,580
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

485
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:11,580
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

486
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,260
Your score was like 140 points?

487
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,260
Yes

488
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,640
You can turn them, you know

489
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,640
You can roll 'em around

490
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,370
How do I do that?

491
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,370
Like that

492
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,940
He just made that one roll

493
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,860
Just like this

494
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,580
I think the difficulty is higher because he started at an higher level

495
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,460
I see, it's level 23 now

496
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,450
So it's harder now

497
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,450
You're right

498
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,800
He hasn't clear a single one yet

499
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:45,780
Hamada's challenge

500
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:45,780
Kunio's Oden

501
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:45,780
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

502
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:45,780
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

503
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
The girl shows your next set

504
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,160
If anything it's rare to see someone not scoring anything

505
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,720
His score is still zero

506
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,800
He didn't get a single one!

507
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
What the-- shut up

508
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,260
How is he able to play it like this?

509
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,760
Are you kidding me?

510
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,500
Not even one

511
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,980
Oh! I got some points

512
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,320
He finally did it

513
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,100
That was pure luck

514
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,960
Try to go for a chain

515
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:37,960
Huh?

516
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,400
You can make combos with chains

517
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Oh, I see

518
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,560
Go for that chain

519
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,560
I think it's too late now

520
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,780
That was quick

521
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,400
It was hard to begin with

522
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,090
Yeah, it was fast

523
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,090
It wasn't easy

524
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,290
Tanaka and Endo are next, but they couldn't keep up with the speed of falling odens

525
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,200
Matsumoto is our last challenger: will he live up to his title of famicom master?

526
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,800
Kunio no Oden

527
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,800
Matsumoto's

528
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,800
challenge

529
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,740
Kunio's Oden

530
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,740
Matsumoto's challenge

531
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,740
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

532
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,740
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

533
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,660
It's "B"

534
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,660
"B" button

535
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,260
This is so freakin' fast

536
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,260
It is

537
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,140
I don't remember it being so fast, geez!

538
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:31,930
Kunio's Oden

539
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:31,930
Matsumoto's challenge

540
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:31,930
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

541
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:31,930
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

542
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,460
I need more of those round things

543
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,960
Come on

544
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,480
Where did all those round things go to?!

545
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,080
Look, he went for a chain!

546
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,080
Woah, there it is!

547
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,980
Take a look at my skills, ya punks!

548
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,160
And here goes the purple thingy

549
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,160
Alright

550
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,280
The eggs

551
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,540
Take this!

552
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,540
Line up the eggs

553
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,430
Go for the eggs

554
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,430
Look at this!

555
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,140
What's that purple thing?

556
00:13:35,430 --> 00:14:03,360
Kunio's Oden

557
00:13:35,430 --> 00:14:03,360
Matsumoto's challenge

558
00:13:35,430 --> 00:14:03,360
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

559
00:13:35,430 --> 00:14:03,360

560
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
I have no idea

561
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,140
It's konjac

562
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,900
Konjac?

563
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,900
You think so?

564
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,770
Shit shit shit I made a mistake

565
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,940
Oh no

566
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,860
Come here, egg!

567
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,860
Waiting for that egg

568
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,360
Here comes

569
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,360
Come here!

570
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,920
What have you done?!

571
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,520
It just came

572
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,500
Oh, nice move, ok

573
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,080
Ok, now wait for the next egg

574
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,080
Here comes

575
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh crap

576
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
You wasted it

577
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,200
Over there

578
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,040
Here's the egg

579
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,040
Here comes the kelp

580
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,760
"Here comes the kelp"...

581
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,300
Well it figures

582
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,680
It makes a difference

583
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,280
It really does

584
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,700
Higher levels are something

585
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,700
Yeah...

586
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,670
Endo's

587
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,670
Now it's time for Endo, who rarely ever plays, to select a game

588
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,670
Selected game

589
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,670
How about this one?

590
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,670
Man...

591
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,320
What do you think?

592
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,060
Oi

593
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,580
Yes

594
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,170
Are we doing this?

595
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,170
What's that?

596
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,410
It's Super Mario Kart

597
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,580
It's Super Mario Kart, the biggest hit on Super Famicom

598
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,580
Released in 1992

599
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,580
Super Mario Kart

600
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,580
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

601
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:34,090
By using the Virtual Console service, you can download them on your Wii U or 3DS and enjoy them

602
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:34,090
Lots of titles from this series were released for famicom, super famicom, gameboy and such

603
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:34,090
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

604
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,740
It's an action kart game in which you play as characters from the Mario series

605
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,090
Like Mario or Luigi

606
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:44,030
By using the Virtual Console service, you can download them on your Wii U or 3DS and enjoy them

607
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:44,030
Lots of titles from this series were released for famicom, super famicom, gameboy and such

608
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:44,030

609
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,010
During the race, you can use various items

610
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,500
Like speed-up mushrooms or items to attack other racers

611
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,180
That's one of its charming point

612
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,700
Each one will compete in a single-player time trial!!

613
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,000
Our members will face a time challenge one by one

614
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,200
We're going to start from Endo

615
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,710
Let's start from Endo

616
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Starting from Endo

617
00:14:50,710 --> 00:15:17,630
Endo's challenge

618
00:14:50,710 --> 00:15:17,630
Super Mario Kart

619
00:14:50,710 --> 00:15:17,630
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

620
00:14:50,710 --> 00:15:17,630
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

621
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,440
The other racers are CPU, aim for that first place

622
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,940
Ok

623
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,440
I see

624
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,420
So 1st place wins, right?

625
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,560
You can do it, Endo

626
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,560
Yeah

627
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,280
This...

628
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,880
It's pretty fast

629
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,900
Grab the item

630
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,300
Get some items

631
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,300
Items?

632
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,390
Inside the boxes

633
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,660
Oi, oi, Endo, are you for real?

634
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,280
You're 8th place, dude

635
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,380
Are you kidding me, oi?

636
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,340
Pretty far from the lead

637
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,160
I can see that

638
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,160
You're so far from the others

639
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,270
You're drunk, aren't you?

640
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:50,430
Endo's challenge

641
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:50,430
Super Mario Kart

642
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:50,430
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

643
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:50,430
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

644
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,680
What are you doing?

645
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,300
Get some item

646
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,300
Take it

647
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,680
What should I do with it?

648
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,610
Just press the A button

649
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,610
Use it

650
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,680
It's better to use it when you're not in a curve

651
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,000
They got past you again

652
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,800
You're one lap behind

653
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,100
Now I'm done for

654
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,100
Enough already, Endo...

655
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,480
This is harsh

656
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,380
I'm so slow

657
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,380
What are you doing? It's hard to watch

658
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,740
Look, everyone is now done, your position number is red

659
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,120
Is that what it means?

660
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,870
Geez

661
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,780
They're already done

662
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,430
Endo is left racing alone, while all the other CPUs already finished

663
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,540
It goes without saying for Endo...

664
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,840
But even the rest of us forced to watch him aren't having fun at all

665
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,340
He's racing all by himself

666
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:04,480
Endo's challenge

667
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:04,480
Super Mario Kart

668
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:04,480
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

669
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:04,480
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

670
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,340
What are you doing?

671
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,220
It's kinda sad

672
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,540
Ugh...

673
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,620
A well deserved 8th place

674
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,280
1 minute and 32,42 seconds

675
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:10,090
Endo: 1 minute 32.42 seconds

676
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,090
Alright guys, consider it your standard to beat

677
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,090
Can we call this a "standard"?

678
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,440
Next up his Hamada: will he beat Endo's record?

679
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,760
Hamada's

680
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,760
Super Mario Kart

681
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,760
challenge

682
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:48,990
Hamada's challenge

683
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:48,990
Super Mario Kart

684
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:48,990
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

685
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:48,990
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

686
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,040
If Hamada doesn't end up on 8th place, he wins to me

687
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,520
I agree

688
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,520
You're right

689
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,840
He's good

690
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,200
I'm not

691
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,500
Look out

692
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,500
I think our position should count

693
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,580
I'm so slow, what the hell?

694
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,220
But man, look at this...

695
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,220
Where should I go?

696
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,320
I know, right?

697
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,320
Yeah

698
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,380
He cleared his first lap, though

699
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,380
He isn't that bad

700
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,480
I'm not good at all

701
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,540
He's pretty fast

702
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,540
The item!

703
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,200
He's rolling around

704
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,600
That's 'cause Tanaka told you to get the item

705
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,600
That's right, don't tell me that

706
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,330
But if you don't take an item, you can't win

707
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,700
He's right

708
00:16:51,330 --> 00:17:02,170
Hamada's challenge

709
00:16:51,330 --> 00:17:02,170
Super Mario Kart

710
00:16:51,330 --> 00:17:02,170
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

711
00:16:51,330 --> 00:17:02,170
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

712
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,260
That's the item

713
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,280
You have to get it and use it

714
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,280
Come on

715
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,680
How do I use it?

716
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,120
They're right behind him

717
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,460
How can't you know how to use it?

718
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,460
I don't know man, you keep on telling me to use it

719
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,870
Yeah, which button is it?

720
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,870
I have no idea which button I should press

721
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:15,480
Hamada's challenge

722
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:15,480
Super Mario Kart

723
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:15,480
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

724
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:15,480
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

725
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,340
In the end, Hamada gets behind everyone else and is left alone

726
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,860
Look at the map at the bottom

727
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,260
Woah

728
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,880
That's slower than Endo's

729
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,640
Like, 3 seconds slower?

730
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:21,190
Hamada; 1 minute 40.97 seconds

731
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,480
Eight seconds, actually

732
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,190
1 minute and 40,97 seconds

733
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,190
That means he's out

734
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,780
I think Tanaka is good at this

735
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,780
Alright, get ready Tanaka

736
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,590
You know

737
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:29,600
I've played the Wii U version before

738
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,800
With your son?

739
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,800
Yes

740
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,960
But that's completely different

741
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,960
Is that so?

742
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,230
Let me try

743
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:47,180
Super Mario Kart

744
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:47,180
Tanaka's challenge

745
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:47,180
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

746
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:47,180
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

747
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,700
Tanaka has confidence in his skills

748
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,760
Huh?

749
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,760
What are you doing?

750
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,820
You should know how to play it

751
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,820
Nope, this is different

752
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,240
You're shaking like crazy

753
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,080
This has nothing to do with the other

754
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,080
Tanaka...

755
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,180
Still on 8th place

756
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,180
This is really hard

757
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,890
He's spending a lot of time over the gravel

758
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,850
Man

759
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,290
It's really hard to use a D-pad

760
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,040
Not going well

761
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:58,390
Super Mario Kart

762
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:58,390
Tanaka's challenge

763
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:58,390
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

764
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:58,390
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

765
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,460
He couldn't get used to the controls and sadly ends up in eighth position

766
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,540
Oh

767
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,180
Around 1 minute 38

768
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:04,070
Tanaka: 1 minute 38.28 seconds

769
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,280
1 minute and 38,28 seconds

770
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,280
I was slower

771
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,070
I was faster

772
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,070
Not good at all

773
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:20,350
Hosei's challenge

774
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:20,350
Super Mario Kart

775
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:20,350
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

776
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:20,350
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

777
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,880
Our fourth challenger is Hosei, a video-game enthusiast

778
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
He's good

779
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,140
He's far from the gravel

780
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,620
I mean, that's how it should be

781
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,840
Right, on the concrete

782
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,350
Yeah, you can speed up properly only on track

783
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,350
Oh no, look

784
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,350
Yamazaki is being reckless too

785
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:35,300
Hosei's challenge

786
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:35,300
Super Mario Kart

787
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:35,300
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

788
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:35,300
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

789
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,880
He hasn't played for so long he lost the knack and couldn't race so well

790
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,240
Alright

791
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,300
Woah, so close!

792
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,300
Yet another eighth place

793
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,580
This is hard

794
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:41,000
Hosei: 1 minute 22.51 seconds

795
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,580
But he did it in 1:22

796
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah, it's the best record so far

797
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah

798
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:48,810
Coming up

799
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:48,810
Matsumoto's Mario Kart full speed drive!?

800
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,500
No way! Can we just pretend that last thing never happened?

801
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,460
Super Mario Kart time attack: it's Matsumoto's turn

802
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:56,420
Matsumoto's

803
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:56,420
Super Maro Kart

804
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:56,420
challenge

805
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,060
Will he escape the eighth position hell?

806
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,260
You see...

807
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,560
And there was something wrong in the way you played...

808
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,560
I've been watching all of you

809
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,560
You were constantly

810
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,560
accelerating like idiots, weren't you?

811
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,280
You have to correctly press and release it

812
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:42,030
Matsumoto's challenge

813
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:42,030
Super Mario Kart

814
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:42,030
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

815
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:42,030
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

816
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,800
It smoked like crazy

817
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,460
On the gravel already?!

818
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
Why so quickly...?

819
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,780
You're always on the gravel

820
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,280
Oh but you used them...

821
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,340
You took a shortcut

822
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,060
Like a shortcut

823
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,060
I see...

824
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,040
Looks like the gravel isn't so bad after all

825
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,020
You can use it as a shortcut

826
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,920
He's catching up

827
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,920
Oh, nice

828
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,740
He relies so much on gravel

829
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,400
The banana!

830
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,030
No way! Can we just pretend that last thing never happened?

831
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,600
Have you ever seen a banana dropped on a road?!

832
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Have you ever seen a banana dropped on a road?!

833
00:19:45,600 --> 00:20:16,330
Matsumoto's challenge

834
00:19:45,600 --> 00:20:16,330
Super Mario Kart

835
00:19:45,600 --> 00:20:16,330
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

836
00:19:45,600 --> 00:20:16,330
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 25 b -8 25 8 25 25 25 b 25 17 25 8 25 0 b 17 0 8 0 0 0

837
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,820
What?

838
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,860
I think you should give up on that trick

839
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,500
Oh, it worked

840
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,780
He's seventh

841
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,780
Nice, he's seventh

842
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,480
That gravel technique is something

843
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,600
It's going well, he can do this

844
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,520
You think so?

845
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,520
Yeah, easily

846
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,080
Really?

847
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,080
Yes

848
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,760
Oh, he got a mushroom

849
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,630
I see, he cut through

850
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,040
He's relying so much on gravel

851
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,860
Seventh place

852
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,880
But it's still way higher than your scores

853
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,570
Matsumoto: 1 minute 18.26 seconds

854
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,570

Let's play SF II

870
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,160

It's a tournament-styled fighting game

880
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,750

Honda is a beast

925
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,230
You ended it only with open-hand slaps

926
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,230
Yeah...

927
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,200
Hosei

928
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,200

The second challenger is Hosei

936
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,320
He fights as Blanka too, just like Endo

937
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,900
That's a dirty move

938
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,900
Here I come

939
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,720
Oh, nice move

940
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,720
Go Blanka

941
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,260
Really nice

942
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,910
He's trying to reach him

943

Got him

944
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,540
Take this

945
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,540

Oh shit!

948
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,600
Gimme a break

949
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,600
You're in a pinch

950
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,940

955
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,260
We have to bring him down

956
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,260

You can change character

963
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,180
Yeah

964
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,380
You're sticking with Honda?

965
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,720
Honda is everything I have

966
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,720
Which one should I pick?

967
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,420
Just pick the one you like

968
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,420
Oh, that one is pretty strong, the indian guy

969
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,640
Which one?

970
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Alright, let's pick him

971
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,640
"The indian guy"...?

972
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,180
Does he look like an indian guy?

973
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,780
Hamada picks DHALSIM for this challenge

974
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,160
Let's bring him down

975
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,750

976
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,750

983
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,980
His movements looks light

984
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,980
Woah! Look how long his legs are!

985
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,980
Amazing legs!

986
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,120
Alright, alright!

987
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,120
Isn't Honda in a pinch right now?

988
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,360
You can do it

989
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,340
You can totally do this

990
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,560
Oh shit

991
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,460
Crap

992
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,460
Honda is in a pinch

993
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,800
Go for it!

994
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,040
Honda did it again!

995
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,340
Alright!

996
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,760
How strong is him?!

997
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,640
Almost there

998
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,220
Oh yeah!

999
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,360
I almost made it

1000
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,360
You got so close

1001
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,830
Matsumoto wins for three consecutive rounds

1002
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,180
He had barely any health left

1003
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,180
I only needed few more seconds

1004
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,640
He's really good

1005
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,640
Honda is a beast...

1006
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,940
Avenge us, Tanaka!

1007
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,660
Alright

1008
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,460
We're counting on you

1009
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,280

00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,880
I want to defeat all of you

1019
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Like that, nice!

1020
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,880
Good

1021
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,260
Use your long legs

1022
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,260
Nice

1023
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,520
Like that, don't let him get close to you

1024
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,820
Block his open-hand slaps

1025
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,600
If you don't, Honda will get you

1026
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,600
That's right, no open-hand slaps

1027
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,840
Nice, go from the above

1028
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,820
Oh no, that's a risky move

1029
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,820
Like that, yeah

1030
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,020
Get away from his slaps

1031
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,020
Don't let him slap you

1032
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,800
Honda is gonna get you!

1033
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,940
He's going to

1034
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,940
Keep on doing that!

1035
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,320
Don't let him slap you!

1036
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,160
Shit, I'm in trouble

1037
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,160
You can win this!

1038
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,040
Almost there

1039
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,040

1040
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,540

Don't let Honda get any closer

1046
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,280
You just need one more hit

1047
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,120
You only need one hit to win

1048
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,380

1052
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,780
Ok, ok
