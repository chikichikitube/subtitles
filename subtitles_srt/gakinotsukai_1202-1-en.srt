1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,980
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai!

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:09,290
My first one-man-show debut!
TKO Kinoshita's Shichi-henge!

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,300
Downtown

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,300
Hamada Masatoshi

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,300
Matsumoto Hitoshi

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,430
Too loud, don't you think?

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,630
That was incredible

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,860
What's your problem?

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,860
I mean, it's perfect for other occasions...

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,800
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,800
Like, in case of SOS or such

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,410
You know? It can come in handy

13
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,450
Alright, tonight we're having our 41st contestant

14
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,120
"First one-man-show", huh?

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,120
You know...

16
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,820
Me and the rest of the staff

17
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,820
Yeah?

18
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,900
Were all like "are we sure this guy hasn't done it before?"

19
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,580
So we made sure to check

20
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,240
And yes, he hasn't done it yet

21
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,240
No, right?

22
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,080
It felt so bizarre he didn't yet

23
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,640
We were all like "why hasn't he done it yet?"

24
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,640
Until now

25
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,560
We have huge expectations for him

26
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,560
Oh my

27
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,030
I'm gonna get so pissed at him if he scores lower than I imagine

28
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,970
Alright, here's our challenger, come in!

29
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,960
TKO's Kinoshita Takayuki

30
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,940
'Morning!

31
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,260
Here they are, Matsumoto

32
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,340
Kimoto Takehiro

33
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,340
Kinoshita Takayuki

34
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,340
Today's protagonist

35
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm so nervous

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,330
What's up?  His partner is here too

37
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,330
You're setting me up

38
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,680
What are you talking about?

39
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,680
Why?

40
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,960
It was you who said "I really wanna do it"!!

41
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,860
That's not true

42
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,390
You told me that yourself

43
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,140
No way

44
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,840
I swear it's true

45
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,180
What are you talking about?

46
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,180
That's not what I mean

47
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,440
Last time we met after shooting High Tension

48
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,030
I had a meeting with the staff and they told me "sign here and you can take part in Shichi-Henge"

49
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,170
And I was like "I see... yes, I'd love to do it"

50
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,170
So, you said it

51
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,940
Of course I said it!!

52
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,880
Does it mean you don't really want to do it now?

53
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,880
No, I want to do it! It's literally the best job for me

54
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,160
That's not it

55
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,160
What the?

56
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,000
No way I'm not going to

57
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,000
That's not it

58
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,820
Matsumoto just before said it felt strange he still didn't take part in it, right?

59
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,550
He told me the same once

60
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,220
Really?!

61
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,120
"It wouldn't be strange if they'd call me, but they're not"

62
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,800
Are you an idiot?!  That's true

63
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,930
Are you a complete moron?

64
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,930
Are you double-crossing me?!

65
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,220
Seriously, is that it?

66
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,700
No, I just didn't say that!

67
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,700
- But you did

68
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,000
He told his manager

69
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,080
"Shichi-henge is what I need right now to step up my game"

70
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,910
Is that so?

71
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,860
I have no idea why he's trying to hide it

72
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,780
Which one is it then?

73
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,780
You said it, exact same words

74
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,080
You wanna do it?

75
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,050
Of course, to me it's like a person you like so much you don't wanna meet

76
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,280
What?

77
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,280
Yes?

78
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,840
Who--?

79
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,360
I mean...

80
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,360
Who are you talking about?!

81
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,160
I mean, this episode

82
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,160
What the hell

83
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,200
I like it so much I'm afraid to take part in it

84
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,400
Take a look at our previous contestants

85
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,400
Here they are

86
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,580
That's how it is

87
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,580
I see

88
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,800
Have you seen any?

89
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,800
- All of them, actually

90
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,180
And how high are you aiming?

91
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,080
At least above the smaller characters part

92
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,850
So, above the 20th?

93
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,850
- Shocking!

94
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,850
- That's right

95
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,550
I mean, yeah...

96
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,590
I still have only 6 transformations at the moment, after all

97
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,250
Huh? What do you mean?

98
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,230
What was that?

99
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,090
At this point

100
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,230
I have no idea if he's joking around or simply anxious

101
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,530
Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

TKO Kinoshita's Shighi-henge
An unexpected turn of events right off the bat!!

104
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,980
What's in there?

105
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,610
Plan meeting

106
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,150
Let's do this one, with Momiji

107
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,020
Oh, a Kyoto trip?

108
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,820
"Matsumoto Hitoshi & Yamamura Momiji's trip around Kyoto"

109
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,820
Gaki no Tsukai plan meeting

110
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,820
"A trip around Kyoto", huh

111
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,820
You like her, don't you?

112
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,380
Well, in one of many ways, yes

113
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,590
Oh, please

114
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,590
I don't know why but I always picture her with red eyes

115
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,500
(momiji = red leaves)

116
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,500
Must be her name
- Yeah

117
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,460
Shichi-henge: start

118
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,080
Ah, makes sense

119
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,200
Kinoshita is nervous, feeling the pressure of his first one-man skit

120
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,230
Cocorico

121
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,230
Endo Shozo

122
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,230
Tanaka Naoki

123
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,230
Tsukitei Hosei

124
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,940
Shichi-henge - Rules

125
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,940
The contestant enters the room with a set of disguises
Whoever laughs at his skits must pay 1000 yen per round

126
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,940
m 0 0 l -25 0 l -25 15 l 25 15 l 25 0 l 0 0

127
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,940
Which transformation will he show us?

128
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,040
Right?

129
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,040
I see...

130
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,840
Not bad

131
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,840
Wow

132
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,910
What should we do?

133
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,910
Don't know

134
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,650
Same problem every time

135
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,580
Can you please

136
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,420
Give me any sort of job?

137
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,380
I wanna join your show

138
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,620
I'll do anything

139
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,970
If I can choose...

140
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,050
I'd like to be an AP

141
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,050
assistant producer

142
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,450
You know why?

143
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,550
Because the producer has to be on site, no way

144
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,480
The director has to review the footage, and his assistant is always busy

145
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,030
But the AP...

146
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,840
I feel like I can do it

147
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,870
I want to meet TV stars

148
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,950
Waiting for them in front of the elevator

149
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,080
And ESH--- escort them to the backstage

150
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,360
The same when they're done

151
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,820
From the backstage to the elevator

152
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,690
Well...

153
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,110
I can't deny I like TV stars

154
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,830
That's why I want to be part of a TV show

155
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,490
Alright

156
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,470
I'll be an AP

157
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,250
I'm gonna get busy soon

158
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,070
Alright alright, time to get busy

159
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,910
I'll give it my best!

160
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,620
I'm coming here tomorrow around 3 P.M.

161
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,640
Or is it ok if it's 4 P.M.?

162
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,130
Alright then

163
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,980
You're gonna make good use of me

164
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,110
And the same goes for you, guys

165
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,950
Alright, I'm an AP

166
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,540
I almost laughed, but for a different reason!

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,680
But we're all safe, right?

168
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,050
Everyone: safe

169
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,240
Are you ok, guys?

170
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,920
He got really nervous

171
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,390
Like, crazy nervous

172
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,390
He was, right?

173
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,460
Man, he was so nervous!

174
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,460
Yeah, I can tell

175
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,190
That stutter almost got me there...

176
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,190
That's the type of stuff you gotta watch out for

177
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,020
You were almost literally laughing, Hamada

178
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,020
Not true, not true

179
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,560
But I was about to, I didn't know what to expect

180
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,560
You saw him, right?

181
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,140
And after he was done, there was sweat everywhere

182
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,260
Right on the table, I was like "oh boy, he's dying"

183
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,200
Right

184
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,440
I think it didn't go as he planned it to

185
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,440
Yes, definitely

186
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,080
I think that's how it went

187
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,080
Makes sense

188
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,060
He probably thought "that's the part where they'll laugh"

189
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,060
Yes, definitely

190
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,140
That's it

191
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,490
He put everything at stake

192
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,490
On the line, yeah

193
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,790
Does he usually sweat that much?

194
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,790
He does

195
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,810
Everytime I glanced at him, it kept on flowing down

196
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,810
That's true

197
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,830
You know, he did a surgery to stop his forehead sweating

198
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,500
Are you kidding?

199
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,500
I'm not

200
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,380
They do this surgery here to stop you from sweating

201
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,880
But it doesn't seem to work

202
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,360
It really didn't

203
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,360
Yeah, his... his sweat is stronger

204
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,810
So it was useless after all

205
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,810
I swear, he really did

206
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,810
And he still sweats?

207
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,640
Saying he wanted to be an AP...

208
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,120
Mmhh...

209
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,120
Yeah

210
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,470
What's going on?

211
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,820
What...

212
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,150
What is this?

213
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,930
I'm freaking out

214
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,990
I can feel a button... is it going to set me free?

215
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,030
I'm pressing it

216
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,710
I'll press it!

217
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,110
No way!

218
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,850
It hurts like hell

219
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,100
W-wait--

220
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,580
My right eye hurts like hell

221
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,780
Is there something I can do about it?

222
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,970
This--

223
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,240
I've reached my limit here

224
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,320
I can't stand this

225
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,750
Please-- what can I do?

226
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,130
Penalty

227
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,460
Penalty

228
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,030
Penalty

229
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
I think I'm safe

230
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,520
It hurts

231
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,900
What was that?

232
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,660
Why on the same button?

233
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,160
Again?

234
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,030
It started again

235
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,230
What does this mean? What's going on?

236
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,000
Is this a bug or something?

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,310
What's the meaning of this?

238
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,660
What the-

239
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,160
What's going on?

240
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,210
What the hell!

241
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,190
Put them in

242
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,400
Did you see that?

243
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,400
That's crazy

244
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,180
It almost came off at the beginning

245
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,180
I saw that

246
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,890
That's no good at all, to have it coming off

247
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,890
I mean

248
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,540
He fiddled with it too much

249
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,540
He was just doing this and it almost came off

250
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,090
I couldn't believe it

251
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,320
Geez...

252
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:47,630
The collected money will be given to the Kobato foundation

253
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,520
That wasn't really safe

254
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,440
Yeah, it's dangerous  His right eye...

255
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,720
You can tell he was in trouble

256
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,720
Right

257
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,960
At one point he was so hurt that he
took the mask off while talking

258
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,960
Yeah, I saw that

259
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,210
Over his eye, yes

260
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,840
And from that point on, a waterfall of sweat

261
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,810
It never stopped since then

262
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,810
Right, absolutely right

263
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,180
Goddamn it...

00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,960
Penalty

265
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,860
His face...

266
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,600
Take a look at his face...

267
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,670
His face

268
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,940

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,940

Penalty

271
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,470

278
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,290
This is so dumb

279
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,730
What the hell was that

280
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,900
He scored a lot with this one

281
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,900
Yeah, this one was good

282
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,010
But again, I saw more sweat drops than teardrops

283
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,420
They just won't stop

284
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,670
Not many tears there, but oh boy the sweat

285
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,680
Nice, huh?

286
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,190
Feels nice?

287
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,130
It feels so nice to me

288
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,720
Don't you think so?

289
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,340
It's good to play around once in a while, right?

290
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,460
Right?

291
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,940
Wanna sit down a bit?

292
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,960
Like this, there

293
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,990
Don't you think it's great to play around once in a while?

294
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,360
You're great, don't you know that?

295
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,420
If you were only a bit cuter I'd be nervous

296
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,800
But you're just fine

297
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,740
She's just about right, ain't she?

298
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,200
Am I right, huh? I found a really good one, right?

299
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,030
Look at her! Isn't she just fine?

You think so too, right?

314
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,440
We got it, we got it

315
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,920
Yes? That's nice! Don't you think you're fine too?

316
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,360
Don't you?

317
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,100
You got here just fine when I asked you

318
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,200
I mean, you came as soon as I called you

319
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,180
Right?

320
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,460
What the hell is he talking about?

321
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,460
Really, it's just fine

322
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,230
Go away, idiot

323
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,230
He's an idiot

324
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,600
Shall we go? It's the best time to go

325
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,600
Go away

326
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,600
This is fine

327
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,920
Really good

328
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,400
He's such an idiot

329
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,400
That was fun

330
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,140
It was really fun, yeah

331
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,140
Yeah, can't deny it

332
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,580
I'm not sure that girl knew what was going on

333
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,580
I think so too

334
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,850
What do you think was on her mind during it?

335
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,690
I don't think she got it

336
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,690
Right, I don't think so

337
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,430
Oh boy

What the-?

348
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,460
Was that a monster or something?

349
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,460
Sounded like one

350
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,010
He was fighting something incredible

351
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,010
That's crazy

352
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:45,350
It's funny how only during the
tug of war skit he didn't sweat that much

353
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,460
You're right

354
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,460
It's the opposite

355
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,430
You're right, I expected him to sweat more

356
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,820
A rush of penalties on the chaotic second half?!

357
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,820
Coming up

358
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,430
That should have been normal

359
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,830
Sorry, excuse me

360
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,630
Hello?

361
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,310
I'm at work-- why are you calling me?

362
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,910
I told you not to call me

363
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,450
I'm done with you Taro

364
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,120
Because you

365
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,960
You kept me that secret

366
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,820
And I couldn't do anything

367
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,580
And yet you're calling me now

368
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,060
I can't now, everyone's here I just--

369
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,960
I'm telling you I can't

370
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,020
I told you so last time, didn't I?

371
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,830
Alright...

372
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,540
One last time, ok?

373
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,620
Excuse me

374
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:32,760
He's waving the pincers up to the sky

375
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,560
You got your eyes on somethin' good

376
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,970
Fresh and delicious crab dishes

377
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:51,040
Ah, Kyoubashi is such a nice place

378
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,910
Come here to Grand Chateau

379
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,020
He's waving the pincers up to the sky

You got your eyes on somethin' good

386
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,430
This is where he sweated the most

387
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,430
He was drenched!

388
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,430
Oh, stop

389
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,370
I almost laughed thinking about the sweat

390
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,370
That was something

391
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,980
Oh boy

392
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,280
Feels like he's a human being

393
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,730
Why does it feels like it?

394
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,250
You, kid!

395
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,020
Wait

396
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,560
Isn't this my bicycle?

397
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,880
Where do you think you're going?

398
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,970
I just got in that store for a moment

399
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,940

Where are you going?!

403
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,950
Some people would say

404
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,640
Maybe you stole it out of a sudden impulse

405
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,420
But still...

406
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,900
That doesn't give you the right to steal it!!

407
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,120
Did you steal it?

408
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,910
Is that how you're being educated?!

409
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,790
Is that how your dad has raised you?!

In the end?

413
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,180
Huh?

414
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,930
Oi, shitty brat

415
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,090
You shitty brat!

418
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,490
Did you steal it and realized there was a
dog in it, or did you focus on the dog?

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,230
You fucking brat!!

420
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,700

That dog is incredible

He's drenched in sweat!

437
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,770
That's too much

438
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,930
Can someone sweat that much?!

439
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,740
Do you like it?

440
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,740
Such big sweat drops

441
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,970
Do you like dogs?

442
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,160
Hey

443
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,650

It's finally time for the results!!

449
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:30,730

450
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,730
That was so funny on so many levels

451
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,870
Alright

452
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,540

453
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,540
Oh my, 40'000 yen

454
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:40,500
40'000 yen

455
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:40,500
Tenth place

00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,460
Nice

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,500
That's where you wanted to be!

459
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,500
Wow, tenth!

460
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,080
That last one was really something

461
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,080
Oh, I'm glad

462
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,740
That was really good

463
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,740
We laughed so much at that

464
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,210
We all thought the same today: can a human sweat that much?

465
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,580
That's right

466
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,320
Man, human potential is unbelievable

467
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,980
It came out when I didn't expect it to

468
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,980
Yeah, with big drops too

469
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,860
And that shitty brat didn't have a drop on him

470
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,890
So smooth, not even a particle
