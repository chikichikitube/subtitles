The usual Gaki no Tsukai backstage

00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,730
Do you have any clue what this thing here could be?

00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,760
Downtown

Matsumoto Hitoshi

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,930

What the heck!

12
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,330
Don't attempt such dirty jokes against your will!

13
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,130
It pisses me off

14
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,060
I know right?

15
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,360
What was that for?

16
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:18,860
Excuse me

17
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,330
Excuse me!

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,400
And we're in

00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
'Morning

23
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,200
It was about time

24
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,630
'Morning

25
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,200
I knew you two would pop out

26
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,600
More importantly,

27
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,060
What's the reason for the shirt they made you wear?

28
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,400
We've been told to wear them from Tanaka

29
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,460
He did?

30
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,100
note: On the shirt "OUR TANAKA"

31
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes

32
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's on the back too

33
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Pretty powerful

34
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,530
It's TOO MUCH for me

35
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,200
To be honest we really don't know

36
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,800
But he said "I can now see what was dim before"

37
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,000
I have already enough of this

38
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,340
I feel you

39
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,570
He also said "Anyway, just come"

40
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,800
Hey!!

41
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,730
Where do you think you are stopping?

42
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,530
Oh I'm sorry...

43
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,530
YOU'RE ON MY WAY!

44
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,860
All the rage towards the world came back inside this human

45
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,130
They worshipped the man carrying all this madness like this...

46
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,890
OUR
TANAKA

47
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,360
On their way to the studio where Tanaka is waiting

48
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,740
It appears that his madness has awakened once more...

49
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,460
Wha-?

50
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,730
Good morning !!

51
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,640
Oh, there he is

52
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,000
What's going o-   - Good Morning!

53
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is filthy

54
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,600
I'm sorry!

55
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,260
Something fishy it's going on

56
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,860
What's that? I think I may or may not seen it before

57
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,500
Exactly

58
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,660
You know

59
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,600
There has always been something that made me feel uneasy

60
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,300
I swear

61
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,200
What's that?

62
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,330
You know, on our "No Laughing" series...

63
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,800
I've always been thai-kicked

64
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,530
Without any sort of explanation, unreasonably

65
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,060
Well, if you say "unreasonably" keep in mind that we go through some pretty unreasonable stuff too

66
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,120
That's because the program itself is unreasonable

67
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,120
Hey, Tanaka! Look here!

68
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,980
You're getting a thai-kick, scum!

69
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,860
At the end of the year, on our "No Laughing" serie, as a custom

70
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,730
I had enough!

71
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,530
All the unreasonable thai-kicks kept on happening

72
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,330
IT HURTS I CAN'T STAND THIS ANYMORE!

73
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,420
This is the reason for Tanaka's madness

74
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,600
So basically

75
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:03,330
Total of times it happened during No-Laughing series till now: 8 times

76
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,330
What I had been thinking all the time

77
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,930
Is that it would be way better to thai-kick someone

78
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,180
Rather than being thai-kicked myself

79
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:14,450
Tanaka's realization:ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooi


It's better to perform a thai-kick rather than receiving it

80
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,930
Not anything I wasn't expecting him to say

81
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,650
Yeah, I can understand him

82
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,860
Yeah but the way he speaks...

83
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,400
It's too much  - There's no hatred in his tone

84
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,820
So, ya know...

85
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,530
He didn't hear a thing we said

86
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,800
Today

87
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
What I'm gonna do

88
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,030
Is to call here on this studio all the people who recently made me angry

89
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,400
For what they did or said on TV

90
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,060
What?

91
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,060
What's the deal? - Yes

92
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,860
You mean tv stars?

93
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,350
Exactly

94
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,260
So basically

95
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,630
I'll ask them lotsa questions

96
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,060
And I'm gonna thai-kick the hell outta them

97
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,460
As soon as they make me angry

98
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,200
I think there's gonna be more than a problem with this

99
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:43,740
Tanaka's realization:ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooii


Questions to the guests ➡ thai kick if they make him mad

100
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,130
I want to make them taste

101
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,660
Whether or not

102
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,800
A rage-induced thai-kick is unreasonable

103
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,130
Eh?

104
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,800
I don't think it's a good thing

105
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,820
What do those people think they're coming to do here today?

106
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,660
They're coming believing it's an episode of "we've asked 100 people"

107
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,460
"We've asked 100 people"?

108
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,860
I mean, "100 things"

109
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,700
So they think they're gonna be interviewed

110
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:02,750
Quiz: 100 Thingsoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooii


It's a show were, in the form of a quiz-show, the guests arei
asked about their private life / way of thinking & behaving

111
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,060
I'll call out the guests

112
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,200
Making them think it's "100 things"

113
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Yeah but, isn't it kinda awful?

114
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,700
It's worth it

115
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,530
Ok but...

116
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,230
Have you ever met em all before?

117
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,440
Like, just 2-3 of them

118
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,260
Everything just became more awful!

119
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,030
Let's just stop

120
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,760
I told you today I'm gonna go for it

121
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,390
No way

122
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,420
Tonight, Tanaka will strike the unreasonability of thai-kicks
In the arse of comedians who don't know anything about !!

Tanaka will ask questions to the comediansoooooooooooooooooo

If he gets angry, he'll push the voice-button and strike a thai-kick

132
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,060
I think it's also pretty harsh for us to just stay here and watch

133
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,550
We didn't do anything to begin with

134
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,450
Right

135
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,760
Besides---   - Our first guest's entering!   - What, for real?

136
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,260
My heart is kinda racing

137
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,530
I wonder who's coming

138
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,460
I'm coming in!

139
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,730
Good morning

140
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,530
Oh

141
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,130
Oh, it's Shinoyama-kun

142
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,860
'Morning

143
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,730
G'Mornin'～ !!

145
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,060
Good morning

146
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,860
G'Mornin'!

147
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,500
Uhh, well, Tanaka is...

148
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,930
Somehow today Tanaka's acting a bit strange...

149
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,660
So sorry for that

150
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,130
Stand right here, here!

151
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,600
Why don't we have him talk to you first?

152
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,660
Endo knows him, right?

153
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,800
Do you know each other?

154
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,670
Nope !!

155
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,670
Err... nice to meet you

156
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,660
'Sup

157
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,260
Get here

158
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,300
Right here, yes   - This is somehow incredible

159

TV STARPPP
SHINOYAMA
AKINOBUPP.

160
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:21,820
His father is Shinoyama Kishin, his mother Minami Saori

He's currently working on NHK as a reporter etc. for "asaichi"

161
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,000
Akinobu Shinoyama

162
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Both his father and mother are famous characters

163
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,930
And he's the thouroughbred of the entertainment industry

164
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,460
Something that infuriates Tanaka!

165
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,260
This is bad, this--

166
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,000
So, ya said your parents are famous, huh?

167
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,400
Who's ya pops?

168
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,000
"Pops", he said

169
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,600
Well I think...

170
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
My dad's huhhh...

171
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,130
I think that's a pretty rude way to refer to him

172
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,130
He's a photographer, he's also a writer

173
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,200
Right, I read that

174
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,600
Who's ya mama, huh? Huh?!

175
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,500
Who's ya mama?

176
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,000
She...

177
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,730
She... used to be a singer bac-

178
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,730
A singer ya say?

179
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,800
Yes a singer, Minami Saori...

180
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,400
So today you recorded huh?

181
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,500
※On this day, Shinoyama shot the live broadcast for NHK'S "Asaichi"

182
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,200
It was a live broadcast, huh? I've watched that

183
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,530
Yes, it was for my morning news program     - Oh, is that so?

184
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,800
And I had to shot my relay as a repor-

185
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,460
Ya totally sucked at being funny

186
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,100
What does it have to do with him?   - He's not a comedian, you know

187
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,860
Tell me now

188
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,130
Yes?

189
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,130
What club were ya in at school?

190
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:02,800
My club?

191
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,460
Yeah, tell me what club activity ya were doin'

192
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,200
He's asking a lot...    - Yeah

193
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,530
My club...

194
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,480
I've always been doing

195
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Both soccer and the drama club

196
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,600
Which kind of drama?

197
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,600
More than acting on a play

198
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,720
I took part in several musicals in english back th--

199
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Are ya sayin' ya can speak english?

200
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,870
To be honest I can't speak it at all

201
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,720
Try sayin' something in english that ya like

202
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,460
Something in english that I like?

203
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,930
Just tell me somethin'

204
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,260
English words I like...

205
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,460
I guess in the end

206
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,400
Th-that's got to be "LOVE" or something...

207
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,100
What's going on?

208
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,530
Shinoyama: Thai-kick

209
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,400
Wait that's---

210
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,000
Stand there!

211
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,930
Excuse me but...

212
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,460
Weren't we supposed to do the "100 thin-

213
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,800
So predictable, "LOVE" or something

214
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,600
W-wait

215
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,460
Oh, so that's how you're gonna do it?

216
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,460
Hold him, License

217
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,060
Why a thai-kick...?

218
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,130
Huh? Tanaka-san... what's going on?

219
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,800
A thai-kick

220
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,570
W-wait...

221
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,520
This is scary

222
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,200
Are you for real?

223
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,660
UGH

224
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I bet that hurt

225
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,400
It definitely hurts

226
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Are you ok?     - We're sorry for that

227
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,130
What was that for?

228
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,000
I bet he's angry        - Yeah, it was painful

229
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,450
He... he's not listening to us

230
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,600
Now ya free to go, c'mon

231
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,010
A-are we done already?

232
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,860
Yup we're done here dude

233
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,000
C'mon you can go now

234
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,000
But... haven't you said you've watched my morning program, before?

235
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,730
I did

236
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,300
By the moment I was done with it

237
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,800
I rushed to come here from Katsuura, in Chiba

238
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,660
I see

239
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:38,300
※It takes roughly 3 hours from Katsuura to this stage

240
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,800
So you got here in hurry to do the 100 things show

241
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,730
Yeah I've been told we were going to do that

242
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,300
Yeah yeah, we're done with it, it's over

243
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,270
CRUSHED

SHINOYAMA AKINOBU

244
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,260
That kick... was for real?

245
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,060
Yeah it was

246
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,600
Tanaka, let's just stop this

247
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,930
It's no good if you do that for real   - Yeah dude

248
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,200
Don't worry it's ok

249
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,530
On top of that



there's no connection between Katsuura and Thailand

250
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,090
I think the next one is about to come too

251
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:58,530
Really?

252
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:58,930
Yeah

253
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,930
I'll have you look at it

254
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,000
Well I think that may be a problem
- Yeah, I'm really bad at this...

255
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,350
He even said "nice to meet you"

256
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,240
Sorry for the wait

257
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,260
The guest will be entering now

258
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,260
Alright, there it is!

259
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,330
Who will it be?

260
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,030
I'd say it would be better to stop this

261
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,130
Yeah, like, just being here watching is--

262
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,260
Good morning!

263
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,000
Mornin' !

264
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,460
Morn---

265
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,330
G'Mornin', mornin'

266
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,270
A girl is...

267
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,560
Maybe it's a bit harsh if it's a girl, Tanaka

268
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:29,020
IDOLPPP.
KIKUCHI
AMIPP.P_

269
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:29,020
She debuted as the 16th member of "Idoling!!!"

Now she's an indispensable being in variety shows

270
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,200
Ami Kikuchi

271
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
The fact that she's the idol who appears the most on variety shows

272
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Made Tanaka snap!

273
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,660
Get over here

274
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,200
You're being rud-

275
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,260
Here

276
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,670
What is this?

277
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,040
What is this?

278
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,460
What is this?

279
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,000
What is this?

280
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,860
Nothing nothing nothing, don't worry

281
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,930
Huh? Oh I see

282
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,330
Questions... was it?

283
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,370
May ya tell me ya name?

284
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,130
Ami Kikuchi

285
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,130
Ami Kikuchi, huh?    - Yes

286
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,930
I'm 22

287
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,730
Where ya from, huh?

288
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,600
From Hokkaido

289
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,530
Hokkaido?

290
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,230
And since when ya came here to Tokyo?

291
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,600
Since I was a first grader

292
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,000
Highschool, huh... and what are ya doin' now?

293
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,260
Eh? My Job? I'm an idol

294
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,660
Is there, like, a place ya like to go buy clothes ya often go to?

295
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,640
Yes...

296
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,800
Of course there is

297
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,200
It's Shibuya's 109

298
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,060
109?

299
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,800
Yes

300
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
Ya like 109?

301
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,860
Sorry but what is this?

302
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,600
It's ok it's ok    - Just play along

303
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,800
What's with him?

304
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,400
Oi! Ya know,

305
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
I've heard 'bout that

306
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,330
About what?

307
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,130
Looks like Hamada-san it's pretty into ya, aight?

308
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,860
Oh, yes

309
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,200
Come on!      - Really?

310
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,860
Yeah that's right I--

311
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,860
S'dat real?!

312
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,460
Yeah, it's true, I swear

313
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,860
How about ya do the opposite thing

314
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,330
Yes..?

315
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,440
And tryna say what's good 'bout Hamada-san instead?

316
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,600
Something appealing?

317
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,260
This pace...

318
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,400
Maybe the fact that he has this image

319
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,260
Moreover, what the hell is this, so irritating!

320
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,900
Of him being seen as a scary guy

321
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,330
He's actually not that at all, he's really nice

322
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,000
Like when we were all together at the lobby...

323
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Wait, have we started already?

324
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,430
Yeah we started

325
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,090
Eh? Wha-- why, this feels somewhat wrong

326
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,290
Who cares 'bout dat?

327
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,290
JUST TELL ME!!

328
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,730
Like when everybody got up at the lobby

329
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,470
He said to everyone "come on, don't worry, stay down"

330
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,660
And whaddya think ya aimin' to be from now on?

331
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,060
How do ya want to be in the entertainment industry from now on?

332
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,090
From now on...

333
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,030
I guess someone like Katsumata-san...

334
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,030
note: I guess she's refering to Shizuoka-born comedian Katsumata Kunizaku

335
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,330
Wha-wha-what's going o---

336
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,090
Kikuchi: Thai-kick

337
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,130
Wh-wh-what's happ-

338
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,400
What's this? It's unsettling

339
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,400
I could have not imagined ya would pick him outta everyone!

340
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,330
What? But why?

341
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,500
You're kidding, right?

342
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,400
This will be painful to watch

343
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,200
You're kidding, right? Right?

344
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,530
It's not just you doing this    - Don't worry

345
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,530
I'm scared...

346
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,530
GYAAAAAAAAAAH

347
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,500
That was surely painful

348
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,400
It totally went "BAMMM"

349
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,200
It made a clap noise!

350
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,000
That's no good

351
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,660
That hurt like hell, what was that for?

352
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,460
I know I was told today we were recording, but...

353
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,300
You can clearly see that bit of regret in his face

354
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,150
You're reconsidering this, aren't you?

355
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,660
You can tell by his face    -  It's getting clearer

356
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,130
Don't say such bullshit...

357
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,130
CRUSHED

KIKUCHI AMI

358
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,530
Tanaka you... you sure you're not reconsidering this?

359
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,530
Ooh no way, I'm not

360
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:48,860
You su-

361
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,200
It won't happen

362
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,600
No way I'm going to regret this

363
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,860
You're face is becoming a bit twitchy though

364
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,460
You're right

365
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,460
But when this is over you're going to apologize, right?

366
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,000
No no, I won't do that

367
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,530
Even the fact he's doing this with no context for them...

368
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,970
The guest will be entering now

369
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
C'mon c'mon c'mon!

370
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,000
Here we are again, starting from the guest's puzzled look

371
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,200
...Good morning

372
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,600
G'mornin' !

373
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,730
Here comes another big one    - This time it kinda...

374
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,400
In a way I think this couldn't be helped

375
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,200
Come here, come here

376
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:24,770
CHOREOGRAPHERPPP.
PKABA-CHAN

377
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:24,770
She's the coreographer for songs such as SMAP's "sekai ni hitotsu dake no hana"

Her eccentric look makes her stand out even in the world of transexuals

378
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,800
Kaba-chan

379
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,730
Her eccentric look makes her stand out even in the crossdessers panorama

380
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,730
How is Tanaka going to pick a quarrel?

381
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,680
I want to kick her too    - What's with this style?

382
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,530
Why are you dressed like this?

383
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,260
I want to do it too, Tanaka

384
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,400
What is she holding?

385
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,660
Are ya already makin' fun of me? What's ya name?

386
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,400
Kaba-chan--

387
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,930

388
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,660

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
She's 43!?

392
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,800
She's 2 years older than us       - 43!

393
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,400
What are ya holdin' in ya left hand?

394
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
I would have asked it too

395
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,900
What's inside it?

396
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,500
It's a ladies set

397
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,800
What do ya usually do everyday?

398
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,600
I have a tea with Midori-chan...

399
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,870
Who?!

400
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,260
Who's she

401
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,930
Who's this Midori-chan?

402
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,930
My transvestite friend Midori-chan

403
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,860
My transvestite friend Midori-chan?     - Yes

404
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,600
Oh I see, Midori-chan the trans....

405
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,260
Ya always hang out with Midori-chan?

406
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,370
Yeah

407
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,600
So ya two are basically dating, right?

408
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
No no no!

409
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,530
We're both women so that can't be happening

410
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,530
It's nothing like that

411
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,480
Kaba-chan: Thai-kick

412
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,480
Why?

413
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,690
You made me snap!

414
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,960
W-wait

415
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,400
Why? Why?

416
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,400
It's better if you stay still
- Yeah, don't move or it could be dangerous

417
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,200
Huh? Why? Why is this--

418
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,170
Be careful

419
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,260
What are you gonna do?

420
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,960
IT HURTS!

421
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,860
Ouch ouch ouch     - That may have hurt

422
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,730
I think it hurted a bit

423
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,200
Kaba-chan?

424
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,800
Are you hurt?

425
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,660
You can think of it as a sort of vaccination

426
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,460
That way the pain will be duller, right? It's fine it's fine

427
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,330
It was painful...

428
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,110
I bet it was      - What is this?

429
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,410
We're done here, Kaba-chan

430
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,530
Wha-?

431
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,860
We're done with this

432
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,160
Say Kaba-chan...

433
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,530

Yeah I do ♥

438
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,060
I don't like her getting close to me so happily

439
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,030
But

440
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,030
Since I caught Rubella

441
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,630
At the end in January

442
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,230
It seems like my @#%&£ was gone ♥

443
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,800

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,920

ACTORPPPP
JINBOPPPP.
SATOSHIPP.

464
00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:00,490
He's a big actor who starred in several movies and dramas,

His most famous one being "Aibou". This is his first encounter with Tanaka

465
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,690
Satoshi Jinbo

466
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,190
How will Tanaka, who has never meet him before,

467
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,260
Debut in front of this actor he doesn't personally know?

468
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,060
. . . .

469
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,060
Startin' now I'm gonna make ya a bonch

470
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,700
Of questions

471
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,930
"A bonch of questions", he says

472
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,200
Ok

473
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
So answer me, ok?

474
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,460
Ok

475
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,730
You're close    - That's too close

476
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,230
Let's keep the distance, Tanaka

477
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,240
Ya name is?

478
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,470
Satoshi Jinbo

479
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,610
The way he asks his questions is weird

480
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,940
How old are ya?

481
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,210
I'm 50 years old

482
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,650
He's way older than him

483
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,580
What's ya hobby?

484
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,580

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,980
My hobby is golf

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,250
How much can ya spin ya golf club?

487
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,920

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,260
I get around 100 meters or such

489
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,060
Is there a club ya particularly like?

490
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,260
A club I like?

491
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,730
Oh you mean a golf club I'm good with?

492
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,660
Is there?

493
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,670
He has never done it, why is he asking?

494
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,730
I like the Sand Wedge

495
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,140
. . . .

496
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,140
And whaddya like about SANDWICH?

497
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,940
It's not "sandwich", it's "sand wedge"

498
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,240
Not "sandwich"

499
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,040
You're embarrassing

500
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,840
The hell are ya laughin' at?

501
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,710
Huh? Why you ask?

502
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,910
I said, why are ya laughin'?

503
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,980
Well 'cause you said something funny

504
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,120
How about ya try to tell me ya favorite golf-related term?

505
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,490
Do questions like this one exist?

506
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,790
We talkin' 'bout golf terms, tell me ya favorite one, c'mon

507
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,260
"Body" (swing)    - I can see he choose that

508
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,260
And why do ya choose "body"?

509
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,900
Givin' there are a lotsa golf terms why d'ya choose to tell me "body"?

510
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,130
'Cause if I manage to get a body I'm happy

511
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,940
Aren't there other good ones?!

512
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,200
Yeah, like "Eagle"

513
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,570
And why didn't ya say "eagle"?

514
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,970
'Cause I can't really get an eagle

515

YA PISSING ME OFF !!

516
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,040

519
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,510

The hell, dude

523
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,790
I bet he has no idea what's going on

524
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,590
Do I have to stick out my butt?

525
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,990
Your butt, yeah

526
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,660
THAT HURT!!

527
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,400
That must have hurt, we're sorry for this, Jinbo-san
- I bet that hurts, we're sorry

528
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,070
Man, for real...

529
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,740
Yeah really, this one...
- It looked painful!

530
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,040
Feels like something came out from it

531
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,210
I know what you mean, really

532
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:01,180
It's just a momentary feeling, it shouldn't last for long

533
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,510
Why was I kicked?

534
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,980
You made him mad 'cause he's doin--

535
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,850
I mean, that's the first time we met

536
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,520
Well technically yeah...

537
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,250
Yup, that's right

538
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,250
We're done here!

539
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,290
Thank you for coming, we're sorry
- Thank you, we're done

540
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,130
But... wasn't I supposed to answer some questions?

541
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,130
There are no questions       - We're done with this

542
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,330
We have to go on now

543
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,930
He looks angr--

544
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,530

Thank you!

547
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,600
He looked a bit angry      - Ok  - We're done with this

548
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,340
Tanaka...   - You did something bad

549
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,340
Jinbo-san looked a bit angry

550
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,210
I think Jinbo-san was actually a bit mad

551
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,280
Yeah the way he spoke...

552
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,710
May I?

553
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,880

Katsumi is a senpai 11 years older than Tanaka, Sayuri 2 years older

557
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,860
The married couple manzai duo, Katsumi & Sayuri

558
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,590
Needless to say, they're both big senpais to Tanaka

559
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,260
How will he attack them?

560
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,130
The atmosphere feels terribly wrong

561
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,400
He's not really acting as the usual Tanaka

562
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,600
He always greets us so happily

563
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,110
Is that so? Why don't you just do that instead?

564
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,940
What's ya name?

You know them

566
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,110
They're senpais, it feels wrong if you talk to them like this

567
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,910
I'm Katsumi!

568

What do you mean?

594
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,930
What's happening?

595
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,130
Not Katsumi-san?

596
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,060
He's spared

597
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,130
Just Sayuri!

598
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,260
Must be because of her answer     - Yeah

599
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,000
Don't let her go, License!

600
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,870
You're kidding, right? Are you kidding me?

601
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,270
We're sorry, just endure this

602
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,610
Katsumi too has no idea what to think while watching this

603
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,880
Hey be careful, don't--

604
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
AAAAAAAAAAAH!!

605
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,650
That was painful

606
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,520
It hurts!

607
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,920
That hurt so bad

608
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920

He's really polite     - He is, yes

616
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,730
One time

617
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,140
There was this pretty girl on make-up in Osaka who said was a fan

618
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,400
And I went to ask her phone number for him

619
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,780
He just laughed!

620
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,210

You went through this for many times by now    - Right

626
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,260

683
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,010
He may not be renting it

684
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,450
Ya selling lots?

685
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:30,880

Enough of this!
- Come on, Tanaka!

692
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,190
Why do ya choose the room ya have?

693
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,200
Who cares?

694
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,460
Tell me why you choose it

695
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,270
Let's just stop fussing over this

696
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,340
Dude your teeth are really dirty

697
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,810
Hyadain: Thai-kick

698
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,210
Eh? What do you--

699
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,710
Does it mean that...?

700
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,180
I don't get it!

701
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:08,720

What was that for?

704
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,930
It happened so out of the blue

705
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,330
Is it cause I told him his teeth are dirty?

706
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,730
I think he's probably regretting kicking you

707
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,830
Isn't that true?

708
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,470
No I'm not

709
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,400

You're actually regretting this, right?

CRUSHED

HYADAIN

713
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,380
Unprecedented unreasonable thai-kicks

00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,520
How many unreasonable thai-kicks have we went through until now?

715
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,390
All the resounding screams and jeers

716
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:51,460
note: narrator voice same as the text

717
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,790
And then...

718
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,460
The source of Tanaka's anger will finally show itself

719
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,930
Anyway

720
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,300
"Thai Kick"

721
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,200
We have to call him, if I don't manage to thai-kick him

722
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,800

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:07,210
Tanaka accidentally pushed the voice button he's holding

Oh     - What happened?

726
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,910
He must be agitated

727
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,210
That's nothing good too

728
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,450
This whole thing was completely useless

729
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,720

00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:37,940
He's in charge of thai-kicks in the No-Laughing serie

He's the source of Tanaka's anger along the others

743
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,140
Who made him face countless hardships

744
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,440

772
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,730
He has answered for real, "play"

773
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,470
He could have said "which places does your wife like"

774
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,330
Are ya going out together to play?

775
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,530

00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,540

Tanaka: Thai-kick

782
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,360
It said "Tanaka"

783
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,540
Something's wrong! That's not how it was supposed to go!

784
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,320
As expected, the real deal strikes harder!

785
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
It must have hurt

786
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,460
Oh, amazing! How was it?

787
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,630
It was unavoidable at this point

788
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,630
He stored too much grudge from them

789
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,700

790
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,800
