1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,660
8th Ever - Gaki No Tsukai Chiki Chiki

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,660
"Are their hearts connected?"

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,060
No Smartphones Meetup!

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,310
So loud

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,800
It's been 2 years

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,710
2 years?

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,340
He was really loud wasn't he?

8
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,300
I wasn't being loud

9
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,340
The 8th installment of a project designed to test their bonds!

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,910
The Rule: They head to a location using the theme card given to them
The challenge ends if  they all meet up

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,310
Looking back at past installements, there is one troublemaker who holds them up

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,940
What do you mean? That's-

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,920
Tanaka always hold us up

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,110
Tanaka, we're really counting on you

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,570
You guys-

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,400
You always head straight to Komazawa Park don't you?

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,430
I just went there for the parking lot one

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,430
He spends so much time there it's like his neighbourhood

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,290
You get me right?

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,630
Like maybe he can find a cast away dog to bring home

21
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,810
Time for the first theme

22
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,770
"An Oasis in the City"

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,800
What's that?!

24
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,000
This is difficult

25
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,710
What is that?

26
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,520
You don't want us to meet up at all do you?

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,970
Honestly!

28
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,090
What cruel bullies!

29
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,590
Such a vague concept

30
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,910
Well, let's say farewell for this first one

31
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,230
Yes, I think we won't meet up

32
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,260
But you know, it's OK if none of us meet

33
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,260
No it isn't!

34
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,260
subbed by senor_wristband

35
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,360
If you'd like to support my subs, consider donating @ ko-fi.com/buresurettosan
Any support is appreciated :)

36
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,890
There's no way I would go there!

37
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,150
I've gone and done it!

38
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,690
13:05 - They depart from NTV

39
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,400
It's been 2 years?

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,570
What does this theme even mean?

41
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,710
I have no clue where to start picking a place

42
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,890
Well I thought of that sauna, the one I always go to

43
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,890
But who the hell would head there. To my Sauna

44
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,660
I think Yama-chan, and Matsumoto,

45
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,430
I've heard there's this sauna they both went to

46
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,430
There was one

47
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,460
But I don't know what sauna that is

48
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,280
If you asked me to go to a sauna I mean

49
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:18,000
Hamada and Hosei are thinking along the same lines,
In this project, it's important to consider what other's might be thinking

50
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,200
TEXT I'll get really flamed if I end up on the highway,

51
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,230
TEXT I'm going to avoid the highway as much as possible

52
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,970
And then the troublemaker Tanaka, who wants to rid himself of that name today

53
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,830
You can't think of anywhere?

54
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,710
Nothing comes to mind

55
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,990
It seems that once again Tanaka will draw the ire of the other members

56
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,710
It's not exactly an oasis, but,

57
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,630
It was a place you looked forward to,

58
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,630
In the past, you know,

59
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,000
When I was really into golf,

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,970
We just, hung out, chilled afterwards

61
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,000
Got something to drink, smoked our cigarettes,

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,030
And just chilled out

63
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,540
Can you tell us the destination please?

64
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,860
My bad, my bad

65
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,460
"How many balls do you think we hit?"
We just hung out there afterwards

66
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,670
If I think along those lines, it's JIngu Gaien's driving range

67
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,030
Should we go there?

68
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,510
It seems one man has confidence in his choice

69
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,170
Keeping another person's thinking in mind will help meet them faster

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Let's do this

71
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,570
What sort of place do you have in mind?

72
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,540
I can say this,

73
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,770
It's gotta be Hibiya Park right?

74
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,860
Oh, you're thinking along those lines?

75
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,630
Yeah. It's an oasis for salarymen to relax in the afternoon

76
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,510
And consdering the TV show angle,

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,930
My real answer is Gotanda though

78
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,930
TN: Matsumoto might be referring to Gotanda's red light district

79
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,030
Oasis can mean "a place for workers to unwind"

80
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,690
That's the intended meaning

81
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,940
There were 2 other men who thought the same as Matsumoto

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
One of them, is Endo

83
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,110
The first one,

84
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,830
Hibiya Park

85
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,370
Salaraymen really do think of that place as an oasis

86
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,460
And the other one,

87
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,170
In Daikanyama,

88
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,400
The TSUTAYA, that image

89
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,800
Let's go to [!@$!@$!@]

90
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,430
Which location did Endo choose?

91
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,280
And there was another man struggling to pick a place

92
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,890
You can't think of any place?

93
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,890
I do have some ideas in mind

94
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,820
An idea ...

95
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,230
For example?

96
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,230
For example, Hibiya Park

97
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,540
For working salarymen,

98
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,540
Them eating there lunches in the afternoon,

99
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,030
That's one idea I had,

100
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,140
That's the first one I thought of

101
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,170
Any others?

102
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,090
As for others,

103
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,830
There's gotta be water I think,

104
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,440
When you think of an oasis

105
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,630
Shinobazu Pond

106
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,230
Yes, in Ueno

107
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,830
In Ueno

108
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,600
The migratory birds too,

109
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,000
They think of that place as an oasis, and they rest there

110
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,710
Thinking in that sense,

111
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,540
Shinobazu Pond

112
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,880
Your second choice?

113
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,630
My second choice

114
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,890
Which one should we go to?

115
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,970
Mr. Driver, can we head to [!$@!@] please?

116
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,810
What will Tanka's answer be?

117
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,540
Right away, there's a chance 3 people will meet up

118
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,800
Healing places ... like temples, or fun places?

119
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,860
The first one I thought of, Sensō-ji temple, in Asakusa

120
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,170
And in Yoyogi, Meiji Shrine,

121
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,490
Ueno Zoo,

122
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,540
Shinjiku Lumine Theatre

123
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,370
And also that sauna in Shimbashi I keep brining up

124
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,080
But there's no way they'd go there...

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,940
Let's try Panda-chan!

126
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,350
Panda-chan?

127
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,690
Isn't Ueno Zoo an oasis?

128
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,510
I think someone will show up

129
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,160
If Tanaka is heading for Shinobazu Pond,

130
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,730
There's a chance they can meet!

131
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,130
There's a good chance 4 people could meet someone at the first theme!

132
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,970
What will happen?

133
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,740
"Are their hearts connected?" No Smartphones Meetup!

134
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,980
With the first hint, there's a good chance 4 people will meet someone!

135
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,930
Things like "Oasis", stuff that is...

136
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,420
Sensual, something that heals the soul,

137
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,890
Those guys don't do that

138
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,600
They're the type to have a lot of plaque in their teeth

139
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,710
Well we're almost there

140
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,560
7 minutes after leaving NTV, Matsumoto arrives at his City Oasis

141
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,280
Colder than I thought

142
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:54,530
Hibiya Park, an oasis for salarymen

143
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,620
There's no way nobody will come

144
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,630
If that happens then we're just done

145
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:12,580
Expectations remain ... Tanaka and Endo said Hibiya Park as well. They are yet to arrive.

146
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,220
It depends on what they think an oasis is

147
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,320
Almost there

148
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:28,090
Did Endo arrive at Hibiya Park? Or at Daikanyama's TSUTAYA?

149
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,760
Thank you very much

150
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,430
Woah the air is totally different at this oasis

151
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,840
Ahhh, feels nice

152
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:47,960
Endo chose Daikanyama's TSUTAYA...

153
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:54,270
It's sort of like seeing Diamond Head in Hawaii. "Woow I feel refreshed!"

154
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,510
That feeling is exactly the same

155
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,220
"Aloha Table"

156
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,580
Wow it even says "Aloha Table"!

157
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,600
It says "Waikiki Aloha Table"

158
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,470
That's exactly what I'm talking about!

159
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:13,440
And the other one who said Hibiya Park, Tanaka arrives

160
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,530
We'll arrive soon

161
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,420
Yeah already, we're here we're here

162
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,670
We're here

163
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:32,620
Is he arriving at Hibiya Park? Or Shinobazu Pond?

164
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,690
Alright we're here

165
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,180
Ueno Zoo, very nice

166
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,040
What do you think, it's nice isn't it?

167
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,510
Even these buildings, it feels like an oasis in the city

168
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,490
Unfortunately, they did not meet up

169
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,760
Even if nobody comes here,

170
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,360
They definitely won't complain that I chose this place

171
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,160
In the end, nobody came to Hibiya Park

172
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,840
I told you right? They're idiots

173
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,240
I have to go to the hospital today

174
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,360
Meanwhile, Hosei gets out at Ueno Park

175
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,270
Aiming for Tanaka!

176
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,380
Cocorico's Tanaka Masayoshi

177
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,620
See, look. It's an oasis!

178
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,420
This is an oasis in the city

179
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,070
C'mon come here

180
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,130
He targeted Tanaka alright,

181
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,970
But even within the same park, Hosei is at the zoo, and Tanaka is at the pond

182
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,200
Since they're in different spots, there's no chance they'll meet

183
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,380
I have no expectations really

184
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,290
And of course, nobody came to Hamada

185
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,420
Meeting is really difficult

186
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,600
With that, time's up!

187
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,490
Of course right? They won't come here

188
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,560
There's no way. I bet nobody met up for sure.

189
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,500
They call to report their locations

190
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,820
Matsumoto-san, whereabouts are you?

191
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,540
Seriously,

192
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,900
"An Oasis in the City", right?

193
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,900
It's gotta be Hibiya Park then!

194
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,550
What do you mean "Uwaaahh!"

195
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,300
Seriously?~

196
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
I've gone and done it!

197
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,150
It's gotta be here, there's a fountain and everything

198
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,500
I've really done it now...

199
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,050
Hold on, where's Hamada?

200
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,550
I'm at Meiji Jingu's driving range

201
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,930
Man cut it out!

202
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,800
That's not an oasis

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,170
Just cut it out. There's no way I'd go there!

204
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,250
Man I can't rely on you

205
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,500
Endo, where are you?

206
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,850
I'm in front of the TSUTAYA in Daikanyama

207
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,050
What the hell?

208
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,050
What the hell?

209
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,000
What the hell?!

210
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,550
This place is super Oasis!

211
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,750
He's touched a nerve I think

212
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,100
Yama-chan where are you?

213
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,130
It's gotta be a park

214
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,890
Yeah, Hibiya Park

215
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,030
It's gotta be Ueno Park!

216
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,700
Oh man you're at Ueno Park?

217
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,220
There's a lot of people who feel it isn't an oasis!

218
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,370
Alright, the troublemaker Tanaka

219
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm at Shinobazu Pond in Ueno

220
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,370
Enough of that

221
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,200
Why are you at Shinobazu Pond?!

222
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,600
I can understand choosing Shinobazu Pond at least

223
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,050
Just let me say this; Which of you thought of Hibiya Park

224
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,110
Endo here

225
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,820
I did

226
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,360
And you Hamada-san?

227
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,000
I did, I did

228
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,070
You lying idiot!

229
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,930
There's no way

230
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,560
Absolutley not

231
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,200
I'll just tell you, I have to go the hospital today. I have an appointment

232
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,570
So get this over with

233
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,910
Let's do this!

234
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,130
It was Hibiya Park after all

235
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,930
If we all went there we could have had 4 people, excluding Hamada

236
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,930
They all went to parks huh

237
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:29,490
I did say Hibiya Park. But I thought the theme was more general than that

238
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,930
So I'm still feeling good about this

239
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,300
50 minutes since the start, and nobody has met up

240
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,400
Starting fresh with the next theme

241
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,750
"A large overhead pedestrian crossing"

242
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,750
This is very general

243
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:59,050
In Namikibashi, from Daikanyama to, I think it was Ebisu,

244
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,350
The one in Namikibashi is pretty big

245
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,600
Take me there. Take me to that place in Shibuya

246
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,050
That one,

247
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,570
Since Hamada-san is at Meiji Jingu, he'll head there right away

248
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,640
It's gotta be that one right?

249
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,500
In Shibuya, that one is pretty remarkable

250
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,650
There's one in Shinjiku also...

251
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,450
Either one

252
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,320
It really is either one

253
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:40,660
Already, three people have said Shibuya. A good chance of a meetup!

254
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,700
It doesn't have to be a single crossing right?

255
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,200
Right? Then it has to be that one

256
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,750
Is there one?

257
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,300
There is!

258
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,100
Do I have to say it?

259
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,950
It has 4 crossings!

260
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,450
It's huge!

261
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,520
It's not just 1 crossing, there's 4 of them

262
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,560
What do we do here, it's gotta be that one!

263
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,830
Which crossing is it that Hamada has such confidence ?in

264
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,070
What driving range was Hamada talking about? I didn't ask that

265
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,800
It was Meiji Jingu I think

266
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,300
Oh yes, Jingu

267
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:32,000
Maybe he'll go to Shinjiku ... He probably won't think of that one

268
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,050
It's definitely the one in Shibuya

269
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,560
Is the crossing Hamada heading to in Shibuya? Or ...

270
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,300
There's two of them in Ueno

271
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,310
Ah I see

272
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,440
But still there's a chance they could turn around and go to Shibuya,

273
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,600
I think there is a chance it's Shibuya, but ...

274
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,780
There's 4 crossings!

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,700
If he's not going to Shibuya, then where?

276
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,950
Hold on, considering the direction...

277
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,330
Shibuya, or Roppongi,

278
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:26,950
In Roppongi, in Arc Hills, I used that pretty often

279
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,270
Either Shibuya, or Arc Hills,

280
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,600
Excuse me driver, can we head to [!@#!@$!]?

281
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,420
Where did Tanaka choose?

282
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,200
If it's Shibuya, there's a chance 4 people will meet!

283
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
However,

284
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,800
However, If I see a bigger crossing on the way there,

285
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,400
Let me choose that one

286
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,100
And then...

287
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,100
That one is pretty big isn't it?

288
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,650
Hmm?

289
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,680
Hold on ... Sorry, can I change mine?

290
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,400
This one is pretty big

291
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,150
That is huge

292
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,120
Now that I've seen this,

293
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,390
After seeing that one, I'm feeling unsure,

294
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,400
With that, the slim chances of meeting up are gone

295
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,750
Thank you very much

296
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:29,950
He changed his choice on the way there ... This is what makes him a troublemaker

297
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,200
It's bigger than the one I thought of. There's no way they can complain about this

298
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,860
2, 3

299
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,900
There's more for sure, 3

300
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,000
4,

301
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,990
5, 6, there's gotta be more on the other side,

302
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,200
This is a lot

303
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,130
This is a lot, I didn't know about this one

304
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,350
Meanwhile, Matsumoto arrives at his Shibuya crossing

305
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,000
This is what I'm talking about

306
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,750
Doesn't that look impressive?

307
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,450
Right away, he waits at the meeting location

308
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,150
He waits for the other 2 who said Shibuya

309
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,450
And then!

310
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,450
Good work!

311
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,450
TN: Matsumoto can't see the orange subtitles so he doesn't know Endo is speaking

312
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,450
Who is it? Who is it?

313
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,550
Yes yes yes yes yes!

314
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,750
Right? Right?

315
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,750
Is that Endo?

316
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,000
Good work!

317
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,850
Oh it's Endo!

318
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,050
Endo where did you come here from?

319
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,440
Oh yeah Daikanyama, that's why it took so long

320
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,850
It's definitely here right?

321
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,700
It's gotta be here

322
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,250
I think this is the biggest in Japan

323
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,950
It's the biggest in Japan

324
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,450
It's gotta be the biggest in Japan

325
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,020
They're messed in the head if they don't come here

326
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,850
They're idiots if they don't come here

327
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,350
They really are idiots

328
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,200
However I haven't forgotten you went to Daikanyama

329
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,150
Meanwhile, Hamada also arrives at the crossing

330
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:17,800
Where is this huge crossing he has confidence in?

331
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,650
Look!

332
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,900
There's 4 of them!

333
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,810
It's so big, look at it!

334
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,300
It is the Tengenji Pedestrian Bridge in Shibuya

335
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,800
They're idiots if they don't come here

336
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,600
Idiots

337
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,650
No, just look at it. Ryousuke (Camera-man) film it properly

338
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,090
There's 4 of 'em!

339
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,700
Exactly that moment, Hosei arrived ...

340
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,200
He's heading towards Tengenji where Hamada is!

341
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,300
Ah, that one is pretty big

342
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,050
Is that the Tengenji crossing?

343
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,650
This one is huge too

344
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,180
There might even be someone here

345
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,400
But I never thought of Tengenji though

346
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:12,500
Hosei's destination is not Tengenji...

347
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,250
However, at this place ...

348
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,650
Ah, there!

349
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,100
Where?

350
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,000
Hamada-san

351
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh shit he's there! Hamada-san's there!

352
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,210
Oh no!

353
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,700
Oh shit he's there! Hamada-san's there!

354
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,650
Ah! Hamada-san!

355
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,650
Huh, is that Yama-chan. Wait, he's not stopping at all!

356
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,650
He's kidding right?

357
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,050
What do I do? I can't go back there can I?

358
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,250
Yes that's right

359
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,200
Damn Hamada-san was there!

360
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,000
A near miss for Hosei!

361
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Then where is he heading?

362
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:05,650
Hosei passed right in front of Hamada's eyes. Where exactly is he heading?

363
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,500
This one here, this one

364
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,300
It's big right? That's a big pedestrian bridge.

365
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,950
Shibuyabashi

366
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,850
Since Ebisu is right there, we would meet up here a lot

367
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,050
This bridge is pretty big right? This place here,

368
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,300
I thought someone else would be here

369
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:33,050
Hosei is smack dab in the middle of Hamada and Matsumoto,

370
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,920
They've just missed each other by 2km

371
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,280
And with that ...

372
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,920
No way!

373
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,020
Really?

374
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,120
They call to report their locations

375
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,400
Tanaka where are you?

376
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,200
I'm at the bridge in front of Ueno Station

377
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,080
In front of Ueno Station?

378
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,480
Man, you think about yourself too much

379
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,140
No listen, it's so big I can't see all of it!

380
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,640
Shut up!

381
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,920
No no no, that's not the point,

382
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,510
But that is the point. Where are you guys then?

383
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,820
Matsumoto, and Endo have met up!

384
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,960
You met up with Endo?

385
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,600
Besides Shibuya Police station, there's a massive overhead crossing

386
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,400
There it is, someone met with Matsumoto

387
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,910
You guys get it right?

388
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,270
Yama-chan and I had a near miss

389
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,560
I apologise

390
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,910
I'm at Tengenji right now

391
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,180
It's just a normal crossing

392
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,140
There's 4 bridges here, 4!

393
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,140
How many do you think we have?!

394
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,600
Yamasaki where are you?

395
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,980
I'm in Ebisu,

396
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,560
The overhead crossing for Shibuya-bashi

397
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,400
If you're already in Shibuya then why didn't you keep going?!

398
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,100
There's a bigger one just ahead of you!

399
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,670
Well this is one is really convenient

400
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,970
Convenient?

401
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,970
Next week!

402
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,200
No Smartphones Meetup Finale!

403
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,910
Tanaka has an epic fail!

404
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,020
I've gone and done it

405
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,240
And one man tries to break the rules!

406
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,240
Maybe I'll go home

407
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,820
Don't miss it!

408
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,510
C'mon, let's get off,

409
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,980
I don't wanna
