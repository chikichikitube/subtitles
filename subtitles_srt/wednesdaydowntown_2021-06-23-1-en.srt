00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,040
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,860
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,140
It's Jinnai Tomonori!

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,340
Good relationship, right?

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,940
Let's get to the point

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,500
Please take a look

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:35,010
2nd Among the people you know, if you confess in the order of how much you like them, and you'll find someone within 100 people, no matter who you are

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,410
The ending of the 1st edition previewed the 2nd

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,880
But what happened the first time around?

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,850
Please see the review

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,720
The last to test this hypothesis was...

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,460
Papa's Hoshino Disco

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,990
Who confessed to he liked in the order of how much he liked them

14
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,700
At the 16th person...

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,170
Please go out with me

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,200
Eh--?

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,770
With Miyuki...

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,280
I have discussed the matter that I like Disco

19
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,790
It came out

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,720
A succesfull coupling

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,560
Or so it seemed

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,890
As expected... Ito...

23
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,400
I like you

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,730
But we haven't been out on a proper date yet

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,670
He was told "i'll consider it after a date"

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Indeed

27
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,070
As he couldn't give up on the 13th person, Ito Chinami

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,390
He ultimately didn't choose Ami

29
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,810
And after a few meetings with Ito

30
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,420
He confessed again

31
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,390
If you can, please go out with me

32
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,740
However

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,730
I can't get into a relationship with you

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,000
Unfortunately, he failed

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,010
On the other hand, Ami, who clearly confessed but was rejected

36
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,680
Didn't Disco do this project?

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,510
So...

38
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,980
Can I try it too?

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,720
I want to have a boyfriend, really

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,820
With all my heart

41
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:18,990
Volunteered?

42
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,130
And so, the 2nd edition follows suit

43
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,230
Ponloop Ami's 100 person confession project!

44
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,710
So, Kanda, this theory

45
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,710
If you did it, there'd probably be no problem

46
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,210
No, I don't think so

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,610
It's 100 people, after all

48
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,620
I don't even know 100 people

49
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,120
Ah right

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,550
What do you think, Shibuya?

51
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,530
Well, honestly...
-Confident?

52
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,290
Confident

53
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,790
For sure!

54
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,960
If its 100 people, it should be possible

55
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,420
To validate this theory

56
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,940
Now is not the time to be indecisive

57
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,040
With 5 years of experience, Pon Loop's Ami, 28 years old

58
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,810
By the way, how has your love life been so far?

59
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,270
Couldn't have dressed up a bit?

60
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,450
So far... the number of years without a boyfriend equals my age

61
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,290
Neither confessed nor been confessed to

62
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,090
The majority of students at her high school were girls

63
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,700
And in college she became passionate about comedy

64
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,330
That's how Ami has never experienced love head-on

65
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,110
I kind of think it's time for a relationship

66
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,980
Seems like a good girl

67
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:58,330
So, she was asked to seriously consider the person she wanted to date for a week

68
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,450
The day of confession arrives

69
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,960
Only the thought of a relationship is on my mind

70
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,180
Ami's first choice is...

71
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,280
Determined

72
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,460
Not bad, not bad

73
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,300
Oswald's Ito

74
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,640
The first time we met was about 3 years ago

75
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,170
Really?

76
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,280
Picked him as number one?

77
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,140
It was love at first sight, so to speak

78
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,280
So

79
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,810
"Hello"
-You've worked hard

80
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,310
Want to meet

81
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,980
"Hey, what? What's wrong?"

82
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,120
Called Ito to TBS

83
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,020
Her first confession in life begins

84
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,220
Looks kinda nervous

85
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,820
Thank you for your hard work

86
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,890
Hey, what's going on here?

87
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,490
No, that...

88
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,810
The wind is so strong

89
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,990
Could you please have a seat first?

90
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,090
Sit?

91
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,160
On the bench?
-Yes

92
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,100
Although it may be insignificant to you

93
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,600
When recording a show with you

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,310
With your group and mine

95
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,140
In the backstage, the atmosphere was pretty cold

96
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,880
At that time, only Ito came to our side

97
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,520
Really, that...

98
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,090
"Don't worry so much about whether this works or not. It's okay."

99
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,870
So gentle

100
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,560
This is what you said to me

101
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,020
You probably don't remember

102
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,690
Hmm...

103
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,330
I was really saved by those words

104
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,220
The bangs

105
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,530
Gradually, that...

106
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,340
A handsome vibe appeared

107
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:30,380
Think I like Ito

108
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,510
The back is flowing

109
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,110
What kind of haircut is this?

110
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,180
Hmm...

111
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,400
Like a character actor

112
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,050
I like you

113
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,180
I like Ito

114
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,320
Would you go out with me?

115
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,920
Very clear and direct

116
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,660
Well, that...

117
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,500
So, um...

118
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,330
Ah, I'm very sorry

119
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,670
Ami is unfortunately rejected by her first choice

120
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,010
I just see you as a junior

121
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,010
A close junior

122
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,220
Is that what you think of me?

123
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,080
Yes, that's for sure

124
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,350
Well that also makes me happy

125
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,860
To be honest I think it's quite suspicious

126
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,320
The phrase "cute junior"

127
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,030
It's fine to be a "cute junior"

128
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,600
And he said it casually

129
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,070
As its just the first person, I'm starting to realize

130
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,870
It's starting to get a bit scary

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,210
But i'll continue with a positive mind

132
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,780
So

133
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,960
Awesome

134
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,900
The second place is Shogo

135
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,800
They're all comedians

136
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,390
Really

137
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,050
Well, I think it's not possible

138
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,220
It is better to have a good relationship but also distance with juniors

139
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,730
Ah...
-That's what I think

140
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,030
She's still a "cute junior"

141
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,510
Then

142
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,450
Another comedian

143
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:09,910
"I just see you as a junior"

144
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,240
"That's all I've thought up until now"

145
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:19,250
That is, as a fellow comedian

146
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,480
Youtuber？

147
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,290
"I think of you as an interesting senior"

148
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,590
Comedy writer

149
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,420
"I think of you from that perspective."
-Hmmmmmmmm

150
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,080
And

151
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,060
"I have a girlfriend at the moment"

152
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,770
Ahh...

153
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,130
College junior

154
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,440
I thought none of them have girlfriends

155
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,110
I took this into consideration when making the list

156
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,910
Indeed

157
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:48,460
From her first confession in life, Ami is rejected by 6 people in 3 hours

158
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,020
In 7th place is...

159
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,020
Timon D's Maeda

160
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,090
We have a good relationship

161
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,680
Unexpected choice

162
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,260
And we go out to eat

163
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,080
This is a different thing from falling in love

164
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,190
We also go to concerts together sometimes

165
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,670
The closest male so far, Maeda

166
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,370
Thank you very much. Sorry

167
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,710
If you can

168
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,180
Would you be able to go out with me?

169
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,380
Ahhh so

170
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,850
Yes, that, yes...

171
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,850
Did you say "I like Shogo"?

172
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,690
I still remember you said "I still like Disco"

173
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,960
Did I say that?

174
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,030
Don't remember?

175
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,030
He knew...

176
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,830
Have I told that many people?

177
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,700
I'm surprised by myself

178
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,040
I'm not feeling so good about myself

179
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,410
I really like you as a person

180
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,540
Really?
-Really

181
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:00,220
It's true... I feel like I like you
-Is it true?

182
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,220
Well, I have a girlfriend now

183
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,130
Why are you a little angry?

184
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:14,010
After that, she also contacted former college seniors, comedians and staff members

185
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,240
16 people

186
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,670
So tough

187
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,270
Successive confessions in order of preference

188
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,290
Is her mental state okay?

189
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,540
Mental state must be not so great

190
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,040
I think of you as a sister

191
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,920
After 9 hours

192
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,860
She's been rejected 17 times

193
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,260
Too strong

194
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,280
Honestly, in terms of Mimori...

195
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,790
What do you think of me?

196
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:39,690
"Eh? No, eh... the feeling of people of the same age?"

197
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,090
We are indeed the same age

198
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,960
"Yes"

199
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,930
"It's the feeling of a close male classmate"

200
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,030
Eh?

201
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,630
Eh?

202
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,400
I get it

203
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,340
"Eh, no, that..."

204
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,340
Thank you very much, really

205
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,740
Sorry to call you so suddenly

206
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,280
The mood became very bad

207
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,340
Please continue to look out for me

208
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,240
Thank you very much

209
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,850
"Is it that awkward? What's going on here?"

210
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,850
Thank you very much. Sorry

211
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,890
Just wants to hang up the phone quickly

212
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,510
"Eh, what is this?"

213
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,660
Hurry to the next

214
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,780
Indeed, such a situation, it can become...

215
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,020
It's dangerous. It's really dangerous

216
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,920
I was just about to confess

217
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,120
This is no different from confessing...

218
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,490
Seems very petty

219
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,800
At 9pm

220
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,910
The 19th male

221
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,300
Juicemans' Yojiro

222
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,830
Juicemans?

223
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,170
A comedian?
-Comedian

224
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,170
Loads of comedians

225
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,980
Calling unexpectedly at night

226
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,780
Long phone calls with him

227
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,520
If you don't like someone, you wouldn't do it, right?

228
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,940
Why?

229
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,750
Indeed

230
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,520
That's what I think, at least

231
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,410
Maybe

232
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,700
A seemingly obtainable goal

233
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,690
The 19th man

234
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,230
How exactly will it develop?

235
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,940
Very handsome

236
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,760
Thank you for your hard work

237
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,890
Yeah pretty attractive

238
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,670
So urgent, what's wrong?

239
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,870
In regard to you

240
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,840
I like you

241
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,040
I just want to get it out there

242
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,180
So I invited you here today

243
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,880
To date?

244
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,120
Yes...if you can

245
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,640
He said it straight

246
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,190
If possible, I would like to go out

247
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,890
Although I think it would be good if we could play together as before

248
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,960
I really like baseball

249
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,230
I know

250
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,730
Although I would like to be with someone

251
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,600
But that...

252
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,210
I need my own space

253
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,500
Need time for your own interests
-Yeah, yeah, yeah

254
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,170
Time to watch the game

255
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,850
I am also the type of person who needs their own space

256
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,020
I see

257
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,290
Don't want to be tied down

258
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,280
Is that ok?

259
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,680
Hesitating

260
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,080
What do you think?

261
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,020
Is there any other factor that you think is necessary?

262
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,060
I didn't know before

263
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,860
Didn't know that Ami liked me

264
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,400
So with that in mind

265
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,470
What comes after

266
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,040
I think its possible

267
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,860
Considered

268
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,870
To be honest, it's not an immediate "I like you too" feeling

269
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:09,760
I see

270
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,010
But we can go out on a date, that's no problem at all

271
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,840
Eh, really?

272
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,210
It's okay to go on a date

273
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,220
If I had to decide today

274
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,720
All I can say is sorry

275
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,560
OK

276
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,570
A possibility

277
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,860
To wait until after the date... although leaving the possibility

278
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,560
Ami was told a relationship straight away is not possible

279
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,130
How do you feel now?

280
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,500
I really don't want to expect too much

281
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,610
Although it's a bit of an understatement to say that

282
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,640
But I want an "on the day boyfriend"

283
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,090
On the day boyfriend

284
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,350
Why?

285
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,050
This kind of thing will not happen!

286
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,740
So into the second day of confession

287
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,220
This kind of thing has to be accumulated over time

288
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,150
What'll happen on day two

289
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,720
I feel like I'm back in the right frame of mind

290
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,960
I'm approaching today with the feeling of starting afresh

291
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,130
Very positive mindset

292
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,860
The 20th male that such Ami wants to date is

293
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,860
Ultra Boogies' Sasaki

294
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,500
He is very gentle

295
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,170
To be honest

296
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,740
If pressure is put on him

297
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,310
He might go out with me

298
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,170
So

299
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,500
What is she saying!?

300
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,510
Can you go out with me?

301
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:29,090
I don't think of you in a romantic sense

302
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,780
Although rejected once...

303
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,060
The strategy changes to apply pressure

304
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,230
What's going on?

305
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,860
But really...

306
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,230
Do you have a girlfriend now?

307
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,400
No girlfriend

308
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,500
Anyone you like?

309
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,570
No

310
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,940
Really...

311
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,670
No, it's...

312
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,350
This isn't how you should confess

313
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,080
In any case, the precondition of something first

314
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,680
Precondition？

315
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,410
Just do not have preconceptions

316
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,420
Eliminate the concept of fixation
-Hmm

317
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,920
Don't say you can't date me because I'm a second generation female comedian

318
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,590
Don't worry about such factors

319
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,720
I think there is definitely

320
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,820
That... because

321
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,570
What are you talking about?

322
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,390
In a relationship sense?

323
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,760
Yes, relationships

324
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,160
Yes, but...

325
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,030
But I can only answer what I think

326
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,650
Indeed

327
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,800
But it may not be accurate

328
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,440
No, that's my decision

329
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,140
Pressure confession strategy failed

330
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,010
That's a sure failure!

331
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,640
She had a vicious look in her eyes

332
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,310
Things are getting worse and worse

333
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,650
After confessing to more than 20 people

334
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,740
Ami is becoming stronger

335
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,160
Is it possible in the future?

336
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,720
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."

337
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,290
Answer too fast

338
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,560
The 25th place is

339
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,930
Former comedian, Ochimori's Ochi

340
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,410
All types of people

341
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:56,970
I have feelings for Ochi

342
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,980
The feeling of like

343
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,610
Really?

344
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,510
The tone of voice is kind of different now

345
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,120
Ah, so

346
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,820
Well, as a junior, you get a perfect score

347
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,690
Ah, okay, I don't need to hear the rest

348
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,430
I think what you're gonna say afterwards will be very annoying

349
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,130
Not so good

350
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,930
As a girl.
-Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I said, "Okay."

351
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,320
Don't be like that!

352
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,270
As a girl to see
-Dangerous, okay, okay, wait, what, what, what, what?

353
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,250
What do you mean by danger?

354
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,440
Wait, really don't say it

355
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,740
Hey, what? I don't know what you mean.
-No, I really...

356
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,100
Wait a minute. What? Okay, stop it.
-No, in the future...

357
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,770
Okay, okay, okay, okay, why?

358
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,730
This is not a confession

359
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,770
Don't know what you mean

360
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,640
In the future...
-All right, all right, all right, all right, stop it

361
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,210
What's going on here?

362
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,480
Impossible, its impossible

363
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,880
What kind of conversation is this?

364
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,380
I can't do it, but I hope you can...
-No, no, that's not what I meant...

365
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,150
I'll cheer myself up, okay?

366
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,980
Please don't say it.
-What do you mean?

367
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,240
What kind of conversation is this?

368
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,590
Next in 26th place was 2nd place Shogo's partner Takeru

369
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,310
What just happened?

370
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,760
I like your personality

371
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,530
His partner

372
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,730
Not just personality, how to say it...

373
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,660
I like you

374
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,100
In terms of dating

375
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,000
Can you tell me if it's doable?

376
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,500
No, this is the one...

377
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,540
It is possible, right?

378
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,370
No, no, no, no, no, no

379
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,870
It's okay, right?
-No

380
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,210
Sorry, no

381
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,050
The theory is that you can find love within 100 people if you confess in order of your preferences

382
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,180
I see

383
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,680
Which place am I?

384
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,850
26
-No, it's so low...

385
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,990
It's too low

386
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,360
But really...
-What about Shogo?

387
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,920
2nd place

388
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,620
Not good

389
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,160
I just shouted

390
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,560
Don't get both members of a duo involved!

391
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,900
Really, don't do both

392
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,260
You should just choose one, right?

393
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,300
It can't be helped

394
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,430
You just happen to be a duo
-Don't go for both

395
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,070
Just like the two people themselves form a combo

396
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,540
It can't be helped

397
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,400
Indeed

398
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:33,930
That's the reason. I understand

399
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,310
So many comedians

400
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,970
Why are you angry?

401
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,240
This is what it looks like

402
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,310
I'm really sorry about this

403
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,080
I am the type of person who considers male comedians as the opposite sex

404
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:48,320
After that, she continues to confess to the "other sex" of comedians

405
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,560
How many more people does she like?

406
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,290
I also have strong intentions

407
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,600
I also want to go out with a model or an idol

408
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,280
Good point

409
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,670
If you become popular you have a chance, right?

410
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,270
Is it okay to say the opposite?

411
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,660
Men not replying in kind did not appear

412
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,300
Nothing you can do about that

413
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,420
On the 2nd day she confessed to 14 people

414
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:17,960
Too much

415
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,520
Total 33 consecutive losses

416
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,350
Anyone else you like?

417
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,490
There are

418
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,770
Still?

419
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,760
Still...
-Sorry

420
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,510
So, we entered the third day of Pon Loop Ami's confessions

421
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:44,640
Go for it!

422
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,560
First on this day is

423
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,750
I hope you can go out with me

424
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,320
Takashi's fine, right?

425
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,180
With Ami?

426
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,160
Takashi is okay, right?

427
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,290
With me

428
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,330
Doesn't get it

429
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,550
Me?

430
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,860
With Takashi, yes

431
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,620
No, no

432
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,330
You don't like me, do you?

433
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,860
Eh? I do!

434
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,700
Didn't you say "Disco is good"?

435
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,530
Didn't you say, "Disco is best of comedians"?

436
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,510
As expected

437
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,060
Everyone knows it

438
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,370
Did I say that?

439
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,700
Don't you always wear a T-shirt that says Disco?

440
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,140
Really likes him!

441
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,920
Next, in 35th place is a junior comedian Isayama

442
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,740
A very innocent look

443
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,620
He awakens a maternal feeling in me

444
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,680
Really very cute

445
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:32,160
I like you as a member of the opposite sex

446
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,520
Eh? Ok

447
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,360
Cute, so cute!

448
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,360
Wow, i'm surprised

449
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,080
Is there a chance?

450
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,870
But, um...

451
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,200
What does "um" mean?

452
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,540
No, this is not the place to laugh

453
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,170
Not the place to laugh

454
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,930
What's wrong? What's wrong?

455
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,490
What's going on here?

456
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,980
I am very sorry

457
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,570
No way!

458
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,110
I am very happy

459
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,180
It's best not to laugh when you reject someone

460
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,650
If this is still the case
-Sorry

461
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,910
Why's she being like this again

462
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,050
Afterward, she confesses to two monk-looking men

463
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,410
Impressive two

464
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,910
Welcoming the 39th

465
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,630
Really?

466
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:10,900
A comedian again

467
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,240
Kakaroni's Kuritani

468
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,440
Never heard of him

469
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,670
That... Kuritani has never had a girlfriend either

470
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,840
I don't think he's very good with women

471
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,030
This type might be good

472
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,240
I have not had a boyfriend either

473
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,010
So this common ground feels quite appropriate

474
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,580
Two inexperienced people seems like a good idea

475
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,080
Indeed

476
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,780
I feel that you are very self-restrained

477
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:39,020
And have a serious outlook in terms of comedy

478
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,990
The advice you give is very helpful

479
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,000
Makes me think I should listen to you

480
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,600
And made me notice a lot of things

481
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:55,270
Like, I took the liberty of going to the shrine where Kuritani often goes

482
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,110
Yes yes yes

483
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,580
I'm on my own

484
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,780
And i've gotten somewhere

485
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,380
If I could become like Kuritani

486
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,950
I think it would be good and interesting

487
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:15,860
Also, as a man, I like Kuritani

488
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,230
So, will you go out with me?

489
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,930
Oh...oh oh

490
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,140
Hm...

491
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:25,900
How to...

492
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,120
Thinking

493
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,110
Thank you so much for saying that!

494
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,450
Thanks

495
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,110
I have never been confessed to

496
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,420
First time!

497
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:43,950
Although there is no right to refuse
-Rights?

498
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,490
Currently

499
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,300
All I can say is sorry

500
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,300
I am very sorry

501
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,300
I'm really, really sorry. I'm so bad. I'm sorry...I'm really sorry.
-No, no, no. I'm sorry, too

502
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:02,670
It's the first time, right?

503
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,170
Although it is the 39th person

504
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,840
Sorry for suddenly saying such a thing

505
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,280
Ah, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry

506
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,880
I'm really...sorry.
-No, no, no

507
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,740
Super nice guy

508
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,810
Wow, I'm really sorry.
-You don't have to say that

509
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,320
It's someone else's first time, sorry...I'm really sorry

510
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,350
Are you crying?

511
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,990
No, not crying

512
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,240
What kind of scene is this?

513
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,190
Because I understand the weight of the first time

514
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,930
Sorry

515
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,710
Good boy

516
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:30,430
Confessions are such a courageous thing to do

517
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:37,340
He himself is touched, seeing Ami take such a huge step

518
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,820
And so, Kuritani sheds tears

519
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,450
But

520
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,720
This is the Wednesday Downtown

521
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,390
The theory involves whether its possible to get a relationship by confessing to 100 people in the order of preference

522
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,820
You're gonna say it?

523
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,540
Don't tell him the truth, right?

524
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,690
How many?
-39th

525
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,160
That's a lot of people

526
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,900
39 ah

527
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,600
I'm crying. I was 39th

528
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,470
I'm sorry because it's the first time I've been confessed to

529
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,660
Seriously

530
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,280
39…

531
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,360
Crying

532
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,710
Because Ami often asks me to go out

533
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,380
I also felt there was something going on

534
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,650
I thought you might like me

535
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,820
But that's not true at all

536
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,000
Really, please don't do that

537
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,120
Don't cry

538
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,140
What the hell is going on here?

539
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,300
I thought I could get on

540
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,700
Why're you saying it like that

541
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,170
"Get on"...

542
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,420
Weird way to say it

543
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,640
It's true that the phrase "get on" is not great

544
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,510
This kid's an idiot, right?

545
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,970
I feel that Kuritani is really a good person

546
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,710
He thought very seriously

547
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,190
Really did

548
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,910
I feel a little bit uncomfortable...

549
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,080
But what next?

550
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,750
Can I continue?

551
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,510
Seriously!?

552
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,550
Still going

553
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,550
To continue

554
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,850
Her spirit is too strong

555
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,560
So, with more people she likes

556
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,890
The confessions move into the 4th day

557
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,060
Day 4

558
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,340
Incredible

559
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,200
From now on

560
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,250
I just want to get along as seniors and juniors

561
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,570
Keep up the good relationship

562
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,960
But

563
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,640
In fact the next will be the last person

564
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,150
If it doesn't work, i'll give up

565
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,680
The number of men she has confessed to so far is 70

566
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:34,070
But not even Ami has 100 people she likes

567
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,650
To be expected

568
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,490
The number of people I know

569
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,300
Of course there are many more

570
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,670
It's not great for the person to know the number

571
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,700
Indeed

572
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,200
Although there have been many

573
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,250
Objectively, this situation has been formed

574
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,970
So far

575
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,970
All are carefully chosen

576
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,640
In terms of people I really like

577
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,070
You only want to confess to those you'd actually date

578
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,240
According to this standard, there are 71 people

579
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,500
So, the last one is

580
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,440
The 71st is a former member of her agency

581
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,070
Shinichi

582
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,660
If you can, I hope you can go out with me

583
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,960
"Wait"

584
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,090
"No, it's definitely not me."

585
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,900
"It's not me"

586
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,700
"No...no no"

587
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,230
"No. Ami should be very popular, right?"

588
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,570
Popular? What are you talking about?

589
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,640
"No, no, no"

590
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,430
Angry

591
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,840
How can I be popular?
- "There are others..."

592
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,070
There's no one else

593
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,750
This is no longer the attitude of confession

594
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,950
And thus ends the testing of the theory

595
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,670
Is that a confession?

596
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,240
Ending with anger

597
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,410
But

598
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,950
The results

599
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,780
In terms of same-day relationships

600
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,590
No one could do it

601
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,220
But with Juicemans' Yojiro

602
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,980
Oh yeah

603
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,420
Can I talk to him on the phone again?

604
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,780
Back to 3 days ago

605
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,280
The 19th confession, Yojiro

606
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,160
Dating

607
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,730
Dating is perfectly fine

608
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,570
Eh, really?

609
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,930
It is possible to go on a date together

610
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,000
Because he said so

611
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,030
He is contacted

612
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,580
Like this...

613
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:01,550
Well, I still think

614
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,510
Only Yojiro...

615
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,950
"How dare you say that now"

616
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,140
So true

617
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,260
In terms of a relationship

618
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,210
Confessed to 71

619
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,450
There is no one else to like

620
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,990
Can you, that, dating...

621
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,900
Can you go on a date with me?

622
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,060
"If you really feel like you like me"

623
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,700
Yes yes yes I do

624
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,630
"If you really want to go out"

625
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,740
"With this in mind"

626
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,440
Yes yes yes

627
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,370
"If you really think so, we can."

628
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,310
It's true, it's true, it's true.

629
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,370
Thank you very much

630
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,960
So irritating

631
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,340
I did it

632
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,020
Why are you so irritated?

633
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,710
Got on!

634
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:44,190
So, Ami's challenge is extended

635
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,780
Will this work out?

636
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,090
Good

637
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:45,650
I'm tired already

638
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,440
So Ami confessed to 71 men she likes

639
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,940
But she wasn't successful

640
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,250
But she was serious

641
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,830
She really wanted to get a boyfriend on the same day

642
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,960
But there was no way to do it that day

643
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,970
What's this?
-Impactful words

644
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,130
Same-day boyfriend

645
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,510
She wanted it on the same-day, but couldn't

646
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:07,250
So, with Juicemans' Yojiro, and the promise of going on a date

647
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,580
Things were getting heated

648
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,820
Ami did start to get angrier and angrier

649
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,050
Gradually more and more angry

650
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,620
It became a bit like trying to emotionally pressure people to borrow money

651
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,390
There are situations where she was surely angry

652
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,780
So, now, Ami

653
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,400
Is going on a date with Yojiro

654
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,090
By the time this episode airs

655
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:35,100
It'll be clear whether they are in a relationship or not

656
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,140
So the results will be stated in the broadcast

657
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,480
Which ranking was Yojiro?

658
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,070
Yojiro is the 19th.
-19th place

659
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,650
Not bad, not bad

660
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,550
It's okay.
-It's okay

661
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,220
So a week after the confession

662
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,580
Ami and Yojiro travel to the zoo for their first date

663
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,490
Then

664
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,740
After that, they met a few times

665
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,210
What the hell is going on here?

666
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,410
I'm scared

667
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,420
One month from the start of the confessions

668
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,460
Finally it's time to confess again

669
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,030
We've had frequent contact, we've met frequently

670
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:35,870
More than before, I like you more now...

671
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:41,870
I think I really like you

672
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,540
Although its nothing new

673
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:53,620
If you can, can you go out with me?

674
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,220
Please

675
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,890
Well, well, well, that...

676
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,130
Ami who wants her first boyfriend

677
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,640
And Yojiro who had a girlfriend once 6 years ago

678
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,410
The answer given is...

679
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:20,940
At the beginning of the confession, the first time, to be honest it was a little...

680
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,850
I felt a lot of pressure

681
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,320
Did I apply pressure?

682
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,150
Yes, unsurmountable pressure

683
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,090
But in terms of dating, it felt good

684
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,960
You seemed to be really happy

685
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,290
And i've been very happy being with you

686
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,500
I've felt really happy

687
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,430
Its made me happy

688
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,670
So that's why...

689
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:49,140
I think, if we were to be together, I think we'd both be very happy

690
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,210
So, I'd also like to ask you to be with me
-Eh?

691
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,580
Eh eh eh eh?

692
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,450
Eh eh eh eh, what!?

693
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:10,030
Does that mean I've become Yojiro's girlfriend?

694
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,560
Yeah that's the case

695
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:35,320
※The BGM is Disco's song... yeah

696
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,230
Awesome!

697
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,030
Please take care of me

698
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,870
Too awesome!

699
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,280
I hope you'll delete Disco-san's contact information immediately

700
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,280
I will talk to Disco

701
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,510
Ami is mine

702
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,480
We're doing a joint performance together, so we'll have to meet

703
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,350
If I meet him, I'll definitely beat him up

704
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,320
Please don't

705
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,490
Congratulations!

706
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,160
Thank you very much

707
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,990
I really though it was hopeless

708
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,290
It really didn't seem like it was going to work out

709
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,060
I was rejected by 71 people!

710
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,900
I never thought this would be the result

711
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,670
What kind of date do you want in the future?

712
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,870
Hmm, how to put it

713
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,570
Go once to... go to Disneyland once

714
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,710
I'm gonna go book it now

715
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:05,050
Next is everybody's theories

716
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,320
Tonight's presenter is

717
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,260
It's Tamura Kenji!

718
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,190
Isn't that Tam Ken?

719
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,370
I'm Tam Ken, thank you for waiting

720
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,800
So guys, let me ask you a question about curry

721
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,420
If you hate curry, please raise your hand and explain why

722
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,630
I don't think I hate it

723
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,080
No one, right?

724
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,510
So this time, I bring you the second part of a certain curry theory

725
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,350
This is it

726
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,490
The 2nd - If the smell of curry wafts in from the next room during a meeting, you'll surely go eat curry afterward

727
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,840
Ah yeah this was done before

728
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,710
That's it

729
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:55,490
The plan is to keep sending the aroma of curry to the next room during a meeting

730
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:02,760
And then fellow the target on the street to see if they eat curry or not

731
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,880
What is this?

732
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,480
This did happen

733
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,650
Five out of six people ate it!

734
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,960
Yeah
-It was pretty impressive

735
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,800
Only Noda Crystal did not eat

736
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,060
Because he hates curry

737
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,610
It can't be helped.
-It can't be helped. After all, people who hate curry will definitely not eat it

738
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:27,230
Basically, we can say that the theory has been proven, right?

739
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,400
But... those people last time

740
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,790
They're all simple-minded guys, right?

741
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,230
It varies from person to person, right?

742
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,020
As soon as they smell the curry, they wanted to eat it

743
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:49,380
So, the next step is to re-examine curry in a new format

744
00:31:49,950 --> 00:32:01,430
The 2nd - If the smell of curry wafts in from the next room during a meeting, you'll surely go eat curry afterward

745
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:10,280
This time, we called our targets to the Green Mountain Studio under the pretext of a fake location for a TV show promotion

746
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,260
In the middle of the discussion, they will smell curry coming from the next room

747
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,720
Then they'll choose their lunch from three possible menus

748
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,950
Curry

749
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,950
Omelet

750
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,950
Ramen

751
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:29,250
Incidentally, in front of the curry cart, we set up a trap

752
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,450
What a mess
-Why?

753
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,730
Although perhaps a bit unreasonable for people attracted by the smell

754
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,470
We'll let them fall regardless

755
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,170
Why?

756
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,200
Really unreasonable

757
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,490
So first of all, the first target is

758
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,440
Good morning

759
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,080
I'm Plus Minus' Iwahashi, thank you

760
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,230
Plus Minus' Iwahashi

761
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,820
And

762
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,520
This is a "medical examination for comedians" program

763
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,080
The meeting to discuss a program begins

764
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,530
Sorry

765
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,130
Appeared
-His ticks

766
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,430
Scary

767
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,130
Twice

768
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,300
Sorry

769
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,340
It's fine. It's totally fine

770
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,620
It's totally fine

771
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,490
After he unleashes his ticks as usual

772
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,310
It happens

773
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,370
Is it common?

774
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,380
The curry battle begins

775
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,000
Do you use your eyes a lot?

776
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,450
Very often

777
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:32,100
I often watch Youtube and Neftlix

778
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,640
Then

779
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,050
Took off the mask to smell it

780
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,230
Seems like there's a strong smell of curry

781
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,890
He's quick to respond to the scent

782
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,340
This is curry, right?

783
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,940
Hey? Very strong curry smell...

784
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,740
I have a bit of nasal congestion so I can't really smell it

785
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,510
Really?

786
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,240
It's really strong

787
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:01,180
This imprinted the aroma of curry in his mind

788
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,950
Weird

789
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,780
Then, the opening of the fake show is shot

790
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,090
Hello everyone, i'm Plus Minus' Iwahashi

791
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:16,400
My interest is to go to hotels for breakfast without staying overnight

792
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,370
Okay, OK, thanks

793
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,040
This will be fine for the opening
-Thank you

794
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,210
It just so happens that the TV series team is not here yet

795
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:27,310
So you can here for a while
-Oh, really?

796
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,450
Are you waiting for the actors?
-Yes

797
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,280
Ah yes, I understand

798
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:36,330
This time we prepared three food trucks

799
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:42,400
And gave them a voucher and to choose one of three

800
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,660
Can I go?
-Yes

801
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,900
Ok

802
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,980
What will happen?

803
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,730
Which one will he eat?

804
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,330
What is this way of walking?

805
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,260
Which one will he eat?

806
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,810
He's heading...

807
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,730
Eat curry? Eat curry?

808
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,790
Will you go for curry?

809
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,350
Is it curry?

810
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,470
Going to the right, he's not eating it?

811
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,130
It's curry, right?

812
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,160
Attempted to eat curry

813
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,130
Why does this have to happen to him?

814
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,640
So the truth was revealed

815
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,070
Carried away by the aroma of curry

816
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,970
What the hell?

817
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,270
Oi what's this?

818
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,810
Hey, what's going on?

819
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,810
What is going on?

820
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,180
Hey, I don't get it, why this hole?

821
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,180
Iwahashi, what were you going to eat?

822
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,150
Curry

823
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,850
Why do you want to eat curry?

824
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,490
Because the smell of curry was very strong

825
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,790
During the meeting

826
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,260
So you want to eat curry?

827
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,590
Well... that...

828
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,160
If the aroma is so strong you will definitely crave curry, right?

829
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,330
Hey, wait, hey, what, hey?

830
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,730
What is this? What is this?

831
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,740
So, the project is explained

832
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,170
What is this?

833
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,640
I like curry

834
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,780
If I smell curry of course i'll eat it!

835
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,980
This prank is way too simple, right?

836
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,290
Iwabashi, by the way, you have to go somewhere else now

837
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,520
Go elsewhere?

838
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,960
Unfortunately you have no time for curry

839
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,690
Oi!

840
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,460
At least let me eat the curry!

841
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,630
I can almost taste the curry

842
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,500
Iwahashi already looks like he has curry on his mouth

843
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,400
It's dirt!

844
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,380
So this is the end

845
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,270
Loads of dirt

846
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,250
The next target is

847
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,210
Who is this?

848
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,800
Here we go again

849
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:44,510
The 2nd appearance, Viking's Nishimura

850
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,350
Is that the smell of curry?

851
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:52,860
Last time, he went to eat curry after the meeting

852
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,760
Will he fall for the same trick this time?

853
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,270
Then

854
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,450
Do you smell it?

855
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,670
Vague smell of curry

856
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,270
I think it's probably curry

857
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:13,680
Despite being relatively minor, it still made an impression on him

858
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,770
So, the same as before, an opening scene is shot

859
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,700
Then it's time for lunch break

860
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:23,740
Will the same thing from two years ago happen again?

861
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,290
Which one will you eat?

862
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,380
What will happen?

863
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,290
Ramen is also available!

864
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,690
Ramen is an attractive choice

865
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:31,880
Looking at the signs

866
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,000
A little hesitant

867
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,450
Yeah

868
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,590
Still going for curry?

869
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,810
Surely eating curry!

870
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,570
Hello-

871
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,840
Hello-

872
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,720
Also said hello

873
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,880
The truth is revealed

874
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,620
Hey what's going on here?

875
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,250
Nishimura, this is the second time

876
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,220
Ah, did he forget?

877
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,960
Do you remember? Don't remember?

878
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,560
The trap? If you fall into a trap...

879
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,160
No, it's not about the trap, the curry

880
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,460
Curry?

881
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,570
Curry?

882
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,440
Ah!

883
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,410
Ahh..

884
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,880
The one in Akasaka.
-Yes

885
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,040
Now I think of it...

886
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,710
Didn't you have a curry then?

887
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,810
I did!

888
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,620
He forgot

889
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,920
That time also had the fragrance of curry!

890
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,050
What a strange way to talk!

891
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,920
Like a moron talking
-Like a moron

892
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,720
This is the second time

893
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,930
This way of speaking

894
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,360
Whoa

895
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,830
Curry is so awesome!

896
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,900
Emotions are so high!

897
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
So...

898
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,870
You could use this to commit a crime

899
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,340
What kind of crime?

900
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,340
What if this causes a crime?

901
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,460
What is he talking about?

902
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,120
The next target is

903
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,850
I'm Tom Brown's Michio

904
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,790
Tom Brown's Michio

905
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,250
Without further ado, we immediately feed in the curry aroma

906
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,220
Looks so delicious this curry

907
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,550
During the meeting for the fake health program

908
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,700
Ah, I like curry rice

909
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,560
Like curry?

910
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,300
Yes

911
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,700
Katsu curry and stuff like that

912
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,310
Whether its the smell that influences the conversation or not, the topic naturally turns to curry

913
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,270
I also make my own curry at home

914
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,640
But

915
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,380
How many times a week do you eat curry?

916
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,920
How many times...?

917
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,320
Haven't eaten in a long time?

918
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,350
No...I feel like I can't remember

919
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,620
But in any case, I often eat it

920
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,230
I also often go to Coco and also make my own

921
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,820
The curry is pouring in

922
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,830
But i feel that maybe I don't eat it that much

923
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,300
Eh? How much is it?

924
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,570
Eh... do I eat it?

925
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,920
Scary scary scary

926
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:54,900
With the smell of curry filling the whole room, is he becoming dizzy?

927
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,880
Michio's words seem to be muddled

928
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,040
Sorry

929
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,880
I feel that, in terms of food... I suddenly can't remember anything

930
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,620
Next

931
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,620
Hello, I'm Tom-Brown' Michio, the presenter of the TBS Spring Drama Festival

932
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,920
The curry sauce is sucked in through the nose

933
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,450
As expected of someone who has inhaled curry

934
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,930
His opening joke is curry-related

935
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,960
Okay, OK. Thank you very much

936
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,530
He got carried away

937
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,800
With this opening

938
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,740
Unconsciously in front of the camera...

939
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,140
The word "curry" came out of his mouth

940
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,570
His brain is already full of curry

941
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,760
So surely he will choose the curry?

942
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,880
It's curry

943
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,870
The truth is revealed

944
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,070
Eh? This is... eh?

945
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,240
I don't understand... why did I fall into a trap?

946
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,390
Why do you want to eat curry?

947
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:08,240
There was a meeting before this

948
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,180
There was a very strong curry smell

949
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,150
During the meeting?

950
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,850
Yes

951
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,720
If you smell curry, you will definitely wanna eat it

952
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,260
Eh, then why...

953
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,260
What does the trap have to do with this?

954
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,900
Falling is funny

955
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,660
What the hell are you laughing at?

956
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,770
The next target is

957
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,200
I'm Jimmy

958
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,920
All strange people!

959
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,860
Jimmy Onishi

960
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,620
Why ask this guy to be the host of a TV drama festival?

961
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,160
So true

962
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,060
That's weird. That's weird

963
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,410
Surely he'll think its strange

964
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,150
I smell curry

965
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,600
And he has a good nose

966
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,950
Smell the smell of curry rice

967
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,790
Ah, you mean here?

968
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,980
Ah no, the cafe is also quite close, I can't tell the difference

969
00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:01,070
So, the same approach is used to verify again

970
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,160
The café is also quite close...

971
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,630
What'd he say for the opening?

972
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,580
What'll happen?

973
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,130
It got cut out

974
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,400
It must have been awful

975
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,160
I guess so

976
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,120
Walk straight through!

977
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,240
Excuse me

978
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,160
And said "excuse me"

979
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,240
As expected: curry

980
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:23,290
I'm sure I'd choose curry if I smelled it

981
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,410
So far, the curry battle has gone perfectly

982
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,420
What's up with that smile!?

983
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,960
The last target is...

984
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,870
I am Shoji, thank you

985
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,170
A muscular comedian who considers curry as an enemy to maintain his body shape, Shoji Tomoharu

986
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:49,110
If the other person next to me makes a little, if you bring curry, I'll also do it

987
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,610
You mean you won't eat it?

988
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,560
I don't really get what you're talking about

989
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,710
A little harsh

990
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:00,460
Curry Battle, the final target is

991
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,790
I am Shoji, thank you

992
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,570
Shoji Tomoharu

993
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:12,170
Here he is also asked some questions about diet and lifestyle

994
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,100
I eat basmati rice and stuff

995
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:19,810
I'm careful not to consume carbohydrates when I eat

996
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:24,650
I am also very careful to control what I eat at night

997
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,930
Shoji is quite serious about it

998
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:30,620
Sure enough, he's limiting his carbohydrate intake to stay in shape

999
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,840
That's not the same

1000
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,620
Curry and the like is a no-go

1001
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:38,180
So, we've added chicken just for him

1002
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,490
This time there's chicken too

1003
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:38,360
Chicken

1004
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:38,360
Curry

1005
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:38,360
Omelet Rice

1006
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:38,360
Ramen

1007
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:38,970
I see

1008
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,330
It'd be great if he still chooses curry

1009
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:47,800
A high level of difficulty, will Shoji choose the king of carbs?

1010
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,900
Indeed

1011
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,700
If so, the theory will be completely proven

1012
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,200
Completely and perfectly confirmed

1013
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,290
I don't think he'll eat ramen either

1014
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,680
What'll happen?

1015
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,040
Ah, chicken!

1016
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,670
Going to the chicken side

1017
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,660
Is it chicken?

1018
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,590
Is it?

1019
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:09,760
Still chose curry!

1020
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,960
He chose curry, what about carbohydrates?

1021
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,410
A perfect score

1022
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,370
What for? Why the hole? What's going on here?

1023
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,000
What the hell is this for? What the hell is going on?

1024
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,940
This is Wednesday Downtown

1025
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,080
Yeah

1026
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,400
So, we explained the project to him

1027
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,550
Because you are more concerned about carbohydrate intake

1028
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,780
Ah-

1029
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,820
We also prepared chicken

1030
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,820
Other muscle comedians are gonna criticize me

1031
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,260
You usually pay attention to sugar, right?

1032
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,130
Yes

1033
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:50,730
But I'll usually eat curry

1034
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,630
I see

1035
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:57,310
In summary
Curry is pretty much a drug

1036
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:00,380
So, the theory was completely confirmed

1037
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,700
This is really impressive

1038
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,720
Then there will be no more complaints, right?

1039
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,390
That's true

1040
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,220
The participants all seemed to have something to say about it

1041
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,490
These people are too unique, right?

1042
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,290
They are all simple people

1043
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,010
Aren't they the ones who will go for curry even without the smell?

1044
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:18,690
No, it's not because of the aroma

1045
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:22,700
To get up from a hole and go to eat curry is really impressive

1046
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,900
It's a good thing, right?

1047
00:45:27,900 --> 00:46:14,820
