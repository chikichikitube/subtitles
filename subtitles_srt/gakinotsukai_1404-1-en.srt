1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,960
At a certian hot spring, there is an inn where liars gather

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,640
Excuse me, the first cut will be shot from outside, and then...

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,620
Before filming

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,920
Okay

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,040
Shut up

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,640
Shut up

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,240
So scary

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,200
That was scary

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,600
Even though he's explaining...

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,960
He tells him to shut up...

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,760
Shooting started

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,760
That was pretty scary

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,440
What was scary?

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,880
Even though the staff were explaining things,

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,120
You said "shut up". You did!
I didn't say that!

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,680
You did say that. What happened?

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,640
Ah, I'm drunk

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,800
That's also a problem

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,320
Yeah, I'm wasted. I'm wasted

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,590
He's already started!!

21
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,160
Yeah, I've started!

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,320
Fully improvised! Liar's Inn

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,440
The person on the card nominates someone to lie

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,200
The nominated person must maintain the lie given to them until the OK

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,720
So, shall we begin?

26
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,720
Here I go

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,680
So Hosei-san nominates?

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,880
I will start the story

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,760
Hey Tanaka,

30
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,440
You got a brand new fortune telling?

31
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,280
Where did you hear that from? You heard about that?

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,440
"A brand new fortune telling?" I'm not sure what that means

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,160
There's the personality check,

34
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,720
Yes and the compatibility check

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,080
There's so many

36
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,170
There's no other ones

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,440
But there is that one, the "Talking fortune"

38
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,760
Huh? This sounds like an uninteresting story

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,520
We won't know until that we hear it

40
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,960
Yes, yes it's called "talking fortune", I did it for the first time,

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,560
While you talk, the other person tries to find out what the future might hold for you

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,980
That's just getting life advice!

43
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,880
There's more to it right?

44
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Ah, sorry I messed up the explanation, I'm sorry

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,480
Of course there's also the standard fortune telling questions,
Like my age,

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,400
My date of birth, my birthplace

47
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,240
Birthplace?

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,600
That's a rare question to ask

49
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,090
Yes, the guy who did the thing said there are even "Birthplace Fortunes"

50
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,560
Ah! He changed it!

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,620
Um, birthplace fortunes-

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,840
Birthplace fortune? That's totally different

53
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,680
What do you mean "The guy who did the thing"?

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,920
Objectively, this fortune is objectively-

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,840
Could you try it out?

56
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,160
Yeah could you try it out?

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,920
How is your...Spring? What does your spring schedule look like?

58
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,320
Tell you my spring schedule? Well I was on break for a week,

59
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,120
And I have some Rakugoka and TV work

60
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,600
I see. This was enough for me to understand.

61
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,320
Just from that? What did you understand?

62
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,920
From the outside, your life looks just fine

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,840
Sorry?

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
That's not really a fortune

65
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,520
No no Tanaka, I really hated that

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,640
How about you try DownTown-san?

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
Hamada-san?

68
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,440
Hamada-san, of course I'm sure you have a fun and peaceful life,

69
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,840
But is there is 1 thing that worries you?

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,000
Even if it's a small thing, that's fine

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,120
The iPad I ordered hasn't arrived yet

72
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,520
Even though you've ordered them before, it hasn't arrived yet?

73
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,040
Yes, this is enough

74
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,960
You got it?

75
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,960
What did you find out?

76
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,000
Um, uh, it'll arrive

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
It shall arrive

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm sorry

79
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,480
A new fortune huh

80
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,960
It's just, out of all these ones I've done

81
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:09,440
I was looking for something to say, opening each door, but,

82
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,200
It was like I got stuck at the first one

83
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:21,270

84
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,120
Next

85
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,480
Tanaka nominates someone to lie

86
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Tanaka-san nominates

87
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,760
Sorry about this, I thought this was bullshit,

88
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,320
Me?

89
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,680
Is it true you have a Kintoun?

90
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,680
TN: Kintoun is a cloud Goku uses to fly in DragonballZ

91
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
What? No way

92
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,560
Sorry about this, I did think no way it's possible

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,160
C'mon, what kind of question is that? Let's skip this one let's go

94
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,080
Sorry, I apologize

95
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,800
It doesn't exist in the first place

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,560
Next one, let's do the next one

97
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,840
I have 2 of them

98
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,560
2?

99
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Surely you don't need 2. Isn't 1 enough?

100
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,200
Yeah, one of them is like uh,

101
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,120
Who gave it to you?

102
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,580
How do you obtain one?

103
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,960
Could we buy one?

104
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,240
Buy? Well, you can't really obtain one legally

105
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,440
Well yeah of course

106
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:18,360
Yeah it was coincidentally someone I knew, from a used car lot,  an old man

107
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,320
A guy?

108
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,480
He told you "Endo-kun I have a Kintoun"

109
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,920
He didn't say a Kintoun, he said he had a convenient ride...

110
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm curious about the price

111
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, it did cost quite a lot

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,840
As much as a car?

113
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,680
It wasn't that much, he said I could have it for 200,000 yen

114
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,320
Oh really?

115
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,080
That's pretty cheap

116
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
That's way better than a car. Damn it must be so fast.

117
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,640
It is

118
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,600
For example, how long does is the round trip between Tokyo and Osaka?

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,040
That's quite the distance

120
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,500
With the Shinkansen these days it's, 2 and half hours?

121
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,480
Yeah generally they travel at 500km/h

122
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,920
Well, about and hour and a half I'd say

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,880
That's fast

124
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,160
Hmm...that is not much of an improvement

125
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,900
It's still slower than a plane

126
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,040
What about the fuel?

127
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,480
Fuel? Well if you offer it some salt...

128
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,690
It eats it?

129
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,160
It doesn't eat it though, but if you place some salt or something around it then yeah

130
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,360
I'm not sure about that...

131
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,600
It grows, like that

132
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,520
I'm not sure it was salt...

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,800
Shut up

134
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,640
Is it really salt?

135
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Shut up
Salt, yeah it's salt

136
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,100
How do you ride it?

137
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,100
Yeah how do you ride it?

138
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,440
What is it like?
What is it like?

139
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,800
If this was the Kintoun

140
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,240
Well I just get on it like this,

141
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,960
It's like this really

142
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,880
Sometimes I kneel like this...

143
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,250
Ugh...

144
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,840
Awful

145
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,360
That's awful

146
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,600
It is quite awful

147
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
I wonder what you're calling awful...

148
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:05,040
Yeah, what do you mean? My heart is about to break

149
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,310
Matsumoto nominates someone to lie

150
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,600
Hey Yamasaki,

151
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,640
Yes

152
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,880
I heard you have 5 anuses

153
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,040
Who did you hear that from?

154
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,380
I heard that from Aya-san

155
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:33,040
When we went to eat together with our families, you went to washroom and she apologised;

"He takes so long, I'm sorry"

156
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,840
"He has 5 anuses so he takes a long time"

157
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
Wouldn't it be faster instead?

158
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,600
Yeah I thought that too, I wanted to ask but she told me "Please don't mention it to him"

159
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,080
Where?

160
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,720
Well, of course on my butt, around my butt

161
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,560
Around your anus?

162
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,000
There's one in my anus

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,200
1 in your anus?

164
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,320
What do you mean 1 in your anus?

165
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,720
The first one is your anus right?
Yes

166
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
And then right near by there's another

167
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,680
That is like a fake-anus

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,440
It doesn't do anything

169
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,760
Man, you don't need that

170
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,320
It's dead? It's not active?

171
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,640
It's not active,

172
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:25,120
And the other 3, well can you all tell,

173
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,680
Can you feel your bones?

174
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,440
What bones?
On your butt

175
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,520
Oh the tailbone?
Yes, oh here yes

176
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,560
I have one near the tailbone,

177
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,280
Is that one fake too?
Not fake, it's a real asshole

178
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,480
So that one actually works?

179
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,200
Yes, it totally works

180
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,360
And your ass has lots of bones right?

181
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,800
Basically I can make anuses appear on bones

182
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,560
What do you mean?

183
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,760
You have 5 to work with, it would've been better if they were in different places

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,480
Yeah...

185
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,080
I wonder why they're all down there

186
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,440
That's what I'm saying to the God who made Yamasaki

187
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,880
Yeah, I don't know what that God waj jinking...

188
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,400
Huh?

189
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,920
What happens when you clench?

190
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,120
From the main anus, it comes out slowly

191
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,440
And when that happens, it comes slowly out of all of them

192
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,240
The 3 other than the fake...

193
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,160
One is fake right? So it comes out of 4 places

194
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,080
It comes out 4 places, and that makes my pants filthy

195
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,680
And I really hate that...

196
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,680
But you can take them off

197
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,320
Yeah you can take them off

198
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,200
Yeah yeah I take em off...

199
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,160
Oh wait, did she say it was 8 places?

200
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,160
8 places?

201
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,840
She went as far as to reveal that...

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,760
Is that true then?

203
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,080
I understand what you mean now by "He takes a long time"

204
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,200
She even revealed that?

205
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
Where are those ones?

206
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,360
Those are here here and here,

207
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,120
Directly, like in the middle of this human body,

208
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,840
Right here, there's one here like this

209
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,320
What here? On the neck?
No not there

210
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,760
What happens when you fart?

211
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,200
When I fart it's just...What do you think happens?

212
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,280
Yeah I'm asking you'

213
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,040
We wanna hear this, we really do

214
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,840
When we fart it's just pffft

215
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,680
It's just pffft out of one place right?

216
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,000
This is different for me, since it has to come out of 8 holes,

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,680
There's 1 fake so there's 7 holes though

218
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,800
Oh yes yes I apologise

219
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,600
Since it has to come out of 7 holes

220
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,480
For example, the air in a fart like *pfft* is split up for 7 holes

221
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,480
So really it's like,

222
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,760
Did you hear it?

223
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,600
I barely heard it

224
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,480
How do you use the washlet?

225
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,440
Well yeah with the washlet I gotta clean everything right? So just like this, hole by hole, one by one

226
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,130
I end up in this sort of pose at the end, like this,

227
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,760
Oh, that's why it took so long

228
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,600
That's why it took so long

229
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,640
What emotion do you have?

230
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,760
My emotion,

231
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,720
I think if I hear that then that'll be enough

232
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,880
Ok, Ok

233
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,000
Right now, all I have is a feeling of gratitude

234
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,960
I'm grateful

235
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,360
It's not a good thing though right?

236
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,640
That's, that's cause,

237
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,640
If you had to sum it all up;

238
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,400
They're adorable

239
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,600
Each and every one, anuses, they're adorable

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,400
They're oh so small... like rose buds, it's like 8 rose buds

241
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm just so thankful

242
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
You care for them

243
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,760
I care for them, each and every one

244
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,880
And if you had to sum up why,

245
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,920
If I had to sum that up...

246
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Mouu, they're adorable!

247
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,400
Sorry, sorry. Somehow,

248
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,440
I somehow feel sorry

249
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,400
I really didn't know when to press it

250
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,080
That's true, it's difficult to time that

251
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Wasn't that way too long?

252
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,520
No no no, I just thought it wasn't really a simple story

253
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,280
Please go ahead

254
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,600
Oh? Oh dear, excuse me

255
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,080
Hosei picks someone to lie

256
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,440
What's wrong with this guy. You gotta have something.

257
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,280
Do you know it feels to have your 8 anuses exposed? It's upsetting

258
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,440
Hamada-san...

259
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,040
Crocodile Dundee is based on you?

260
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,540
Is that true?

261
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,120
Next - What is Hamada's Crocodile Dundee story?!

262
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,880
Hamada-san

263
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,720
Crocodile Dundee is based on you?

264
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,680
Is that true?

265
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,080
If that's true it's amazing, I don't think it is though

266
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,640
No, that's what I've heard

267
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,760
Crocodile Dundee? Oh yes

268
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,340
He holds the crocodiles

269
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,530
yes yes yes yes yes

270
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:49,880
It was, back when I was about as fit as Matsumoto-san

271
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,840
Crocodile wasn't really that macho

272
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,120
Well I wasn't macho but I have to catch the crocodile after all

273
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,000
He was Australian right?

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,240
Yeah and he was amazing with crocodiles and-

275
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,420
And then he went to America

276
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,040
Yes, yes he did

277
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,320
Is that so?

278
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,800
Crocodiles...

279
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,600
I don't what Crocodile Dundee is like...

280
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,440
I didn't really know he was based on me, I don't know about that

281
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,800
I just thought people called me that cause I caught a lot of crocodiles

282
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,840
You caught a lot? How many have you caught?

283
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,400
Well uh, well I just did it cause someone wanted a bag

284
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,000
A bag? Explain please

285
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,790
A craftsman?

286
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,160
Using crocodile leather?

287
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,560
Yes yes yes yes

288
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,440
They asked me, I don't really know how many,
I would just catch and skin them

289
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,880
Oh you even skinned them?

290
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,960
Who asked you to do that?

291
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,240
A bag shop

292
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,080
Ah, a bag store requested it

293
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,620
Yeah, cause I was known as a wholesaler

294
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,920
Wasn't Crocodile Dundee someone who cared for crocodiles?

295
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,150
He (Crocodile Dundee) was just a bag wholesaler

296
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,520
That guy

297
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,760
Yeah that guy

298
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,400
Wasn't he a great friends with the crocodiles?

299
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,880
For the movie they changed and hid a lot of stuff

300
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,800
I don't know about the movie, but all I did was cleanly skin them and deliver them

301
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,920
I don't know what product-

302
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,040
Where did you send them?

303
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,000
The bag shop that ordered them

304
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:34,560
The craftsman knows how to cut the skin to make the bag

305
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
And I don't know that of course

306
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,680
Whether it was a big crocodile or a small crocodile, I just sent the skins

307
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,640
I just flipped them and sent the skins

308
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,760
What do you do with whats leftover?

309
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,760
Leftover?

310
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,480
Oh you mean the rest of it? It's gross so I throw it away

311
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,160
Damn...

312
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,600
Isn't there some use?

313
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,320
Yeah, you could eat it. Is it alright to throw it?

314
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,760
Is it alright to throw it?

315
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,240
Yeah people might ask about that so I throw them away late at night

316
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,120
Yeah they don't know it's for a bag shop

317
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,240
Where do you do it? Do you bring them home and cut them there?

318
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,680
Yeah people might complain

319
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,320
And I have a small shop that I rent,

320
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,880
At the small shop, I have them all lined up
Wearing a mask, cause it stinks

321
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,120
Yeah, it's raw flesh after all

322
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,720
Yeah it does have bad smells

323
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,240
It smells gross and raw, it takes quite a long time

324
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,480
Is this Crocodile Dundee? I'm not sure

325
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:43,080
Yeah everyone mistakes it to be like that. It's not like that movie at all!!

326
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,160
The original is a crocodile skinner

327
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,320
That guy was a crocodile skinner!

328
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,690
If they said that then it would be bad for the film

329
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,360
Oh that's why?

330
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,020
They just make it look cool

331
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,880
Yeah they put whatever title they want

332
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,120
What is the Japanese Title?

333
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,160
What is the real crocodile dundee ?

334
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,360
Like I said, he's a crocodile skinner

335
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,440
A crocodile skinner?

336
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,400
Totally different from the original then

337
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,880
I have no idea no what to say. Even if you tell me he's Australian...

338
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,280
Here I go
Go ahead

339
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,960
Endo picks someone to lie

340
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,160
Endo-chan!

341
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,440
Well, as a juinior this is something that shocked me

342
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,480
It's about Matsumoto-san
I heard your pay last month was just 80,000 yen (~$800)

343
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,160
We all thought no way

344
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,880
That is...
It must be some mistake

345
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,200
Honestly, it has been a while

346
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,320
There's more information?

347
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,120
In fact, since this year started it's been 80,000 yen

348
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,520
No way, but you're doing so many shows

349
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:17,480
It honestly shocked me, I was at the Yoshimoto HQ and went to greet President Okamato for the new years,

350
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,080
And suddenly he smacked me

351
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,640
But I didn't think he would hate you

352
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,200
He said he was thinking of smacking me since last year

353
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,680
But that's different from your pay

354
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,360
Right? I asked "What the hell?! Why'd you smack me"
Oh yeah also my lip was busted

355
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,640
And it was bleeding

356
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,760
And then he said "80,000 for you!"

357
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,360
I said "No no no no"

358
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,560
Why? Why did he do that?

359
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,640
Yeah, why?

360
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,200
We hate this too
Yeah we hate that, just 80,000 yen

361
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,640
Somehow, he said I was being really cocky, since the summer

362
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,920
What does he even mean getting cocky?

363
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,080
I don't really know

364
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,120
Please tell us in detail

365
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,560
When I asked for more detail he said "Nope, you've been acting cocky"

366
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,320
That's something Okamoto, Fujiwara and Osaki said to me

367
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,160
So I also thought "Maybe I am getting cocky"

368
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,680
But, still 80,000 a yen makes no sense

369
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,410
Hamada-san did you hear about this?

370
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,400
Not at all

371
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,560
He also sends me really nasty SMSs

372
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,720
What kind of SMS

373
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,600
Like "You're so gross"

374
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,610
SMS?

375
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Not an email or on LINE

376
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,960
He said "I saw you on TV the other day, your opening was disgusting"

377
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,280
He doesn't need to go that far

378
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,560
Yeah things are bad

379
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,200
He really hates you!

380
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,680
Yes indeed

381
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,280
Isn't there something you think is the reason? Like "Oh maybe that's why!"

382
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,440
Otherwise...

383
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,640
You know, there one thing. I dyed my hair right?

384
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,270
Something that could be it

385
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,560
And I didn't consult him at all about it

386
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,100
That was a pretty long time ago

387
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,160
That was said too. "It's been a pretty long time"

388
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,680
By who?

389
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,400
By Okamoto

390
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,720
I did wonder when he was gonna say something about it

391
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,840
He said "Hamada is a good guy"
"Hamada is great"

392
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,560
"That guy would never dye his hair"

393
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,080
That's not something to get upset about

394
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,540
So if we do something like that it could also happen to us?

395
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,320
Yeah it might be the end of the line

396
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,150
It's amazing you guys still drink

397
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,400
Yeah...

398
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,120
Even though he got mad at you

399
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,200
That's cause,

400
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,440
They're really trying to push Hamada forward at Yoshimoto

401
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,520
I wonder why Matsumoto has to be brought down for Hamada

402
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,840
Yeah, it makes no sense

403
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,240
Your pay went up right?
They're not pushing for me at all

404
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,880
He told me straight up the rest of my money is going to Hamada

405
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,200
Is something like this even possible

406
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,240
He event sent me an SMS

407
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,640
Why SMS??

408
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,400
He even sent me "Hamada will get the rest"

409
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,960
With, with this kind of emoji

410
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,520
That one, yeah he was in a pretty good mood then

411
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,320
There's no way
No really really I did

412
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:24,480
I didn't think it was like a punishment, I thought you accidentally got someone else's pay slip or something

413
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,440
No no no. He said, he said like
"You're at the same level as Wacky now"

414
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,440
TN: Wacky is a comedian from the duo Penalty

415
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,840
Wacky makes 80,000?

416
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,600
From Penalty?

417
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,480
I thought Wacky would make a bit more than that.
80,000? I don't know of course

418
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,920
Yeah actually

419
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,760
I thought he was trying to say he's giving me a penalty
And when I said that he smacked the shit out of me

420
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,680
Sorry, it was a depressing story

421
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,030
Matsumoto can predict the future?!

422
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,840
Next

423
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,800
Tanaka picks someone to lie

424
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Matsumoto-san, this is something I've heard

425
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,560
What is it?

426
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:23,080
I heard when you get drunk you unlock an ability to predict the future

427
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,880
It's not true right

428
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,040
Predict the future?

429
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,480
I heard that ability awakens

430
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,920
That's an amazing ability

431
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Oh sorry, isn't everyone like that?

432
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,320
Not at all
No

433
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,440
Even if I drink

434
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,440
Oh then it's just me who has this ability

435
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,760
That's amazing if it's true

436
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,810
On DownTown Now we drink right?

437
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,800
During then, are you predicting the future the whole time

438
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:59,160
Oh yes, I could tell everything
I could even tell Hamada wants to go home early, I could tell everything

439
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,440
Is that really predicting the future?

440
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,160
Well ask me something about the future

441
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,200
Did you know Trump would win?

442
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,160
Yeah

443
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,560
Really? When?

444
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:20,380
Back when Trump was a child

445
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,220
Child?

446
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,200
But aren't you younger

447
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,360
You're younger

448
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,580
Didn't it only happen when you drink?

449
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah, you weren't the age to be drinking

450
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,290
It was Otoso

451
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,640
TN: Otoso is spiced sake drunk ceremonially on new years

452
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,600
It even works with Otoso?

453
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,760
It was this tiny thing. It worked from that.

454
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,800
Is there any celeb scandal you know about?

455
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,400
Of course

456
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,840
There's gonna be another Bun Shisho

457
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,640
You didn't press it now?!

458
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,720
For real!

459
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,680
You were too surprised and couldn't press it

460
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:13,000
