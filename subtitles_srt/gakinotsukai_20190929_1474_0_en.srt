00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,950
Fifth time on Gaki no Tsukai: Let's play tabletop games from around the world!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,170
Here we go again!

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,270
This is our fifth episode

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,260
Yeah, it is

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,230
Why is Tanaka running this show?

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,500
I heard he got here hours before

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,800
Tanaka learned each game's rules beforehand

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,300
Do you want to do this that bad?

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,390
Of course I want to

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,100
They told me you got here this morning

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,820
I just got here few minutes before you guys

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,810
I know you've come several times to learn them

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,500
And you were like "mhh, I see..."

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,650
This is embarrassing...

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,580
I bet you even took notes

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,450
I heard some games sold pretty well after our show

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,920
Yeah, I heard that too

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,120
Some of those we've played run out of stock

19
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:51,530
This time too, they'll get to choose and experience some worldwide famous tabletop games!

23
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,370
The first game they're going to play is "Zitternix", from Germany!

24
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:10,120
Long story short, it's about getting as much sticks as you can

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,920
Like Jenga, right?

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,920
Yes

27
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,820
We start from this and we throw the dice in turns

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,980
As you can see there are three colors: red, blue and yellow

29
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,980
Three of them?

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,450
If you get blue, you have to draw the blue stick

31
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,220
Each color is worth some points

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,300
I see

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,520
Blue is 3 points, red is 2 points, yellow is 1 point

34
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:41,050
Blue ones are thicker, so if you take them the structure could crumble

35
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,180
So it must not crumble, right?

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,670
That's right, if it falls down it's game over

37
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,320
This is so simple it doesn't seem fun in the slightest

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,850
It's so simple, isn't it?

39
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,470
I guarantee this is surprisingly fun, simple and fun

40
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,950
Alright, we're moving anticlockwise

41
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,050
I got yellow

42
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,970
Yellow is easy, it's right in the middle

43
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,100
But this will inevitably crumble, I mean, not now

44
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,100
That's right

45
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,010
How do you know when it will? It's tricky

46
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,720
For now it's pretty solid

47
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,020
It's going to get crooked

48
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,020
Blue is bad news

49
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,620
Which one...?

50
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,070
But it's worth 3 points

51
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,970
You're fine however it goes

52
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,020
But it's already kinda crooked...

53
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,220
Yes

54
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,900
You can't do that, you have deal only with the first stick you've touched

55
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,890
Eh?

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,370
Just say that before, dude

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,900
Of course it's like this, Endo

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,810
But once you grab one and try to get it out...

59
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,510
You can sway it around as much as you want

60
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,880
What do you mean?

61
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,350
You can move it around?

62
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,350
Yes, you can shake it

63
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,150
While holding it?

64
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,250
You can do that

65
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,000
You can change that?

66
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,620
Yes, you can adjust it as much as you want

67
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,490
As long as you're going to get the stick you're holding

68
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,790
This is such an important thing to say

69
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,590
Why bringing it up now?

70
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,620
It was really important... which one was mine?

71
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,800
- It was that one
- I guess you're getting one penalty

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,250
Take that one for now

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,880
I'm sure it was that one

74
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,520
Is this ok?

75
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,420
It's fine, it got even more crooked but it didn't crumble down

76
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,700
I see, so the loop is going to move as well...

77
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,200
Another blue one

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,620
It's totally doable

79
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,920
I think this one's ok

80
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,130
Can you let go of the one you're holding?

81
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,970
He made it look so easy, everything is alright

82
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,970
It's another blue

83
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,970
Ok, now it's going to be risky

84
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,470
Right, we won't know when it's gonna be hard

85
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,070
If the loop is going to stay as it is, I can do it

86
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,950
I think it's this one

87
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,020
Huh? Is this situation ok?

88
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,550
Yes, it's still ok

89
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,670
Are you kidding me?

90
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,470
I see, now I see

91
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,070
That was impressive

92
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,370
He got so close

93
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,620
Yeah, it was about to crumble

94
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,250
The dice is being such a jerk

95
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,250
Nothing but blue

96
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,370
Yeah, it's unbelievable

97
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,070
We got it, dice

98
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,720
We know it by now

99
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,650
Maybe if you swing it around...

100
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,520
It's moving a bit

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,300
It's ok to move it around, you know

102
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,300
You can control it

103
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,900
You can get it back in shape

104
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,600
It is crumbling

105
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,770
It's really close to crumbling

106
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,620
Doesn't look safe

107
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,300
Isn't it better to take it away in one flick?

108
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,670
So stupid

109
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,120
Such a boring way to lose...

110
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,050
That was so stupid of you

111
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,820
Why didn't you try to put everything back?

112
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,270
Yeah, you could have done it

113
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,160
But--

114
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,130
This is how smaller companies crumble down

115
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,270
So worthless

116
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,270
That's a backstreet workshop way of ending it

117
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,720
But this happened because I was trying to put it back...

118
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,940
It crumbled 'cause I tried to prevent it

119
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,570
Just do it the other way round

120
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's have another round now that we know the rules

121
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,720
On their second round...

122
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,270
Now I get it

123
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,670
The five started to understand the mechanics of Zitternix

124
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,170
And they collect more and more sticks

125
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,270
That was close

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,650
This one looks bad, this other one too

127
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,820
You're right, they're both hard to get

128
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,550
Incredible

129
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,900
Are you kidding me?!

130
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,480
I don't have much confidence in this...

131
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,950
Alright

132
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,600
It's this one, right? I know for sure it's this one

133
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,550
Or maybe I'm wrong?

134
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,550
Wait a second, is it this one?

135
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,920
That one...

136
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,170
Over there

137
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,750
Is this...? Oh, from here?

138
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,800
Wait a second

139
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,370
Ah, this one!
- That's right

140
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,550
Now I see

141
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,570
It's not touching anything relevant

142
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,970
But it's hard to get

143
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,450
He's still in game, right?

144
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,310
I can't get this...

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,150
Dude, if everything falls, it'd be your second time

146
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,720
Just go for it

147
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,420
This hesitation is killing me

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,700
Let's see...

149
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,270
Why sticking to that? Wait, he has to

150
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,270
Can't help it, he touched that one

151
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,370
He's really...

152
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,370
Where is it gonna fall?

153
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,700
It got even deeper inside

154
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,570
Now he's 100% done for

155
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,520
Come on, man...

156
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,670
You made it impossible

157
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,670
It's between two red ones

158
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,570
And you're forced to take that one

159
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,020
You're in such a bad situation now

160
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,320
Try to use your pinky

161
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,750
I don't think he...

162
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,070
His fingers...

163
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,420
Like this, huh?

164
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,100
That's not how-- what a waste of time

165
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,300
Their next tabletop game is going to be "Slide Quest", made in France

166
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,400
Four player cooperate to balance four levers

167
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,310
And guide the adventurer towards the goal!

168
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,010
Here it is

169
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,220
Looks fun

170
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,900
This is that french game

171
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,200
Which got your attention, Matsumoto

172
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,270
You have to go past several obstacles over the board

173
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,470
By following the white line

174
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,770
And try to reach the number "4" at the end of the road

175
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,660
So, this is our route?

176
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,020
But near the route there are objects like this stone

177
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,240
Or dynamites like those

178
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,200
That's 'cuz you're placing 'em

179
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,970
That's the point of the game

180
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,850
It figures

181
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,820
That's how it is... if there weren't any, it won't be fun

182
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,200
It's fun because there are obstacles

183
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
How can we pass through here?

184
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,670
Yeah I mean-- we can't touch it, right?

185
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,050
You end up touching the dynamite while passing through here, right?

186
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,370
If you hit it it's fine, no big deal

187
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,950
But if you knock it over, it explodes and you're out

188
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,370
So we can't make it fall

189
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,320
What if it falls down the hole?

190
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,570
It won't matter

191
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,380
But it'll explode

192
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,950
It explodes?

193
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,470
'Cause it comes from below

194
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,860
Yeah but uh....

195
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,180
I mean, debris could fly towards us

196
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,170
Are you--- talking about a real situation?

197
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,020
Is it really gonna explode?

198
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,620
Can we fall in the hole with the dynamite?

199
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,270
The dyn---

200
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,120
Can we jump inside with it?

201
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,150
Of course you can't

202
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,960
You'd die

203
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,820
You can't fall inside this hole

204
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,600
How about the other two?

205
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,470
All holes are bad!

206
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,340
Is it really going to explode?

207
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,370
What the hell are you all talking about?!

208
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,620
Let's do this

209
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,170
Endo, you should go right some more

210
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,620
We can't fall inside the hole

211
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,320
Well...

212
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,420
Pretty rough

213
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,600
We're still on track, it's alright

214
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,920
Yamazaki stop lifting that, I'm gonna do the same too

215
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,970
That's right, just like this

216
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,830
We have to let Hamada deal with this

217
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,800
Now it's your turn, Matsumoto

218
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,420
Oh boy, now I have to get past that hole

219
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,200
Endo you too

220
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,350
Can I help here?

221
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,870
You went too far, Yama-chan!

222
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,710
We're so close to the goal

223
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,620
No, you have to follow the route

224
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,250
Towards me, Yama-chan

225
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,400
It's not moving

226
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,320
Here

227
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,920
More towards Matsumot---

228
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,090
Where the hell are ya goin'?

229
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,090
We were doing so well...

230
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,900
Come on...

231
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,300
Yama-chan careful! Go back

232
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,250
Let's put it back where it was

233
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,250
Well done, now it's ok

234
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,200
I'm gonna let go

235
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
It's up to you, Matsumoto

236
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Why do you always do that?!

237
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,710
He's right

238
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,870
It wasn't me, it was Endo!

239
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,420
It was you, Yama-chan

240
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,420
Let's go

241
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,420
Don't move there

242
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,200
Tilt it, Shozo

243
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,150
I have to

244
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,650
I'm not moving here

245
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,620
Oh, nice nice

246
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,620
Looking good so far

247
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,460
Yama-chan, don't touch anything!

248
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
He's right

249
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,440
I'm scared

250
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,570
Don't shout

251
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,400
That was on me

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This game is freaking hard!

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,100
It's really hard

254
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,860
Look, there are corpses...

255
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,150
Holy shit, it's getting scary

256
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,150
So scary!

257
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,700
Look how many dead guys are in there!

258
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,950
You were doing great at first

259
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,150
Wanna switch places with me, Yamazaki?

260
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,220
Hamada has to give it all at the beginning

261
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,370
At this point you---- Ah!

262
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,250
Are you kidding me?

263
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,320
You got it wrong, it was Shozo

264
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,880
It wasn't me

265
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,170
You pulled the lever so hard

266
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,120
I did not

267
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,690
It went straight down the hole

268
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,690
That's because he pulled so goddamn hard

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,950
I didn't, I swear

270
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,280
It's a game about collaboration and trust, but...

271
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,440
Careful, there's a dynamite

272
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,420
Why did you pull it that way? We were doing the opposite

273
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,280
I didn't!

274
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,850
Of course it's gonna fall!

275
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,220
I think I'm done

276
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,390
We were moving it that way, but those brats over there...

277
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,890
He's freaking me out

278
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,390
And he just called us "brats"

279
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,900
What the fuck is wrong with you two?!

280
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,900
I'm seriously scared

281
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,870
Tanaka switches places with Hamada

282
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,150
But his pressure is just escalating

283
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,400
You have to let Yama-chan do this

284
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm fine, I'm not moving anything

285
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,440
What the hell are you doing?

286
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,900
It was the two of you just now

287
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,270
You went hard, didn't you?

288
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,200
Yeah...

289
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,800
I went a bit hard

290
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,460
Why did I suddenly get called to join this?

291
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,450
It wasn't sudden at all

292
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,050
Their next game is "Ubongo", made in Germany

293
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,570
It's a speed puzzle game in which you have to fill the blank spaces on the board with the given pieces

294
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,720
First off we're going to roll the dice and see what we get

295
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,500
For example, now we got this serow

296
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,320
Now, take a look at your own serow-marked piece combo

297
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,320
You have to use those three colored pieces to fill the blank space

298
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,460
All of them?

299
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,900
All of them, yeah

300
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,400
You gotta fill it up nice and clean

301
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,430
They all work?

302
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,430
They do

303
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,640
The first person who completes his given puzzle...

304
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,940
Has to shout "ubongo"

305
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,050
And from when the first person says it

306
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,720
All the other players

307
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,650
Have 10 seconds to complete their own puzzle

308
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,320
I don't think it'll be enough for us...

309
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,620
Hamada's puzzles seem kinda easy to me

310
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,520
We don't know that, let's do it

311
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
This is hard

312
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,950
Here comes the dice

313
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,820
We got a mask

314
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,200
The mask? The one at the bottom?

315
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,750
I'm gonna do this

316
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,310
How am I supposed to fill it completely?

317
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,720
Put your mind into it

318
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,850
Even if you say so...

319
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,850
You have to use all three pieces

320
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,920
Sorta ubongo!

321
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,920
"Sorta"...?

322
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,710
There's no such thing

323
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,590
You have one spare space

324
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,970
But it's kinda an ubongo, isn't it?

325
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,860
You have to fill it completely, there's no "kinda ubongo"

326
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,330
Ubongo

327
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,180
He got an ubongo!

328
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,370
Ubongo!

329
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,220
TIME UP

330
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,550
And it's over

331
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,770
Wait a sec, now I'm curious to see how can I get an ubongo here

332
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,420
Please, check it out for yourself

333
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,690
I don't think this one can actually get me an ubongo

334
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,750
I can get a sorta-ubongo though

335
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,650
Same here

336
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,070
He did it in a flash!!

337
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:32,340
The genius boy appeared!

338
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,300
So quick!

339
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,750
Can you do mine too?

340
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,750
What was that just now? Are you kidding me?

341
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,590
It's an ubongo!

342
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,400
The genius boy appeared among us!

343
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,900
I always have one square left

344
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,570
Please, do it

345
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,570
Genius boy

346
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,140
I'm 100% sure you'll have one square left too

347
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,100
Maybe this one's impossible even for genius boy here

348
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,650
He's really a prodigy

349
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,270
The hell is this?!

350
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,570
Incredible

351
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,940
Impressive

352
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,220
If you flip your puzzle board...

353
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,820
You'll get a 4-pieces harder version

354
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,450
Four? Impossible

355
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,600
But maybe it could even be easier, who knows

356
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,000
It could be, yeah

357
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,220
We're doing this?

358
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,900
Just flip your board

359
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,370
I don't think I can win against genius boy

360
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,340
You won't expect it, but Yamazaki has this side too

361
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,320
That was a shock

362
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,200
Let's do this

363
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,550
It's a snake

364
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,070
Four pieces, huh...

365
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,010
The fact you can flip each piece is driving me nuts...

366
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,870
It gets more difficult with four pieces

367
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,400
This is impossible...

368
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,120
I don't think I can get any ubon---

369
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,840
Ubongo!

370
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,170
Genius boy returns

371
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,050
Are you kidding me?!

372
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,130
Amazing

373
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,780
I could make this my job, you know

374
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,120
Wanna be an ubongo comedian?

375
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:29,130
Their next game is going to be "Quarto!", made in France

376
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,720
There are 4 types of pieces

377
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,470
You have to place them anywhere in the board to form a row

378
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,770
Make sure to line up 4 of them

379
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,340
But there are lots of combinations

380
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:46,020
For example, four of the same color are ok

381
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,520
How about the shape?

382
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,300
Even if they're not the same color, same length is ok too

383
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,020
Length too?

384
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,300
Yep, as long as they form a line

385
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,150
There are four combinations

386
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:03,150
color (white or black)

387
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:03,150
hole (present or absent)

388
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:03,150
length (long or short)

389
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:03,150
shape (round or squared)

390
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:03,150
For a row in Quarto: color, shape, presence or absence of hole, length

391
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:10,170
Another important point of this game is that your opponent chooses which piece you're going to play next

392
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:16,020
If you line up four of them in a combo, you win by shouting "quarto", but...

393
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,850
There's a chance you line up a quarto but you don't realize you did it

394
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,850
It can happen

395
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,850
That you don't feel your quarto?

396
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,000
In that case, if the opponent notices that during his next turn...

397
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,820
He can shout "quarto" himself and snatch the opponent's point

398
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,170
You can steal points

399
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,620
Oh, I see...

400
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,760
First challenge on quarto: Hosei vs Endo

401
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,800
I see

402
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,350
So strange you get to choose what the opponent plays

403
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,750
It is

404
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,920
I see...

405
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,850
There are lots of possible patterns to make points...

406
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,740
I think we're few steps away from scoring a point

407
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,220
Yeah, but how?

408
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,060
Quattro

409
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,950
Hosei wins

410
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,370
He's right!

411
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,810
Endo...

412
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,700
Does this count as a quattro?

413
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,700
It's quarto, actually

414
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,950
Quattro is that pizza, right?

415
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,140
Ahhh, it's the color, isn't it?

416
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,210
I didn't notice it

417
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,250
I did, actually

418
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,510
We should count this as a draw

419
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,640
I was looking so cool and then...

420
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,640
Then "quattro"

421
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,780
It's a pizza

422
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,070
That one from Pizza-la

423
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,080
It's that one from Pizza-la's delivery service

424
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,400
Downtown showdown: an unexpected turn of event!

425
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:24,720
Time for a Downtown showdown on quarto: get ready for a crazy twist!

426
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,350
Do rock-paper-scissors

427
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,610
Get ready and---

428
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,420
Matsumoto is going first

429
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,540
Was that "get ready" thing necessary?

430
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,320
That was so unnecessary

431
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,230
Dude, I just placed this piece here

432
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,230
Yep

433
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,920
And you're not moving?

434
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,800
Oh, do I have to?

435
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,150
He didn't see anything!!

436
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,920
This guy is insane

437
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,220
Of course you gotta move

438
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,240
Alright

439
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,940
Place a piece already!!

440
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,350
This is so bad

441
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,500
What's going on?

442
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,670
I place his piece and then mine?

443
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,220
Yeah

444
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,850
This guy...

445
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,100
Anywhere is fine, right?

446
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,100
Yes

447
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,200
I see, even far away is good

448
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,870
No, I---

449
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,470
It's Hamada's turn to place a piece

450
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,710
Those guys are absurd

451
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,710
No wait-- I knew that

452
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,570
I came here to have fun!

453
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,350
Are you sure?

454
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,750
That's not normal

455
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,750
I'm just here to have fun

456
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,730
Just place a piece already!!

457
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,660
Gimme a break

458
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,920
This is just a thing we're doing now

459
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,700
It has nothing to do with the game

460
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,940
Just quit it, otherwise I'm gonna call it a forfeited game

461
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,600
I was just thinking about my moves, geez

462
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,150
Can't deny you have to

463
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,250
But it's a fun game

464
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,550
You gotta use your head

465
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,200
I'm thinking about several strategies

466
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,500
This friggin' piece you gotta place...

467
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,170
Yeah, it's tricky

468
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,200
It makes you impatient

469
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,870
But I'm scared to be yelled by him, so I place em without thinking

470
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,170
It's frightening, yeah

471
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,350
That's what makes me place them

472
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,290
Place that friggin' piece...

473
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,800
Can't we just pretend I've won this?

474
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,870
Woah, what should I do?

475
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,420
Close to match point, huh?

476
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,220
We're close

477
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,420
That piece is probably upside down

478
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,700
This one?
- Yes, that one

479
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
And now...?

480
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,800
Quattro

481
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,800
He said "quattro"! The pizza thing!

482
00:23:39,500 --> 00:24:09,000

483
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,950
"Quarto"?
- That's a pizza

484
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,750
That's from Pizza-la

485
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,020
Enough with this

486
00:23:47,500 --> 00:24:09,000

487
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,620
They barely even played!

488
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,620
This game is a blast, isn't it?

489
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,320
It really is

490
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,000
I think pizza will be sold more than this game after we air this

491
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,950
They're all gonna order "quattro" pizza
