You're right, I am an idiot. I chug liquor, and make women cry.

Of course, all of that is for the craft.

But, honestly

65
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,160
I really don't even feel like doing this.

Ruby Ring / Akira Terao

91
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,480
Behind the frosted glass, in a windy town.

92
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,320
An unwelcome heart is in pain.

93
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,660
Like a weightless dead leaf blowing all around.

94
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,160
Ever since losing you......

95
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,740
Staring down at your feet,

96
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,910
You took the ring off that day.

97
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,780
If you planned on giving it back to me,

98
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:33,750
Just throw it away.

99
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:41,560
Now two years have gone and passed by.

100
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,600
And when I catch a glimpse of that beige coat you used to wear,

101
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,970
I look and see if I can find the ruby ring on her finger.

102
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,710
Ever since losing you......

103
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,930
Thank you very much, come right over here

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,390
You were the first one up

105
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,390
and it was like you were completely possessed by him.

106
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,030
Right

107
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,220
and it was like you were completely possessed by him.

108
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,960
Thank you.

109
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,220
Really.

110
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,430
Was there anything you focused on?

111
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,430
I tried to get the feeling

112
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,430
for the mouth posture

113
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,300
Terao Akira's...

114
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,100
Sometimes he goes like this, see

115
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,240
Ah, that was the point of focus

116
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,240
Yea

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,200
Forget that though, why did the MC get to sing for so long?

118
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,670
Forget that though, why did the MC get to sing for so long?

119
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,510
Forget that though, why did the MC get to sing for so long?

120
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,840
Well, we were the first ones up, so

121
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,450
We had to come out and

122
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,450
show how it's done

123
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,450
and there's two of us...

124
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,580
How was it?

125
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,720
You're really gonna ask me that?

126
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,420
You're really gonna ask me that?

127
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,600
Alright.

128
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,520
She's probably never heard of him before

129
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,630
Have you heard of Akira Terao?

130
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,730

186
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,610
"Let's try wearing each others"

187
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,350
Enough already!!

188
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,730
Thank you, go ahead and take a seat

189
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,030
Alright

190
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,590
Here's the next Lip-Syncer

191
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:10,060
A Godsister of Show Business

192
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:10,060
Is Finally Entering the Lip-Syncing World

193
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,100
Akiko Wada's "Old Diary"

194
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:20,370
Lyrics by: Kazumi Yasui  Composer: Kouji Makaino

195
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:20,370
Old Diary / Akiko Wada

196
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,960
Was her chest always that big?

197
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,880
Back then, both of us

198
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,450
For some reason, because of society

199
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,480
So he's not doing Mori Shinichi

200
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,090
we sulked in how we lived.

201
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,360
Her voice is young

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,360
It's very young

203
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,360
In a small love apartment.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,600
I'm not sure about this...

205
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,530
Back then, both of us

206
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,470
For some reason, because of young lust

207
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,840
We were wasting our lives,

208
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,740
Bringing lover's bodies together.

209
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,380
I liked you, but stuff like "love"

210
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,560
Oh, she moves like that?

211
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,360
Absolutely, absolutely never say.

212
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,500
Akiko-san.

213
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
I guess so.

214
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,560
Life in the corner of the city

215
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,560
Doesn't he kinda look like Mori-san?

216
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,030
was perfect the way it was.

217
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,260
His base has turned into Mori-san.

218
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,700
Yea, it has.

219
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,540
Back then, both of us

220
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,630
Sometimes he just makes that face...

221
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,310
didn't believe other people.

222
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,740
It was just us all alone,

223
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,680
and we didn't care about a single thing.

224
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,100
Thank you very much, come on over.

225
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,900
You're breathing quite heavily, but

226
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,570
His face was Mori Shinichi!!

227
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
You started to morph into him

228
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,500
No no no,

229
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,570
You're singing face was Mori Shinichi.

230
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,570
It really was.

231
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,970
I tried my best to completely become Akiko Wada today.

232
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,310
I tried my best to completely become Akiko Wada today.

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,780
I completely put Mori Shinchi aside.

234
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,110
Your Mori-san is better

235
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,700
His Mori-san is better than this.

236
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,780
But with Mori-san,

237
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,920
He doesn't really have many hits

238
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,920
Yes he does!!

239
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,920
He has tons!!

240
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,100
That's just disrespectful.

241
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,830
He does, but there were none on the list.

242
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,230
Well it was perfect, thank you.

243
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,230
Please have a seat.

244
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,400
Now for the next Lip-Syncer.

245
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,770
A Performance of a Song About a Nostalgic Youth!!

246
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,460
Kensaku Morita's "Tearful Farewell"

247
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:41,910
Lyrics by: Yuu Aku  Composer: Kunihiko Suzuki

248
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:41,910
Tearful Farewell / Kensaku Morita

249
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,130
Oh, this is perfect for Yoshinobu

250
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,100
This is a good pick for him.

251
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Woah, he's barefoot

252
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,090
Who do you say goodbye to?

253
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,460
It's actually kinda funny

254
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:59,200
Farewells are all too sad

255
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,530
He's good at the facial expressions.

256
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,200
He's good at the facial expressions.

257
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,840
Wait for a rainy day,

258
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,230
If we tried this it wouldn't be funny, though

259
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,630
I see

260
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:12,810
and say a tearful farewell.

261
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:26,120
Don't show the tears that will run down your cheeks.

262
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,130
That's a good face

263
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,130
That's just how he sang.

264
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,290
This guy really watched the video

265
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:37,540
When you can't hold them back, wash them away with a rain shower.

266
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:44,140
Loneliness and sorrow,

267
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:50,410
will come and go eventually.

268
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,260
He sang like that too, huh.

269
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:56,850
But when that time comes,

270
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,460
His smile is great.

271
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,800
It's refreshing.

272
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:04,500
say a tearful farewell.

273
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,200
Not bad

274
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,170
It was good because he's an amateur

275
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,200
It was good

276
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,930
That was uh,

277
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,330
a fantastic performance.

278
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,340
It was great

279
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,280
It was just like Morita-san.

280
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,510
It was just like Morita-san.

281
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,360
He really studied for this.

282
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,780
It felt like he really studied the music video.

283
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,250
How much did you study for this?

284
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,380
How much did you study for this?

285
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,150
A couple of... I watched it a few times.

286
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,290
A couple of... I watched it a few times.

287
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,820
A couple of few times?

288
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,820
What does that mean?

289
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,060
I knew it well.

290
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,060
You know it well?

291
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,230
From my youth.

292
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:42,400
More Contestants Will Perform!!

293
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:42,400
Second Half After the Cheer Break

294
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,130
After the cheer break, the second half will begin!

295
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,100
After this, even more contestants will perform!

296
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,030
Let's start the second half.

297
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,940
First Million Record Seller!

298
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,940
The Queen of Heartbreak's

299
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,180
Miyuki Nakajima's "Light Sleep"

300
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:03,150
Light Sleep / Miyuki Nakajima

301
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:03,150
Lyrics / Composer: Miyuki Nakajima

302
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,860
Hold on

303
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,860
This is his entrance?

304
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,460
So he's not using the stairs

305
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,800
This is repulsive.

306
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,270
He must have seen this at a concert.

307
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,300
He may have.

308
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,600
It's like a live concert.

309
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:30,550
That summer day I promised to remember seems so long ago.

310
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,330
That's a great stare.

311
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:39,090
That wind is gone even from the returning tides.

312
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,960
This is scary!

313
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:47,270
Ahh, the candle that we lit together in that room.

314
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,790
He's an idiot

315
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,270
He looks like an old lady!!

316
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,500
In the time of overflowing light

317
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,600
But he's so into it.

318
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,600
He is.

319
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,660
Kind of like a fortuneteller.

320
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,040
Where did it fade away to.

321
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,700
This is how you do it.

322
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:03,550
Tell me how much you miss it

323
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,830
I feel like I've learned something.

324
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,060
I didn't know you could take this path

325
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:11,990
Tell me the truth.

326
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,800
You can.

327
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
That way of singing...

328
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:20,530
If you're not a stranger, it's all the more, all the more...

329
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,560
She really makes that face

330
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,730
She makes scary faces.

331
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:28,670
Wandering in a light sleep,

332
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,730
Oh, it changed.

333
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,960
It's a new face

334
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:36,850
the town is calling out for love.

335
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:44,990
Wandering in a light sleep,

336
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,860
He has a lot of faces up his sleeve.

337
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:54,270
the town is calling out for love.

338
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,730
Amazing.

339
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,500
A little scary.

340
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Is that the finale face?

341
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Really scary.

342
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,740
The ending is scary.

343
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,940
He turned into Hiroko Yakushimaru

344
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,730
So this is how it ends.

345
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,300
Thank you very much!

346
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,650
Come on over here.

347
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,190
It was very enthusiastic singing,

348
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,190
or should I say enthusiastic lip-syncing.

349
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,060
Right, well

350
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,160
you see,

351
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,000
It was the theme for a drama.

352
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,570
Was there a reason you chose

353
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,570
this song specifically?

354
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,800
The theme, umm...

355
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,640
It was the theme for a drama.

356
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,640
Say the reason!!

357
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,310
Why did you choose this song?

358
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,280
Because I liked that drama...

359
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,310
And it's the theme song...

360
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,310
Correct.

361
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,810
She's getting mad.

362
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,250
I understand.

363
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,250
Yes.

364
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,550
She's getting mad.

365
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,390
So it's like

366
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,390
You were in a light sleep

367
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,390
and woke up from it, huh?

368
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,390
And also...

369
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,390
Huh!?

370
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,960
Huh!?

371
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,800
He won't even look over here

372
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,660
Like an awakening...

373
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,230
We are now at our last Lip-Syncer!

374
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,730
We are now at our last Lip-Syncer!

375
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:13,880
An Enthusiastic Performance From

376
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:13,880
a Lip-Syncing King and His 2 Assistants!!

377
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,330
The Checkers' "Heartbreak for Julia"!

378
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:26,760
Heartbreak for Julia / The Checkers

379
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:26,760
Lyrics by: Masao Urino  Composer: Hiroaki Serizawa

380
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,130
"His 2 assistants?"

381
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,500
And "a king."

382
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Ah, I remember this song.

383
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,360
Oh, it's Fumiya-san

384
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,730
and Takamoku-san

385
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,230
They look just like them

386
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,660
They look just like them

387
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,870
A candle's light

388
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:40,300
Bursts and spreads through a glass piercing.

389
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,940
You dance in his arms.

390
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,570
Is this supposed to be Fumiya-san?

391
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,740
Is this supposed to be Fumiya-san?

392
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
Yea...

393
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,710
Heartbreak

394
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,090
A sad carol in the window display.

395
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,960
He really...

396
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,090
He got really old

397
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,660
It turned into silver snow.

398
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,160
He's not very light on his feet

399
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,660
As I walked through the door

400
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:13,800
The person who cried and sent me off.....

401
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:22,110
We lost something important in this city.

402
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:28,720
Do you remember?

403
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,950
He's pretty stiff.

404
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,120
I wish he'd move a little more.

405
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,190
The dream that we had.

406
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,760
He used to move around a bit more

407
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:40,830
Let's go back to that street corner,

408
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:50,470
Julia

409
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,430
He got so old.

410
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,360
He finally used both arms

411
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,020
So slow!

412
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,930
Sometimes too early, sometimes too late

413
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,930
Thank you very much, come on over.

414
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,290
How do you feel? Having finished your lip-sync.

415
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,830
How do you feel? Having finished your lip-sync.

416
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,300
I'm 61 years old now, so

417
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,360
Right

418
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,300
After training...

419
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,840
I've had muscle pain for three days now.

420
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,430
Ah, I see.

421
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,770
Your voice is way too quiet!!

422
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,440
Your voice is way too quiet!!

423
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,710
During some of it you sort of looked like Daiki Kameda

424
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,810
During some of it you sort of looked like Daiki Kameda

425
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,500
It's supposed to be Fumiya-san

426
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,700
Thank you very much, please have a seat.

427
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,990
But still,

428
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,990
Mrs. Nakajima is still aiming for the win.

429
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,190
He always goes for high quality

430
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,790
but he never wins

431
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,860
You could really feel his enthusiasm this time, too.

432
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:56,540
The Lip-Sync Battle With a Prize

433
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:56,540
The Lip-Sync Battle With a Prize

434
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:56,540
Who Will Win the Lip-Syncing Crown!?

435
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:56,540
Who Will Win the Lip-Syncing Crown!?

436
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:56,540
Who Will Win the Lip-Syncing Crown!?

437
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:56,540
Who Will Win the Lip-Syncing Crown!?

438
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,060
The White Hot Lip-Sync Contest!

439
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,700
And now, who will receive the lip-syncing crown?

440
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,100
The winner is...

441
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,330
The Checkers!

442
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:12,190
Takafumi    Kenji     Kazuhiro
Inomoto       Suga     Fujiwara

443
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:12,190
Winner

444
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,000
Congratulations!

445
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,860
Lost it again...

446
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,500
We couldn't compete

447
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
You had the highest quality

448
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,030
I thought it might be Miyuki-san, but...

449
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,730
Yours was high quality so it's ok

450
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,710
A Real Performance From the Winners!!

451
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,710
After This

452
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,640
That must be frustrating.

453
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,630
It must be, huh.

454
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:28,570
r

455
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:36,180
Cue Card

456
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:36,180
The ones acquiring the prize are "Heartbreak for Julia"

457
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:36,180
r

458
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:36,180
The ones acquiring the prize are "Heartbreak for Julia"

459
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,180
stiff

460
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,200
He always does this.

461
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,480
He did it last time too.

462
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,650
It's not a license!!

463
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,590
The Checkers' "Heartbreak for Julia"!

464
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:51,200
Heartbreak for Julia / The Checkers

465
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:51,200
Lyrics by: Masao Urino  Composer: Hiroaki Serizawa

466
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,760
Can't believe we get to see it again

467
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,830
It's even their real voices.

468
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,970
A candle's light

469
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,240
Bursts and spreads through a glass piercing.

470
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,950
You dance in his arms.

471
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,750
He's so gentle.

472
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,550
Such a soft voice.

473
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,820
Heartbreak

474
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,460
You can do better than this

475
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,360
A sad carol in the window display.

476
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,930
Try harder

477
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,670
It turned into silver snow.

478
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,100
So gentle.

479
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:33,800
As I walked through the door

480
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,440
It's turning into a love-making song!!

481
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,260
Can they keep it up?

482
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:41,280
The person who cried and sent me off.....

483
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,280
We lost something important in this city.

484
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,930
His voice isn't coming out

485
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:56,090
Do you remember?

486
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:01,400
The dream that we had.

487
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:08,170
Let's go back to that street corner,

488
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:16,410
Julia

489
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,500
It won't come out

490
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,000
It's really good

491
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,500
It's great

492
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,160
Great.

493
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,560
Thank you very much.

494
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,130
This time,

495
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,200
it was your real voices

496
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,070
By the end it turned into old men doing karaoke

497
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,910
By the end it turned into old men doing karaoke

498
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,580
She's still mad

499
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,330
She's still really mad.

500
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,610
I was so annoyed

501
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,610
that I couldn't really hear the song.

502
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,120
Could you please sing it again?

503
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,360
Good idea

504
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,030
Really?

505
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,030
Good idea!

506
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,030
Alright then,

507
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,620
Ok then, get ready

508
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,820
Get the song ready!!

509
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,930
Since she couldn't hear it...

510
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,930
No lyrics, either (on the cue cards)

511
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,260
Let's hear it one more time

512
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:11,740
* No Lyric Cue Cards

513
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:11,740
Heartbreak for Julia / The Checkers

514
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:11,740
Lyrics by: Masao Urino  Composer: Hiroaki Serizawa

515
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,600
Still smiling, though.

516
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,830
See that?

517
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,440
He was like "Where's the lyrics!?"

518
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,510
A candle's light

519
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:27,020
Spreads through a glass pi--...

520
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:33,390
You dance in his arms.

521
00:23:33,720 --> 00:24:09,660
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

522
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,300
That's the song of a winner

523
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,560
Not bad.

524
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,430
How was it, Nakajima Miyumi-san?

525
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,960
At some point, uhh

526
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,960
I couldn't understand the lyrics anymore

527
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,530
Fumiya-san, the lyrics...
