00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,820
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,590
Let's get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,200
It's Chocolate Planet!

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,920
It's Chocolate Planets!

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,590
Yes indeed, we are Chocolate Planets, thank you for having us

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,710
Thank you, thank you

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,080
So, although it may be asking too much,

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,810
Everyone please look here
-What what what

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,120
Does everyone know what this is?

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,420
It's a deep-sea monkfish

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,050
That's right, a deep-sea monkfish

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,560
Do you know the characteristics of this fish?

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,290
It has a glowing light

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,230
Do you know why it glows?

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,390
Because they want to attract other small fish to them
-That's right

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,870
Deep-sea monkfish glow from the top of their heads to feed on the small fish that are attracted to it

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,580
This time we bring you a theory about deep-sea monkfish

18
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,720
This is it:

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,380
Deep-sea monkfish traps also work for humans

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,690
Wait a minute, I'm a little confused about what you mean

21
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,900
What is it? Give me an example

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,240
Well, it glows, right?

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,410
And fish are attracted to it, right?

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,410
Then the deep-sea monkfish eats them

25
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,280
"Does this apply to humans as well?" That's it

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,500
Does this apply to humans?
-In humans, that is...

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,310
The kid on that side, you speak first

28
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,850
That means I'm not very credible, right?

29
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,340
Let the planets speak

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,290
I am the planet
-That is, the monkfish will glow

31
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,470
There's a light, right?

32
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,750
Then humans come along

33
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,750
And then they are preyed upon

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,850
Preyed upon...?
-Can it eat humans?

35
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,170
Is the trap for humans also light?

36
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,190
It's light, it's light

37
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:50,990
That is, whether deep-sea monkfish can prey on humans
That's all.

38
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,490
I was just asking what everyone thinks, so I raised this question

39
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,220
Are you okay? Were you uncomfortable just now?

40
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,410
No discomfort, no discomfort-
-Instead...

41
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,900
We are just wondering why they can't understand

42
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,220
What don't you understand?

43
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,310
I want to watch the VTR at home, is that OK?

44
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,070
Why does it have to be like this?

45
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,740
Coming up, the horror of the deep-sea monkfish prank!

46
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,690
What's that?

47
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,420
Also, we have...

48
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,090
No-one can tell who you are if you're wrapped in 10 rubber bands

49
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,710
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!?

50
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,280
And, "If the person who is pranked pisses themselves...

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,560
The instigator's face will instantly turn serious"

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,630
And, the "No couples sleep in bunk beds" verification!

53
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:56,160
Verify that the deep-sea monkfish's trap also works for humans

54
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,200
This time the stage is this warehouse

55
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:07,130
First, we contacted the targets under the guise of a fake program

56
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,880
Then suddenly let the venue expereince a blackout

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,930
At this time, the deep-sea monkfish machine hidden behind the wall of boxes appears,

58
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,190
Illuminated only by the tip of its tentacle

59
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,640
If the target is attracted, it will be preyed upon instantly

60
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,040
Ah I see

61
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,950
First of all, the first target

62
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,220
Nishimura
-Yeah

63
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,870
Viking's Nishimura

64
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,200
He's completely unaware that on the other side of the wall, there is a giant deep-sea fish

65
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,550
Nishimura is confirming the playing cards that will supposedly be used in the next challenge

66
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,510
What the hell?

67
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,720
Just when he is, for some reason, checking the smell of the cards...

68
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,030
Suddenly...

69
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,240
Whoa scary

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,700
Pretty scary!

71
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,570
Can't see anything at all

72
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,080
A power outage!

73
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,940
Why just this reaction?

74
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,320
Not even a sound

75
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Not making a single sound is pretty impressive

76
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,630
If it was me I'd probably be more afraid

77
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,870
Then the staff wearing night vision goggles quietly remove the wall

78
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,630
Deep Sea State
-Deep Sea State, absolutely

79
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,790
In the darkness, within the deep sea setting, a deep-sea monkfish appears

80
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,570
It's pitch black

81
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,370
Really dark, can't even see the monkfish itself

82
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,070
Nishimura can't see anything

83
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,310
The camera is really powerful isn't it

84
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,310
What the hell?

85
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,620
He's finally speaking

86
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,680
The reaction to the power outage was rather uneventful

87
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,680
Indeed

88
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,730
Here it is

89
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,040
Here we go
-It's bright!

90
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,300
A single light in a sea darkness

91
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,310
Incidentally, the view that Nishimura saw was this

92
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,900
And then...

93
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,970
Hey...

94
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,580
I'm sure you'd go closer

95
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,830
He's leaning over!

96
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,530
Nishimura is slowly drawn to the light

97
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,310
So interesting

98
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,360
You're really good at leaning over!

99
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,180
Once you get close...
-That's all it takes

100
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,870
It's ready to eat, right?

101
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,040
And then...

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,310
And then...?

103
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,110
Feeding begins immediately

104
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,260
How does it hunt?

105
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,190
Ah, what, what, ah

106
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,430
I'm scared!

107
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,330
What is this?

108
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,330
This is how it happens

109
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,120
That's how it happens

110
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,190
Next...

111
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,580
Ah~ so cold

112
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,210
Ah~ slippery and slimy

113
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,480
The digestive juices enter

114
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,750
Ah~ so slimy

115
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,220
What is this, feels smelly and sticky and smelly

116
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,480
Any more?

117
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,850
Back into the light

118
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,270
It's a turd
-Yeah, a turd

119
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,420
Excreted through the anus

120
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,500
What's the deal?

121
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,600
It's been excreted!

122
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,870
What do you think just happened?
-Hey, what are you talking about?

123
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,340
What do you think is going on here?
-What?

124
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,540
Seriously, what?

125
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,570
Firstly, you are on Wednesday Downtown

126
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,640
Eh…？

127
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,350
What...what is this? What theory?

128
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,750
What theory? It's a theory right?

129
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,850
What...what? What is this thing?

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,260
"The deep-sea monkfish trap also applies to humans"

131
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,060
A deep sea monkfish is that monkfish...

132
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,990
The one at the bottom of the sea?
-Yes, the slimy one.

133
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,540
Ah this ah ah um

134
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,000
Ah——

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,900
The glowing one?
-Yes.

136
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,300
The one with the thing is the deep-sea monkfish?
-That's right.

137
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,100
That's the deep-sea monkfish ?
-Correct

138
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,270
The light?
-Indeed

139
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,540
It leads things toward it

140
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,280
After I got close, my feet got stuck and it moved

141
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,880
Yes, that was it eating
-So I was eaten, right?

142
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,150
Ah, I was in it's stomach. This is gastric juice, right?

143
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,070
You understand so fast!

144
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,290
Then I've been digested
-Correct

145
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,300
In the darkness, if light appears then you feel safer

146
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,870
There's no one that wouldn't take the bait

147
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,000
Ah, isn't this the deep-sea monkfish?

148
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,900
Didn't see it before

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,900
Wa--!

150
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,240
This, this, this, this!

151
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,140
This is how I was staring at it just now

152
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,480
No one can escape from this, can they

153
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,450
Impossible to escape from

154
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,020
This is an awesome theory!

155
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,120
The deep-sea monkfish is awesome!

156
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,830
Super interesting

157
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,620
I want to go home straight away,

158
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,890
And look up "deep-sea monkfish" in the encyclopedia

159
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,920
Regardless of whether it works for humans

160
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,910
Or whether it is even possible to avoid it

161
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,530
The deep-sea monkfish device is chilling!

162
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,170
It's really interesting when leaning over

163
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,980
The second target is...

164
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,600
Please sit here for a moment, I'll call the director

165
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,130
Ah~ Shiraki

166
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,130
It's Ah~ Shiraki

167
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,250
The candle's flame

168
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:27,490
She practices the scenes of a fake script with great care despite the messy outfit

169
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,210
And despite the messy outfit, she is very careful regarding hygiene

170
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,780
Ah~ Shiraki

171
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,260
She may be more wary

172
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,860
The scallops are about to be preyed upon

173
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,970
And then...

174
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,670
Wah!

175
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,600
Scary, isn't it?

176
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,770
Excuse me!?

177
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,640
You'd most likely say that at least

178
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,260
This is the normal reaction, right?

179
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,910
Excuse me--!?

180
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,370
But its probably better not to move

181
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,590
I'm scared!

182
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,550
Scary, scary, scary, scary, scary!

183
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,390
It's scary, isn't it?

184
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,760
Excuse me!?

185
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,160
Scary, scary, scary!

186
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,490
Something seems to be coming...

187
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,490
Scary, scary, scary!

188
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,100
Different to Nishimura, the sensitive to sounds and movement man and woman

189
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,200
Excuse me!?

190
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,170
I am night blind, I can't see anything!

191
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,420
Night blindness isn't the problem

192
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,390
Is there anyone there?

193
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,640
What?

194
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,120
The light is on

195
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,180
And so...

196
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,180
You would lean toward it
-Yeah

197
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,290
While treading carefully, she walks ahead

198
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,600
It's really impossible to see anything

199
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,220
Can't see anything at all

200
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,440
Can't see what's in front of her

201
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,960
Slowly moving towards the light

202
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,300
Leaning over!

203
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,560
Excuse me!?

204
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,610
She's still relying on that

205
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,920
This one also, unsurprisingly, went onto the tongue of the monkfish

206
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,160
Still a bit further, still a bit further

207
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,650
The feeding begins

208
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,650
Is it time to begin?

209
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,250
So scary... scary ah ah ah ah what is this!?

210
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,430
Eaten

211
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,750
What's going on? Scary!

212
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,970
What's the deal?

213
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,130
Scary!

214
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,120
What's the deal?

215
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,800
What's the deal?

216
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,770
How do you feel?

217
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,770
It's scary

218
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,810
It's a prank, right? A prank?

219
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,460
And so, we divulge the theory...

220
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,950
Ah——

221
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,720
Do you know the deep-sea monkfish?
-I've heard of it

222
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,220
Uses this to lure

223
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,880
Ah this is a universal object is it?

224
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,560
I just normally...

225
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,230
Went in the direction of the light

226
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,800
Incidentally, how do you feel about this lubricant?

227
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,730
This is the first time I've used it

228
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,930
It's good stuff

229
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,560
First use

230
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,610
I think I understand the type of people who like this...

231
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,870
What are you talking about?

232
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,940
I see. Is there anything else you want to say? Any more questions?

233
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,650
The rest of what I want to say...

234
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,020
Will appear after the commercial break

235
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,920
I'm sorry...

236
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,250
Start with "Sorry"

237
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,790
Shouldn't end with "Sorry"

238
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,740
The next target of the deep-sea monkfish prank is...

239
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,070
Mou Chugakusei (Already a high school student)

240
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,310
What will happen?

241
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,850
Ah!

242
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,320
Ara?

243
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,290
Are?

244
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,600
After darkness descends

245
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,990
The wall is moved as before

246
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,990
And the deep-sea monkfish debuts

247
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,830
Excuse me!?

248
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,730
And then, this time too

249
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,580
Getting closer

250
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,200
Excuse me!?

251
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,010
Definitely closer than before

252
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,440
Then, as he is already in range...

253
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,990
Yeah

254
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,940
Because the light is on

255
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,560
Wait...

256
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,780
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts

257
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,490
More digestive juices were put in this time

258
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,950
And then,

259
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,660
No! What? Why?

260
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,970
What is this...

261
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,510
Because of the darkness, I've been feeling nothing but fear

262
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,310
We are from Wednesday Downtown
-EH?

263
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,080
Wednessy?

264
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,150
Wednessy?

265
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,990
What is Wednessy?

266
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,520
Deep-sea monkfish prank?

267
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,620
Ah, really, it's a deep-sea monkfish lamp

268
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,360
The design is so good its a pity you can't see it in the darkness

269
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,480
Is that the point?

270
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,700
I was really attracted to this orange light

271
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,930
Only this orange light could be relied upon to move forward

272
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,560
Indeed

273
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,500
Is there anything else you would like to say?

274
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,410
Ah~ actually, I was really looking forward to doing the show I thought I was here for

275
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,610
"The support group is here today, too"

276
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,550
"For the sake of everyone, let's go..." or something like that...

277
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,680
It's self-made

278
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,940
Yeah it's self-made

279
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,270
Next up...

280
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,450
Hasegawa

281
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,750
No problem, right?

282
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,160
Excuse me!?

283
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,700
You're not doing anything weird, are you?

284
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,130
Anyone there?

285
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,650
Everyone says "Excuse me!?"

286
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,930
Ahhh!

287
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,430
The power is out

288
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,910
As always, this time too

289
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,910
Looks like a different person

290
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,290
His expression is so stupid

291
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,240
Is anyone there?

292
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,360
Does look stupid
-Yeah

293
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,710
Drawn by the only bright light in the darkness

294
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,530
Wow!

295
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,740
And then...

296
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
You see, looks so stupid

297
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,220
Bad, bad, bad

298
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,840
It's pouring!

299
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,080
The quantity is very good

300
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,620
Ah, so that's what happened, I was eaten
-That's right

301
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,850
So that's how it is

302
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,160
Next time I'll eat instead!

303
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,230
And so, the final individual is...

304
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,250
M-1 Champion

305
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,540
Sakai

306
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,180
This guy is pretty weird

307
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,820
His use of words might be pretty bad

308
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,480
Indeed, he must be eaten

309
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,140
Eh? Excuse me--!?

310
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,160
This is really what a bad guy looks like

311
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,880
The power is out

312
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,480
This guy doesn't even look frightened

313
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,550
It seems to have tripped

314
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
You'd usually scream a little, right?

315
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,640
Failing to spot the light, he wanders around for 3 minutes

316
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,730
He pisses me off!

317
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,120
Why can't he find it?

318
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,700
Finally...

319
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,230
I don't really understand either

320
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,360
It's so dark maybe he can't see it

321
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,330
What's that?

322
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,150
And then...

323
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,600
Hey--

324
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,150
What happened all of a sudden?

325
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,160
The panic is starting

326
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,340
Restlessness

327
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,660
Dangerous!

328
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,710
What what what what?

329
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:39,390
Ahhhh, ahhhh, snake, snake, snake, snake!

330
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,190
Still hasn't figured it out

331
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,310
Snakes?

332
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,490
Wait, there are snakes ah

333
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,670
Not snakes!

334
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,950
Why?

335
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,890
Actually, it's not snakes but digestive juices

336
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,530
And then...

337
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,230
What, what, what, what, what?

338
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:58,550
This time is based on the concept that the gastric juices will digest the clothes

339
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,700
Additional elements on top of the original

340
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,960
What the hell is that

341
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:17,160
This is "the trap of the deep-sea monkfish applies to humans as well"

342
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,130
The one just now

343
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,940
Like an orange ball
-Light

344
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:30,210
I was very restless and moved closer to the light

345
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,380
And I was eaten

346
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,740
Because it was the only one that lit up...

347
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,180
And then, because I was eaten, I was digested in the stomach

348
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,150
That's why it's so sticky

349
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,420
Huh?

350
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,690
To sum up
The trap of deep-sea monkfish is inescapable

351
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,530
Awesome

352
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,640
That's awesome
-So that's what it was all about

353
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,030
What does everyone think?

354
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,930
In short, 100% of the people were lured

355
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,330
Very impressive

356
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,310
Monkfish are doing some amazing things at the bottom of the sea

357
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,990
So this is probably how it happens to all the fish that are preyed upon

358
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,550
No idea what's going on

359
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,750
That works for fish

360
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,990
But it won't work for comedians again

361
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,880
Indeed

362
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,290
After this broadcast

363
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,260
However,

364
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,890
After watching it, even if...

365
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,490
How about changing this part?

366
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,300
The light part?

367
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,700
Replace it with something like putting a colored thing in a place where there's nothing else

368
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,140
But then...

369
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,430
It's not a deep-sea monkfish

370
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,460
So strict!

371
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,930
Let's welcome the next presenter

372
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,420
What?

373
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,640
Who is it?

374
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,520
Ah

375
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,050
It's Tamura Kenji!

376
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,010
Thank you for having me

377
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,800
Thank you for having me

378
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,610
Thanks for coming

379
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,170
This time i've brought

380
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,820
A theory about rubber bands

381
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,220
This is it:

382
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,490
A person with 10 rubber bands stretched over their face cannot be recognized

383
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,130
Eh?

384
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,490
Frequently featured in shows

385
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,560
Is seeing many rubber bands can be stretched onto the face in 1 minute

386
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,830
Stuff like a Guinness World Record challenge

387
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,830
Pretty common, right?

388
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,340
Has anyone here done it?

389
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,040
I've done it
-Yeah

390
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,840
The face is deformed after putting it on, right?

391
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,140
It's super deformed!

392
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,110
So,

393
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,220
With about 10 rubber bands, no one will be able to recognize the person

394
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,120
Can 10 be done?

395
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,290
So, let's verify it now

396
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,420
Right now?
-Yes

397
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,290
The set has already been prepared

398
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,620
Please move over there for the on-site verification

399
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,530
Team Quiz - Who is the Person Disguised by Rubber Bands?

400
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,340
This time, the teams are divided into Matsumoto and Hamada teams

401
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,970
The theory will be tested in the form of a quiz

402
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,880
Also on this side is the comedian that will never turn down any work...

403
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,410
Flirty comedian Fujimoto

404
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,260
Be careful of your choice of words

405
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,070
What do you mean by flirty comedian?

406
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,490
Matsumoto team's rubber bands

407
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,140
One team will be presented with other team's rubber band-tied face

408
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,460
And will be able to confer with each other

409
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,340
Up to 20 rubber bands can be used

410
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,930
If you succeed in making your opponent guess incorrectly,

411
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,240
The number of rubber bands used subtracted from 20 is the score

412
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:23,540
However, if the other team gets it right, they get zero points

413
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,990
So if you can't guess with 5 bands, you get 15 points

414
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,210
Ah it's this type of rule

415
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,120
I don't understand at all

416
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,480
You 'aint your standard idiot!

417
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,690
Can't help it, too old

418
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,900
He's already the age where his driver's license will be cancelled

419
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,820
Who are you talking about, idiot?

420
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
It's still too early for that

421
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,660
Who's gonna confuse the acceleration for brake?

422
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,590
So, for the first round of rubber bands tied to the guest,

423
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,720
Both of the participants are male

424
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,660
I see

425
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,320
We have A or B

426
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,240
So i'll ask Matsumoto and Hamada to choose

427
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,400
Which one?

428
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,940
Either is fine

429
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,540
Let the other side choose?

430
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,670
No problem

431
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,800
B

432
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,170
You're choosing B?
-Yes

433
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,130
Don't let each other see

434
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,280
So each has decided their respective guests

435
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,920
Got a good one

436
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,050
We don't

437
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,130
The next two teams move quickly backstage

438
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,260
And are given rubber bands

439
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,200
Where are the features of the face...

440
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,000
Nose...

441
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,300
It's the nose

442
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,770
The eyes have to be strained and deformed
-The eyes are still...

443
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,210
Lift the nose up or pull it down?

444
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,900
It's better to put it up
-Put it up

445
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,310
The first to attack is Hamada's team

446
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,310
And Matsumoto's team guesses

447
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,280
Yes, ready to go

448
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,730
Hamada's team used how many rubber bands

449
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,550
8

450
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,750
8

451
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,120
So few

452
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,760
A very light touch

453
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,230
So let's begin

454
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,140
Hamada's team... OPEN!

455
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,700
So hard
-Who is this?

456
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,800
This is just 8?

457
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,630
Ah, this...

458
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,480
This is...

459
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,500
The amount is low

460
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,050
It's tough
-Let's discuss it

461
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:02,940
Is this really just with 8?

462
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,480
Yes
-Yes

463
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,730
This is awesome!

464
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,310
We did it!

465
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,810
We did it!

466
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,350
We're in trouble
-This person's original foundation is too tough

467
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,790
We did it in such a short time!

468
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,790
I know the answer and still can't even see it!

469
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,970
Fujimon you know loads of people!

470
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,790
No idea at all

471
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,890
There is no such person!

472
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:21,620
Very good

473
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,390
Well, well, well
-That's a win

474
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,960
No clue at all

475
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,670
May I speak?

476
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,990
Not a formal answer
-Not a formal answer

477
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,040
FUNKY's Kato?

478
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,900
No, it's not right

479
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,970
Would he come here?

480
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,870
Can he do this?

481
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,860
He's not lacking work, right?
-I couldn't say

482
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,670
How about Takahashi?

483
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,330
COWCOW's

484
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,250
Tada?

485
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,510
Ah, Tada?

486
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,420
No

487
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,820
With the rubber bands it does look similar

488
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,380
Yes

489
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,050
Have to rewind

490
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,850
You have to imagine what it was like before the rubber bands were put on

491
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,360
It's almost time

492
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,960
5

493
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,660
It's kind of close

494
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,720
4

495
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,970
3

496
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,580
2

497
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,160
Okay, okay, that's him. That's it

498
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,280
Do you have an answer?

499
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,270
Suddenly it came to me

500
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,030
Are you ready? Team Matsumoto, please give your answer

501
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,560
Miyashita Kusanagi's Miyashita

502
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,270
Miyashita

503
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,820
Miyashita Kusanagi's Miyashita, did you guess correctly?

504
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,650
Now let's have the guest remove the rubber bands

505
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,520
Eh? I don't know

506
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,700
A face like this with just 8

507
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,290
This this this

508
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,050
I can't see it now

509
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,230
Then please take off the rubber bands
-Who are you?

510
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,530
Who the hell are you?

511
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,520
Hmmm

512
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,010
It's a big change

513
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,390
Did we get it right?

514
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,840
No? Who is it?

515
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,200
Still don't know yet, ah don't know yet

516
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,410
Who?

517
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,910
The correct answer is Miyashita Kusanagi's Miyashita

518
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,580
Great!

519
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,840
Matsumoto's team answered correctly

520
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,900
Barely got it right

521
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,260
So close!

522
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,350
Awesome

523
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,190
That's right

524
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,250
Guessed correctly

525
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,160
That's awesome!

526
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,240
Guessed it right!

527
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,970
You were right!

528
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,560
When I first saw it, I really couldn't tell

529
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,720
Miyashita, how did the rubber bands feel?

530
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,120
Being constricted by the rubber bands is surprisingly painful

531
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,240
But in comparison to the rubber band,

532
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,400
Backstage, Hamada said "Don't move"

533
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,200
And at the same time hit me here, which was much more painful

534
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,070
My apologies

535
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,050
Hold still!

536
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,820
So Hamada, who started the game, did not receive any points

537
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,810
So, Matsumoto's team

538
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,810
How many rubber bands did you use?

539
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,050
9

540
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,050
An aggressive approach

541
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,980
Of course we're going to attack

542
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,990
Yes

543
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,790
So, Matsumoto's team... OPEN!

544
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,660
Eh?

545
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,700
Very good

546
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,580
Who is this!?

547
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,080
You're a little too close!

548
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
Just stand there!

549
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,150
Don't go any further!

550
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,470
This is not good. This is not good

551
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,940
Who is this guy?

552
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,040
Please keep your face close

553
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,210
Is he a grandpa?

554
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,910
There is no sense of freshness
-No sense of fresh meat

555
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,010
This... this thing...

556
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,480
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!?

557
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,980
Yes!
-Don't do that

558
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,360
Don't describe people like that!

559
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,320
Yes!

560
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,530
Seems to be completely unclear

561
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,790
This is a grandpa, right?

562
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,520
No, I think he may not be that old

563
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,800
Not that old?
-Seriously?

564
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,520
That's what i'm thinking

565
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,150
Guess someone at least

566
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,350
This is not good

567
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,930
Just now she said...

568
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,150
Please hurry up!

569
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,980
I guess it's pretty similar

570
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,970
Quite similar

571
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,920
Go for it

572
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,580
There is nothing else
-Nothing else

573
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,650
Okay?

574
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,590
I really can't tell

575
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,180
I can't recognize them!

576
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,210
So, Hamada's team, please state your answer

577
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,950
Lasher!

578
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,840
Itamae
-Itamae

579
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,710
Seriously unrecognizable

580
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,250
Are you sure?

581
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,400
I can't tell
-I don't really recognize them, but...

582
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,280
Okay, please come to the front and take off the rubber bands

583
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,280
That...

584
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,850
Hey, who's that!?

585
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,520
Guessed right

586
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,860
The hair really is the main feature

587
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,260
Just looking at the face isn't enough

588
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,730
I didn't expect you to guess correctly

589
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,000
Honestly, couldn't you guys guess quicker!?

590
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,600
Seriously, you can't guess a bit quicker!?

591
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,770
I'm really sorry
-It's Lasher Itamae!

592
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,090
Awesome

593
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,770
Hamada's team answered correctly
-They didn't give up

594
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,470
So impressive!

595
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,880
I couldn't do it too harshly

596
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,370
But I did think "the face could be more taut"

597
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,540
But I really couldn't do it

598
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,080
No, it's not a big deal

599
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,170
It's fine to do anything to him
-No, no it's not

600
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,180
Don't point like that

601
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,220
So, both sides answered correctly in the first round

602
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,200
So neither side scored points

603
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,300
Can we see it now?

604
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,230
You can see it

605
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,420
Guests for the second round for both sides are women

606
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,850
After selecting,

607
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,040
The same process as before takes place back stage

608
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,830
This is very good
-Further up

609
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,880
That's perfect

610
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,240
I can't tell
-I can't tell either

611
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,210
That's it, let's do it
-We'll win, we'll win

612
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,460
So, Hamada's team guesses first in the second round

613
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,290
How many bands?

614
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,620
11

615
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,160
More than the theory!?

616
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Still very much on the offensive

617
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,140
Yes, a little bit, but I still want to win
-Really making it difficult

618
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,300
OK OK OK

619
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,130
Then, please get ready...

620
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,460
Matsumoto's team... OPEN!

621
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,140
Eh?
-Very good

622
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,210
Don't cross the line, don't cross the line

623
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,410
Very good

624
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,730
So that's how it is

625
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,300
This...
-I can't tell

626
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,140
The skin still looks good

627
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,910
The skin is good
-The skin is very good

628
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,040
Age can't be discerned

629
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,750
But the skin is nice

630
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,640
The mouth may be a feature

631
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,720
Mouth... where have I seen this type of mouth before...

632
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,490
Please don't think about it

633
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,260
This is a comedian, right?

634
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,840
Has the feeling of a comedian

635
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,480
The eyebrows also haven't moved much

636
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,160
So, it's almost time to answer

637
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,160
Go fo it, that's it

638
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,050
Please, Hamada

639
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,700
Do Hamada's team have an answer?
-Do you have an answer?

640
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,520
Was it Hamada that said it?

641
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,070
Not quite sure though...

642
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,880
Then, let's hear from Hamada's team

643
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,170
Enoue

644
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,740
Enoue
-Yes

645
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,390
Enou
-Nietzsche's

646
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,510
Ah~

647
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,350
That means it's not right

648
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,750
Can we try again?

649
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,590
Really!

650
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,250
You've shown your hand?

651
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,570
Really!
-What is all this?

652
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,120
What a bore!

653
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,820
No, why are you dancing!?

654
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,830
So strange!

655
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,030
Let's dance, everybody!

656
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,130
Let's all dance!

657
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,500
What a botch!

658
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,030
Who the hell is it?
-Please can the guest come to the front

659
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,160
Who is this?

660
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,970
Have you met her?

661
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,010
You must've

662
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,060
Really?

663
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,940
Hamada-san hasn't?

664
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,930
No, no, I'm sure we've met her before

665
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,310
Really?
-Yes, i'm sure of it

666
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,950
Can the guest please remove the rubber band
-Who is this?

667
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,080
I really can't tell

668
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,560
The face is all puffed up

669
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,750
Looks a lot like my friend's wife

670
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,290
How is that possible

671
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,210
So, the correct answer is Papa's Ai Nappu

672
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,730
Ai Nappu

673
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,160
It's Papa's Ai Nappu

674
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,370
How is this possible to recognize

675
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,050
Great!

676
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,250
So, Matsumoto's team used 11 rubber bands

677
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,190
And scored 9 points

678
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,610
Yes, yes!

679
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,250
Matsumoto's final score was 9 points

680
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,480
How many rubber bands did Hamada use?
-How many did we use?

681
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,570
10

682
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,880
If Matsumoto's team is not correct either,

683
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,220
The score will be 9-10, and Hamada's team will win

684
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,420
How will it end?

685
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,490
Eh? It's tough!

686
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,900
Eh?

687
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,810
Very good, very good

688
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,530
You really did it!

689
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,060
I can't even recognize it

690
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,880
I can't even recognize it

691
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,370
I think your team's gonna guess wrong

692
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,380
I forgot who it was

693
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,990
This isn't a comedian, right?

694
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,760
No, it feels like someone that has their eyebrows done nicely

695
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,310
Like maybe Inoue Sakura

696
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,460
Inoue Sakura

697
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,890
Looking at it, i'm struck by the beautiful eyebrows

698
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,410
Is it Tomoko Kaneda?

699
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,720
Or is the skin a little too good?

700
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,780
The makeup looks different

701
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,470
Makeup!

702
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,090
The makeup isn't the same?

703
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,210
The makeup is very well done

704
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:35,960
Great eyeliner, seriously

705
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,580
It's almost done, isn't it?

706
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,600
Eh? I don't know

707
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,580
Is it Nora?
-Nora?

708
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,470
No it can't be, is that Nora?

709
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,340
Nora or Remi, choose one!

710
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:46,960
Totally different, right?

711
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,510
Don't just consider people named Hirano!

712
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,270
Then let's say Nora
-Nora

713
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,680
Then, Mastumoto's team, your answer please!

714
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,950
Nora Hirano
-Norora Hirano...Nora

715
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,500
What are you saying?

716
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,240
Is it the right answer?

717
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,450
Please come forward

718
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,090
Huh?
-No way

719
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,930
Not at all!

720
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:09,780
Who are you!?

721
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,060
Today's clothes are really good

722
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,300
Who is this?

723
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,570
This type of clothing...

724
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,930
Who the hell is it?
-Even looking at the clothes I can't tell

725
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,500
Please remove the rubber bands

726
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,640
Ann Lewis?

727
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
Will Hamada's team end up winning?
-Looks like Yukihina

728
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
No way!

729
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,380
Is this your first job?

730
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,940
That's awesome!
-Hey!

731
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,400
Who the hell is it?

732
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,450
Eh, eh?

733
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,720
Hey, is it that person?

734
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,870
Eh?

735
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,900
I'm Nishiyama Moshi
-Eh~?

736
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,190
The answer is Nishiyama Moshi

737
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,600
Yeah!!!

738
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,900
No, no, no

739
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,960
This is really...
-Good!

740
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,230
Wrong answer!

741
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,660
Can't you choose your work?

742
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,070
Can't you choose your work?
-Can't you guess?

743
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,860
So, Hamada's team wins

744
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,790
Yes!

745
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,440
OK OK

746
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,410
Awesome!

747
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:04,950
No, the only reason they won is because of Hamada's sadistic streak, right?

748
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,950
He was obsessed with pulling the upper lip upward

749
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,220
If you can achieve this level of effect it'd be good

750
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,020
To the top

751
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,030
Stop, pull up and stop

752
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,130
So it can be said that people who have 10 rubber bands on their faces are unrecognizable, right?

753
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:20,980
Yes, it is

754
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,260
It's proven

755
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,920
This is the proof

756
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,730
We won!
-Verification over!

757
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,670
Thank you very much for your assistance!

758
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:33,980
Next introduces and tests the theories of people throughout the globe

759
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,550
Tonight's presenters are...

760
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:40,310
Fujiwara!
-Thank you for having us

761
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,290
We're gonna do it!

762
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,350
I'm going hard today
-Going for it!

763
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,100
Thank you for having us

764
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,460
I have a question for everyone

765
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,670
When was the last time everyone pissed themselves?

766
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,310
It wasn't very long ago for me

767
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,370
Sometimes it feels like it if you haven't pissed very carefully

768
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,170
Yes indeed
-It happens

769
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,580
What about you, Nami?
-Probably about 5 years ago for me

770
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,600
Not that long ago
-So you can leak too?

771
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,670
I was holding it and shaking on the way home from the parking lot

772
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,250
I was struggling with the key to open the door then I just suddenly relaxed

773
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,660
It all came out
-All of it?

774
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,360
Not a drop left?
-Yes

775
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,160
You just couldn't hold it anymore

776
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,320
If you just let half of it out it doesn't help

777
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,700
So if someone knew an acquaintance pissed their pants, how would they react?

778
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:30,490
It depends on the character of the other party, but they probably wouldn't react too strongly

779
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,610
Right?
-That's most likely the case

780
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:35,990
So, this time we bring you a theory related to urination

781
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,080
This is it:

782
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:44,050
If the person who receives a "happy surprise" pisses themselves, the instigator's face will instantly turn serious

783
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,100
What the heck?

784
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,860
If it was a dog it'd be understandable
-That's true

785
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,330
It's normal for dogs to do that
-Indeed

786
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,440
Well, we have already verified it so let's take a look at the VTR

787
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:06,780
If the person receiving a "happy surprise" pisses themselves, the instigator's face will instantly turn serious

788
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:14,420
This time the participants thought they'd be appearing on "Surprise Meeting Between Ordinary People and Idols"

789
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,980
A "We'll Make Your Dreams Come True SP"-style program

790
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:27,070
This teenager will be so happy to see his idol that he pisses himself

791
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,730
The verification target is...

792
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,630
Fuwa's here!

793
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,540
Fuwa

794
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:43,810
She herself is no stranger to laughing so much that she leaks

795
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:49,590
Therefore, a perfect candidate in regard to both popularity and urination

796
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,360
The teenager isn't expecting to see you today

797
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,590
He's completely unaware that his wish is going to be fulfilled

798
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:00,130
Ah ~ this is a gonna be a happy surprise!

799
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,500
Are they here now?
-Not yet, they will be shortly

800
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,800
Tell me when they come, then, I'm too loud

801
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,840
After a fake opening

802
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,010
It's finally time to meet

803
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,680
Thank you for being here
-Thank you for having me

804
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,340
Fuwa will appear from behind during the interview

805
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,610
The standard surprise process

806
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,520
What will happen?

807
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,860
Thank you for your continued encouragement!

808
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:40,860
Whether on TV or on youtube, you are always entertaining

809
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,000
I really like you

810
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,610
So please meet with me, please!

811
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,780
Good morning-pi! I'm Fuwa!

812
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,850
Ah!

813
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,750
Eh?

814
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,190
Eh? Wait a second...

815
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,370
Even Fuwa has...?

816
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,830
Eh?

817
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,170
Eh?

818
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,640
Eh? Wait a second...

819
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,610
It would be like this

820
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,910
Should change faces...

821
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:26,350
Eh? Hey this is a leak...

822
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,520
Maintaining the atmosphere as much as possible

823
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,480
Hey, wait, you're leaking?

824
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,250
Joyful in the face of urination

825
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,770
As expected, Fuwa shows a serious expression for a moment

826
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,930
No wonder
-Human nature

827
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,100
Wait, I have a change of shorts. Wait for me

828
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,870
Eh? What should I do?

829
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,140
Do you have pants? Can you change your pants again?

830
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,900
I didn't bring any with me...
-You didn't bring any?

831
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,960
I should have some, wait a second

832
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,170
Eh? Wait, what should I do, this will be weird, right?

833
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,240
You can't cut for a moment, can you? What should I do

834
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,450
So gentle!

835
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,380
Fuwa is so gentle!

836
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:59,260
While considering the editing problem, the happy teenager is led to the bathroom

837
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,990
She lends him her own shorts

838
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,650
Is his mother here?

839
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,990
His dad was here
-Dad?

840
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,350
And also...

841
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,450
Did you wipe it? Why not? Unbelievable!

842
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,730
Why is no one wiping it

843
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,030
No toilet paper or something?

844
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,600
Use some paper towels to wipe it

845
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,810
Urine on the floor

846
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,670
If you wipe it when it's dry it'll still smell

847
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,700
Sprinkle some of this

848
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,560
As expected of someone with experience of incontinence

849
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,360
She looks like she is used to it and even directs the cleaning of the urine on site

850
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,720
And then

851
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,010
We can't do another surprise, right?

852
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,720
He's already met you now

853
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,570
Just focus on the upper part of the body, because the pants changed

854
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,920
Just use the top half of the shot

855
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,890
The leak is treated as if it never  happened, and instructions are given to the editor

856
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,900
Just start with his happy expression after seeing me and cut it

857
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,800
Very good, it suits you, it suits you!

858
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,070
Pretty good

859
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,310
Ver good, and it's okay, don't worry about it, I leak too

860
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:02,510
We are the Leaky Pee Alliance
-Yeah

861
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,080
At school you can tell your classmates that "Fuwa and I are pee-pee allies"

862
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,290
So gentle!

863
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,720
And so, the truth is revealed

864
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,860
This is not the "Happy Surprise" crew

865
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,160
Hey, what? No way!

866
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,790
What do you think it is?

867
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,730
Eh? WedDown?
-Yes

868
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,800
Eh--?

869
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,800
You're a spy of WedDown!? Are you kidding me?

870
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,900
Ah right

871
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,270
Just now I put on a really happy performance

872
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,570
In fact, I was terrified

873
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,680
I thought to myself, "No way!"

874
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:38,050
In summary, people who have experienced it themselves are very gentle

875
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,650
So everyone, what do you think?

876
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,480
I'm sure it'd be like that!

877
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,000
Indeed, it would be like that, the normal human reaction

878
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,150
Fuwa is still very impressive
-Very gentle

879
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,730
She also took the editing into consideration

880
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,990
What exactly were we supposed to learn through this theory though?

881
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,840
The matter of urine leakage is damaging to the atmosphere

882
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,850
Time and space seem to freeze for a moment

883
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,640
And also that when meeting fans you should prepare an extra pair of pants

884
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,640
That's not necessary

885
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,480
We also have another theory for you today

886
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,920
Have you ever slept in a bunk bed?

887
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,940
I did, when I was a kid

888
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,350
Yeah?
-It was a bunk bed

889
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,780
How about Matsumoto-san?
-I never have

890
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,920
Not with your brother?
-No

891
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,240
Ones with a top and bottom bunk
-I said no already!

892
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,430
I'm scared

893
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,470
You've said it so many times already

894
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,820
Ask me again, maybe something will come back to me

895
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,040
Did you and your brother sleep in a bunk bed
-I already said NO!

896
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,480
What do you want from me?

897
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,670
Why did I have to ask again?

898
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,900
Anyway, this time we bring you a theory related to bunk beds

899
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,020
It is this:

900
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,820
There are no couples that sleep in bunk beds

901
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,810
What is it?
-We have bunk beds in our house

902
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,360
No way, that'd make the hypothesis instantly incorrect

903
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,200
Yes
-A ready-made example

904
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,160
Really?

905
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,730
Right now?
-Now

906
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,470
Do you sleep on the top or bottom?

907
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:08,250
We have two bunk beds in our house

908
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,800
I sleep on the top bunk, my son sleeps on the bottom bunk

909
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,740
And with the other, my daughter sleeps on the top bunk and my husband sleeps on the bottom bunk

910
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,930
It isn't that two adults sleep on the same bunk bed
-Yes

911
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,980
That's fine then

912
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,820
It's because my daughter prefers bunk beds

913
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,680
Two bunk beds in the same room?
-Yeah

914
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,220
Is your home an army dormitory!?

915
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,960
With an officer shouting "Get UP!!"

916
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,030
Didn't Hamada sleep on a five-tier bed during high school?

917
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,360
What's a five-tier bed, a bunk bed is just top and bottom

918
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,830
What sort of bed is a five-tier bed!?

919
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,330
You can jump from the top and parachute down like a solider

920
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,930
And mess people up
-Sounds like something out of Ashita no Joe

921
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:47,310
No couples sleep in bunk beds

922
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,880
When it comes to bunk beds, they are usually used by two brothers

923
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:58,180
Or in student dormitories, which gives the impression that they are mostly used just for children

924
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,440
That's the image that usually comes to mind
-Yeah, yeah

925
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:04,230
So, are there any adults using bunk beds?

926
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:09,530
First, we enquired with a bedding store

927
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,230
Then searched on SNS

928
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,940
The survey found...

929
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,210
This 44-year-old woman who currently lives in Fukushima Prefecture

930
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,620
I started sleeping on this bunk bed about 4 years ago

931
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,760
Usually I sleep underneath and my mother sleeps on top

932
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,530
Mom?

933
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:42,900
Surprisingly, a mother and daughter aged 44 and 73 use a bunk bed

934
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,250
The mom doesn't sleep below?
-You'd think that'd be better

935
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,340
That's quite tough

936
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:48,540
So we asked them to show us how it looks

937
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,470
Is it more comfortable to sleep on the top or the bottom bunk?

938
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,240
The top bunk is hotter in summer

939
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,880
Although the top bunk is for adults

940
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,150
I always worry about whether she's going to fall out

941
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,890
To be honest, I don't recommend it

942
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:11,300
So, why are these two adults sleeping in a bunk bed?

943
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,600
To save space in the bedroom

944
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,200
Originally, I wanted to my son and I to use the bunk bed

945
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,970
To begin with my son slept on the top bunk

946
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:25,780
But as he grew up, it switched to my mother

947
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,840
My son now sleeps on the floor here

948
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,380
So adding the 16-year-old son, it's like this

949
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,840
Three people sharing one bedroom

950
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,200
The next person is an adult who sleeps on a bunk bed

951
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,660
This 21-year-old woman currently lives in Tokyo

952
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,770
I sleep on the top bunk and my grandmother sleeps on the bottom bunk

953
00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:02,980
For about 12 years since elementary school, I've slept in the bunk bed with my grandmother

954
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,540
What are you laughing at?

955
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:08,070
Now one is 21 and one is 77

956
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,780
You're so noisy
-What are you laughing at?

957
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,750
How does it feel to sleep here?
-Very comfortable

958
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,750
What's so funny about this

959
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,120
And,

960
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,620
I have three brothers

961
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:23,700
In the opposite room is my mother and two brothers in a three-tier bed

962
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,530
Three-tier bed!?
-I've never heard of one!

963
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,300
Three-tier bed?
-That's right

964
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,300
My two sons and I sleep in this three-tier bed

965
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:34,940
The top is the second eldest, the middle is me, and the bottom is the third eldest

966
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,380
The bottom pulls out

967
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,250
So you pull it out when it's time to sleep?
-Yes, yes

968
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,420
At first, my three sons slept here

969
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,090
But since my oldest son is no longer at home, I sleep in the middle

970
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:54,260
The second eldest is 26, I'm 49, and the third eldest is 24

971
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,240
We are all adults now

972
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,240
Everyone is an adult

973
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,020
Total age: 197 years

974
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,240
Spread across a total of five beds

975
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,710
Why add the years together

976
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:12,440
Although several groups of adults sleeping in bunk beds were found

977
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,720
Are there really no couples?

978
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,120
Oh yeah...
-The main topic

979
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,820
However, suddenly

980
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,640
The next group of adults that sleep in bunk beds are...

981
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,800
What is this image!?

982
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,960
This 36-year-old woman who lives in Akita Prefecture

983
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,100
How do you use this bunk bed when you sleep?

984
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,670
I sleep on the bottom and my husband sleeps on the top

985
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,940
To sum up, finally

986
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,740
We found a bunk bed couple

987
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,790
By the way, the way they fall asleep is a bit strange

988
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,320
The orientation of their heads is not the same

989
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:56,630
But the man is very happy with the current bunk bed state

990
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,490
He peeks from above to see if I'm awake

991
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,700
And seems very happy when he does it

992
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,970
I think the person who invented the bunk bed is really too awesome

993
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,230
But, why did you decide to use this bed?

994
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:15,580
We took it over because originally it was for our children

995
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,110
Every day they fought about who would sleep on the top bunk

996
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:24,490
I'll sleep on top!
-Today is my turn!

997
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,680
Is this footage necessary?

998
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:29,360
Concerning who sleeps on the top bunk, they often pulled and shoved each other next to the ladder

999
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,570
Not needed, not needed, we all understand

1000
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,800
This makes it very easy to understand

1001
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,990
And also the one in the lower bunk kicks the one above from below

1002
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,210
To make it more visually appealing, the VTR was prepared for the audience

1003
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,210
It's good to have such things to be able to understand

1004
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,460
What are you doing!?

1005
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,870
I see

1006
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,720
Day and night the siblings argued endlessly

1007
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,780
So there was an upward kick

1008
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,170
Yes, yes, much easier to understand with the VTR

1009
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,950
That's enough you two!

1010
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:58,520
If this continues, then father and I will sleep on the bunk bed!

1011
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,350
That's right, didn't she just say that?

1012
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,880
So that's it!

1013
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,210
Wait a minute, what is this?

1014
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:16,270
And so, the two adults slept on the bunk bed while the children slept on the floor

1015
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,470
In all of the current findings

1016
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:24,610
Every family originally bought the bunk beds for their children

1017
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,250
Apart from this couple, who now live in Tokyo

1018
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,750
Soon after the wedding I asked for a bunk bed

1019
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,830
I think it's reasonable for us not to interfere with each other

1020
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,160
Since my wife requested it, I had to accept

1021
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:48,470
In summary, there are two types of couples

1022
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,400
There are then

1023
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,880
Couples sleeping in bunk beds

1024
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,970
It's not a big deal,

1025
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,500
But the VTR recreation...

1026
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,250
It didn't have much content

1027
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,110
It's not so much a matter of it not having much content, more that it wasn't necessary

1028
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,890
Not needed, not needed

1029
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:10,480
Seriously what the hell, that VTR was so annoying

1030
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,320
Wait, what was so annoying about it?

1031
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,430
We shot the VTR in order to make the audience understand the situation more clearly

1032
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,660
I don't think the audience for this show is expecting that kind of VTR

1033
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,040
Explanations for layman aren't clear though

1034
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,150
No, they said it quite clearly

1035
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,750
It was exactly the same as the picture I had in my head

1036
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,940
Comedians have more imagination though
-Yes that's true

1037
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,940
The average person has nothing in their head
-Yes, better brains

1038
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,230
What a waste!
-The picture doesn't immediately come to mind

1039
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,550
Not everyone can do it

1040
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,640
Has our program's staff been replaced?

1041
00:45:43,220 --> 00:46:14,820
