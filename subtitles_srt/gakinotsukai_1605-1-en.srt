1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,440
Are their hearts connected? No Smartphones Meetup!

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,160
The first theme; A Car Showroom

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,000
I'd go to the Honda in Aoyama-Itchoume

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,240
They head to where they thought of in a taxi

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,520
Matsumoto went to a Honda showroom in Aoyama

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,800
And then!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,480
Oi!

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,040
Somehow he met up with Hamada right away!

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,960
This is kind of annoying

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,160
But it's this one!

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,960
The next hint; A Large Post Office

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,760
DownTown headed to Akasaka Post Office, however Hosei, Endo, & Tanaka didn't show up!

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:54,600
The 2 big bosses ... The 2 big bosses are already in Aoyama!

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,600
"What are the 2 big bosses doing?" - That's how you gotta think

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,600
Meanwhile, Hosei and Endo met up at Meguro Post Office

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,920
Well done, of course right?

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,960
These are their current locations; Will they be able to meet up?

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,160
Time for the 3rd hint

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,720
Damn this is hard!

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,360
A long tunnel

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,800
This is a tough one isn't it?

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,000
Where would a long tunnel be?

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,020
If they're asking about "tunnels", let's forget about the "long" part for now-

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,720
No no, we can't forget that part, it said "a long tunnel"

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,440
I can't really think of one

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,520
I think near Shinjuku Goen,

28
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,800
The one that starts in Shibuya and ends in Yotsuya

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,800
Yes yes yes yes, that park

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,400
Ohhh yeah, you're right

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,440
If they think about where their Big Brothers are, they have to head there!

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,640
You met Yama-chan there for the big billboard

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,040
For that Onisihi Lion billboard thing right?

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,760
Oh really?

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,480
Can we go there?

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,240
That's a really long tunnel that one

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,920
They head to Shinjuku Goen Tunnel, near an intersection where Hosei once met up with Matsumoto

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,880
Is this camera enough? Oh, I should hold this?

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,760
It feels kind of gross being filmed by Hamada

40
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,120
What is this

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,320
There's no helping it

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,360
But still, I think if we leave Tanaka by himself, he heads to insane places

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,800
We need to catch Tanaka

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,760
A long tunnel? Are they are any? In the first place

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,880
Ah! Hmm?

46
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,280
In Meguro, wasn't there a road under the highway?

47
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,360
And another one, wasn't there one in Shibuya?

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,200
There is

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,760
There is right?

50
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,840
Hold on, can we go to [@!@#!@]?

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,640
Just where is Tanaka heading?

52
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,840
But next time...Nah we'll be fine. I feel like Yamasaki will come.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,000
Really? Yama-chan should've remembered the last one

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,320
The Yamasaki-Endo duo still have a little bit of a human heart left

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,920
Tanaka doesn't huh?

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,760
That thing, that thing is impossible

57
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,240
He does love animals

58
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,640
Exactly, he's an animal

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,120
He likes animals so much he turned into one, for real

60
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,480
And what about Hosei, who once met up with Matsumoto near Shinjuku Goen Tunnel?

61
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,400
What about you?

62
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,760
I think, over there, Meguro Tunnel

63
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,200
But, I feel like there are some major roads too

64
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,680
Isn't [!@#@!] a major one?

65
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,120
I think that's good, let's go there

66
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,040
Right?

67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,520
Will they be able to meet DownTown?

68
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,680
Still, it's been a while since I've had to wait on someone for that long

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,640
Yeah, you made us wait a bit too long, Tanaka-san

70
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,160
It was unbelievable

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,490
"Hamada-san told me to go the second one I thought one"

72
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,680
"The second thought I partook in..."

73
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,400
Yeah..."I partook in"

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,400
"I partook in" ...
"The second one I partook in..." What the hell!

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,080
What the hell!

76
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,080
What the hell is with him? Who does he think he is?

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,040
Right? We get to our destination quickly

78
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,600
Exactly...

79
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,720
This, this right?

80
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,480
That's a long tunnel, a long one....Yes, yes

81
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,280
15 minutes since they started driving, they arrive at Shinjuku Goen Tunnel

82
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,200
Well Matsumoto-san, it's here

83
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,680
This one right? This is really long

84
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,720
From this way, if they come here

85
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,010
Nahhhhhh

86
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,760
It's really a problem of how long they make us wait

87
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,440
Until everyone gets here, if they do come here

88
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,440
Those 2 are in Meguro right? The other is, in Sancha right?

89
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,080
That Sancha guy is creepy

90
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,360
This time I've really come to hate the Sancha guy

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,040
That guy, he really is, he really is dangerous isn't he?

92
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,320
I'm actually scared of him now

93
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,720
Meanwhile, Tanaka arrives at his tunnel

94
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,480
Will he meet anyone!?

95
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,240
Over there...

96
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:12,120
National Highway Route 246 Ikejiri, near Shibuya

97
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,280
I think it's here though

98
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,520
Tanaka remained alone, and then the staff said...

99
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,200
We just looked up, the name of that tunnel

100
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,920
It doesn't come up

101
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,640
Perhaps because, this is not a tunnel, but an underpass

102
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,400
Underpass? Ohhh...

103
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,760
Cause tunnels they make by drilling down-

104
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
Wait, no, Takahashi please, it's alright

105
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,080
I have a bad feeling about this

106
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,800
Please, for now just stop there

107
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,960
10 minutes since they arrived, DowntTown continue to wait trusting in Hosei & Endo

108
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,000
Any time now, if they're coming

109
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,200
Are they coming?

110
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,000
All we can do is trust Yama-chan & Shozo

111
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,840
And then, Hosei & Endo arrive at their tunnel!

112
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,880
Ara! There it is!

113
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,840
Damn, this is kinda,

114
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,120
I know from my long friendship with DownTown, they're not here!

115
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,200
However, they arrived at Roppongi Tunnel. Nobody met up

116
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,040
Just there

117
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,920
And then

118
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,120
Sorry, time's up

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,640
They didn't come!

120
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,240
The 5 confirm their locations

121
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,440
Eh? Yama-chan & Shozo, where are you?

122
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Roppongi Tunnel

123
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,520
Roppongi Tunnel?

124
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,240
It's not that long!

125
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,560
Huh? Can you see that?

126
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,360
That's not right

127
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,840
We can see the other side

128
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,640
It's so short!

129
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,240
You can't do that, no no no

130
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,360
You idiots can see the exit can't you?

131
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
I can see it!

132
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,160
Tanaka-san? Where are you?

133
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,760
Yes, Tanaka here

134
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,400
I'm at the tunnel that exits starts in Ikejiri and exits in Shibuya, under 246

135
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,560
There it is

136
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,470
COME CLOSER TO US ASSHOLE!

137
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,960
They're telling me to get over there, they're telling me to get over there

138
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,600
Incidentally, DownTown-san?

139
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,320
Yostsuya-Yonchoume...

140
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,080
Of course!

141
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,120
It's that one!

142
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,790
NO NOT "IT'S THAT ONE"!!

143
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,280
Damn, it's that one

144
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,920
Yama-chan you came here before too

145
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:44,640
Once, for the big billboard thing, we met here right?

146
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes! Yes, that one!

147
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,840
I couldn't think of anything other than Roppongi Tunnel

148
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,760
Think properly!

149
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,520
Yes, I will!

150
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,880
Now I'm definitely going to beat you

151
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,960
Tanaka only please

152
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,380
Please, plea- Please, um,

153
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,840
Look forward to it!

154
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,160
Shinjuku, yeah that one. That one for sure.

155
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,680
Hosei-san, Roppongi tunnel is way too short

156
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,960
We can see the exit! It's bright, it's not dark at all this tunnel

157
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,320
We can see it

158
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,200
2 hours since the start, the 5 want to hurry up and meet already

159
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,280
Will they be able to meet this time? The 4th hint;

160
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,840
Another tough one...

161
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,640
A famous temple...

162
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,480
You know,

163
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,360
Last time, Endo, Hosei and I all met up,

164
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,920
When we passed in front of Sengakuji temple, we talked about the 47 lost samurai buried there

165
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,000
If Yamasaji and Endo actually remember that, I think they'll come to Sengakuji

166
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,200
Then they'll come

167
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:06,120
That was last time, for the Aquarium card, where they passed by Sengakuji on the way to Aqua

168
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you know who is buried at Sengakuji?

169
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,920
Get this right Endo, this is so well known

170
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,960
Do you guys all know?

171
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,080
It's not one person

172
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,880
Oh I got it...

173
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,760
The 47 lost samurai...

174
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,340
They're called the "Akoroshi"

175
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh really?

176
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,880
I didn't know that

177
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,040
Can we count on that?...

178
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:42,270
There's that one too, that one near Tokyo Tower, Zoujouji

179
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,480
Oh, Zoujouji. It's either one...

180
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,720
I think they'll remember though

181
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,240
Sengakuji...Let's try heading there

182
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,120
Should we go? OK

183
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,880
Trusting Hosei & Endo will remember that conversation, they head to Sengakuji

184
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,400
I wonder where Tanaka is going

185
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,520
Tanaka is really something

186
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,560
If Tanaka's in that area anyways, he should juts go home!

187
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,000
Still alone Tanaka; What temple is he heading too?

188
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,220
I have a lot of options

189
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,840
Tsukiji Hongan-ji...
[!@!$@!@] is a shrine I think

190
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,160
That place is a temple

191
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,840
Oh really? Then [!@$!@] sounds good

192
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:36,640
We've done a Gaki shoot there too. Everyone's been there, so they really should remember it

193
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,440
Will troublemaker Tanaka's choice turn out correct?

194
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,880
DownTown's been doing this shoot all by themselves!

195
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,800
Driver-san, could you turn the AC down a bit?

196
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,480
I'm very sorry about him

197
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,580
Hold on! You bastard...

198
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,680
I asked normally

199
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,520
You kinda disliked that right?

200
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,400
What the hell!

201
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,100
It was scary right? The way he said it

202
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,960
I said it normally

203
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,440
We're about to pass it soon, Hosei & Endo's tunnel

204
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,160
The short one

205
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,560
If they're starting from here, if they remembered that conversation then they'd go to Sengakuji

206
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,800
If they didn't remember then they'd go to Zoujouji for sure

207
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,160
Zoujouji?

208
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,920
They could've gone to Zoujouji

209
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,840
I think so

210
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,120
Endo doesn't know about Zoujouji

211
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,560
Wasn't there a golf practice ground around there?

212
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,760
There was! Oh

213
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,720
In that case he'd know

214
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Endo went there pretty often

215
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,480
Really? Eh? Should we go back?

216
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,000
There's a possibility he remembers that

217
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,480
Should we go back?

218
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,240
If we turn back now, we can make it

219
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,640
What should we do? Do we count on that conversation about Sengakuji?

220
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,960
What should we do? What should we do?

221
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,680
What should we do?

222
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,760
This is where those idiots went!

223
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,040
You can see the end! How is this long?

224
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,140
What do we do? (x2)

225
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,200
The Sengakuji conversation, I don't think those 2 idiots remember it!

226
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,600
They'll probably say "Oh when did that happen?"

227
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,440
This question really threw us for a loop

228
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,760
Actually, let's go to Zoujouji

229
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,720
I feel like, they didn't think of Sengakuji

230
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,560
Right? They don't seem the type to remember

231
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,520
They change their destaintion from Sengakuji to Zoujouji...Will this work out?

232
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,480
Tanaka wouldn't have arrived yet right? If he's heading to Zoujouji

233
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,080
Maybe Tanaka is feeling sick, he should just go home

234
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:03,880
Meanwhile, Tanaka arrives at his temple. What will happen?

235
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,320
They'll come for sure! It's gotta be this one

236
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,040
He arrived at Akasaka Toyokawa Inari Betsuin, and met up with nobody

237
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,960
I got it wrong?

238
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,360
Not here? Not here huh?

239
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,680
DownTown are almost at Zoujouji

240
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,320
I hope they come here, please

241
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,120
They should've arrived before we did

242
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,760
Yeah. I hope we meet!

243
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,800
Trusting Hosei & Endo to head here, DownTown head towards Zoujouji

244
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,680
They gotta be here

245
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:51,080
C'mon! But...It doesn't feel like there are comedians waiting there does it?

246
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,480
If they're not here I won't believe it

247
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,720
Trusting Hosei & Endo are here, DownTown head towards Zoujouji

248
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,360
Those guys headed here from that tunnel

249
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,240
Eh?!

250
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,760
No way...

251
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,560
They're not here

252
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,520
They're really not here?

253
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,040
But if they started at Roppongi Tunnel, it doesn't make sense they're not here

254
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
It doesn't make sense

255
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,520
Then they're not here

256
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,080
They went somewhere else

257
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,800
10 minutes before DownTown arrived at Zoujouji

258
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,960
Hosei & Endo had this conversation...

259
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,840
I feel like there was one beside Tokyo Tower...

260
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,280
What's it called?

261
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,840
Zoujouji

262
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,040
Endo-san, on your left side is Zoujouji

263
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,200
Where? Oh there it is, it's huge

264
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,720
They already passed by Zoujouji! Which temple are they heading to?

265
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm really curious where Yama-chan and Shozo went now

266
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,920
We went out of our way to come closer to them

267
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,760
We were seriously thinking of them

268
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,620
Exactly! Starting from that tunnel

269
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,280
The times really have changed...
Now the Senpai has to worry about the junior

270
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,240
It's scary. Scary

271
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,400
Is it really possible to miss the mark this much?

272
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,280
This is a record isn't it?

273
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,240
It's been a while

274
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,200
And the time we've had to wait

275
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Certainly. Certainly.

276
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,640
The Akasaka Post Office thing really shocked me

277
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,040
We waited so long right?

278
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,440
And then...

279
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,480
Time's up

280
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,120
The 5 confirm their locations

281
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,760
Oi!

282
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,520
Oi. Cut it out already

283
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,200
Their voices are quiet...

284
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,360
First off Yama-chan & Shozo, where are you?

285
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,500
Sensoji...

286
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,040
Sensoji?

287
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,800
They went to Asakusa?!

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,440
EH?!

289
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,720
We had best out of 1 match...And Sensoji won...

290
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,000
What? Why did that win?

291
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,200
Why didn't you win?
Listen!

292
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,240
Think about where you guys started

293
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,680
DownTown-san thought of you guys and came here

294
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,020
Incidentally...Where is here?

295
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,320
We, are at Zoujouji

296
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,120
See! I said it! See!

297
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,360
Zoujouji?

298
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,520
I forgot about Zoujouji!

299
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,080
You mentioned it?

300
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,200
I forgot about Zoujouji!

301
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
Hosei-san said-

302
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,120
Endo just drop it

303
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,280
Hosei-san said it was a different one, or Sensoji

304
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,040
Endo!

305
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,840
Yama-chan? Yama-chan,

306
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,720
Incidentally, did you think of Sengakuji?

307
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,800
You, Endo, & I had a conversation about Sengakuji once

308
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,920
When I asked you who was buried here. Did you forget that conversation?

309
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,440
...Yes

310
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,320
Yes, you forgot right?

311
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
It seems you forgot, you really didn't remember

312
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,720
OI HOLD ON FUCKER BITCH ASSHOLE TANAKA FUCKER

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,920
This is not good

314
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,600
So much abuse

315
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,760
Where are you?

316
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm at Toyokawa Inari

317
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,280
HUH?!

318
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,720
We recorded for Gaki here once!

319
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,840
That's true

320
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,240
So I thought you guys would remember that, and came here

321
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:42,160
No no, Tanaka, Hamada-san said to go to the second one you think of, right?

322
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,440
I've stopped doing that

323
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,960
You stopped already?!

324
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,160
I got it wrong last time, so,

325
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
No no

326
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,040
It's gotta be Zoujouji!

327
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,600
So we were choosing between Zoujouji and Sensoji.
Did you think of Sensoji?

328
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,680
When you're not sure, go to a close by one.

329
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,840
Yeah!

330
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,280
Since we came all the way out here

331
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,520
Yeah. Seriously, do you get it?

332
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,040
We both hate you now

333
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,120
You guys are our enemy

334
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,560
We are going to hit you of course

335
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,880
We are going to hit you of course

336
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,960
Please don't

337
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,240
Look forward to it!

338
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,030
FORWARD TO IT!

339
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,120
If you hit me using those muscles I'm gonna die

340
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,400
Alright

341
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,760
It's a journey to get smacked

342
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,560
You shot me, didn't you? I wanted you to say we both decided it

343
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:37,360
No Hose-san, please. For the next one, can I decide?

344
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
"I did, I did"

345
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,560
No way

346
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,620
Hosei-san if we can't get along now it's over

347
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,440
This time for sure! The theme;

348
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,200
We got this one. Matsumoto-san,]

349
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,400
"A stadium"? Yoyogi?

350
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,280
The National Stadium!

351
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,120
Oh yes, of course. Of course.

352
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,440
It has to be the National Stadium!

353
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,400
We can look at this as the last one right? It wouldn't be strange at all if we all met up

354
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,720
That's true

355
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,960
I've never been so confident in my answer for one of these. Can I say it?

356
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,760
A stadium? Komazawa comes to mind

357
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,300
Komazawa Stadium? The stadium is part of Komazawa park

358
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,840
Nah I've always called it Komazawa Stadium

359
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,760
You're kidding right?

360
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,640
DownTown head to their stadium with absolute confidence

361
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,640
Mr. Driver, excuse me, could you turn the tempreture up a bit?

362
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,440
Yes, certainly

363
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,600
Sorry about that. It was kind of intimidating

364
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,320
It absolutely wasn't

365
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,340
Now that I think about it, that guy, Tanaka would arrive first right?

366
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,720
He should be there first

367
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,160
If he is going to the National Stadium

368
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,720
I'm so tired

369
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,740
Fpr sure Tanaka will be at this one

370
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,920
Seriously what do we do if this isn't the end

371
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,920
I can't say corporal punishment, but something like that

372
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,120
Something like that

373
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,360
For an episode

374
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,920
Something that's bound to leave a lump

375
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,920
So if we don't meet Tanaka right away, he's gone off somewhere else

376
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,920
Honestly I'm really scared to meet him now

377
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,760
Conversely

378
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,040
I might speak to him using honorifics

379
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,880
Trusting Tanaka is waiting for them, they arrive at the National Stadium

380
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,080
He should be here

381
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,120
He'll be here

382
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,280
We better meet him

383
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,960
But kind of, if I try to sense if someone else is coming here...

384
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,720
I can't sense Tanaka

385
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,320
I really can't sense Tanaka here

386
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,600
AHHHH!!!

387
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,600
It's Tanaka!

388
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,160
Here right?

389
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,360
I couldn't think of anywhere but here

390
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,280
I couldn't think of anywhere but here

391
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,760
We're kind of frightened of you.

392
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,840
You're just scary!

393
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,560
Starting today we'll address you with honorifics

394
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,760
No please, please that's the worst

395
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:27,000
But, this is the only answer right? Everyone will come here

396
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,960
That's what I want to believe

397
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,040
But those guys are coming from Asakusa right?

398
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,680
Would you seriously go all the way to Asakusa?

399
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,800
Starting in Roppongi

400
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,920
Exactly! I thought "Goddamn they took so long"

401
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,320
You're one to talk!

402
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,020
How long do you think we had to wait for you to go to Sancha!

403
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,440
And while we're saying this...

404
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,200
What if the staff tells us they've arrived

405
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm really scared of them giving me the phone

406
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,080
You're right. You're so right.

407
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,380
15 minutes since the 3 of them met up

408
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
This is just..

409
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,760
Aren't they late?

410
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,160
It's been too long. It's worrying

411
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,920
I'm really worried now

412
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,280
They haven't gone to some insane place right?

413
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,000
It is possible

414
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,880
They might have gone to Komazawa

415
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,840
Komazawa right? That one too

416
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,920
AH!!!

417
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,640
Eh? They're here!

418
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,720
They're here right?

419
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,720
They're here!

420
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,400
So late

421
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,880
They finally came. Finally they came.

422
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,640
Senpai!!!!!

423
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,680
Are they fucking joking?

424
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,080
We waited so long!

425
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,560
I'm sorry

426
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,020
Matsumoto-san and I are thinking about an episode

427
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,960
I think we need to consider this; Making DownTown wait for that long...

428
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,120
That's, that's true

429
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,840
You too

430
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,720
All 3 of you

431
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,640
I'm sorry

432
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,480
Sorry, can I, can I just, call Chono-san?

433
