00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,770
In the back room of Gaki no Tsukai, and those 2 are no where to be seen...

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,480
All 3 of you are wearing glasses!

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,000
Why don't you get Lasik or something done?

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,850
They're scary

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,910
-Wait, what's scary about that?!

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,510
-Good morning

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,140
Listen to what I have to tell you guys seriously...

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,280
I laughed so much I though I'd stopped breathing

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,540
It was so bad I was about to die...

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,480
We know you just got here

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,420
Who was it with just....

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,340
You know him?

14
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,420
Him...

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,420
Ah, Hamada...

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,170
You forgot Hamada?

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,480
Well...

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,250
I asked if he was coming

19
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,050
If he was coming? Nah forget it that's enough all ready!

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,740
It feels like a quiz coming and that's the worst !!

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,850
Last time on 'Try to answer the riddles thought up by Hamada'

22
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:56,820
Bread(Pan) is bread, but what kind of bread(Pan) can't you eat?

23
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,800
As hard as they tried the 3 just couldn't get any answers right

24
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,880
A frypan!

25
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:00,910
So close!

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,740
Why the fuck didn't you answer the question just now?!

27
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,010
CAN'T YOU WORK OUT THE RIDDLE?!

28
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,340
THIS IS NIHON TV BROADCASTING!!

29
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,220
But this time... What is it that Hamada is planning?!

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,400
It's a show that features Ameagari

31
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,620
Magical Hatena (Family fun quiz type show)

32
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,170
Well, Hamada sometimes...

33
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,000
He watches it at home

34
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,110
He just can't stop laughing at it

35
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,420
It's so funny he said

36
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,940
People that don't get it find it funny

37
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,680
People that do get it also find it funny

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,940
Both kinds of people find it funny

39
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,340
So he wants to give Magical Hamada a go...

40
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,340
Magical Hatena â†’ Magical Hamada Version

41
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,880
After creating the concept he said it would be a good idea to try

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,600
It's the only thing he can focus on

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,480
There isn't any interest in women any more

44
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,000
He said women's bodies are just no longer magical

45
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,710
The concept was a little hard to grasp at first...

46
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,220
But I said I saw his point

47
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,450
Is this like a normal conversation for you?

Born from the 90's hit TV show 'Magical Zou Power!' the revived version

50
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,600
Now airing on TV under the name 'Kainou Magical Hatena'

51
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,280
The show that Hamada wants to try himself...

52
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,020
Matsumoto takes the 3 contestants to meet that certain comedy duo...

53
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,910
Good morning

54
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Ameagari Kesshitai: Miyasako Hiroyuki / Hotohara Toru

55
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,020
We have something to discuss with you

56
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,820
What are you filming today?

57
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,860
Magical Hatena...

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,340
Hamada-san has... Well...

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
We haven't gone to meet him yet...

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,250
Magical... Hamada

61
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,370
It's magical Hatena we're shooting...

62
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,620
That great, it's really popular

63
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,140
But we want to do 'Magical Hamada'

64
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,600
Is that a problem?

65
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,510
If there was something to refuse, then I'd want to refuse...

66
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,650
Well, you mentioned that Magical Hatena is very popular so I'm happy about that

67
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,450
We just have to try and make it fun

68
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,820
I have been laughing all morning since I woke up

69
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,770
Thinking about the Magical Hamada

70
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,620
I want us to appear together

71
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,800
And use the studio set as it is

72
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,600
After explaining the situation to them

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,600
They head to the studio where Hamada is waiting...

74
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,120
You're late! I've been waiting~ !!

75
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,570
Come on get over here !!

76
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,420
Let's begin!

77
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,310
Can we brief?

78
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,740
They want to participate too
-Really?!

79
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,940
Is that a wig...?

80
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,450
Right?

81
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,680
What's the reasoning behind the hair change?

82
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,510
Come on, a lead host spokes person without this head is a little...

83
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,080
You wanted to give it a go just once right?

84
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,310
Perhaps the hosts before you had this style?

85
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,850
Everyone has played Magical banana before, maybe long ago but...

86
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,880
You all know what to do then right?

87
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,420
That's why we're all going to play Magical Hamada

88
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,020
Magical Hamada

89
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,820
The Hamada version

90
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,450
Well everyone take your places for now

91
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,250
The Magical Hamada is about to begin

92
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,290
But the content that lies within...

93
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,850
Let's begin with the first game...!

94
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,400
MAGICAL HAMADA !!!

95
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,800
We will be playing the game similar to Magical Banana (Word association)

96
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,310
When you hear 'Hamada' what do you think of?

97
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,740
The word game with rhythm, what comes to mind when you hear 'Hamada'

98
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,020
We're only going to be using the word Hamada?

99
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,350
Yes, just Hamada

100
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,590
When you hear 'Hamada'...

101
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,970
All of us?

102
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,000
I just said that didn't I?

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,650
-YAMASAKI !!

104
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,400
-Didn't he just say it?

105
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
-How many times must I?

106
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,600
Yamasaki, please stop doing that ok

107
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,310
Sorry

108
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,250
Let's begin!

109
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,850
Ready, set...

110
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,020
Magical Hamada~

111
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,680
When you hear Hamada...

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,200
Tough

113
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,620
When you hear Hamada...

114
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,020
Fashionable

115
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,510
When you hear Hamada...

116
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,850
Kind

117
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,400
When you hear Hamada...

118
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
Rich

119
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
When you hear Hamada...

120
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,770
Popular

121
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,200
When you hear Hamada...

122
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,510
Good at singing

123
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,940
When you hear Hamada...

124
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,420
Comedy genius

125
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,020
When you hear Hamada...

126
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,000
Really what is this...

127
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,450
This is depressing me

128
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,250
Can we stop with this feeling?

129
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,020
What's with the 'Tough'? I'm not 'Tough'

130
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,910
What are you laughing at?

131
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,680
Don't laugh !!

132
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,400
Get serious

133
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,850
This isn't a time for joking right?

134
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,650
I really want to do this seriously

135
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,370
You're ok to smile

136
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,510
A pleasant smile feeling

137
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,770
That's good

138
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,710
Pleasant smile...

139
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,280
Show us your pleasant smile

140
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,200
When you hear Hamada...

141
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,280
-That might not be bad...?

142
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,310
How about it Hamada?

143
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,010
That smile isn't too bad

144
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,050
You're laughing too much

145
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,620
We're starting with the face slaps this quickly?

146
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,050
Show us again

147
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,970
When you hear Hamada...

148
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,650
Something, something. Like that right?

149
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,540
-Yeah...

150
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,650
Let's try and enjoy ourselves then?

151
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,070
Here we go!

152
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,310
Ready, set~

153
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,710
Magical Hamada~

154
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,140
When you hear Hamada...

155
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,170
Strong

156
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,170
When you hear Hamada...

157
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,400
Midget

158
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,540
When you hear Hamada...

159
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,540
Kansai dialect

160
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,740
When you hear Hamada...

161
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,880
Hot lips

162
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,050
When you hear Hamada...

163
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,080
Bad at drawing

164
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,310
When you hear Hamada...

165
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,310
Far sighted

166
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,400
When you hear Hamada...

167
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Stinky lap

168
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,420
Haven't you just been saying bad shit this whole time?

169
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,910
-What's your problem

170
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,000
There is so much you can say about Hamada

171
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,880
Look closer at him!

172
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
What part of him have you been looking at?!

173
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,850
DO IT RIGHT !!

174
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,310
DON'T FUCK ABOUT

175
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,240
Tanaka also what's your problem

176
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,600
I'm most pissed off at you in particular

177
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,570
For fuck sake really

178
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,510
You make me sick

179
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,710
Change the game!

180
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,050
I can't go on like this

181
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,420
Let's change it

182
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,080
Change the attitudes ok?

183
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,910
Everyone ready?

184
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,480
The next game will be

185
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,220
Hamada Magical Change!

186
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,510
The name Hamada is made up of 3 syllables

187
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,940
So we're going to change 2 of them, for example

188
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,400
Hawaii

189
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,450
Any order is okay as long as it makes a word

190
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,740
There should be plenty of options to chose from

191
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,050
Let's begin!

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,420
-The ears...

193
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,740
-Could you please hide the ears

194
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,170
Sorry but...
-Suddenly exposing them like that...

195
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,600
You're so silly

196
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,420
You look like a right silly billy with those ears like that

197
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,420
-That hair style and ear combo is...

198
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,710
Let's begin

199
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,340
Ready, set !

200
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,420
Change change, Magical Hamada...

201
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,800
When you hear Hamada and change 2 syllables...

202
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,740
Hakone (place)

203
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,820
When you hear Hamada and change 2 syllables...

204
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,200
Hakata (place)

205
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,740

206
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,000
Haniwa (pottery figures)

207
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,480
When you hear Hamada and change 2 syllables...

208
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,280
Hagaki (Postcard)

209
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,080
When you hear Hamada and change 2 syllables...

210
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Hasami (Scissors)

211
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,910
They all begin with 'Ha'

212
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,450
Ha Ma Da, there is 3 syllables, you change 2

213
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,000
I thought it would be easy to understand

214
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,080
The most fun is in the variety of words and expression

215
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,850
The first few are okay use that pattern but...

216
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,650
But that far down the line you should be changing it up

217
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,250
Am I mistaken?

218
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,250
Please, you don't have to just use only 'Ha'

219
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,680
Lets begin!

220
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,370
Ready, set

221
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,680
Change change Magical Hamada...

222
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,220
When you hear Hamada and change 2 syllables...

223
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,340
Namari (Lead)

224
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,880
When you hear Hamada and change 2 syllables...

225
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,080
Chimame (Blood blister)

226
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,250
When you hear Hamada and change 2 syllables...

227
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,370
So-da (Soda)

228
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,880
When you hear Hamada and change 2 syllables...

229
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,680
Semai (Small)

230
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,020
When you hear Hamada and change 2 syllables...

231
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,540
Omame (Bean)

232
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,680
That's not related whatsoever

233
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,080
What is he talking about?

234
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Did it change?

235
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,340
Are you changing 2 syllables?

236
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,400
-You said to change 2 syllables from the start though...

237
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,650
If you change 2 syllables I can't keep up

238
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,370
I don't get it.

239
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,620
This isn't interesting at all

240
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,080
It's what you asked...

241
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,850
Should we leave the 'Ha' in place then?

242
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,370
Leave the 'Ha'...

243
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,660
Or how about leaving the 'Ha' and 'Ma'?

244
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,030
-That would be easy to understand

245
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,400
-Leave the 'Ha' and 'Ma'

246
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,650
Ok here we go!

247
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
Ready, set!

248
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,770
Change Change Magical Hamada

249
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,570
When you hear Hamada and change one syllable...

250
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,340
Hamaki (Cigar)

251
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,940
When you hear Hamada and change one syllable...

252
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,620
Hamachi (Fish)

253
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,570
When you hear Hamada and change one syllable...

254
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,310
Hamane

255
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,900
-Someone's name?

256
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Nah.

257
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,880
It came to mind because of Hamachi!

258
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,340
Hamachi reminded me of it!!

259
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,770
-Hamane can be a name also

260
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,110
Guys please...

261
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,410
Try and understand his sentiments a bit more

262
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,340
What did we do wrong?

263
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,510
You can't just use Hamane like that

264
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,520
That bad image of Hamane who debuted at the same time comes to mind

265
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,280
Hamane Takashi,
53, comedian

266
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,190
It's no wonder he reacted like that

267
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,370
TN; Hamane's gag line is actually 'I'm happy Pyo~n!'

268
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,370
That guy uses 'Delicious Pyo~n!'

269
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,250
He's not funny at all...

270
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,680
Was it my fault?

271
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,370
Well either way...

272
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,850
Let's go apologise

273
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,620
I didn't think we had done anything wrong

274
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,200
How should we apologise

275
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,970
I could just see he was unhappy

276
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,310
Tanaka, your performance was really sloppy

277
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,170
I really wanted to do my best

278
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,940
I was concerned about it the whole way through

279
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,570
-All of it?

280
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,940
My mum even said it before, 'That kid hasn't got any life in him'

281
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,450
Tanaka you should apologise properly

282
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,140
Let's go apologise

283
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,110
They head to Hamada's dressing room to apologise

284
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,000
Hamada?

285
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:22,170
Yoshimoto Creative Agency
Company President Okamoto Akihiko
Downtown former Manger

286
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,850
Damn his voice is quiet

287
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,650
What's this meeting about?

288
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,550
-Excuse us...

289
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,250
What's this about?

290
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,570
We're discussing foreign plans

291
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,080
Foreign plans...

292
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,280
Everyone has something they would like to say, Tanaka

293
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,970
Hamada-san has put great efforts...

294
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,110
Into making Magical Hamada a really fun show

295
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,970
Because we were not able to achieve your dream idea concept

296
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,570
I would like to sincerely apologise

297
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,340
After it stopped the first time and I saw your feelings....

298
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,340
I understood how you wished the game to be

299
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,800
Next time I promise I will do my best and really make it great

300
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,310
Can we please give it one more go at Magical Hamada?

301
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,400
They just made a small mistake on what kind of fun you wanted

302
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,910
Although it wasn't fun...

303
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,510
They tried to make it fun, but they were somewhat mistaken

304
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,140
After speaking to them, everyone agreed they wanted to make it fun

305
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,740
What are you laughing at!

306
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,800
ARE YOU LAUGHING?!

307
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,020
TANAKAAAA!!

308
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,510
Your inappropriate laughing

309
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,100
Is a huge problem

310
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't laugh

311
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,050
He's laughing

312
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,880
Sorry, I won't laugh

313
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,880
Anyway, Hamada-san can we continue?

314
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,280
What is this?

315
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,020
We're planning international work

316
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,650
From Asia to Ameriyaka...

317
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,000
We talking world wide plans

318
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,620
Seriously what the fuck are you laughing at again!

319
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,910
We just told you to stop laughing

320
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,910
I didn't laugh

321
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,910
This is the root cause of Hamada-san's stress

322
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,330
We have interrupted their meeting

323
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,250
They have stopped for us, and we're are supposed to be apologising...
But for some reason you're messing around

324
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,400
This is completely inexcusable

325
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,170
They are talking about planning global work events

326
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,650
That's right, from Asia to America, after that we have Europe planed

327
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,400
Why are you laughing?

328
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,170
Do you think this is an appropriate time to act the fool?

329
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,000
You're clearly causing Hamada stress

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,820
Can you or can you not do it?

331
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,310
We can!

332
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,700
We will do our best

333
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,370
If you can't, then go home now

334
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,800
We want to see faces that are crying but slightly laughing from you guys

335
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,000
-Hamada, he's not laughing at that, it's different

336
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,820
He's crying but it looks like he is laughing

337
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,250
I'm crying

338
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,220
I'm honestly crying

339
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,820
Get serious!

340
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,770
After the break! Hamada transforms into ???

341
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,250
The members await Hamada's return

342
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,220
Just don't do anything weird

343
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,110
Lets just keep the spirits and humour high

344
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,020
Sorry to keep you

345
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
Lets do it

346
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,910
Matsumoto-san, the intro please

347
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,910
Ok! Let us begin

348
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,650
Hama Hama PANIC!

349
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,510
We will be playing Hama Hama PANIC

350
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:08,820
The objective is to quietly take a bone out from infront of the sleeping Hamada

351
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,680
But if you fail and wake him up...

352
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,450
He will be enraged and a huge panic will ensue

353
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,210
He really is asleep

354
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,510
Lets begin

355
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,120
Hama Hama PANIC

356
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,250
START!

357
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,450
You were fine!

358
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,450
Ah, he is stirring a little

359
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,680
He's fast asleep

360
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,340
I can tell

361
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,910
Ah! Watch out!

362
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,200
He just opened his eyes!

363
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,110
They're not open, it means he went into deep sleep

364
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,400
He's sleep watching

365
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,600
He did it when we went to Okinawa

366
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,400
When we stayed at Haimarubushi in Okinawa, he did it then too

367
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,620
He's laughing!

368
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,000
He's having a nice dream!

369
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,220
It didn't take much time to get to sleep

370
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,200
He just lifted his head?

371
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,020
Is he really asleep?

372
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,000
He stopped snoring!

373
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,910
He's just staring at Tanaka

374
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,800
You're talking crazy he's asleep!

375
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,800
Sleeping with eyes open...

376
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,820
Shh.. Listen

377
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,510
See?

378
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,280
I can understand his fears

379
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,650
He is completely out like a light

380
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,740
-He moved
He is really staring

381
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,910
Is he asleep?
-He looks in ambush

382
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,950
What are you doing!!

383
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,020
Do it properly

384
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,170
The nose became an eyepatch!

385
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,710
He's clocking us

386
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,140
-Showing his tongue

387
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,080
Tanaka you ruined it

388
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,420
Anyone would be annoyed if you did that to them while they slept

389
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,850
Yes, but that's what the point of the game was to...

390
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,450
I could tell he was tired and taking a peaceful rest

391
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,280
Then how were we meant to...

392
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,910
He was gently sleeping peacefully and you went and did that

393
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,480
I thought that the game was...

394
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,600
We were being serious so...

395
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,480
Hamada was clearly tired and was taking a nap!

396
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,790
You took his bones while he slept!!

397
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,020
You took his bones, of course he will be mad

398
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,170
I told you to not do that didn't I?

399
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,770
Let's go and apologise

400
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,310
What for?

401
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,370
You took away Hamada-san's precious bone shape bones

402
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,880
We're sorry he didn't get much sleep

403
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,970
Got it?

404
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:44,620
The bone important shape that Hamada-san didn't get much sleep we're sorry

405
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,340
I don't really understand the grammar...

406
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,660
Look, it was his precious items with dear attachment, that's why he got flustered

407
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,420
The feelings of apology are just so overwhelming you can't even grammar

408
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,820
It's his beloved item

409
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,710
Coming up! An unbelievable tragedy!

410
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,910

Hamada-san...

423
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,080
Was sleeping and protecting his precious bones

424
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,280
Then...

425
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
We removed those bones away

426
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,770
Hamada-san was sleeping so to say...

427
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,050
What are you saying?

428
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,880

Don't you get it? How many times have we been over this?

431
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,420
You need to think of Hamada-sans feelings

432
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,740
That's why we're here doing this

433
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,220
We want to do this. Once more!

434
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,110
And when Hamada

435
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,530
When he was sleeping...

436
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,140
The idea was to collect those beloved bones

437
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,400
So Hamada-san's feelings

438
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,800
He was sleeping when we took those bones

439
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,340
While Hamada-san was sleeping

440
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,540
What is he rambling about?

441
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,980
I don't get it.

442
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,740
Just go home already

443
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Honestly, Hamada-san...

444
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,260

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,080

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,020

We don't need you

449
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,310
I don't understand

450
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,800
Don't run away!

451
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,020
