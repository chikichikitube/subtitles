00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,670
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,050
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,720
Onigoe Tomahawk!
-Surprising!

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,050
Thank you, we are Onigoe Tomahawk

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,620
Scary
-An oppressive feeling

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,440
Hamada has a lot of people like us around him

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,910
Standing by his car
-You idiot!

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,150
So, I think everyone here should be aware of this

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,910
Our style usually involves arguing

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,200
It's interesting
-Very popular with everyone

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,250
So we have brought a theory about argue-style comedy

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:50,600
If managers suddenly give you a Onigeo Tomahawk-style "you're so noisy!" routine while fighting with another manager, will the situation turn serious?

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,670
This is scary

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,730
If it is said by the agent who is always around

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,170
You'll think, "He doesn't really think that, does he?"

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,570
It also depends on how the relationship is

17
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,100
If it's a playful relationship
-Yes

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,800
Indeed

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,100
So next

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,580
Shut the hell up!

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,020
The real manager prank

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,140
And

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,540
The area of Mutsumiso is still the best value for money in Tokyo

24
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,400
And

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,110
The all-time worst-selling comedian CD ranking

26
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:56,600
If managers suddenly give you a Onigeo Tomahawk-style "you're so noisy!" routine while fighting with another manager, will the situation turn serious?

27
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,420
So

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,910
These two participate in the capacity of determining the quarrel

29
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,770
Awful

30
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:13,180
The same amount of stress felt in general should be released

31
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,250
If they can see someone seemingly really taking something to heart

32
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,550
They'll be convinced that its real

33
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,050
We are looking forward to this development

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,800
So, the the first target to endure verbal abuse from their manager is

35
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,850
Diane's Tsuda

36
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,620
By the way, this time the project

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,880
Good choice, good choice

38
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,170
Don't fight, don't fight, don't fight!

39
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,620
You're so noisy!

40
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,710
You're turning into an old man!

41
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,970
I don't really think so!

42
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,310
But lately, when you're tired you look like Mino Monta

43
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,750
You're so noisy!

44
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:56,970
The person assuming Sakai's role is a fake new manager who has been working for just a few days

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,370
Next

46
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,790
I don't really think so!

47
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,080
The person playing Kin's role

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,220
Is Tsuda's real agent

49
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,880
His real manager

50
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,070
This time you were responsible for writing the script
-Yes

51
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,610
How is it?

52
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:21,280
Conveying Yoshimoto's feelings of Diane's Tsuda to him

53
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,650
I hope he will take these words back home with him and think about them behind closed doors

54
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,600
Really?

55
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,680
Tsuda arrives at the scene of the fake recording

56
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,680
It's for his own good

57
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,650
It's okay to be honest with Tsuda

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,830
Spraying alcohol furiously...

59
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,710
Looks mad

60
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,930
Spraying way too much, right?

61
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,360
It's cheap alcohol, right?

62
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,100
It's not like that, Tokyo people don't do it like that

63
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,240
Just looking at this makes me feel angry

64
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,080
So

65
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,910
Can we take some pictures first?

66
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,280
Tsuda is taken out of the room

67
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,600
At this time, a conflict brakes out between the two managers

68
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,770
So realistic!

69
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,140
They've been instructed

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,850
When Tsuda returns to the room and attempts to break up the fight

71
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,450
Yes, yes, yes

72
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,110
The "you're so noisy!" will be triggered

73
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,310
It'd be a shock

74
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,200
Go back quick!

75
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,300
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

76
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,440
Hey!

77
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,110
What's up? What's up?

78
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,280
What are you doing?

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,140
You're so noisy!

80
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,480
What the hell!?

81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,650
Tokyo Yoshimoto doesn't need you at all!

82
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,880
What the hell are you talking about?
-Go back to Osaka!

83
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,720
Who the hell is this guy!? What's going on!?

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,530
He's angry

85
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,630
Shut the hell up!

86
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,960
What the hell!?

87
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,130
Tokyo Yoshimoto doesn't need you at all!

88
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,370
What the hell are you talking about?
-Go back to Osaka!

89
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,710
Can't blame him, he didn't even do anything

90
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,500
Who the hell is this guy!? What's going on!?

91
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,100
How...

92
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,670
I don't really think so!

93
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,880
They said he was the "Next Chidori"

94
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,550
But he can't beat Kamaitachi so he should just stay at home and live stream video games

95
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,250
What?

96
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,020
I'm shocked...

97
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,020
That's too funny

98
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,890
What? Is something wrong?

99
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,760
I'm shocked...

100
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,990
What's going on here?

101
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,030
What's going on?

102
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,230
Ah, he laughed, must've realized

103
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,500
He seemed to be angry before but now he's just embarrassed

104
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,250
With the inclusion of Kin's part, he realized something was up

105
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,800
The truth is revealed

106
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,940
He realized

107
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,770
The managers worked hard

108
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,920
Whoa, you surprised me!

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,950
What? How?

110
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,390
What the hell?

111
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,790
Seeing the manager and the newcomer quarreling like you two...

112
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,060
Wha...what?

113
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,260
You were a little angry at first, weren't you?

114
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,400
Super angry...really super angry

115
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,100
This goddamn newcomer, for a minute I wanted to smack him

116
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,210
I really almost did it

117
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,080
Really a little angry, right?

118
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,010
Did you write the script?

119
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,410
Yes
-What the hell!

120
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,320
We had some other ideas
-Tell me

121
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,150
Since Oda came on the scene you're of no use anymore

122
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,920
That's the thing I care most about, okay?

123
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,800
Tsuda cares a lot

124
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,370
The next target is

125
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,280
Panther's Ogata

126
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,170
It's the first time we've targeted Ogata, so i'm looking forward to it

127
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,880
Will he realize?

128
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,340
He's aging surprisingly quickly

129
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,270
More and more wrinkles

130
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,240
If there are no more pranks, he's done

131
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,380
If pranks cease to exist, then Ogata is finished

132
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,850
He could be pranked to pay a loan back for 70 years

133
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,280
That's why he's funny

134
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,920
Because he should have noticed so many times

135
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,260
It's really impressive
-Who wouldn't notice

136
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,730
His outlook or something is also, how to say, childish?

137
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,230
In short, he's an imbecile
-Yes, yes, yes

138
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,570
The places he loves to eat at are also really disgusting

139
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,940
Enough guys!

140
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:08,450
This badmouthing continued for 10 minutes

141
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,620
Ogata arrives at the scene

142
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:21,220
When he leaves the room, the two agents begin their fight

143
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,540
The managers are impressive

144
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,190
Looks like a real fight

145
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,710
Looks superb

146
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,860
What will Ogata do?

147
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,370
Can't stop it!

148
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,370
What will be the result?

149
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,530
Wait wait wait

150
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,930
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

151
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,900
Stop, both of you!

152
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,400
What are you doing? What are you doing?

153
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,870
You're so noisy!

154
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,740
You have never made people laugh by yourself!

155
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,480
Eh?

156
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,580
I don't really think so!

157
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,920
If you weren't in Panther, your ability would be similar to XXX

158
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,360
So why are you so up yourself?

159
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,920
Why would you say such a thing?

160
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,100
Why fight?

161
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,370
I'm very sorry
-Sorry

162
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,570
Are you arguing about me?
-No, I was just too impulsive

163
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,240
Is he angry?

164
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,040
It looks like he didn't realize it was our lines

165
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,510
Not realizing the connection with Onigoe, he is instead traumatized

166
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,780
We've been rude

167
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,650
Do not say such hurtful things so early in the morning, its bad for the heart

168
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,990
I am very sorry

169
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,360
You too, what was that just now!?

170
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,090
I made a mistake

171
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,060
What do you mean a mistake?

172
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,760
I got a little overheated

173
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,560
Why on earth would you say something like that early in the morning?

174
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,170
"Early in the morning"

175
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,870
This is Ogata's style

176
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,540
When's a good time to say it?

177
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,740
Hurry up and realize

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,770
Is that what you've always thought?

179
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,940
He doesn't know much about you

180
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,950
What are you saying, I don't get it

181
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
I was just being too impulsive

182
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,890
If it was impulsive, can you say it again calmly?

183
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,090
Even if it's the truth, you can't say it?

184
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,490
I know it better than anyone!

185
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,990
I can't believe he accepted it

186
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:16,140
Although the content is right on the money, he hasn't realised the connection to Onigoe

187
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,940
The truth is revealed

188
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,800
He knows, right?

189
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
What?

190
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,280
What's going on?

191
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,050
What the hell is this?

192
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,910
You have worked hard

193
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,350
Ah...

194
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,620
Ah, this is you guys' routine!

195
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,960
After seeing them, Ogata finally realizes

196
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,260
You guys...are really good at criticizing!

197
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,660
That's our style after all

198
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,800
Which program do you think this is?

199
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,030
That... well...

200
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,270
So many times already...

201
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,210
This is how you're paying off your loans, right?
-You're so noisy!

202
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,000
The next target is

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,110
Komiya

204
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,460
He's too popular for his own good
-Indeed

205
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,530
His attitude towards his agent is very worrying

206
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,700
He is very...

207
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,330
His concept of male superiority is a serious issue

208
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,000
Very serious, especially in this day and age

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,440
Although he can be superficially pleasant, to the bone, he is mean to women

210
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,540
Komiya, with a suspicious air of misogyny

211
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,970
Will he join in?

212
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,220
What will be the result?

213
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,680
He's laughing

214
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,190
Laughing so hard, eh?

215
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,250
Girls or...

216
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,870
Not stepping in? What the hell!?

217
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:05,110
For some reason, Komiya is laughing a lot

218
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,940
This is a bad vibe

219
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,480
What's going on?

220
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,940
No action at all

221
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,420
Are you okay? Are you guys okay?

222
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,490
What? What's wrong?

223
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,720
You're so noisy!

224
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,790
What's wrong?

225
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,730
You can't be compared to Degawa and Kano because you're just pretending to be a decent guy!

226
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,960
Huh? What's going on?
-I don't really think so

227
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,000
You pretend to be a good guy, but when you participated in the song section of M-1 last time

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,370
You acted the fool on purpose just to get people to tease you

229
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,040
Eh? What's going on?

230
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,220
His expression has started to change

231
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,220
I am very sorry

232
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,390
I'm very sorry.
-Don't apologize

233
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,020
I think he noticed.
-He should have sensed something was wrong

234
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,130
Isn't this Onigoe's routine?

235
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,370
You've worked hard, Komiya
-Thank you for your hard work

236
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,840
Did what we wrote upset you?

237
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,510
Your smile suddenly disappeared at one point

238
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,480
Well, you have a point

239
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,380
Why didn't you do anything to stop the fight?

240
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,820
I couldn't help but laugh because my manager here was acting in such a lame scene

241
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,390
You should learn from the previous generation of Kano and Degawa!

242
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,960
Look how hard they work!

243
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,790
I don't see them as rivals, okay?

244
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,230
The difference between Degawa and Kano is that I have Aida with me

245
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,360
I have Aida with me

246
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,100
Is he on the same level as them?

247
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,500
Aida?
-Yes

248
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,140
Don't put it like that

249
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,540
The manager is laughing

250
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,140
The next target is

251
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,250
Still so strict with his manager

252
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,880
Panzetta Girolamo

253
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,340
He won't understand

254
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,920
This one should be the most difficult to get it

255
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,320
After all, he's not a comedian

256
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,750
This is his manager

257
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,860
Handsome

258
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,530
Does Girolamo know Onigoe's routine?

259
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,660
I don't think so.
-Oh

260
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,760
It's really not good

261
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:12,510
Girolamo, who does not know the original routine, will be faced with the manager's verbal violence

262
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,770
What will be the result?

263
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,570
Why is there a smile at the corner of your mouth?

264
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,150
Is everything okay?

265
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,920
Why are you fighting?

266
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,550
You're so noisy!

267
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,890
Who? Me?

268
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,460
You've lowered the reputation of all Italians in the minds of Japanese people!

269
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,160
Do you wanna smack?

270
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,180
Scary scary scary scary

271
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,630
So scary!
-Super scary

272
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,740
Suddenly said "do you wanna smack?" ...
-Whoa...

273
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,580
You've lowered the reputation of all Italians in the minds of Japanese people!

274
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,280
Do you wanna smack?

275
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,280
A sudden approach

276
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,220
Not good, not good, not good, not good

277
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,370
I don't really think so!

278
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,850
No way!

279
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,050
It's fine that he's a womanizer

280
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,830
I just don't want him to end up like Ishida

281
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,560
Is everything okay?

282
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,470
Ah, he's laughing. Great.
-He's smiling!

283
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,640
This is a first for me

284
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,740
Seeing HORIPRO people fight each other, I just wanted to cool everything down immediately

285
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,180
Because if the people at the top know about it, you might be fired

286
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,250
Let's go have a nice meal together!

287
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,750
Treat us to a cheap and delicious meal

288
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,750
Because the salary at HORIPRO is not that great

289
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,740
Girolamo, takes a sharp turn from "unpleasant" to gently defusing the situation

290
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,620
This is the most frightening aspect

291
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,200
So the truth is revealed here

292
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,140
He seems like the type not to be messed with

293
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,700
Ah...that's how it is

294
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,200
Do you know us?

295
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,810
Can't remember the name

296
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,440
You got shouted at, right? "You're so noisy!"

297
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,750
And suddenly said "do you wanna smack?
-We were sweating in front of the screen!

298
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,180
We were thinking "if a fight happens what do we do?"

299
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,290
At first I was really about to snap

300
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:11,020
But what he said was so ridiculous I couldn't help but laugh

301
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,820
Thankfully, a fight and being unable to televise this segment were avoided

302
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,080
It was touch and go for a while there

303
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,510
The last target is...

304
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,100
Sorry to make you wait so long

305
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,600
This is gonna be bad

306
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,570
TKO's Kimoto

307
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,200
This candidate is too good

308
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,580
Instead of letting us say it, we'll leave it to the manager to deliver it

309
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,250
This is a wakeup call

310
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,480
Feel like i'm about to see something I shouldn't

311
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,750
Managers really shouldn't say this sort of thing

312
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,990
But we are taking this opportunity to put everything out there

313
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,060
I hope this will help her to unload

314
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,680
A man who cares a lot about hierarchical relationships

315
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,250
What will be the result?

316
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,650
I didn't say it!

317
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,790
What's wrong with you?

318
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,650
As if it was my fault!

319
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,440
What do you want!

320
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,310
Wait wait wait

321
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,610
What's wrong? What's wrong?

322
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,250
You're so noisy!

323
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,210
Eh?

324
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,520
It's disturbing to be in charge of you at Shochiku!

325
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,490
Eh?
-I don't really think so

326
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,090
But I hoped that you would take off like UNJASH's Kojima did when he left

327
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:24,860
But I haven't seen any improvements and just think that Shochiku is finding it harder to deal with you!

328
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
Eh?

329
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,530
Eh?

330
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,130
Scary!

331
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,570
Scary scary scary

332
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,870
I'm very sorry. That was a little...
-A heated moment

333
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,870
I'm sorry for being too impulsive just now

334
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,280
Between managers, there's a little...
-What's going on?

335
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,880
Didn't realize?

336
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,220
Hasn't he seen our routine?

337
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,450
Despite having experienced it previously, he fails to realize the connection to Onigoe

338
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,220
Instead, he simply became irritated

339
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,160
Eh? Anyway...that...anyway, you know

340
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,260
I think it's good to have momentum

341
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,870
But after all, things have just begun, so...

342
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,570
Its a temporary thing, we have to be able to deal with it

343
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:10,880
This is the first time i've seen you like this

344
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,620
Lecture time!

345
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:19,020
So, he launched into "long-winded lecture that looked gentle at first glance"

346
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,570
Later

347
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,120
I'm really sorry

348
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,320
An apology is nice

349
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,220
This is the end

350
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,630
It's only natural

351
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,930
So that's what you think!

352
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,940
Unsurprisingly, he lets his real manager off

353
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,340
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah

354
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,670
I don't really agree with what you said

355
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,210
But it's good to talk about things

356
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,010
I really don't want to go in

357
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,150
Anyway, lets get back to it

358
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,780
Lets sit down

359
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,250
Although rude things have been said
-Yes.

360
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,260
Hm

361
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,210
The truth is revealed

362
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,890
You've worked hard

363
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,770
Thank you for your hard work

364
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,270
Do you know what's happening?

365
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,870
It's a show, right?

366
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,110
You didn't realize?
-Realize what?

367
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,610
That this was a bit like our routine?

368
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,850
I didn't... oh, the way you argue
-That's right

369
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,750
You didn't get it even with the second part?
-Not at all

370
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:33,590
You can see how big of a problem this is in my mind

371
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,730
It was so spot on

372
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:43,520
It felt like she finally said what she really wanted to say

373
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,740
And that name appeared

374
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,480
Is it too much to same that I envy him?

375
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,250
In summary
His target is Kojima

376
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,420
What's with the photo?

377
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,370
What kind of prank is the last photo?

378
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,140
It's outrageous, isn't it?
-What an outrageous prank

379
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,370
That part is not related to us

380
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,970
That's right.
-Yes

381
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,410
Girolamo is scary

382
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,630
"Do you wanna smack?"
-It's not easy to say that

383
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,740
I've never even said "do you wanna smack?"

384
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,710
Sounds like an enka singer's B-side

385
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,850
"Do You Wanna Smack"

386
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,200
You two chatting was also pretty bad

387
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,620
I'm sorry.
-Yes, it was

388
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,600
Because I didn't know it would be shown
-Yes

389
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,650
It'll definitely be shown

390
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,310
Those words were the most honest

391
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,600
After watching the broadcast those people should really take it to heart

392
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,530
When was all over, the staff said something that made us panic

393
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,080
Eh?

394
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,100
"All Kyojin's part cannot be shown"

395
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,740
The manager said it couldn't go out

396
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,740
The manager thought it'd be a problem
-Yes

397
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:01,210
We thought to ourselves, "this show has gone too far..."

398
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,620
Let's welcome the next presenter

399
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,080
Audrey's Kasuga!

400
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,770
Twoos!

401
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,080
Here we go. Thank you all

402
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,250
So, let's get to it

403
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,000
Straight to the point

404
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,540
If I don't get to the point, something big will happen. I know

405
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,540
This is the theory I bring you today

406
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,810
The area of Mutsumiso is still the best value for money in Tokyo

407
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,680
I lived in an apartment there for 20 years

408
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,600
The landlord hasn't been displeased with all the location shooting there?

409
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
No

410
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,510
This is the thing I appreciate most as a comedian

411
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,310
One time in the morning, for Wednesday Downtown

412
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,940
Someone came and banged on the front door outside, tried to smash it to bits

413
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,990
The landlord was laughing down below

414
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,610
He was the one laughing the most

415
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:29,200
The area of Mutsumiso is still the best value for money in Tokyo

416
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,020
So

417
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,140
Twoos！

418
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,420
Loud voice

419
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,110
Also wearing a mask

420
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,340
Good morning, everyone

421
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:47,570
One morning, a full of energy Kasuga visits the area of Mutsumiso for the first time in a while

422
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:54,530
I come and go when doing business in this neighborhood

423
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,360
Go back and see how it looks

424
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,460
Why?

425
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,030
To see how its doing

426
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,230
After all, I lived here for 20 years

427
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,840
Although I don't have this experience

428
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,610
I imagine it's like having a child with your ex-wife

429
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,110
A common scene in TV series

430
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,480
Watching from outside through the kindergarten fence

431
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,250
That feeling?

432
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,200
A long-awaited meeting with the loving and compassionate Mutsumiso

433
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,260
Kasuga is in high spirits, but

434
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,920
Ahhh

435
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,160
There used to be mailboxes here

436
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,600
It's gone!

437
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,910
The mailbox that used to be by the stairs

438
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,220
Dismantled

439
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,470
Here's the box

440
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,740
Moved to the entrance of each room

441
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,000
And

442
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,450
Ah? Is this door new?

443
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,280
Ah?

444
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,320
A new fan

445
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,590
Says "WEATHER COVER" in English

446
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,930
Imported goods!

447
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,700
Ahhh

448
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,200
A water heater!

449
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:19,450
Doorbell

450
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:19,450
Lights in the corridor

451
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:19,450
Small fire extinguisher

452
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,000
Kasuga moved out about a year and a half ago

453
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,910
Although it has undergone some renovations

454
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,280
Ah?

455
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,420
No change

456
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,180
Only the room where Kasuga stayed 201 remains unchanged

457
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,190
Somehow only 201 is the same

458
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,860
Cultural heritage treatment

459
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:40,910
Also, a long-awaited reunion with SIINA Miura, a second-generation artist living in the area

460
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,400
Who moved to Mutsumio a year and a half ago

461
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,340
Here, he is asked about his feelings of living here

462
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,040
How is it?

463
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,850
You've experienced all seasons by now

464
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,810
Nice, right?
-It's nice to live in

465
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,550
-56y/o building
-No bathroom
-With toilet

466
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,550
It's very, very nice.
-Right?

467
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,890
The first winter was hard, right?

468
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,320
Yes, the first winter I thought it was so cold

469
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,220
Sometimes when you get up you exhale white breath

470
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,490
Frequently

471
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,390
You get used to not having a bathroom

472
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,730
Completely used to it

473
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,400
Washing once a week was perfectly fine

474
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,540
In summer
-Summer? Wow!

475
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,570
Listening to their conversations, the merits of Mutsumiso were still unclear

476
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:31,710
Despite the atmosphere alone apparently making the area great for both old and new residents

477
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,490
So, we conducted a questionnaire survey locally

478
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,970
Which revealed an average monthly rent of 39,000 yen in Mutsumiso

479
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,080
To find whether places that are cheaper than this exist

480
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,820
We sought comedians proud of the affordability of their places

481
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,850
Is there anything cheaper than this?

482
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,820
There should be

483
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,000
To find better deals that Mutsumiso

484
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,820
The first place we travelled to is Nerima-ku

485
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,410
Ah? There's a guy staring at me. Is that him?

486
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,680
Hello, good morning
-Morning

487
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,050
The first comedian with super low rent is

488
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,490
With 14 years expereince, Royal Mizoguti

489
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,050
Mizoguti

490
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,420
The 1st floor is the store

491
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,690
It's a store

492
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,560
Mont Reple 6

493
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,530
This has probably never been shot before

494
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,500
It's the first time

495
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,870
First time shooting in your place?
-First time

496
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,670
The address is clearly printed

497
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,910
By the way, Mutsumiso is a great choice when it comes to location shooting

498
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,110
Standing by for a shoot

499
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,110
Covered up?

500
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,780
The address is blocked with white tape

501
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,820
This is for an on-location shoot

502
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,720
An interesting sight

503
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,110
Here
-Yes

504
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,290
What is this?

505
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,300
First of all, this is concerning
-Sorry

506
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,900
I have no sense of time

507
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,740
Warning myself not to be late

508
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,670
So you posted this

509
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,070
Does this work?

510
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,340
Nothing works...
-Then take it off!

511
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,140
It scares me a bit

512
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,010
Excuse me.
-Please come in

513
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,180
Excuse me.
-Please come in

514
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,570
So many words

515
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,000
And air conditioning

516
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,080
The size of this room is 6 tatami mats plus 1 kitchen

517
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,370
When you walk into the entrance hall, you will see...

518
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,460
There are a lot of notes
-Yes

519
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,200
Have the life of a popular comedian

520
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,800
What is that sort of life like?

521
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,870
I'm not sure

522
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,640
It's better to take it off

523
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,940
By the way, the most recommended thing in this room is

524
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,740
Decent bathroom

525
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,390
What's that?

526
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,760
What is this?

527
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,860
There is a toilet. What is this?

528
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,360
And shower
-Yes

529
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,420
With washstand and shower

530
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,600
This can be moved

531
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,280
Wow

532
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,600
First time I've seen that

533
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,740
The wall there is a bit...

534
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,240
It's peeling at the corner pretty badly

535
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,140
What's up with that?

536
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,980
When it rains heavily and there's strong wind

537
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,620
Water seeps in through the cracks

538
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,490
This is not good.
-It's not good

539
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,890
To what extent does water seep in

540
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:29,630
To the carpet

541
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,250
With water-related advantages and disadvantages

542
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,370
The rent for this six-tatami plus 1 kitchen is...

543
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,370
This is the point

544
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,650
35,000 yen

545
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,210
With shower
-Yes

546
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,210
They crossed their arms at the same time

547
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,250
Like a master and a disciple

548
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,560
Then let's decide

549
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,910
Which is the best value: Mont Reple 6 or Mutsumiso

550
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,540
It is the current resident Miura who decides

551
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,020
Mutsumiso
-Very good

552
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,600
I think this place is very good

553
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,970
But Mutsumiso is bigger

554
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,940
The location is also better

555
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,610
All things considered, Mutsumiso is better

556
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,850
To find a better deal than Mutsumiso

557
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,620
Next, we travelled to Setagaya-ku

558
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,220
Is that the guy?

559
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,390
Is it you? The one who wants to fight against Mutsumiso?

560
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,620
What's with this greeting?

561
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:43,370
The second artist with extremely low rent is Samidare Taro

562
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,370
Go in like this?
-Yes

563
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:53,970
Walking 30 meters down the narrow alley

564
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,380
This is the place.
-Here?

565
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,420
Ohara House

566
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,380
Very neat

567
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,020
It was refurbished a year ago.
-Really?

568
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,890
Before it was entirely made of wood

569
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,330
I feel like i've been here before

570
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,370
I've heard you've worked here before

571
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,930
Ah right

572
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:21,540
Indeed, it was actually 6 years ago for an investigation...

573
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,780
It's here
-No...

574
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,340
Completely different

575
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,510
No... really?
-Yeah

576
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:39,400
The mixed structure of wood on the first floor and iron on the second left an impression

577
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,190
Looks like a shed

578
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,530
That feeling

579
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:49,870
Were there residents last time I was here?

580
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,640
Was it someone else?
-Another comedian

581
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,240
What about now? Are you the only comedian here?

582
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,940
Just me now

583
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,410
Yeah, because it's cheap

584
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,440
Comedians will be drawn to it

585
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,250
Are the other rooms empty?

586
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,350
Only one or two are empty

587
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,720
Isn't this corridor sloped?

588
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,560
Its tilted

589
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,660
I've been living there for 4 years so I don't notice it anymore

590
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,690
Really? It's super titled!

591
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,360
To this side

592
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,460
Seriously tilted this way

593
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,240
Particularly titled

594
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,670
You get used to it

595
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,420
6 years ago the corridor was tilted

596
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,710
Won't you fall over like this?

597
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,320
But it's just a corridor, let's forget it.
-Yes, it's nothing

598
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,180
It's just the corridor

599
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,150
Well, it's just a corridor

600
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,720
You said the same thing before.
-Eh?

601
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,560
The same thing six years ago?
-Yes

602
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,700
Whoa, so I haven't grown at all since then

603
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,050
In Ohara House

604
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:58,570
Samidare Taro lives in Room C, a one-bedroom six-tatami apartment

605
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,010
With refrigerator
-Included?

606
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,040
Air-conditioned
-With air conditioning

607
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,780
Also has a TV
-The TV comes with it?

608
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,880
Awesome

609
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,480
Impressive

610
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,250
Although the conditions are generally good

611
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,820
There are rats in this building

612
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,450
You've seen them?
-Yes

613
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,190
When I come back they scurry away

614
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,260
Escape through a gap there

615
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,460
No measures?
-Look here

616
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,060
Rat trap stickers?
-Yes

617
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,570
Have you ever caught with this?

618
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,170
Yes

619
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,300
What was the state of the rat? Was it stuck?

620
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,310
Two to three of them were stuck
-2 to 3?

621
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:35,910
Too much

622
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:40,380
I really struggled when getting closer

623
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,510
It's scary.
-It's a little unacceptable

624
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,780
Can you hear the voice of next door?

625
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:50,290
If they're on the phone you can hear their words loud and clear

626
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:55,630
An alarm clock goes off, I don't know if its mine or...

627
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,630
That's awful

628
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,280
Public bathrooms with public toilets

629
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,910
Ohara House comes with its own furniture and its rodents

630
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,250
Its rent is...

631
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,970
30,000 yen

632
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,850
Whoa!

633
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,080
30,000?

634
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,980
It's furnished, it has a shower, a toilet and a washing machine

635
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,790
But the decision rests with Miura

636
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,510
Out of Ohara House and Mutsumiso

637
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,340
Which is a better deal?

638
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,140
Mutsumiso

639
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,340
Very good

640
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,500
Is that really what you think?

641
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,300
The public area is a bit too big. You'll have to run into a lot of people

642
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,670
I care about that

643
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,710
But this was a tough matchup.
-Neck-and-neck

644
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,680
A very interesting matchup

645
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,110
To find a better deal than Mutsumiso

646
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,940
Next we went to Meguro-ku

647
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,590
Is that him?

648
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,990
Good morning

649
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:08,710
The third artist with extremely low rent is Squeeze Iwao who has been performing for 3 years

650
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,470
What is it with these names

651
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,510
Really nonsense

652
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,170
Over here

653
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,940
Where?

654
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,980
Here
-Here?

655
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,150
It's here
-Here?

656
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,980
Yes
-Here?

657
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,990
Here
-Here?

658
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,160
It's here
-Here?

659
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,590
Here?

660
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,890
Isn't it quite big?

661
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,600
It's not a question of whether it's big or not, right?

662
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,000
It's not a matter of size. Look how amazing it is here

663
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Don't you think it's cool?

664
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,340
I'm not sure it has the right feeling though

665
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,070
Kind of looking forward to it
-It's a great place

666
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,170
Have a look

667
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,810
I'll open it

668
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,310
It's like a Ghibli movie, right?

669
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,250
The landlord lives on the 1st floor.
-Oh

670
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,310
The 2nd floor is an apartment

671
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,370
Looks like a student place

672
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,450
Climbing the steep stairs

673
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,200
It doesn't seem like this era at all

674
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:18,570
And no lampshades, just bare bulbs

675
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,100
Is this a darkroom?

676
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,340
Like a movie

677
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,010
Great

678
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,380
Very nice, very excited about the interior

679
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,950
Glad you like it

680
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,680
Here, please come in

681
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,750
So narrow!

682
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,090
So narrow

683
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,090
So narrow inside

684
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,620
Particularly narrow

685
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:48,050
This confinement-like room is only 3 tatami mats in size

686
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,300
This is a detention center, right?

687
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,540
Is this the room where Tony Ooki was locked up?

688
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,840
Has a prison vibe

689
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,050
This looks like the type of place that Wednesday Downtown locks people up in

690
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,080
Indeed

691
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,580
You don't feel enclosed? Just 3 tatami.
-No, I don't

692
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,350
There's no bathroom

693
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,720
TV can only watch channels 8 and 6

694
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,820
Why why?

695
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,730
Can't get a signal?

696
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:23,200
To watch TV, the window needs to be opened and the angle of the antenna adjusted

697
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,620
A 5 minute walk to the nearest station

698
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,710
But there is no bathroom. So, the price is...?

699
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,050
How much is the rent?

700
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,520
18,000 yen

701
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,680
So cheap!

702
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,450
Really? 18,000 yen?

703
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,990
Really?

704
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,310
Facing the super cheap house of just over 10,000

705
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:55,170
Miura can't help but hold his head in his hands

706
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,940
His decision was...

707
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,800
It's over, right?

708
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,800
Mutsumiso!

709
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,450
This was a tough choice

710
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,980
Its mainly the TV...

711
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,050
By the way, which one would you choose, Kasuga?

712
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,000
This place

713
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,320
After all, it's only 18,000 yen

714
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,520
TV is not worth 20,000 yen

715
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,760
By the way, this is the cheapest rent in Tokyo according to the staff survey

716
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,960
Are there any places cheaper than 18,000 yen?

717
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,430
9800 yen

718
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:38,110
9800 yen？9800 yen？Monthly？

719
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,180
In Edogawa Bridge
-Edogawa Bridge

720
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,420
16 minute walk from Waseda
-Long

721
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,590
A room that looks like a hallway

722
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,790
This is also attractive

723
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,200
It is the real 1st

725
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,880
Interesting

726
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,570
What do you think, Okada?

727
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:18,370
If there's rats, ah, its difficult

728
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,710
Every day as well
-Every day?

729
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:25,710
Every day there is a rustling sound when opening the door

730
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,290
Occasionally they get stuck

731
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,450
What do you think, Kendo?

732
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,930
Kasuga, seeing you do location shoots

733
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,850
I'm always very moved

734
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,940
The wobbly-walking Kasuga

735
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,490
Yes, it looks better after editing

736
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,820
Its even worse during the recording

737
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:55,150
Next is everybody's theories

738
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,970
Magical Lovely!
-Too early!

739
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,400
Magical Lovely!

740
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,620
Magical Lovely!
-Thanks

741
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,570
Magical and lovely
-Yes

742
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,420
That's right, thank you

743
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:13,000
Without a doubt, we are Magical Lovely

744
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,170
Comedians bringing out songs is pretty common, right?

745
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,070
Hamada has
-From time to time

746
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,960
Not really from time to time, but yeah

747
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,000
Your husband too
-Yes

748
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,550
My husband sings pretty well, but his partner sings like shit

749
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,420
You are too biased towards your own husband

750
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,100
That's why it only sold 30,000 copies

751
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,020
That many?
-That's still pretty impressive

752
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,500
There are many popular artists who have released songs

753
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,170
First of all, please listen to this

754
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,640
Harisen

755
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,340
Reached #195 in the charts

756
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,350
With "Song of Friends"

757
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:03,450
The theme song of a Keroro movie

758
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,370
Should've sold well then, right?

759
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,590
Isn't that great?
-Yes, it is

760
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,660
Only 400 copies were sold

761
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,790
Not even enough to full the Lumine theatre

762
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,360
Not enough to fill Lumine

763
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,150
No way

764
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,630
I thought to myself, what are my peers doing?

765
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:22,600
Surprisingly, despite the popularity of Harisen

766
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,520
They only sold 400 copies

767
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,070
So, this time, we bring a theory about comedians' CDs

768
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:35,720
The worst selling comedian CD in history is Harisen's "Song of Friends"

769
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,600
400

770
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,620
There's people from Keroro Gunsou in it too, right?
-Yes

771
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,500
And fans of it
-Children and so on

772
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,400
These people add up to 400

773
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,710
It really is "Song of Friends"

774
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,800
Lyrics like grapefruit
-Not many friends either

775
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,000
What does "like grapefruit" mean?

776
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,670
Like... is there such a song?

777
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:06,400
I think there was a song called "Song of Friends" before

778
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,400
What does everyone think?

779
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,950
Don't pass it off to everyone else!

780
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,240
We have also done a song
-Really?

781
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,580
A song called "Bayashi"
-Never heard it before

782
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,120
Of course, no one downloaded it

783
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,920
It didn't even come out as a CD.
-Ah right

784
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:34,380
The worst selling comedian CD in history is Harisen's "Song of Friends"

785
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:39,050
So, before announcing the list of the worst sellers

786
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,700
Let's take a look at the top ten comedian CD sales over the generations

787
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,470
That's good to know

788
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,200
No. 10 to No. 4 is shown above

789
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,550
Born from the popular variety show "Urinari

790
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,520
Songs from here make up the bulk

791
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,850
Next in 3rd is

792
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,570
Tunnels

793
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,320
Tunnels' "Here Comes the Rattlesnake" with sales of 1.4 million

794
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,520
Next in 2nd is

795
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,200
Them again

796
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,220
"Timing" by BLACK BISCUITS with sales of 1.48 million

797
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,000
Impressive

798
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,470
So Unari shows its power again

799
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,220
The biggest success is

800
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,500
There it is

801
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,150
Caused a movement, eh?

802
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,920
As you know, it is H Jungle, which is our Hamada

803
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,270
WOW WAR TONIGHT with sales of 2.13 million

804
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:44,470
Now we know the top artists list

805
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,870
Let's take a look at the worst selling CDs

806
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,600
First in 10th

807
00:41:53,850 --> 00:42:00,370
COME ON BABY" by GO☆TO, also known as Goto of Soccer Time, with sales of 1079

808
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:01,300
He released one?
-Goto did

809
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,320
Next in 9th is

810
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,970
Oki KODAMA-HIBIKI's "chi" with sales of 1068

811
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,370
Next in 8th is

812
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:29,550
Kenji Hirai songs covered by Ken Hirai, 954 copies sold

813
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,450
Could've sold more

814
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:37,650
7th place is "Proposal in Daejeon" by Tetsu and Koto's with 824

815
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,470
This is too humiliating

816
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,570
The cover shot is quite good

817
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:48,670
6th place goes to Kano Eiko's "Welcome! Handsome Man☆Heaven" with 626 copies sold

818
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,550
Seems like it'd sell well

819
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:56,220
But a year and a half later he scored success with 50TA

820
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,820
A huge difference

821
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,470
The next one was super big

822
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,700
Next in 5th is

823
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:15,420
KERO! and MARCH 2008" by Kozuki Tsuchida and Kanako Yanagihara with 523 copies

824
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,000
Impressive

825
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,120
An unexpected collision with Keroro Gunsou

826
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,000
By the way, Keroro Gunsou has worked with many comedians

827
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,650
Among them, there is also the odd pairing of Ogawa Naoya and Iwasa Mayuko

828
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:37,120
Next in 4th is

829
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:46,100
Kajiwara sung the theatrical theme song of the Battle Team series

830
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,670
New Horizon

831
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,270
459
-Yeah

832
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,050
Finally, its time to look at the top three

833
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,300
3rd is

834
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,950
What?

835
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:08,420
The ED song "I Hate the Night" from the anime Gegege no Kitaro

836
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,720
Performing this song is

837
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,120
An old acquaintance, Hidekazu Nagai

838
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,370
2nd is?

839
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,850
2nd

840
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,100
Harien's "Song of Friends" with 398 copies sold

841
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,500
Not even 400!

842
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,350
So at this point, unfortunately, the hypothesis has been disproven

843
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,600
398

844
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:41,020
Finally, the number one lowest selling comedian CD is

845
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,520
What's this?

846
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:53,970
The group 5uppers born from the theater "5up Yoshimoto"

847
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,950
"Each Story", with 363 copies sold

848
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,300
5uppers?
-Never heard of it

849
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,570
The hell?

850
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,450
Gross!

851
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,970
With SEAMO as producer

852
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:12,050
From more than 100 artists, these six were selected to form the group

853
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:17,600
Unfortunately, their sales were low

854
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:25,620
In summary
5uppers only made 380,000 yen

855
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:33,420
I think the Goto one is interesting

856
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,300
He also did it
-He's pretty into it

857
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,400
Seriously?
-Seriously

858
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,570
He's good at guitar too

859
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,150
Scary

860
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:47,050
Only sold about 1,000 copies

861
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,100
What do you think Nonomura?

862
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:55,150
The 5th place Tsuchida and Yanagihara is the most unbearable

863
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,850
There's nothing to say

864
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:29,830
