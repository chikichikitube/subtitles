00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,440
Reunion

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,750
[Masao-kun is in danger!]

4
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,550
[If he doesn't get help soon, he could get hurt!]

5
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,420
[Hurry, Miracle Ace!]

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,850
Miracle Ace

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,000
Mister, it's been a while!

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:26,820
Yes it has

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,670
This is the second time you're helping me!

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,650
Yes

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,900
Thank you!

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,700
How did you know I was in trouble?

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,500
I was returning from my job

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,850
Huh?

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,070
I was returning from my job

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,600
Oh, then you heard me... what's wrong Mister?

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,020
I'm tired

18
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,220
I had a lot to do today, I'm tired

19
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,100
Oh, your part-time job was tiring?

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,750
Yea...

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,320
Oh, I thought you could hear my voice with your super hearing

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,870
I thought I should go home early

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,900
My grandmother is coming home soon

24
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,420
Really?
Yea

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,250
We're all going to the buffet

26
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,570
What kind of buffet?

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,420
Yeah, we're all going to the buffet

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,200
What is that?

29
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:09,950
Want some?

30
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,270
Candy

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,300
Yes

32
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,220
Which hand?

33
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,050
This one!

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,050
Thank you

35
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,750
Do you always carry candy?

36
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,350
Yea

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,400
It's sweet

38
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,770
You're right

39
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,450
Mister

40
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:28,970
Yea

41
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,970
You know. I'm always getting bullied

42
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,600
Yea

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,370
Could you teach me?

44
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,220
What?

45
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,650
Some skill

46
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:41,800
Ok

47
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,750
I want you to teach me how to defend myself

48
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,100
Like, if someone is going to punch you?

49
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,350
Well... let's see

50
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,470
Try to punch me

51
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,830
Don't bother

52
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,150
Don't come

53
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,700
I'm hitting you, Mister

54
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,320
My punch is hitting you

55
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,420
It's always that way

56
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,400
but somehow I never loose

57
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,050
Only once during middle school did I loose badly

58
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,000
Just in middle school huh?

59
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,850
Yea

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,970
Do you think I can win?

61
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,600
I guess you can

62
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,220
You just need courage

63
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,970
Basically

64
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,970
I don't have courage
Yea

65
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,150
I should just try, right?

66
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,970
Yea, that's right

67
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,420
Let's go shall we?

68
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,070
Where are you going?

69
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,650
Huh?

70
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,670
Where are you going now?

71
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,220
You're going to help someone?

72
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,220
I told you. I'm going home, my grandmother is coming

73
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,750
We're all going to eat at the buffet

74
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,370
Which star did you come from Mister?

75
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,370
I told you I can't tell you that!

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,020
Bye!

77
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,420
So he's Miracle Ace...

78
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,920
He still has a lot of secrets!

79
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,670
To be continued
