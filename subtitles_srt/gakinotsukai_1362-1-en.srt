Subbed by: Mei.ka~

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,450
A battle will determine who can stay calm no matter what happens.
This is the No-Reaction King Tournament.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,790
What a pathetic little voice!!

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:22,700
Endo

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:22,700
Hamada

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:22,700
Housei

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:22,700
Matoba

8
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:22,700
Matsu-
moto

9
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:22,700
Owada

10
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:22,700
Tanaka

11
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,130
The rule are as follows: 3 traps will be activated for each battle.

12
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,830
The winner will be the one who reacts the least.

13
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,700
The one who reigns victorious will be crowned the king.

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,440
Last time,
they kept on reacting to cleverly-set up traps!!

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,650
Zeebra is working up a sweat!!

16
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,650
So much sweat!

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,620
On the other hand...

18
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,930
There've also been strong contenders
who've shown little to no reaction.

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,800
And tonight, the no-reaction king will be crowned!!

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,400
And the weakest king will also be crowned!!

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,380
Housei

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,380
Matoba

23
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,380
Owada

24
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,350
It's time for the semifinals in the No-Reaction King Tournament!!

25
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,590
It's a battle between Zeebra and Housei, the only remaining regular.

26
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,330
Man, I really want Yama-chan to do good here.

27
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:32,140
They'll be checking on the match from a monitor in another room.

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,330
I hope so, too.

29
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,960
Yeah, me, too.

30
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,270
Yamasaki's the type to grow as a person while doing this.

31
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,630
Well, all we can do is hope.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,000
He is that kinda person.

33
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,140
That's just who he is.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,140
Hm, I don't really think that's true, but...

35
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,410
Battlefield

36
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,450
Let's go ahead and start the match!

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,150
Enter Challengers.

38
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,410
Man, he has to be outta tricks.

39
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,610
He can do it.

40
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,850
Right, right.

41
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:51,320
Neither of them know when and what traps will activate.

42
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,410
Ah, there are even more traps.

43
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,850
We've got some new stuff again.

44
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,880
They even have the drone!

45
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,880
Oh, there's more of them!

46
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,010
Man, there's a lot of stuff.

47
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,010
What's that?

48
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,510
So much stuff!

49
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,360
Will they be okay?

50
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,410
They look so uneasy!

51
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,550
They look so uneasy!

52
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,150
Get Into Position

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,030
And now it starts.

54
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,030
Yup, it's on.

55
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,130
S-somehow...

56
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:08,680
Giant Murakami

57
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:08,680
Ichiouka Genki

58
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:08,680
TN: They're from Yonemura Denjiro Science Production
which is a company that presents science in a fun way.

59
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:08,680
The Denjiro Army is on stand-by.

60
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,800
Well, that was sudden.

61
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Really.

62
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,240
I see.

63
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,910
Man, I'd hate this.

64
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,880
So the trap this time around is powerful CO2 gas.

65
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,740
Damn, it's gonna spray them real bad.

66
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,780
But it's not like this hasn't happened before.

67
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,920
They also can't hear the other members' voices.

68
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,920
I mean, Yamasaki probably has more experience, but...

69
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,650
Looks like he's balding.

70
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,010
Just a little bit.

71
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,010
What a bald head.

72
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,650
If only they were both balding.

73
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,820
I don't really know who loses here.

74
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,730
I don't really know who loses here.

75
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,980
Doesn't he look scary?

76
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,100
Seconds until the powerful CO2 gas is activated

77
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,280
Look at how solid their faces are!

78
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,350
Why do we have to wait so long?

79
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,610
They're lookin' good.

80
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,610
3

81
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,650
seconds

82
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,650
2

83
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,100
1

84
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,100
second

85
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,810
Whoa, it's still going!

86
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,680
Oh, he turned his head!

87
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,480
How are you supposed to factor that in?

88
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,480
Right?
That can't be allowed!

89
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,320
Turning your head can't be allowed.

90
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,580
He shouldn't be able to turn his head. No way.

91
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,580
Turning your head can't be allowed.

92
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,950
'Cause how're you gonna get good at variety?

93
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,650
That's true.

94
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,350
You just have to take it.

95
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,650
Wait

96
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,410
Hold on now...

97
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,410
He got sprayed so bad.

98
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,080
You know, just by this,

99
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,140
You have to consider how bad the trap's gonna be or you're screwed.

100
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,610
Ah true.

101
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,610
I see.

102
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,680
You have to consider how bad the trap's gonna be or you're screwed.

103
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,680
That's right.

104
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,050
That's true.
'Cause the drone from before...

105
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,050
That drone...

106
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:27,050
Get Into Position

107
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,980
Ah, that's a solid face right there.

108
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,410
Ah, but,

109
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,580
'Cause of the CO2,

110
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,110
He's been loosing a bit more hair than before.

111
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,750
He's been loosing a bit more hair than before.

112
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:34,580
Look.

113
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,750
Ah, that's true.

114
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,550
There really isn't anything that he can use.

115
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,510
His resources are limited.

116
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,010
Maybe he got a little too much blown in his face.

117
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,980
Now, the seconds trap is the drone.

118
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,980
Ah, it's time.

119
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,650
I'd hate to get the drone.

120
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,240
Owada-san,

121
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,480
Instead of getting surprised, you just laugh.

122
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,040
Instead of getting surprised, you just laugh.

123
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,780
That's true.

124
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,250
That's a nice face on Yama-chan.

125
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,550
Really solid.

126
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,550
Very nice.

127
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,010
I can kinda see Miyamoto Musashi in his face.

128
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,010
TN: Miyamoto Musashi was a famous swordsman.

129
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,980
You talk too much!

130
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,510
Really,

131
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,820
The glint in his eye is so sharp.

132
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,310
He looks solid!

133
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,260
The way he raises his eyebrows is the best!!

134
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,180
The way he raises his eyebrows is the best!!

135
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,780
They are up there!

136
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,880
Right?

137
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,450
Zeebra kinda...

138
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,080
He's been Tsuyoshi from Nakagawake this whole time.

139
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,010
He's been Tsuyoshi from Nakagawake this whole time.

140
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,010
TN: Nakagawawake is a comedy duo that consist of two brothers.

141
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,750
C'mon!

142
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,010
He really looks like him!

143
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,010
Ah, I see it.

144
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,310
It's just gonna start up, right?

145
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,180
See, there it is.

146
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,750
Oh, of course they'd get surprised.

147
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:33,020
Drone Operator
Celebrity Tani+1

148
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,450
I see.

149
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,450
For this, definitely.

150
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,450
I saw that reaction.

151
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,980
Yama-chan's reaction was bigger.

152
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,550
Definitely.

153
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,050
For sure.

154
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,410
It looks like what happened when I went,

155
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,050
But it's probably the same for them.

156
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,580
You think, "Why are they doing this to me?"
And you wanna look somewhere else.

157
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,650
His face is kinda...

158
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,650
Ah, that's right.

159
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,610
Right into his forehead.

160
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,180
That was amazing!!

161
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,010
Zeebra's just been sweating all over!!

162
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,010
All over!

163
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,080
The legendary sweat.

164
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,910
Now that's a minus.

165
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:00,910
Look!

166
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,850
That was definitely minus a point.

167
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,910
Yeah, minus one for Zeebra.

168
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,050
There it is.

169
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,380
Who knows what they're gonna do to Yama-chan.

170
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,450
But he's fine right now.

171
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,150
True.

172
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,830
He looks like plastic.

173
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,510
Seriously.

174
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,780
He's not moving!!

175
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,180
Not at all!

176
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,180
He's doing great!

177
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,610
But... It's not touching him.

178
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,080
Right.

179
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,450
Ah, there it is!

180
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,540
He totally just smiled!

181
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,810
You can't tell me he wasn't smiling!!

182
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,150
There it is.

183
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,650
Yama-chan kinda...

184
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,550
It keeps on poking him!

185
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,450
I knew it, he -

186
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,380
I knew it, he -

187
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,910
Ah, it's pulling his hair!

188
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,110
Smack dab in the middle.

189
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,210
3

190
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,210
seconds

191
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,850
Seconds until the secret joke

192
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,160
It can't get enough of him!

193
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,160
It loves him!

194
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,210
2

195
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,850
1

196
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,850
second

197
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,940
Blow to the seat

198
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,940
Housei-san!

199
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,880
Zeebra's amazing!

200
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,980
Both of his hands went up.

201
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,610
Wait

202
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,380
My hair just got eaten!!

203
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,520
My hair just got eaten!!

204
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,680
This is a nice fight.

205
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,680
Well, it feels like one loss nad one win.

206
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,230
1 more trap left

207
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,510
Hm, that's true.

208
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,510
Sounds about right.

209
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,510
Right?

210
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,080
Yeah, this is a good match.

211
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,080
Definitely.

212
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,750
On to the next one.

213
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,180
Get Into Position

214
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,180
But just now...

215
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,110
They can't let what just happened get to them.

216
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,110
That's right.

217
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,050
That's very important.

218
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,570
The intensity he had just now wasn't really there.

219
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,550
The intensity he had just now wasn't really there.

220
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,310
That's true.

221
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,110
So, the next trap is...

222
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,450
The Tesla coil.

223
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,780
Wait, what?

224
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,950
It's a high voltage generator.

225
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,210
That's kinda scary!

226
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,210
It's gonna come out like, "Bzz~!"

227
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,780
Just like, "Bzzz!"

228
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,150
Hm? He kinda looks focused.

229
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,150
Yeah.

230
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,450
He's gotten there.

231
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,450
Yeah, definitely better.

232
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,280
Nice!

233
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,980
Very nice, he's at MAX focus!!

234
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,080
He's ready!

235
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,080
Yup, for sure!

236
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,580
Seconds until the Tesla coil discharges

237
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,280
3

238
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,210
seconds

239
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,210
2

240
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,580
1

241
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,580
second

242
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,580
This would definitely be scary!

243
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,650
This is just straight-up scary!!

244
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,480
Seriously!

245
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,480
This is just straight-up scary!!

246
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,550
This is insane!

247
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,350
Like what was that?

248
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,280
I don't understand!!

249
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,490
End of No-Reaction

250
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,480
Man, that was amazing.

251
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,480
Please make your way to the monitoring room.

252
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,080
Aaah, what was that?

253
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,210
Ah, I was so scared!

254
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,680
Yeah, that was scary!

255
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,680
That was scary!!

256
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,910
That was really scary!

257
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:34,910
Right?

258
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,650
That was so scary!

259
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,880
Good jog out there!

260
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,980
The first half was really good.

261
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,980
Really, that was great.

262
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,850
I'm sorry, but like the drone...

263
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,410
The propeller ate my hair...

264
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,850
The propeller ate my hair...

265
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,350
Oh, right.

266
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,410
Nah, you should've expected that.

267
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,950
Well, I didn't!!

268
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,680
Let's play back the match in slow motion.

269
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,780
Both of you... Both of you moved!

270
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,780
That "errr" would be pretty scary.

271
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,280
That's how it ended up.

272
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,280
Ah, right.

273
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,750
The wind from the drone is just so sudden.

274
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,950
That was so lame.

275
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,480
This was...

276
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,510
It hit you pretty hard.

277
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,510
Yeah, it was so strong.

278
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,310
Just this part.

279
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,210
Definitely.

280
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,210
Right?

281
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,780
But Yama-chan did well here.

282
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,780
Very good.

283
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,180
He was just smiling!

284
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,850
He... He really...!

285
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,850
Yeah, you can see it right there!

286
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,650
This was just...

287
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,780
Oh, this part was pretty sketchy.

288
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,780
Yama-chan looks beaten up.

289
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,280
Oh, it's pulling him!

290
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,980
It's eating his hair!

291
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,850
It chased after him knowing he hates losing his hair!!

292
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,350
It chased after him knowing he hates losing his hair!!

293
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,150
Someone's losing his temper!

294
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,010
Just watch it!

295
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,310
He hates this so much!

296
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,550
This didn't last for just a "moment".

297
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,750
Zeebra's amazing!!

298
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,750
I don't see it.
He's too good!

299
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,160
These 3 producers will be judging to see who the winner is.

300
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,610
Was the winner Yama-chan of Zeebra?

301
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,850
Please present the verdict!

302
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,680
Blue, blue, blue.

303
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,110
Zeebra!

304
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,050
Congratulations!

305
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,810
At this stage, all the "Gaki" regulars have now been wiped out.

306
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,750
Right!

307
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,350
Matoba and Owada-san.

308
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,350
You know what I think?

309
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,980
That there's a point to this.

310
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,410
Which is?

311
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,810
That Owada-san has to lose!!

312
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,950
Coming up next!
Owada's persistent no-reaction!!

313
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,330
Round 2 in the semifinals:
Matoba Koji vs. Owada Shinya

314
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,600
Get Into Position

315
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,640
It's finally here.

316
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,310
Giant Murakami

317
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,310
Ichiouka Genki

318
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,310
The Denjiro Army is on stand-by.

319
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,010
So it's this one.

320
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,110
With these people, I don't even know what they're gonna take.

321
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,110
This...

322
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,650
That's right, who knows if there're gonna be decoys.

323
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,680
Right, very true.

324
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,620
Wait-

325
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,180
It looks like he's gonna cry.

326
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,650
His eye look like so girly.

327
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,650
It's off.

328
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,690
His face is completely off.

329
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,690
It's so off.
Yup.

330
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,290
It needs to be more intense!

331
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,290
He kinda... Yeah, it's kicked in now.

332
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,000
TN: Margaret is a shojo manga magazine

333
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,000
Those are the eyes you get when you read Margaret.

334
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,930
Definitely!

335
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,960
They look so gentle!

336
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,870
The first trap, the radio-controlled tank,
is about to be activated. However...

337
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,340
There'll be an explosion from the wall. So...

338
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,880
Can they keep up on not reaction?

339
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,950
They also can't hear the other members' voice.

340
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,310
They probably think the CO2's gonna hit them.

341
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,950
They're just waiting for the CO2.

342
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,020
So will it be the CO2? Or the tank?

343
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,530
The tank. If it was me,

344
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,630
I'd probably think it was the tank with the way it'd be facing me.

345
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,630
Yeah, yeah.
Ah, I see.

346
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,970
There's so many...

347
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,970
Right, there's so much to think about.

348
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,570
There're so many things.

349
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,570
Yeah.

350
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,040
So it'd have to be it if it was facing you

351
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,980
Wow!

352
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,690
Alright, we got Owada-san to flinch.

353
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,450
Matoba-kun is amazing.

354
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,220
He's so good!

355
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,220
Matoba-kun is amazing.

356
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,860
Wait

357
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,860
They handled that well.

358
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,130
I see...

359
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,260
So this is what they had in mind.

360
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,930
They were so focused before!

361
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,930
Right?

362
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,170
That one got me.

363
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,500
He says that, but he didn't move at all.

364
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,500
Not an inch.

365
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,370
That bald guy...

366
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,510
Why do you have to make fun of him!!

367
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,210
He looks like he's having a hard time.

368
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,370
Like you could just see electricity coming out of his head.

369
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,740
Stop making fun of him!

370
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,080
Like you could just see electricity coming out of his head.

371
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,480
He's in so much shock.

372
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,480
Let's make fun of him some more.

373
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,650
Stop that!

374
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,080
Then the least you could do is close up on the bald guy!!

375
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,350
Then the least you could do is close up on the bald guy!!

376
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,160
What a scene!!

377
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,790
Get Into Position

378
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,460
Will the CO2 ever come?

379
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,900
But those people are still there.

380
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,070
Right.

381
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,900
That's true.

382
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,270
With that said, the next trap is the powerful CO2 gas.

383
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,010
So Owada-san's been uncle-hunted 3 times, huh.

384
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,010
He's a victim of uncle-hunting.

385
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,550
And he still took it 2, 3 times.

386
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,920
And he still took it 2, 3 times.

387
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,390
Just stop talking!

388
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,890
Seconds until the powerful CO2 gas is activated

389
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,390
3

390
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,390
seconds

391
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,390
2

392
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,890
1

393
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,890
second

394
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,140
Just wait...!

395
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,050
Wait - he didn't react, though.

396
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,050
Yeah, he didn't.

397
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,620
That was a great fight, wasn't it?

398
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,620
It was good!

399
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,620
It was amazing!

400
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,620
So good!

401
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,590
For a second, he looked like Kitaouji Kinya...

402
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:02,760
For a second, he looked like Kitaouji Kinya...

403
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:02,760
TN: Kitaouji Kinya is an actor.

404
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,760
Definitely, I can see it.

405
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,600
Theory: When you spray Owada Shinya with CO2 gas,
he turns into Kitaouji Kinya.

406
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,430
TN: Probably in reference to their other show, Suiyoubi no Downtown,
in which they prove or disprove various theories.

407
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,430
Theory: When you spray Owada Shinya with CO2 gas,
he turns into Kitaouji Kinya.

408
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,430
... He turns into him!

409
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,600
Both have been persistent in not reacting.

410
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,040
Even with the Tesla coil as the last trap...

411
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,690
With barely any kind of reaction, this has turned into a great match.

412
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,860
That's amazing!

413
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,060
That was incredible...

414
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,060
The deciding factor for the match
was the reaction to the wall explosion.

415
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,070
Owada-san kinda...

416
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,600
Yeah, he kinda...

417
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,970
You could see his shoulders go up.

418
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,710
Matoba was able to show off his strength
and has moved onto the finals.

419
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,680
He was a tough opponent.

420
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,050
He was amazing!

421
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,050
Thank you very much!

422
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,910
What were you thinking about back there?

423
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,520
Hm?

424
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,680
Did you just lose yourself?

425
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,150
Yeah.

426
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,480
Were you thinking of other stuff?

427
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,820
No, I just stared straight ahead, yeah.

428
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,220
Sorry, but we can't use this footage.

429
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,360
Sorry, but we can't use this footage.

430
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:14,470
At last, it's time for the finals.
This is where we'll crown our no-reaction king.

431
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:20,640
Enter Challengers

432
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,670
I hope they fight it out.

433
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,670
Same here.

434
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,640
This is gonna be a good match.

435
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Yeah.

436
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,370
They did make it this far, so...

437
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,840
They should fare well.
Right.

438
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,510
With the way things have been going,
I think Matoba-kun has the upper hand.

439
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,550
With the way things have been going,
I think Matoba-kun has the upper hand.

440
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,550
Yeah, I think he should do well.

441
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,290
Get Into Position

442
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,820
So...

443
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,260
They've gone on standby...

444
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,860
It looks like he's staring at the baldness.

445
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,560
Really.

446
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,700
The bald part.

447
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,230
It looks like he's thinking, "He sure is balding, huh."

448
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,100
Like, "This old man's so bald."

449
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,740
I don't need that image in my head when he looks so serious.

450
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,140
I don't need that image in my head when he looks so serious.

451
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,910
Now, the next trap is Ijiri.

452
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:00,810
TN: Ijiri is a comedian and impressionist.

453
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,810
Pay attention to how he makes his entrance.

454
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,920
It looks like the make-up artist made him really shiny.

455
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:09,450
Seconds until Ijiri Okada appears

456
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,950
3

457
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
seconds

458
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,950
2

459
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,450
second

460
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,450
1

461
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,230
Someone moved there!

462
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,870
Yeah, Zeebra-san moved a little.

463
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,870
That's amazing.

464
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,970
Zeebra definitely moved.

465
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,740
Yeah, he did move.

466
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,110
Matoba didn't move at all.

467
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,110
Matoba-san's a strong contender.

468
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,110
Matoba-san's amazing!

469
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,580
Wait

470
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,510
Who's gonna win?

471
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,950
That hurt so bad!!

472
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,950
Wait, did he get hurt?

473
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,320
It went straight for him.

474
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,920
It hit him!

475
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,660
The fight between these two challengers is on a whole other level.

476
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:51,830
Although Matoba said he got hurt,
he showed no sign of a reaction. Which means...

477
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,500
When the next one starts,

478
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,570
What if you just hit 'em with a bang after the drum part?

479
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,040
Right.

480
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,040
'Cause they're thinking that they're gonna have to wait.

481
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,210
With a suggestion from Matsumoto, as soon as they
get into position, they'll be hit with flash cotton.

482
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,950
How will the two of them react!?

483
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,380
Get into position.

484
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,570
Of course that'd happen!

485
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,570
But Matoba-san's amazing!

486
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,570
Really!

487
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,640
Ah, Zeebra-san.

488
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,510
Zeebra fell right into the trap!

489
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,080
It got him!

490
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,310
Wait

491
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Well, that was fast!

492
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,810
What twas that just now?!

493
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,750
Caught me off guard.

494
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,620
Me, too.

495
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,290
Matoba's such a strong opponent.

496
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,020
He's so strong!

497
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,620
Even to something like this.

498
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,620
Didn't even react to it.

499
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,120
It's amazing how he didn't react to it.

500
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:59,460
Once again, they'll be sprayed with powerful
CO2 gas once they get into position.

501
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,530
How will they fare this time?

502
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,740
Get into position.

503
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,720
That was amazing!

504
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,720
There was so much gas!

505
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,190
Well, that didn't go so well.

506
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,460
That was amazing!

507
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,360
His face hasn't even changed.

508
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,360
That's amazing.

509
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,530
Aw man...

510
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,460
That's incredible.

511
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,670
He's the best in Japan!!

512
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,140
Matoba is just too strong...

513
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,240
Usually, it'd end here, but the match isn't over, yet.

514
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,480
The drone will start up and aim for Matoba
in the hopes that we'll get a reaction from him.

515
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,460
This one, huh?

516
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,830
Drone Operator
Celebrity Tani+1.

517
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,460
He jumped a little there.

518
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,030
Not that one!

519
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,030
The wind comes in just like that.

520
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,730
Just smash into Matoba!!

521
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,030
Let's hope it does.

522
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,240
It went to his eye!

523
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,870
This is amazing!

524
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,240
It's comin' for him!

525
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,540
This guy's incredible!

526
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,880
He's too good!

527
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,880
This guy's seriously amazing!

528
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,960
How does he do it?

529
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,960
Right?

530
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,890
This is amazing!

531
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,090
It's been on Matoba for so long now!

532
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,190
Leave it to him to let his "Matoba juices" pour out.

533
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,860
Leave it to him to let his "Matoba juices" pour out.

534
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,860
Definitely.

535
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,330
He kinda...

536
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,070
His head is channeling "Ashita no Joe" right now

537
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,070
TN: Ashita no Joe is a boxing manga. Matsumoto's probably
referring to how Matoba's hair curls like the protagonist's.

538
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,440
Seconds until the secret joke

539
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,470
Now...

540
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,870
3

541
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,840
seconds

542
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,870
2

543
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,440
second

544
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,440
1

545
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,680
Well, Zeebra kinda moved a little bit.

546
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,890
Cans drop

547
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,680
He did move.

548
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,020
He couldn't have won.

549
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,460
Wait, what?!

550
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,260
That was amazing.

551
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,690
End of No-Reaction

552
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,790
It was all over me!

553
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,660
Please make your way to the monitoring room.

554
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,660
Did you hear him?!

555
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,300
Man, that was just...

556
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,300
That drone was a pain in the ass!!

557
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,670
I wanted to break it so bad!!

558
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,240
Incredible!

559
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,240
Just what I expected!

560
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,270
That's Matoba for you!

561
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,640
They don't mess around!

562
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,370
I think it's clear that you won!!

563
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,370
You definitely won!

564
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,070
It's just that Zeebra's weaknesses came through.

565
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,480
It's just that Zeebra's weaknesses came through.

566
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,480
Yeah.

567
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,410
I'm exhausted...

568
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,350
You're so quiet!

569
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,350
Of course, the result is...

570
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,950
Red, red, red. Matoba Koji!

571
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,950
Thanks!

572
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,960
Thank you!

573
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,860
The very first!

574
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,160
The first no-reaction king is Matoba Koji-san!

575
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,360
I got it! Thank you!

576
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,970
Matsumoto-san, you thought you could seriously take him down.

577
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,970
Right.

578
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,370
I do think that.

579
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,270
Now you have to.

580
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,010
I'd have to or else.

581
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,010
But there's no way.

582
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,310
Yup.

583
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,210
I've been learning a lot from Hamada-san,

584
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,640
And now I've surpassed him and won!!

585
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,640
What the hell are you talking about?

586
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,810
What are you talking about?!

587
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,450
He was too weak for you.

588
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,450
Yeah, definitely.

589
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,850
He's very weak.

590
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,320
So...

591
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,920
The weakest...

592
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:09,890
Huh?

593
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,020
Should we get on to crowning the weakest now?

594
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,690
If we're talking about the weakest...

595
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,690
Then go ahead.

596
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,630
No way.

597
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,730
Hamada-san and Tanaka-san.

598
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,430
Hamada-san and Tanaka-san.

599
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,430
What the hell?!

600
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,360
Sounds good.

601
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,800
No no no,

602
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,900
I swear I'm gonna win!!

603
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,100
Yeah, but...

604
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,800
I'm sorry, but I swear I will!

605
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,170
I mean, it'll be close, but...
What?

606
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,170
Well then...

607
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,570
It has to be perfect.

608
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,440
If it's gonna be like that, then I don't even care anymore!!

609
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,850
Coming up next!
A battle to find the weakest no-reaction king!!

610
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:46,290
Who will be the weakest no-reaction king?
Tanaka Naoki vs. Hamada Masatoshi

611
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,290
I see...

612
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,390
But they look so weak.

613
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,390
They really do.

614
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,030
What the hell is up with them?

615
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,030
I kinda understand, though.

616
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,130
Seriously.
right?

617
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,270
Not a good start for him already.

618
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,370
He's already scared.

619
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,200
Yeah, he's not ready.

620
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,170
Get Into Position

621
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,170
So, this where they start.

622
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,580
What kinda nerves do they have?

623
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,580
What the hell is that? I've had it with this guy.

624
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,480
Seriously.

625
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,980
What's with his face?

626
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
What is that face?
It kinda looks off.

627
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,780
What? That face...

628
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,020
What the... This guy pisses me off!!

629
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,590
Why's his face like that?

630
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,450
He's acting all cute!

631
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,860
He's just like a little girl!

632
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,860
Yeah, seriously...

633
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,960
This isn't what we talked about!! I hate this guy!

634
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,770
Two curveball jokes have been set up in
this match to find the weakest king.

635
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,370
So what kind of reactions will they show us!?

636
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:42,780
Seconds until the Tesla coil discharges

637
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,510
3

638
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,450
seconds

639
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,450
2

640
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,750
1

641
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,750
second

642
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,490
Whoa~

643
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,060
Did it shock him?

644
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,830
He was like, "Whoa~."
He went, "Whoa~"

645
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,900
Whoa

646
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,900
That was full out!!

647
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,970
Full out!!

648
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,620
Man, that only lasted for, like, 2 minutes, but I could laugh forever.

649
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,620
Man, that only lasted for, like, 2 minutes, but I could laugh forever.

650
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,620
That was unbelievable.

651
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,250
I wanna take this home with me!

652
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,620
Wait.

653
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,750
That was a full out reaction!

654
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,060
You always have something comin' outta your mouth!!

655
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,060
My apologies.

656
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,160
You were just like, "No!".

657
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,460
Did I?

658
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,670
You did! You went, "No!" like an idiot!

659
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,110
Get Into Position

660
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,640
My heat can't take anymore.

661
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,110
He's in bad shape.

662
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,110
I hate this!

663
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,480
I don't know what face he's trying to make.

664
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,550
What's with the look on his face?

665
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,080
I don't get him.

666
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,020
What d'you think of his face, Matsumoto-san?

667
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,020
I don't get it.

668
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,280
He's so scary, he's turning into a girl!!

669
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,320
He's so scary, he's turning into a girl!!

670
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,190
It's different.

671
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,320
It's like if a girl had a kid, and then that kid had a kid.

672
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,690
Ah, I see.

673
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,020
It's like if a girl had a kid, and then that kid had a kid.

674
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,460
I can see that.

675
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:09,400
Seconds until Ijiri Okada appears

676
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,230
This pisses me off.

677
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,400
He must be having a hard time.

678
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,130
Probably...

679
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,130
3

680
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,070
seconds

681
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,070
2

682
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,400
1

683
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,400
second

684
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,370
Whoa!

685
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,300
Whaa

686
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,300
Who!

687
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,010
Whaaa~

688
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,970
Whoa!

689
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,180
Alright, alright!

690
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,110
"WOW!".

691
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,980
That was just a normal reaction.

692
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,080
They were like, "WOW!".

693
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,380
He's...!

694
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,120
I'd hate this.

695
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,620
He's not even surprised by this.

696
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,290
What is this?

697
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,930
3

698
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,860
seconds

699
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,130
Seconds until the secret joke

700
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,860
2

701
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,690
Both of them were hilarious, though.

702
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,130
1

703
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,130
second

704
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,360
Right?

705
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,600
Right?

706
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,830
Right?

707
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,270
This is great!

708
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,270
Both of them were so weak.

709
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,270
Isn't this great?!

710
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,210
There ya have it!

711
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,080
Right, right!
That was the weakest king match!

712
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,580
Thank you for being here, everyone!

713
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,580
Thank you!

714
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,920
See you next week!

715
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,720
He's still scared.
