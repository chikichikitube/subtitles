00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,590
Backstage of Gaki no Tsukai

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,030
Hello.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,020
Hello.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,370
Hello.

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,800
Hello.

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,540
Hello.

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,430
Can you tell I'm slightly smiling?

11
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,770
Can you tell I'm slightly smiling?

12
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,300
Yes, I can see your teeth.

13
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,730
Hahaha

14
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,600
... the white of your teeth.

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,120
Ok.

16
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,160
So, I don't need to tell you, then.  You know this, right?

17
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,540
Remember, we did this?

18
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:27,940
This whole thing?

19
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,080
He came to me.

20
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,310
He came crying to me.

21
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,610
He came crying to me.

22
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,140
Again?

23
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,550
The dream that Matsumoto envisioned was...!?

24
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,540
After the high jump from last month,

25
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,540
Matsumoto has now set his sights on

26
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,550
The Vault

27
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,860
The vault.

28
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,760
An extremely high-level skill where you flip

29
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,760
twice with your legs tucked in!!

30
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:43,990
And within vaulting,Part 2

31
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,990
said to be the most difficult skill,

32
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,400
is where you tuck your legs in while in the airPart 2

33
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:46,990
An extremely high-level skill where you flip

34
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:46,990
twice with your legs tucked in!!

35
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,560
Forward handspring with double front salto tucked

36
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,420
and flip twice:

37
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,500
The forward handspring with double front salto tucked.

38
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,690
The forward handspring with double front salto tucked.

39
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,560
The forward handspring with double front salto tucked.

40
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,100
If you do two flips well enough, you supposedly get a perfect 10.

41
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,220
If you do two flips well enough, you supposedly get a perfect 10.

42
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,680
I see.

43
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,640
Oh.

44
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,990
I see.

45
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,080
But there's no way he'll be satisfied with that.

46
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,910
3 flips is what he wants.

47
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,330
No way.

48
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,080
No.

49
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,040
There's no way.

50
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,330
You think so, too, right, Hamada?

51
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,840
What's the point for you to say "no way," "no way" before we've even tried?

52
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,880
We'll give it what we got, but

53
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,460
if Matsumoto himself

54
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,010
is all like this, like he was before

55
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,390
he won't be able to do any flips.

56
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,630
He literally puts nothing into his muscles.

57
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,700
Seriously.

58
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,160
I mean.

59
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,560
Don't worry.  He himself brought this all up so he'll do it.

60
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,700
Really?

61
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,250
Hmm.

62
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,270
Don't worry.  Let's just give him 3 flips, all right?

63
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,370
He was crying.

64
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,320
Why would he cry?

65
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,510
He cries so easily

66
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,810
for some reason.

67
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,360
Lately, he cries really easily.

68
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,480
Yeah.

69
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,850
When you get to a certain age, you cry.

70
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,510
When you get to a certain age, you cry.

71
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,620
He's not that old.

72
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,520
To dream, again.

73
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,890
*Kuroko is a traditional Japanese theatre stagehand.  Kurokos wear all black to imply to the theatre audience that they are supposed to be invisible and not part of the onstage action.

74
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,890
Four kurokos* rise to the occasion.

75
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,460
For a Perfect 10 on the Vault!!

76
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,460
Matsumoto Hitoshi Goes

77
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,460
Triple Salto

78
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,460
Unprecedented

79
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,120
Unprecedented

80
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,830
Matsumoto Hitoshi goes for a perfect 10 on the vault!

81
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,400
But my question is, why the vault after the high jump?

82
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,700
Yeah, why is that?

83
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,780
He's here.

84
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,100
Hello.

85
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,800
We're ready.

86
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,090
Uh huh.

87
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,040
So, why? Right?

88
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,980
So, why? Right?

89
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,040
So, why? Right?

90
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,410
Umm, what? Why the vault?

91
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,380
Umm, what? Why the vault?

92
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,710
Umm, what? Why the vault?

93
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
You might be wondering.

94
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,560
Umm.

95
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,370
I've been

96
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,410
in show business

97
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,120
for 18 years

98
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,470
as a horse face bit, this whole way.

99
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,400
as a horse face bit, this whole way.

100
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
as a horse face bit, this whole way.

101
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,510
To be a horse face and not be able to do the vault

102
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,670
To be a horse face and not be able to do the vault

103
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,240
To be a horse face and not be able to do the vault

104
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,050
Then it's hard for my juniors to call me a horse face.

105
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,980
Then it's hard for my juniors to call me a horse face.

106
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,650
Then it's hard for my juniors to call me a horse face.

107
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,780
It's hard to say that and I also don't know he's talking about.

108
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,770
Huh?Part 2

109
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,670
Huh?  You get what he's saying.

110
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,800
I don't get it, I'm sorry.

111
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,260
Is he a horse face?

112
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,860
He's a horse face.

113
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,900
So,

114
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,860
this is why I want to try 3 flips.

115
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,000
this is why I want to try 3 flips.

116
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,810
Because it's unprecedented.

117
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,140
Yup.

118
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,810
Because no one has done it before.

119
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,700
Did you just say, "Because no one has done it before?"

120
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,560
Right, because no one has done it before.

121
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,200
Well, in any case.

122
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,020
Yeah.

123
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm counting on you.

124
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,600
Yes, definitely, we're ready.

125
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,450
Yes, definitely, we're ready.

126
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,520
Good luck.

127
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,480
Yes, definitely, we're ready.

128
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,160
With dignity.

129
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:32,810
With dignity.

130
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,550
Ok, we're ready?

131
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,160
Ok.

132
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,410
No problem.

133
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,460
Let's do it.

134
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,830
Do it properly.

135
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,890
Put some spirit into it.

136
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,540
Put some spirit into it.

137
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,360
Let's get this right in one try.

138
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,520
Let's get this right in one try.

139
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,320
Wait, wait.

140
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,760
Huh?

141
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,420
Then I'll go here.

142
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,880
I'll be behind.

143
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,240
Hey, you get there, quickly.

144
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,610
Hey, you get there, quickly.

145
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,270
Hey, you get there, quickly.

146
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:48,800
Hey, you get there, quickly.

147
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,420
Let's, go.

148
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,380
Ok.

149
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,910
Get his feet, his feet, on the ground.

150
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,440
Get his feet, his feet, on the ground.

151
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Get his feet, his feet, on the ground.

152
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,540
Endo!

153
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,320
Got it.

154
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,760
Ok.

155
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,530
Ok, ok.

156
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,220
Come on.

157
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,140
Come on.

158
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,170
No, no, no.

159
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,680
Forward, forward.

160
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,680
To the front, the front.

161
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,780
Come on.

162
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,960
Higher, higher.

163
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,650
Don't hit his neck.

164
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,660
Not hitting his neck.

165
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,210
Ok, good.

166
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,920
Good.

167
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,580
Just like that.

168
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,120
Tuck his legs in.

169
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,250
Ready and

170
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,860
Go.

171
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,320
That was good.

172
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,620
Wait.

173
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,530
Wait.

174
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,850
I got smacked.

175
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,300
Yes, you did.

176
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,460
Are you ok?

177
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,520
Why is he angry?

178
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,100
I don't get it.

179
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,430
He flipped, didn't he?

180
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,310
Yes, he flipped.

181
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,110
He was turning.

182
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,090
Was it because it was just 1?

183
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,360
Oh yeah, it was 1.

184
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,460
Yes, he was saying 3.

185
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,060
Geez.

186
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,990
Are you ok?

187
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,980
He hit you.

188
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,070
The four go back to talk to Matsumoto

189
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,080
Matsumoto had returned backstage and was playing fukuwarai*

190
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
*Fukuwarai is a Japanese game in which a person is blindfolded and then places pieces of facial features on to a board with a blank face, creating a humorous-looking face in the end.

191
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,640
Matsumoto.

192
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,780
What?

193
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,130
Well, yeah

194
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,000
you did say 3 flips, and that was

195
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,140
1 flip.

196
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,110
If you can't do it, just say you can't do it.

197
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,830
What was with you all, acting as if you could do it and looking all confident?

198
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,130
What was "vault" about that, huh?

199
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,900
What was "vault" about that? Think about that.

200
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,750
Every one of you.

201
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,940
Every one of you, think 80% of that.

202
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,860
All right?

203
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,900
If you can't do it, then you can't do it!

204
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,650
I want to jump!

205
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,530
You know?

206
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,770
You have to do it right.

207
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,700
Tell these guys.

208
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,600
Let's do it right.

209
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,750
Matsumoto's Second Attempt!

210
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,750
Matsumoto's second attempt.

211
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,130
No, no, no.

212
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,430
It's the other way.

213
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,490
We have to turn him around.

214
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,930
Get his feet to hit the ground.

215
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,570
Hit the ground.

216
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,530
Ok, got it.

217
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,300
Got it.

218
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,760
Ok.

219
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,380
Up, up, up.

220
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,980
Yamazaki, that's you.

221
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,490
Here we go.

222
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,950
Here we go.

223
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,180
Here we go.

224
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,480
Ok.

225
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,460
Looks good.

226
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,100
Got it, got it.

227
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,430
Ok, raise it.

228
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,780
Higher, Endo.

229
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,440
Yeah.

230
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,040
A little more.

231
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,590
He's looking.  He's looking this way.

232
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,060
He's looking.  He's looking this way.

233
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,140
Hurry up, he's looking.

234
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,730
He's really staring.

235
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,470
It didn't work.

236
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,520
The next...

237
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,930
The next...

238
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,020
Let's go to the next one.

239
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,960
Oh, oh, there.

240
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,780
Let's go to the next one.

241
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,480
It's that.

242
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,480
Don't worry, the next one will be fine.

243
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,770
From here, please.

244
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,630
We were kind of thinking that one might not work, right?

245
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,150
His legs!

246
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,980
Got his legs.

247
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,680
Ready and

248
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,270
Ready and

249
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,440
Ok.

250
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,690
Should we make it touch the ground?

251
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,740
Hold him up.

252
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,140
Ready and

253
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,140
Ready and

254
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,140
Ready and

255
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,840
There.

256
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,470
Ok.

257
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,150
Ready and

258
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,320
Get that side.

259
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,230
It's good.

260
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,490
Yes, it's good.

261
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,420
Flip him.

262
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,370
3 flips, ok?

263
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,230
1...

264
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,480
2...

265
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,100
Go.

266
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,000
Ready and

267
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,930
Ready and

268
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,260
There.

269
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,700
He's going back.

270
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,240
His face was completely red.

271
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,840
His face was completely red.

272
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,680
The four go back to talk to Matsumoto again

273
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,680
Matsumoto was peeling a daikon radish

274
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,360
We were talking and

275
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,090
thinking we mixed up the vertical and the horizontal

276
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,860
thinking we mixed up the vertical and the horizontal

277
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,100
of the flips.

278
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,340
This is not the sort of thing that 3 juniors

279
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:50,310
This is not the sort of thing that 3 juniors

280
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,310
and a duo partner does to someone.

281
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,710
I got hurt.

282
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,250
It hurt like hell!

283
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,000
It hurts if you're thrown in that kind of position.

284
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,600
But seriously,

285
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,270
we mixed up the vertical and the horizontal

286
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,770
so we got it now, right?

287
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,320
Yes.

288
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,760
You "mixed up the vertical and the horizontal?"  What kind of mix up is that?

289
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,270
Who the hell mixes up

290
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,340
Who the hell mixes up

291
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,340
the vertical and the horizontal?

292
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,180
It's pitiful.

293
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,980
Excuse us.

294
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,690
Matsumoto's 3rd Attempt!

295
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,690
Matsumoto's 3rd attempt.

296
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,480
Hurry up.

297
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,420
Lay him down.

298
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,030
Lay him down.

299
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,590
Ok, send it in.

300
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,470
This way.

301
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,720
Fast forwarding

302
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,040
Raise it.

303
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,990
Yes, please.

304
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,300
Turn it this way.

305
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,180
Yes, please.

306
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,930
Above, here.

307
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,500
Above, here.

308
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,360
Good.

309
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,530
Yes, yes.

310
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,040
Good, good.

311
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,600
Yes, yes.

312
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,220
Ok.

313
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,340
Back, a bit.

314
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,940
Back just a bit.

315
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Raise it.

316
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,110
Raise it.

317
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,690
A bit more.

318
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,430
Back a bit more.

319
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,900
Back.

320
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,180
Ok, stop, stop.

321
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,580
Stop.

322
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,230
All right.

323
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,600
All right.

324
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,610
Ok.

325
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,020
All right.

326
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,630
Ok, here we go.

327
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,520
Good.

328
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,680
Ready to go.

329
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,500
Looks good.

330
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,560
Lower it a little bit.

331
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,770
Ok, good, lower it.

332
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,290
Ok, get it out of the way.

333
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,900
Back, back.

334
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,590
Whoa, whoa.

335
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,600
Good.

336
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,410
3 flips.

337
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,410
Here we go.

338
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,600
3 flips.

339
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,320
Turn him.  Go, go.

340
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,520
No, no, I can't.

341
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,520
Almost got it, almost got it.

342
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,770
Tanaka, come on.

343
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,690
Gee, he was heavy.

344
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,540
He's really staring at me.  I don't know why.

345
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,240
Hamada, don't...

346
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,130
After he was laid down and put on

347
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,460
After he was laid down and put on

348
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,460
the forklift

349
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,260
He was staring at me the whole time.

350
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,200
He was staring at me the whole time.

351
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,370
The four go back to talk to Matsumoto again

352
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,360
Wait, wait, wait.

353
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,730
Wait, wait.

354
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,450
Please, wait.

355
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,920
We're right now

356
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,320
It's dirty.

357
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,060
It stinks.

358
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,430
What is that?

359
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,390
Matsumoto was changing his underwear,

360
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,390
which had poop on it

361
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,590
No, seriously, wait.

362
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,820
If you could just put a bit more effort into it

363
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,440
then we could

364
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,530
I am putting in effort.

365
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,840
You're not putting any effort into it.  You just let your body go totally loose.

366
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,940
I agree completely with what Yamazaki said.

367
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

368
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,940
Hold on

369
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,170
Don't trash my reputation saying things like that.

370
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,740
Think about me.

371
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,070
I'm thinking, "What the hell are they going to do to me this time?"

372
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,640
I'm thinking, "What the hell are they going to do to me this time?"

373
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,680
I'm thinking, "What the hell are they going to do to me this time?"

374
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,540
Just equipment after equipment.

375
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,450
Just equipment after equipment.

376
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,550
The time in the air is way too long.

377
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,680
