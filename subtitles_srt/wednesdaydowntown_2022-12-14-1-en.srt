1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,180
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,960
Let's get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,740
Who is it?

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,400
It's Ozwald

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,670
It's a shame about M-1.
-Don't do that

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,480
How unlucky

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,940
The qualifiers have not yet competed

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,060
Think about your position before you speak

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,280
It will have an impact

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,220
Anyway, this is the second edition of a previously tested theory

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,890
It is this

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,420
The 2nd As long as you say something bad in a positive way, a person won't lose their temper

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,280
This is interesting

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,200
The last validation results were very successful

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,270
Very successful

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,970
None of them lost their temper

17
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,070
Kowagata was clearly on the verge of fury

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,210
How would everyone else react?

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,380
It also depends on who it is, right?

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,780
What is it like? Can you show us?

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,610
Me? Okay

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,050
Say something to Hamada

23
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,510
Hamada, you've become an old man, but in a good way

24
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,860
Its positive

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,570
That's too mild

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,530
It's not easy to get angry when you say it's positive

27
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,390
I admire him

28
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,860
It's a bit subtle

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,830
The first person to make bad comments is...

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,280
Minamikawa

31
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,920
Mr. Bad Words

32
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,780
His target is

33
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,300
Not good
-It's a little dangerous

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,260
Panzetta Girolamo

35
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,100
Girolamo

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,990
He'll be beaten up, right?

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:06,740
Didn't he come close... to straight up hitting someone on this show?

38
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,860
Already scared

39
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,090
Really super scary

40
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,090
A famous quote now

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,350
Why are you fighting?

42
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,980
Shut up!

43
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,320
Who, me?

44
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,890
You've ruined the image of Italians in the minds of Japanese people!

45
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,590
Do you wanna smack?

46
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,320
Super quick

47
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,430
"Do you wanna smack?"

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,500
This time, Girolamo is told to wait for a fake show

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,210
3 bad "positive" lines have been prepared in advance

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,650
The first is

51
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,010
Tawdry

52
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,780
He's not really tawdry

53
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,320
This is sure to piss him off

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,720
I don't know what the tipping point is, though

55
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,160
This would be... weird, right?

56
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,430
Can bad words be invalidated by saying them positively?

57
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,190
I really need to ask for more advice today

58
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,000
You wife is angry?

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,470
You know?

60
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,810
Everyone's talking about it

61
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,740
My wife? Please don't do that

62
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,310
No no

63
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,450
You are always very positive

64
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,450
Is there a time when you are not so energetic?

65
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,410
Down?

66
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,890
Is it possible for you to get depressed?

67
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,260
Not really

68
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,890
Everyone has their bad days

69
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,090
But I can get back to normal pretty quickly

70
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,060
Ah, a quick recovery

71
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,070
But overall your mood is very high

72
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,770
High but also calm

73
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,670
Ah, so a positive tawdriness

74
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,200
Tawdry?

75
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,740
Well, it's actually positive

76
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,180
Immediately caught on

77
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,480
Scary!

78
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,080
Especially positive

79
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,280
Me?
-I mean...

80
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,780
You get along well with everyone around you

81
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,720
You seem to get along well with everyone

82
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,790
But that's not the right word to use, is it? Tawdry?

83
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,420
No, no, that...

84
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,590
Don't they say that in Italy?

85
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,960
The popular type

86
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,270
Oh... right
-Yes, yes, yes.

87
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,870
I think being positively tawdry is good

88
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,770
I still think your Japanese is wrong

89
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,170
No, no, really

90
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,540
It's positive!

91
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,110
Tawdry in a positive sense...

92
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,120
Although being slightly concerned about the use of "tawdry"

93
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,840
He's not technically angry, so this is deemed a pass

94
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,980
The second is

95
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,900
Lame clothes

96
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,070
No, no, no, no

97
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,070
This is what he makes his living on, right?

98
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,340
This sentence is something that will hurt his pride the most, right?

99
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,640
And the words just now are still fresh in the mind

100
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,080
You have a lot of clothes, right?

101
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,980
I have a lot, but I also give a lot away

102
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,380
You often see this type of pattern right?

103
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,120
This style is quite common

104
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,420
I've always liked this type

105
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,540
Your clothes are really lame in a good way

106
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,960
Huh?

107
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,430
No one's perfect, right?

108
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,470
Every man will be teased at some point

109
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,340
Oh, maybe...

110
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,720
Not in a good mood anymore

111
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,020
Not good

112
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,980
Can't stop!

113
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,110
Finally quiet

114
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,480
Am I talking too much?

115
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,620
No, I love to talk too

116
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,790
Especially when waiting

117
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,960
It's easy to talk to friendly people

118
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,530
But its the first time we've met

119
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,390
So I don't have that much to say

120
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,400
It's quite rare

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,170
As he says "this is the first time we've met"

122
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,240
Girolamo's anger is beginning to seep out

123
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,110
In light of the dangerous atmosphere

124
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,810
Minamikawa retreats momentarily

125
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,120
So annoying

126
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Holding back

127
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,400
He's already angry, right?

128
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,380
Angry

129
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,230
Just us two?

130
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,400
Yeah, you two
-Ah

131
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,330
He's a weird guy

132
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,100
Kind of want to punch him

133
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,270
There we go!

134
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,980
Straight to the point

135
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,820
Ultimately, he returns to Girolamo, who can't wait to get his hands on him

136
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,900
To deliver the final blow

137
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,550
Scary

138
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,330
I don't dare to watch

139
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,420
How often do you return to Italy?

140
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,030
Before covid I went back all the time

141
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,830
I haven't got back since it started

142
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,730
But I finally went back to Italy in July this year

143
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,970
Although still because of work

144
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,970
You have a lot of friends back in Italy, right?

145
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,370
Of course, but there is no way to see everyone

146
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,670
Are you waiting to hit someone?

147
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,680
Can't see them all

148
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,750
It's like I thought, Girolamo

149
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,850
Don't say it

150
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,520
You've not gone back at all

151
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,750
Me?
-Yeah

152
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,550
Because...

153
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:30,530
Italy is ashamed of you, in a good way

154
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,070
The news?

155
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,940
What?
-What do you mean, Italy what?

156
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,570
It's a good thing

157
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,240
Me?
-For Italy

158
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,440
They want me out?

159
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,780
But in a positive sense

160
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,380
That's why...

161
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,220
How to say

162
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,190
Your efforts in Japan have made you lose support

163
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,860
Why do you think so?

164
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,360
That is to say

165
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,310
This is simply getting angry

166
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,600
Your... persona and so on

167
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,500
This would make you angry

168
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,730
I haven't been banned from the country

169
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,600
I was actually awarded a medal by the government

170
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,270
As a compliment
-The president gave it to me

171
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,710
From the president? That's impressive

172
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,140
Have you ever been beaten up before?

173
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,950
Eh, what?

174
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,820
What a question to ask...

175
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,830
Before he strikes, the truth is revealed here

176
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,830
Can this be considered a success?

177
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,060
We are Wednesday Downtown

178
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,700
Ah...

179
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,370
Did you notice anything strange?

180
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,070
Him, right?

181
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,820
I may have reacted if he said anything more

182
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,270
Beat-beat-beat me up?
-I wouldn't beat you up

183
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,880
I might just kick off, though

184
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,070
What a joke!

185
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,020
The next challenger is

186
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,750
Onigoe Tomahawk's Sakai

187
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,440
His target is

188
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,970
Actress Tono Nagiko

189
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,730
Have you worked together?
-No

190
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,730
Recently, it seems that she is a regular commentator

191
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,830
So i'm a bit nervous

192
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,000
The first line is

193
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,210
Emotionally unstable

194
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,250
No one would say such a thing

195
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,220
Positive emotional instability?

196
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,990
It's terrible

197
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,610
What will happen?

198
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,680
In the car

199
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,570
It's even scarier in tight places

200
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,200
I watched "Suzuran" when I was in middle school

201
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,970
※A 1999 NHK progam in which Tono appeared

202
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,390
Oh really?

203
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,970
I was just 13 years old at the time

204
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,800
Really? I'm happy

205
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,330
I'm a bit nervous

206
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,510
I still have an impression of Tono-san from that time

207
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,450
I've changed a lot..

208
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,980
It'd be strange not to

209
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,450
You say you've changed...

210
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:07,320
But compared to the past, how to put it

211
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,460
There's positive emotional instability, right?

212
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,380
All the emotions are on display

213
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,400
I didn't have much opportunity to show that side before

214
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,740
Indeed, only through acting is it possible

215
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,870
Yeah, it's just an act

216
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,380
So nothing has changed in terms of the emotional instability

217
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,110
In regard to this, she understands herself well

218
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,720
The first level is passed easily

219
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,130
The 2nd line is

220
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,560
Can't have a normal conversation

221
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,760
This is no good

222
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,400
I still have to talk to her

223
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,570
Set up the conversation

224
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,140
Tono, you're not...

225
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,140
In a good way, you can't have a normal conversation

226
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,840
What?
-It's not...

227
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,010
A good conversation

228
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,970
In a good way...
-I don't know what we'll talk about

229
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,720
It's like playing catch

230
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,030
I threw the ball but I don't know if you'll throw it back to me, there's this sense of tension

231
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,060
As a comedian, I think its very interesting

232
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,830
How to say...

233
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,700
Well rounded

234
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,430
Does it confuse you?
-No

235
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,170
Not confused

236
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,400
It's more of an immersive contrast

237
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,810
So its good?
-Yeah, it's great

238
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,360
This has to be reexamined

239
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,380
Despite some sparks, the second level is also passed

240
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,140
The last line is...

241
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,790
Comedy and stuff...do you watch it?
-I love it

242
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,190
Disregarding people's feelings, who do you like best?

243
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,470
Recently the thing I have to watch before bed is...

244
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,460
Well, in terms of comedians

245
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,430
Isn't the senior and junior relationship important?

246
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,230
No no

247
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,860
How the relationship is, etc

248
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,630
Don't worry about it

249
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,370
But I want to hear people say they like an actress I really hate

250
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,080
My expression is obvious

251
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,380
You'll think, "Seriously!?"

252
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,280
Do you have an actress you hate?
-Loads!

253
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,980
Like who?

254
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,750
As soon as they appear, I change the channel immediately

255
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,660
Something is happening

256
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,890
Can you tell me?

257
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,290
A very big name

258
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,890
I won't talk about nobodies

259
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,430
Although you are a big name artist

260
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,630
Yes

261
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:34,470
As an actress, you don't act much in film and television anymore, in a good way

262
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,240
Not good

263
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,870
Me?
-Yes

264
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,140
I'm in a stage play though

265
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,170
Ah, you acted in a stage play?

266
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,910
Ah, that's...

267
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,380
I feel like your strengths lie more in morning variety

268
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:49,450
This... I don't think so

269
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,960
Comedians can sometimes be kind of dangerous

270
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,260
So sometimes I can act help but act like that

271
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,300
That's pretty impressive

272
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,130
Your eyes are too serious...

273
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,670
Scary...no it's not okay
-Scary?

274
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,000
Not at all. You are beautiful

275
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,710
What's wrong? What are you trying to say?

276
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,880
Nothing

277
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,540
Have you been to Musashi Koyama?

278
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,620
No, I'm looking forward to it

279
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,740
It's too raw

280
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,960
A reluctant diversion from the subject

281
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,160
And the truth is revealed

282
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,160
This location shoot is fake

283
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,360
The show is Wednesday Downtown
-I knew it

284
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,540
I lost a friend once to Wednesday Downtown

285
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,040
This time I gained a friend

286
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,610
How to say it

287
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,780
Let's call it even.
-Scary scary scary

288
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,940
The final challenger is

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,070
Unagi

290
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,160
The target is

291
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,360
Honkon

292
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,490
No one wants to do this

293
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,040
What are you talking about?

294
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,070
It's too dangerous.
-Dangerous?

295
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,900
He gets angry even if you don't say anything bad about him

296
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,900
With me

297
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,510
Getting by can be tough sometimes

298
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,480
I just eat bento at Lumine

299
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,350
He said, "Don't eat a bento!"

300
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,870
The first bad thing to say is...

301
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,090
Your appearance and heart are the same

302
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,130
Indeed

303
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,500
His appearance and heart are the same

304
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,070
Like... like a monster

305
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,260
We didn't ask you to say to this extent
-No, you didn't

306
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,770
This meeting seems fun

307
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,590
He has recently opened an SNS and been ranting continuously

308
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,060
An off-balance Honkon

309
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,340
What will happen?

310
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,110
Positive mood gloom and doom

311
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,570
You've been getting a lot of commentary work

312
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,640
Just one as a commentator

313
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,740
Really?
-And...

314
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,170
Listening to the experts talk

315
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:31,110
Then they said that Japan is now very strange, so I also started doing some research

316
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,280
Now I'm starting to think it is weird

317
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,150
This is what you've been interested in recently?

318
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,490
You could say its become an addiction, even though its part of the job

319
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,760
But you've become interested
-I've become serious about it

320
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,260
I want to be complimented

321
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,030
So i've been studying

322
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,670
The good thing about you is your appearance and heart are the same

323
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,640
What do you mean, appearance and heart?

324
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,440
Well... how do I put it?

325
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,950
Noone has ever said anything good about my appearance

326
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,480
They always say "looks dirty"

327
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,650
I'm dirty from inside out

328
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,020
You're too weird!

329
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,250
Most say my appearance and heart are the complete opposite!

330
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,060
Still consistent... but in a positive sense

331
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,630
No, no, no

332
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,130
Most say "you're manly on the inside"

333
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,400
You're too weird

334
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,400
Just... appearance

335
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,140
Even if the exterior is dirty

336
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,540
You know...

337
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,370
People always ask "do you know"? Of course I do!

338
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,650
He's so moody

339
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,510
It's positive

340
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,340
Right?

341
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,580
No, the younger generation certainly wouldn't say it

342
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,720
What're you talking about?

343
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,660
They surely wouldn't say it to your face

344
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,120
You just said it, you said it

345
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,560
I think this is positive

346
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,660
Regardless of the inner self, a clear sense of patience pervades in terms of the subject of ugly looks

347
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,040
Not much anger

348
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,890
Second is...

349
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,380
Honkon, you...

350
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,850
Aren't you pretty harsh about being late?

351
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,210
What happened with that one, Ito of Ozwald

352
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,210
Don't involve me!

353
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,650
Taking up other people's time

354
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,260
Indeed, they should be scolded

355
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,630
And then chattering incessantly, of course i'd be angry

356
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,870
Do you think it's okay for an attending physician to be late to the operating table?

357
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,700
Of course not

358
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,540
Bullet train operators, what if they're late?

359
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,210
You'd be angry

360
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,710
Impossible not to be

361
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,010
It's definitely a bad thing

362
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,980
That's for sure

363
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,350
Honkon is the one

364
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,290
That is positively hated by all young artists

365
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,300
That's bad!

366
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,190
Really? I don't really care

367
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,200
It sounds like Ito hates him

368
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,200
Hated by young artists

369
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,190
Don't mention me!

370
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,960
And is everyone serious?

371
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,970
Indeed... seriously

372
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,210
Please don't think it was me that said it

373
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,400
There are times when I hate you

374
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,470
Saying "I can be annoying at times"

375
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,510
I also have people I like and people I hate

376
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,510
Do you know what it is? The thing that everyone hates

377
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,450
Even if people hate me, I still have rice to eat, so it doesn't matter

378
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,920
Not everything is about making friends

379
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,820
Otherwise there's no sense of tension, it makes things boring

380
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,130
Really, a little more tension

381
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,890
What a big name artist!

382
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,540
As the conversation is heating up, its time for the final line

383
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,600
Political-related statements are irrelevant

384
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,440
This is too deadly

385
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,810
This is bad

386
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,910
What do you think?

387
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,050
I meant to...

388
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:55,280
I do think they're wrong

389
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,590
Here's also gonna see this bit

390
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,790
What will happen?

391
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,530
I feel that Honkon is a very hot-blooded person

392
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,270
And you're very concerned about politics, right?

393
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,440
You guys think too little, its not all just about comedy

394
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,110
You can do that because its peaceful

395
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,080
I always hear your political statements

396
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,450
I think, in a good way, your political statements are irrelevant

397
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,420
What do you mean by "in a good way"?

398
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,780
If you don't know what you're doing, you don't know what you're doing

399
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,250
No, that's positive too

400
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,730
It's not relevant but it does a good job of livening up the show

401
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,760
I'm out of touch? Have you watched me?

402
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,830
Yes, one time...
-For example?

403
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,300
I can't really given an example

404
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,200
Can't even give an example

405
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,770
And you say I'm out of touch, that's not good!

406
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,840
You're being so vague

407
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,010
After all, it is positive

408
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:01,550
What's positive...that's not how to use "positive"

409
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,480
It means that although it is not right to say

410
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,420
It still makes the show very lively

411
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,360
Is it your intention to go in that direction?
-Which one?

412
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,640
Politics?
-Yes

413
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,430
No, it's part of the job

414
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,070
But I'm worried about Japan

415
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,870
Is there anything you want to change?
-There are too many things

416
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,570
Honestly speaking

417
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,110
This country is really in trouble

418
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,910
Is that so?
-Of course

419
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,150
So, you'll change...?

420
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,620
Of course it is to do what you can, and you don't

421
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,050
That's when it's positive. Get involved in some political activities

422
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,260
Do you think that by talking more about politics you'll get less work?

423
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,700
Yeah, I guess...
-Right?

424
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,930
You say this... then don't pay taxes

425
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,730
But in a positive sense

426
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,240
What "positive", you're pissing me off!

427
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,780
Do you think you can be forgiven for saying anything by adding "positive" to it?

428
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,080
No, I really don't think so

429
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,610
Straight up said it

430
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,660
In light of Honkon's comment, the truth is revealed herre

431
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,860
What are you doing?

432
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,360
This is Wednesday Downtown

433
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,930
Honkon was smiling from the moment he came in

434
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,400
Did something good happening?
-Nothing good

435
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,370
Do you really have such a bad impression of me?

436
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,630
I don't usually lose my temper

437
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,900
You are not the same on the outside as you are on the inside

438
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:38,910
In summary
No one was too angry (in a good way)

439
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,440
I see

440
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,420
What do you think?

441
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,220
Ah, i'm tingling

442
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,460
Girolamo was really angry, right?

443
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,060
When the person came in

444
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:57,330
He may have hit him, but it was edited out

445
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,900
Must have beaten someone up

446
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,060
It's true though, Minamikawa is really annoying

447
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,800
His expressions and so on, and his glasses
-Yes, yes

448
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,840
Don't say "positive" after that

449
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,290
Change it to say "I don't think so though"

450
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,650
Pretty good

451
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,150
But then they'll ask "so who said it?"

452
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,790
It makes no difference

453
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,380
Let’s welcome our next presenter please

454
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,480
Anyone there?

455
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,950
There is, there is

456
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,730
It's Fujiwara!

457
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,880
So, this is not a theory

458
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,920
But the project everyone has been waiting for

459
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,030
Please take a look

460
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,740
MONSTER LOVE

461
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,880
It's here!

462
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,540
It's here

463
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,580
There are also many people who hate this project!

464
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,180
No, no, no, the streets are calling it "MONLOVE" "MONLOVE"

465
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,790
It's not that popular!

466
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,850
So, have you all watched it?

467
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,550
Yes
-It's disgusting

468
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,520
In a "People I don't want to be hugged by" ranking, Kuro-chan was 3rd and I was 4th

469
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,960
Just one place difference?

470
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,830
Super close!

471
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,560
He's actually doing things wrong

472
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,200
But i'm just one place away from him!

473
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,230
It's about the same level

474
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,640
I live my life so carefully

475
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,920
What a sad story

476
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:17,240
So, a brief review of what has happened so far

477
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:25,580
Kuro has been living in Okinawa with some women who like him and some pretending to like him

478
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,320
Last week, Mami, a pretender, was eliminated

479
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,260
And it was revealed in the post-interview that those pretending to like Kuro-chan are doing so in the hopes of debuting as idols

480
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,070
Aspiring idols

481
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,260
That's why they were crying!

482
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,040
Then the cookies baked by Miku were smashed to pieces

483
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
The "cookie incident"

484
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,610
It wasn't that big of an event

485
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,250
The culprit was Kuro-chan himself

486
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,280
He's the worst

487
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,540
Is it really possible to broadcast that part on TV?

488
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:07,730
People may think that being a psychopath is appealing

489
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,370
It's the first time i've seen such a disgusting psychopath

490
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,000
Purebred psycho

491
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,360
Its surprising he can still be on TV

492
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay, now these three are left

493
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,180
Richi, Miku and Mina

494
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,880
Let me ask, who do you like, Tanaka?

495
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,330
Eh?

496
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,280
Of these people?

497
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,980
Which one is your type

498
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,320
Mina

499
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,120
Disgusting

500
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,990
You're the one who asked!

501
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,010
Amazing!

502
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,470
Super beautiful!

503
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,720
3 people

504
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
There are only 3 people

505
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,250
Where's the other one?

506
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,720
A nice location

507
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,420
It's so hot today!

508
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,160
I'm really sorry about the cookie incident yesterday

509
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:01,710
I am the one most likely to be suspected

510
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,850
Because i've always been jealous

511
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
Now i'll be suspected again

512
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,110
And Kuro-chan will protect Miku

513
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,330
What a face!

514
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,490
I also think it was Miku that broke them

515
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,660
He did it!

516
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,800
That's why I said Miku

517
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,020
It's okay

518
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,800
No matter who did it, and why

519
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,440
I don't care at all

520
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,400
Being suspicious of others

521
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,810
It makes you feel sad

522
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:40,050
I don't want that

523
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,590
That's all

524
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:50,430
So I don't care who broke it

525
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,760
Good girl

526
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:58,090
It feels like a long time has passed and there are so many less people now

527
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,770
Its coming to an end soon...

528
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,810
I have this feeling

529
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,950
3 people, so scary

530
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:11,450
But a 3-person idol group is quite rare, isn't it?

531
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,190
Very few indeed

532
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,920
The last selected, will they have a solo debut?

533
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,420
Oh, is it like that?

534
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,930
But there are also people that like Kuro-chan

535
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,300
Didn't Kuro-chan say he wouldn't go out with an idol?

536
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,800
He did say that

537
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,910
Still can't tell

538
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,900
What will happen in the end...

539
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,570
There should be no lies here, right?

540
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,520
The opening is important

541
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,260
Everyone looks like an idol

542
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,960
So disgusting

543
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,080
Disgusting

544
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,800
Super beautiful

545
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,100
Ah, i'm so happy

546
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,020
Wait a sec

547
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,640
Everyone wasn't here earlier, right?

548
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,900
We went to a private beach together

549
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,340
Eh, private... the beach?

550
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,380
The beach

551
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,580
Eh? So cunning!

552
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,180
Leaving me behind?

553
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,460
Its nice for it to be just 3 sometimes

554
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,920
Yeah, it was fun

555
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,050
Super fun

556
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,320
But with me it'd be way more fun, ah, so cunning~

557
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,470
He's so annoying
-Really disgusting

558
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,700
Such a shock

559
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,730
Feel so tanned

560
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,840
I wore sunscreen

561
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,370
Put it on twice

562
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,670
Did you get a tan?

563
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,330
Eh?

564
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,380
Eh? Why? Why? Watanabe? What...what's wrong?

565
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,780
Eh, why?

566
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,050
Eh, what?

567
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,120
Yes, only Kuro-chan doesn't know

568
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,850
Hello

569
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,650
Oh, hello

570
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,820
Please take a seat

571
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,350
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why are you here?

572
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,590
Eh? Wait a minute, why?

573
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,220
You have nothing to do with this project, right?

574
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,290
This isn't MONSTER IDOL

575
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,760
Eh? Why are you in Okinawa?

576
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,960
I have an announcement to make

577
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,640
It's not a coincidence?

578
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,240
I know you're here filming

579
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,770
There is an announcement to make

580
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,200
Congratulations to you all

581
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:22,380
You three will debut as an idol group

582
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:22,880
Congratulations

583
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,250
Eh? What's going on? What the hell?

584
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,140
Everyone?

585
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,590
Eh? What's Watanabe talking about? Wait, what's this?

586
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,930
What? Aren't I looking for a girlfriend?

587
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,960
What? I don't get it

588
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,640
Panic attack

589
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:47,170
No, actually, its not about liking Kuro-chan

590
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,940
It's about wanting to become an idol

591
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,640
Eh...

592
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,870
Wait, I don't understand, ah, too sudden

593
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,550
There's nothing funny about it!

594
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,120
What is this?

595
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,980
They can be idols if they remain?

596
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,340
Yes, the only criterion is to capture the heart of Kuro-chan

597
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,200
Thus, these 3 people have qualified for the idol debut

598
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,510
Ah, it has been confirmed

599
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,630
Hey, what about the ones who really like Kuro-chan?

600
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,180
Hey, wait, so, hey?

601
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,610
Does that mean there is no girl who likes me among these 3 people?

602
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,530
There's one left

603
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,160
One more?

604
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,650
Hey, wait, that... wait!

605
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,320
If she's my girlfriend, why will she still be allowed to make her debut as an idol?

606
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,230
Eh?

607
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,830
What do you think you are saying?

608
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,110
No, not my girlfriend...

609
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,800
That, that...

610
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,800
No, I really don't get it!

611
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,900
What the hell is this?

612
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,370
Hey...

613
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,970
Hysterical Kuro-chan

614
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,970
So this is the motivation behind it all...

615
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,420
He's realized

616
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,510
That's why people were crying

617
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,120
I don't understand it

618
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,550
There is 1 person who really likes Kuro-chan

619
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,160
1 person left

620
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,820
It seems that after this cohabitation

621
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,270
She has also come to think it could be good to try to be an idol too

622
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,830
No. Don't decide for yourself

623
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,400
If you stay until the end, do you want debut as an idol?

624
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,470
I will consider it

625
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,640
Finally, they agreed to debut as an idol

626
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,890
So, despite the inclusion of a potential girlfriend for Kuro-chan

627
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:40,290
These 3 will tentatively debut as idols

628
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,590
So I would like to ask Kuro-chan

629
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:48,860
Please decide on the name of the idol group and write lyrics for their song

630
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,560
I got confused

631
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,570
Because I was very "angry"

632
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,930
Like a volcano or something

633
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:07,460
Although Kuro-chan is very angry, this is still a love project after all...

634
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,380
So it is still mainly about Kuro-chan's love

635
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,520
Please return to Tokyo for a date

636
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:18,460
Then you will decide to choose who to confess to

637
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,930
What an expression

638
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,560
Hey...wait, wait, wait a minute!

639
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,870
I'm looking for a girlfriend...

640
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,640
But they became an idol group

641
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,370
So I have to find the girl who really likes me to date?

642
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,480
So hard to understand

643
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,650
Eh...

644
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,990
That's lucky

645
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,240
Scary!

646
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,560
Even if you don't like me, it's nice to pretend to like me

647
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,400
Only 1 person? Only 1 person?

648
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,640
Is there really only 1 left?

649
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,170
Hey

650
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,770
Suddenly saying there's just one person, i'm a little surprised

651
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,200
Indeed

652
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,210
So that's it

653
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,080
There are 2 people who do not really like Kuro-chan

654
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,640
That sucks!

655
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,740
Although the idol debut is confirmed

656
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,360
So please hold on until the end

657
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,490
Please continue to cheat Kuro-Chan

658
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,520
Ok

659
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,860
Such a loud response

660
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,690
This isn't what being an idol's about!

661
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,670
So, the cohabitation life in Okinawa ended

662
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,640
And Kuro-chan returned to Tokyo

663
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,410
Coming

664
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,390
Good morning

665
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,740
Good morning. Eh, what is it?

666
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,680
I want to see if you are composing lyrics

667
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,680
The color of his vest is really nasty

668
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,840
I'm not slacking off!

669
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,460
Immediately began work as an idol producer

670
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,440
So messy!

671
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,120
A different feeling

672
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,760
I challenged myself to do something new

673
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,320
It's not a typical approach?

674
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,560
It's a little different

675
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:08,800
Although it's an idol, it's not the "cute" kind of "likable"

676
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,870
"Cool"

677
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,370
Cool?

678
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,530
Quite serious consideration

679
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:17,400
This kind of vibe could be cool

680
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,310
A feeling of distinct colors, right?

681
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,580
He is responsible for BiSH's clothing

682
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:25,910
This time they are different from the previous style, right?

683
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:31,650
How can I say it? If I don't flip 360 degrees and think

684
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,920
Then its tough to come up with anything

685
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,730
If you flip it 360 degrees, wouldn't it be back to the original place?

686
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,630
Well, let's listen to it first

687
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,500
Ok

688
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:55,640
That's right. This time, Black wrote the lyrics for their debut song

689
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:01,680
It is the opening song of MONSTER LOVE

690
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,460
It's good, it's connected

691
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,690
I have written a lot

692
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,390
I'll write it out first

693
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,740
Yes, please

694
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,030
Watanabe, do you have any thoughts?

695
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,360
"The bond that can't be returned, the bond that can't be broken"

696
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,170
This

697
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,070
Miku made cookies

698
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,670
Then I broke them

699
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,570
You broke the cookies she made for you?

700
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,170
At that time, it became a total battlefield

701
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,480
It's all your fault!

702
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,230
What is "old man got up and became an old woman"?

703
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,150
I was surprised to be cheated

704
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,950
Thought everyone liked me

705
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,090
It was as surprising as a sudden change of gender

706
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,330
Very profound

707
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,500
Yes, it's very profound

708
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,630
I think it is very good

709
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,810
Watanabe, it's done!

710
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,530
It's done!

711
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,640
Full marks

712
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,240
You put all those memories to use

713
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,080
This will make me be liked even more, right?

714
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,980
There is 1 person who will

715
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,170
Kuro-chan also had the important duty of deciding on the group's name

716
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,800
The name is very important

717
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,740
Wrote a lot

718
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,730
I have written a lot

719
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,290
Thinking about these

720
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:24,030
This is very different from "Mameshiba no Taigun"

721
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,190
Bearslayer

722
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,260
Yes, completely different

723
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,170
Leaning more towards the cool type

724
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,840
Electricity, gas and water

725
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,510
Oh you noticed that one?

726
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,150
Because it's a threesome

727
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,850
It is very straightforward, 3 essential things in life

728
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,920
"Escaped Pineapple"

729
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,710
Used the pineapple, which is trendy, and put a sad spin on it

730
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,840
"Full of Sorrow?"

731
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,530
"Escaped Spinach"

732
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,290
Bearslayer

733
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,230
This is Willie Williams

734
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,230
※Karate fighter born in the Jukushin Kaikan with the name "Bearslayer"

735
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,170
Eh?

736
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,410
Willie Williams

737
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,960
Who would know that?

738
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,070
Don't you know? "Bearslayer"?

739
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,450
Why do you want to give them this name?

740
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,590
Let People Drink Sardine Water

741
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,090
Give them a drink when they're dying and they'll be saved

742
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,250
Is "Strawberry Honeydew Daifuku" a honeydew melon Daifuku?

743
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:13,950
No, it's not

744
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,450
Although it is strawberry Daifuku

745
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:19,600
The taste of honeydew melon is unexpected

746
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,600
What does it mean?

747
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,490
I see

748
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,650
What is "Father's Return"

749
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,030
This is a telegram

750
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,960
So that's it...

751
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,340
It should be quite touching, right?

752
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,000
It has meaning

753
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,440
Not touched?

754
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,980
No...

755
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,680
How to put it? Choosing from these names...?

756
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,750
No, to be honest, although I thought of a lot

757
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,490
I'm trying to think of more

758
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,790
More?

759
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,650
Please do

760
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,920
Most aren't doable

761
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,820
Despite thinking so many

762
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,360
Oh, it's been a long time.
-Long time no see

763
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,360
How do you feel after reading the lyrics?

764
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,300
Feels very fashionable

765
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,200
Not really like Kuro-chan

766
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,670
Not alike at all

767
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,040
Let me be clear, I'm not in love mode right now

768
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,120
Fully in producer mode

769
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,110
You see me

770
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:16,850
There may be feelings such as "I like you," "I love you," and "I'm finally at ease"

771
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,230
No, it's not

772
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,750
But when recording songs, you need to be professional

773
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,650
Be sure to go for it!

774
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,460
Ok

775
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,960
First of all, please let me listen to the original and unprocessed song

776
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,680
I get it

777
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,360
Good

778
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,060
Thank you

779
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:40,000
And so, the trio's first recording session ended successfully

780
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,370
They have good personalities and different voices

781
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,570
I'm sorry... I'm really surprised

782
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,610
I thought it would be random trash, I didn't expect it to be anything like that

783
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,360
So rude!

784
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,380
Great singing!

785
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,480
What makes you qualified to say that?

786
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,280
In addition

787
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,190
Ok

788
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,320
You're done?
-Yes

789
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,460
Little embarrassing...

790
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,950
Their costumes!

791
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,060
So cute

792
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,590
Superb!

793
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,900
Feel stronger

794
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,070
Feel stronger?
-Yes

795
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,610
Do you know what the theme of the outfit is?

796
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,610
A hero?
-Like a hero

797
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,710
Feeling able to fight

798
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:25,420
This time when designing clothes I thought of a "mini 4WD"

799
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:25,730
Why?

800
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,590
Mini four-wheel drive?

801
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,790
Mini 4WD...

802
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,090
Wait wait wait

803
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,990
You don't like it much?

804
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,760
No, I like it

805
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,930
So, wear these outfits and go for it!

806
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,930
Ok

807
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,680
So, this is the group name

808
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,000
Here we go

809
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,870
What is it gonna be?

810
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,190
"Mameshiba" is the cute type

811
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:58,780
But for your three I chose a trendier name

812
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
Looking forward to it

813
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,150
So exciting. What is it?

814
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,690
The group name is...

815
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,930
Somewhere in the City

816
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:11,760
Really?

817
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,460
Wait wait wait, did I hear it properly? What does it mean?

818
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,830
Really?

819
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,500
What did you say?
-Please say it again

820
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,200
Eh, you didn't you hear me?

821
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,640
Somewhere in the city?

822
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,880
Heard it

823
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,280
Yes, the group name is "Somewhere in the City"

824
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,210
You thought about it seriously, right?

825
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,650
They hate it

826
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,680
Of course

827
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,190
Although I thought up many names with places in them

828
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,830
"Somewhere in the City" can appeal to people from everywhere

829
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,560
So that's the meaning of "Somewhere in the City"

830
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,160
But only within the area of Tokyo

831
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,400
Although you say that everywhere

832
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,800
Eh...

833
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,440
If you don't like it, do you want to change it?

834
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,600
I also hesitated whether or not I should choose another one

835
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,270
What is it?

836
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,040
The other one is

837
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,840
"Eating Too Much Osaka"

838
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,750
Why do they all have place names?

839
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,570
Based in Osaka?

840
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,110
No, it's not based in Osaka, but it's easy to pronounce

841
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,090
So Mina, you think "Somewhere in the City" is better?

842
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,590
It's better

843
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:11,590
It's better

844
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,280
Then it's "Somewhere in the City"

845
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,590
Its decided

846
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,010
Also had "Tokyo Incident"

847
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,730
So, the name has been decided, and the costume has been decided

848
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,250
Don't compare them!

849
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,530
Let's gather around!

850
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,000
Ok

851
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,370
Here we go

852
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,170
Where are you going?

853
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,010
Somewhere in the City

854
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,840
Where?

855
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,550
Decided!

856
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,440
Not very exciting

857
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,950
1 more time?

858
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:48,280
In this way, the second idol group "Somewhere in the City" is born with Kuro-chan as the advisor

859
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:56,440
So, now, Kuro-chan's search for love is coming to an end

860
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,370
Miku

861
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,010
Where will his romance go from here?

862
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,280
Although i'm humiliated

863
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,990
Here we go again

864
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,610
Please go out with me

865
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,450
Please

866
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,050
I see

867
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:25,080
The idol group "Somewhere in the City", with Kuro-chan as the advisor, is born

868
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,770
I thought I would see more disgusting antics, but suddenly he became a producer

869
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,700
I'm very angry, I don't want to see that side of him

870
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,950
Wanna see his disgusting side

871
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,840
Show me a guy who is more disgusting than me

872
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,140
Nausea is less, and the love is less

873
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,400
I shouldn't have come

874
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,210
But the final scene was quite shocking

875
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,550
A close hug!

876
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,120
The next episode preview

877
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,400
It's very shocking

878
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,640
Who is lying?

879
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,290
Richi has been aggressive

880
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,860
She must want to be an idol.
-Definitely an idol

881
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,870
Richi wants to be an idol

882
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:04,340
The recording also reveals a personality of a very skilled person

883
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,200
Mina is not very active

884
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,640
Not very aggressive

885
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,380
You see

886
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,550
He's really surprisingly into it

887
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,720
Despite all the complaints
-Watching super seriously

888
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,220
Watching super seriously

889
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:24,320
Did you hear that? Can't take his eyes off the video.
-No, no, no

890
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:29,930
If you like MONSTER LOVE so much, just say it!

891
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,280
What do you think the song title is?

892
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,910
Could it be...

893
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,970
Cookie Incident?

894
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,010
The title of the song is "Cookie"

895
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,750
Guessed it!

896
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,720
Guessed it!

897
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,950
Somewhere in the City's Cookie

898
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,290
Yes, Somewhere in the City's Cookie

899
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:05,800
So, you're wondering what kind of song it is, right?
-Can we listen to it?

900
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,640
Please have a listen to "Cookie" by Somewhere in the City

901
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,390
The theme of this song is falling in love

902
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,110
The 3 of them, I don't think they are that typical cute idol type

903
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,370
So I chose a cool and fashionable style

904
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,510
Please show your personality

905
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:27,250
Peeking into the cave, there's treasure

906
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,660
Great voice

907
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:32,320
Don't want a love song that ends in tragedy

908
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,600
Cute

909
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,030
Spent sleepless nights

910
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,420
Good voice too

911
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:42,370
Bound by the halo of angels

912
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:48,600
Why did you like it?

913
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,760
So addictive!

914
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,440
Mina is the most innocent

915
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,040
Don't cry

916
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,960
Whenever

917
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,320
A broken bond that will not be restored

918
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,350
Whenever

919
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:04,690
The intersection of possibility and I love you

920
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,820
Forget the CPAP

921
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,660
Lovesickness

922
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,090
This is the first piece of honesty

923
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,600
The inability to weigh the trafficked

924
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,130
Escape in the display

925
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:23,910
Whenever

926
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,280
Good song

927
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,260
Now lets listen

928
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,310
To two members of BiSH

929
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:34,080
They all sound very good

930
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,890
They have a very good sense of balance

931
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,790
And I don't want any of them to become Kuro-chan's girlfriend

932
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,020
Why do you say such things?

933
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,160
It's a waste

934
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,340
These three people came together by chance

935
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:53,640
But they are very well matched and are totally idols

936
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,170
They've become idols

937
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:01,540
The old man and the old woman, Watanabe praised that line, but I really hate it

938
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,510
Luckily, it wasn't put in

939
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,580
Maybe it's in the second verse

940
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,590
Yeah true, this is the first verse

941
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,170
Yes

942
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,230
Such a bad line

943
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,520
I hate that line!

944
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:17,980
So, the CD of this song will be available at CD stores nationwide tomorrow, December 15

945
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,340
So fast!

946
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:28,060

00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:30,800
Awesome

-Somewhere in the City, so confusing

951
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,880
That's great. People don't know it's them, right?

952
00:45:42,880 --> 00:46:14,950
