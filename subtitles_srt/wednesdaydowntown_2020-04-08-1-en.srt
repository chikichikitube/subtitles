00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,440
Hello everyone, welcome to Wednesday's Downtown!

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,140
Here we go - our first presenter is this person!

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,320
Who is it?

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,420
It's Cunning Takeyama!

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,610
As an entertainer...

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,440
...what do you think is the thing you need be most careful of?

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,580
The most?

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,180
Affairs?

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,420
Yeah, affairs.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,600
Pictoral magazines.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,480
If we put those together, any kind of scandal.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,280
I have an experience from eleven years ago.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,070
My picture was put in a magazine...

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,040
...and that caused quite a hassle.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,320
During those times as soon as you hear about a scandal...

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,200
...your mind just goes blank.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,180
I heard about my scandal right before a quiz show on NHK.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,220
I couldn't answer a single question that night.

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,280
My emotions were all over the place.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
I know that feeling.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,530
When I see an unfamiliar, important-looking guy like a chief manager...

22
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,200
...roaming around set, I think to myself "something definiely happened."

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,740
After this there's definitely going to be something.

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,860
And so this is the theory I have brought today.

25
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,540
Theory: Even if your manager told you "a scandalous article about you will come out tomorrow,"

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,940
...a professional would finish their job for the day without showing any signs of the upcoming issues.

27
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,300
I see.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,900
If you're a professional...

29
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,790
...your personal scandal has nothing to do with the job.

30
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,600
So they should just push through.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,890
If I was informed of a scandal right before coming here...

32
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,380
...I can't just mope around while I'm here.

33
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,150
But you couldn't answer questions at the quiz show!

34
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,140
I was truly so shocked!

35
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,160
Even now I barely remember anything about the show!

36
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,940
Also:

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,300
Today we investigate the theory: Even if your manager tells you "a scandalous article will come out about you tomorrow,"...

38
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,420
...a professional would finish their job for the day without showing any signs of the upcoming issues.

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,660
Today's targets: KoroChiki's Nadal, Panther's Ogata, and Yasumura.

40
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,240
Today's targets: KoroChiki's Nadal, Panther's Ogata, and Yasumura.

41
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,440
We had them come in for a fake to show to determine who the most useless entertainer is.

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,640
Please take the lead since you're the eldest.

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Actually, I'll take the lead.

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,540
In that case, I can lead!

45
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,540
I can lead too!

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,410
In that case, I will lead!

47
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,480
By all means, please!

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,910
What the hell, man?!

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,020
All three started the gig with high energy levels.

50
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,080
Today we've prepared the same scandal article for each of them.

51
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,000
We will tell them one at a time over the course of the gig.

52
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,520
While the staff "get ready," the comedians wait in the green room.

53
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,180
First we target this man.

54
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,290
Manager: We need to talk.

55
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,290
It can't be here?

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,280
We escort him to another room to tell him about the article.

57
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,950
Sorry, umm...

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,020
...around the end of last year, did you go out drinking with some girls?

59
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,620
...around the end of last year, did you go out drinking with some girls?

60
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,490
The end of last year?

61
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,660
It was right around December...

62
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,340
I actually haven't been out drinking with girls.

63
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,610
Well, it's about this, and they've also taken pictures.

64
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,170
Well, it's about this, and they've also taken pictures.

65
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,820
And the picture shown to Nadal is:

66
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,080
Nadal: Accusations of drinking with underage high school girls.

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,840
An article with bad implications.

68
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,650
What is this?

69
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,190
What the hell is this?

70
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,280
Underage?

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,620
Yes, the investigation for this theory began months ago in December.

72
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,920
End of year party... it's been a great year!

73
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,820
At an end-of-year party with close friends...

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,220
Good evening.

75
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,480
Wow, she is Jitsukata's type of girl.

76
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,020
Nadal's friend brought her female friend, who brought her friend to the party...

77
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,160
...to set up the female actresses.

78
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
This is bad.

79
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,780
From the girls' perspective this
party would be such a letdown.

80
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,910
As soon as they all have a drink, the setup is complete.

81
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:20,110
By the way, the girl drinking next to Nadal is the "underage" girl for the sake of the investigation.

82
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,070
Jitsukata brought them.

83
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,520
I'm pretty sure I confirmed with them.

84
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,400
How old are you?

85
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,400
TN: Legal drinking age in Japan is 20.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm 22.

87
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,400
I just turned 20.

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
20? Are you sure you're not 19?

89
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,860
I'm 20!

90
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,370
I beg of you, seriously.

91
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,500
We're really toeing the line here.

92
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,460
It's so real.

93
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,110
Indeed - if I get caught with drinking with an underage girl...

94
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,270
I properly asked if she was over 20.

95
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,510
This is his fault.

96
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,280
This is @#$%&*!

97
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,650
This guy's messed up in the head.

98
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,420
This guy is seriously messed up.  He's deranged.

99
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,580
People from Shibuya are generally deranged.

100
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,160
People from Tokyo are messed in the head.

101
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,390
All these deranged people gathered and created this deranged city.

102
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,420
That's the reason drugs are spreading through Tokyo.

103
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,630
That's why I don't like Tokyo.

104
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,940
There are only these psycho guys.

105
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,090
I've never met a proper guy here, seriously.

106
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,880
For some reason, Nadal's anger was directed at Tokyo in general.

107
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,880
And then...

108
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,310
I knew this would happen if I ever did something like this.

109
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,780
Using my joke like "yabbeezo!" ("that's pretty bad").

110
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,980
Like, "he went for the underage girl."

111
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,520
"He went for the underage girl, yabbeezo."

112
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,360
The way they write this pisses me off.

113
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,960
I only have these dirty jokes.

114
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,320
I only have jokes they can easily make puns out of.

115
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,900
I don't have any pop.

116
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,780
He kept saying it wasn't his fault.

117
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,820
In the article there are accusations of sexual harrassment.

118
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,370
I don't remember.

119
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,310
I legit don't remember.

120
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,060
Did you say any of these things?

121
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,110
Is there a chance you said these things?

122
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,110
No, no - I didn't say that.

123
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,640
I might have asked about the last time she got busy.

124
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,080
Marin, you're seriously in danger though.

125
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,450
It seems like guys would target you with your vibe.

126
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,490
Have any guys recently invited you...

127
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,320
...to have a one-night stand?  When's the last time?

128
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,420
No comment!

129
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,820
Marin-chan, you can whisper - just tell me when you last did it.

130
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,140
But it wasn't like...

131
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,090
..."when did you do it last?" in a harrassing way.

132
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,410
It was more like, "when's the last time you did it?"

133
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,040
There was more pop to it.  I was saying it as a joke.

134
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,740
I don't know how the manager isn't laughing.

135
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,220
She went for it pretty recently!

136
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,580
Let me ask Yasumura-san for advice.

137
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,580
No, hold on...

138
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,900
It's still very raw information.

139
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,400
So, please keep it a secret from those two, and don't tell your wife either.

140
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,910
This is rough...

141
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,350
Please keep it to yourself for now.

142
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,820
I can't work like this.

143
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,710
The thing Nadal was most worried about with the article release was:

144
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,900
You know how I have those commercials? What's happening there?

145
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,780
Umm...for now...

146
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,120
Wait a minute...no no no no no no...

147
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,820
This is awful!

148
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,510
Crap crap crap crap...

149
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,880
A TV commercial that was just recently confirmed.

150
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,930
Is the commercial gone?

151
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:27,270
Judging from the way things are going, it will probably be scrapped.

152
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,840
My head hurts...

153
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,220
I have a stomachache.

154
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,710
Also the gig you are doing right now...

155
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,280
...it might get shelved too.

156
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,450
But we can't tell other people...

157
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,480
...so for now please continue working normally.

158
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,440
My commercial...

159
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
What is going on?

160
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,080
This is awful.

161
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah, well...

162
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,800
We gotta cover this up.

163
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
Covering it up is a bit...

164
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,510
We need to cover it up, otherwise these guys just do as they please.

165
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,550
The drinks...I paid for those!

166
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,050
Yeah...

167
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,850
Wait, actually it was Hikaru.

168
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,850
Nadal would do anything to keep his commercial...

169
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,860
...demanding that they cover up the article somehow.

170
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,860
This guy... seriously.

171
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,540
Please cover it up.

172
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,390
We can't let these guys walk all over us.

173
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,630
Yoshimoto as a company isn't being taken seriously.

174
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,160
They're thinking they can cash in on us.

175
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,920
This is seriously so wrong.  It's messed up.

176
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,180
Well, the article is actually coming out...

177
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:51,390
Cover it up...just this once.

178
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,780
I was really looking forward to it.

179
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,620
Well that doesn't change that it's getting published.

180
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,360
Could you...take this seriously?

181
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,520
I've got it.

182
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,100
This is the worst.

183
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,000
Crap, I don't feel good.

184
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,620
The news hit Nadal both physically and mentally.

185
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,620
Staff: Excuse me.

186
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,190
Back to the show.

187
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,460
Let's see how he's doing.

188
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,860
Let's go!

189
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,390
Yep.

190
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,360
His energy level is perfect!

191
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,620
Compared to the other two who came through with their usual high energy levels...

192
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,280
...Nadal has completely toned down since the opening shot.

193
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,100
The next thing these three are going to do today...

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,930
...super spicy dandan noodle challenge.

195
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,630
Okay, let's go!

196
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,930
That looks spicy!

197
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,940
So... spicy...!

198
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,740
Nadal, on the other hand...

199
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,140
It hurts!

200
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,000
I can't eat this...

201
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,340
He took the first bite...

202
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,500
We've gotta finish this - we're the stars of the show!

203
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,500
We're the regulars!

204
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,280
Let's do this!

205
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,280
We'll do our best!

206
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,740
Let's go.

207
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,440
Nadal knows that the pilot episode won't even air.

208
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,800
Next to the two who went to war with their spicy dishes...

209
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,030
...he was just drinking water the whole time.

210
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,860
This can't be done...

211
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,480
When two of them finished their bowls, the filming for this segment was over.

212
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,800
You weren't eating at all!

213
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,910
You didn't eat anything!

214
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,480
Following Nadal...

215
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,240
At this point we tell Yasamura about the article.

216
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,670
Umm...

217
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,080
...this article was just sent to me.

218
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,660
18 years old... high school girl...

219
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,640
This is awful.

220
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,390
Oh that's spicy.

221
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,030
"Accusations against Yasamura are as follows:"

222
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,990
I mean, I asked her age and she said she was 20.

223
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,380
How old are you?

224
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,080
BON THE WORLD
(comedian)

225
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,380
I'm 20.

226
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,080
So young!

227
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,520
LLR
Tomohoro Ito

228
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,520
Trendy Angel
Takashi

229
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,140
Isn't it scary?

230
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,310
I almost want to check her license or something.

231
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,650
Is this a crime?

232
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,020
This is horrible.

233
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,920
I have to go to court and stuff, right?

234
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,460
There were also allegations of sexual harassment.

235
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,400
Sexual harassment?

236
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,550
Yasumura-san, are you drunk already?

237
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,320
I'm not drunk.

238
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,970
He's drunk.

239
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,830
Oh, he's drunk!

240
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,440
"He showed me his nipple, which I didn't want to see..."

241
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,840
"...and coerced me to touch it with my glass, as if to say 'cheers!'"

242
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,040
Oh yeah, I guess I did that.

243
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,910
Y... You did that?

244
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,150
I did show her my nipple.

245
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,150
What the hell, man?

246
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,190
From the top!

247
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,460
That's so nasty!

248
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,870
Nipple cheers!

249
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,630
That's cold!

250
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,560
This party went full-throttle on the sexual harassment.

251
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,490
However, once the girls left...

252
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,440
This...is Marin-chan's?

253
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,780
Marin-chan and Mao-chan.

254
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,780
This is Marin-chan's.

255
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,000
This is bad.
This is bad.

256
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,620
This shot glass has a higher percentage.

257
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,390
He's really doing it.

258
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,780
It feels like we've seen this somewhere else.

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,820
He's disgusting.

260
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,820
Do you mind if I go to the bathroom?

261
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,820
No, not at all.

262
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,650
If this is real then this is quite...

263
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,450
Well, at this point I would get fired, right?

264
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,350
I'm not sure that you would get fired...

265
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,350
Worst case I'm getting fired.  I mean...

266
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,800
99% chance I'm getting fired.

267
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,600
Right now we're confirming if everything is real...

268
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,200
...talking to the other people who were there, so...

269
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,900
...so, for now, please continue.

270
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,450
Continue like this?

271
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,000
I had to confirm the details with you as soon as possible.

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,780
So I had to tell you now.

273
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,420
Can I really work in this state?

274
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,420
With Yasumura mentally preparing to retire, we continue filming.

275
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,700
We find ourselves in a situation where two of three are not all there.

276
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,500
Let's see how it goes.

277
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,130
Okay!

278
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,690
What's next?

279
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,760
Where did Yasumura's energy from earlier go?

280
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,900
On the other hand, perhaps with the passage of time...

281
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,220
...Nadal's energy has partially recovered.

282
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,460
The next segment for these three to partake in is...

283
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:05,730
...to ask women around Venus Fort who the #1 man they want to sleep with is.

284
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,000
Wait a minute!

285
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,670
If I got a vote from such a cutie, I'd be so happy!

286
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,670
Hold on...

287
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,400
We're matching!  It's the turtleneck!

288
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,840
Just 30 minutes ago Yasumura had a vibrant energy.

289
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,480
Now he doesn't crack a single joke.

290
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,710
Additionally...

291
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,860
From time to time we could see he was consumed in his own thoughts.

292
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,920
And now we tell Ogata...

293
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,850
...who has been carrying the session with his high energy...

294
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,620
...about the article coming out tomorrow.

295
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,720
If this comes out, its over.

296
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,140
Here we tell Ogata about the article.

297
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,820
If this comes out, it's over.

298
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,600
Drinking with someone underage...

299
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,440
They wrote "say 'no, thank you' to alcohol."

300
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,930
They're using my joke as a pun.

301
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,370
It's over for me.

302
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,670
It's over if this is released.

303
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,020
This girl is 18 years old?

304
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,020
She's 18.

305
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,180
Didn't they look quite young?

306
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,380
No...I mean...

307
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,750
...young?  It looked like she had white hairs.

308
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,520
As if you'd drink with someone like that!

309
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,590
Kind of like white hairs...

310
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,590
Hmm...

311
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,130
Her skin didn't look very nice, either.

312
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,030
It wasn't nice.

313
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,060
Oh, and one more point:

314
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,480
Eh? What?

315
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,480
Here.

316
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,660
The borderline sexual harassment...

317
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,570
Did that really happen?

318
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,840
I don't think I did anything that was borderline sexual harassment...

319
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,180
I swear I didn't do anything!

320
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,940
I have a wife and kids.

321
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,150
I have 33 years left on my mortgage.

322
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,780
Do you think I would do something like that?

323
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,030
I'm not trying to accuse you.

324
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,760
...but right now, Yoshimoto can't deal with ANY lies.

325
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,300
Understood.

326
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,000
I mean, if you lie about something like this...

327
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,800
Yeah.

328
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,880
Can you clarify what is true and what isn't?

329
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,210
I did say "I'd tap that."

330
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,210
You said that?

331
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,600
I said it as a joke.

332
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,530
Man it's fun to go out drinking with some ladies.

333
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,380
I'd tap that!

334
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,410
I'd tap thaaaat!

335
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
What about her hair?

336
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,380
Did you smell it?

337
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,860
Yes, I think I smelled it.

338
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,030
In reality, Ogata didn't even touch their hair - let alone smell it.

339
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,300
For some reason he confessed to a crime he didn't commit.

340
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,360
Perhaps other false confessions come from being in this type of high-pressure situation.

341
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,200
Is it wrong to smell their hair?

342
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,270
Why? Is there a law?

343
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,760
If someone feels harassed...

344
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,160
...that's already sexual harassment.

345
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,140
By the way, what he actually did do once the girls left was...

346
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,610
(The actress' chopsticks)

347
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,680
May I?

348
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,610
Hey, stop it with those kind of jokes.

349
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,480
Wait, what? Eh? Eh? Eh?

350
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,110
He's taking it home.

351
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,150
Feels like we've seen this before, too.

352
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:54,120
Wait a minute, help me out here.

353
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,120
I'm not sure to what extent I can help, but...

354
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,750
...the article is being published.

355
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,030
I mean, there's really nothing I can do at this point, is there?

356
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,780
Perhaps he felt there was no way out of this situation.

357
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,990
At this moment...

358
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,160
Are all the other comedians being exposed too?

359
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,570
We should cover their faces.

360
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,410
If the story is coming out
anyway I'll take the fall.

361
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,980
We would all be screwed,
that's not necessary.

362
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,140
After that display of loyalty...

363
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,980
...we sent Ogata back on set to continue filming for today's gig.

364
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,980
And then...

365
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,980
Such a somber vibe!

366
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,670
The green room was like a funeral.

367
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:54,150
Let's take a look at the shoot where all the stars believe it will be shelved.

368
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,080
Please begin in 5...4...3...2...

369
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,920
It's completely different!

370
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,560
Two hours ago they started with so much energy.

371
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,340
Everyone's demeanor has calmed so much...

372
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,340
...it's like we're seeing a different show.

373
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,580
Ogata was hit particularly hard with the news.

374
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,160
So we're competing to see who can find as many good things about Venus Fort.

375
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,940
You can walk around freely and we'll share our answers later.

376
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,440
Let's go!

377
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,020
It looks like tears could stream down his face at any moment.

378
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,520
This is the worst.

379
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,540
And now...a segment with a forturne teller to see who has the best luck.

380
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,620
From here forward...what is going to happen...

381
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,810
...in terms of a career change?

382
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,930
Career change?

383
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,480
Yeah, I want to hear about a career change and whatnot.

384
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,930
Yeah.

385
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:05,050
Like, not as a comedian?

386
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,050
Yeah, I want to hear about non-entertainment stuff too.

387
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:10,060
Also, my kids...will I stop being able to see them?

388
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,090
Also, my kids...will I stop being able to see them?

389
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,090
What happened to you?

390
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,780
His thoughts are completely consumed by the scandal.

391
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,170
Did you see anything about me losing job opportunities?

392
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,640
No no no no...

393
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,640
Really? I'm talking comedy jobs.

394
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,750
Yeah, nothing like that.

395
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,710
So if I work hard, everything will go well?

396
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,710
It will.

397
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,580
That gave me some energy.

398
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,900
This is going to come true, right?

399
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,700
You're not energetic at all!

400
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,580
Is it really going to come true?

401
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,890
You're scary!

402
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,890
Are you sure?

403
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,770
At this point they have wrapped up filming for the day.

404
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,480
As the three of them were set to leave the building...

405
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,130
...we set up a fake journalist to ambush them.

406
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,630
How will they react?

407
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,350
Good evening, excuse me...

408
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,120
This is in regards to the underage drinking accusations.

409
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,450
Can these allegations be considered factual?

410
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,450
I apologize.

411
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,360
So you admit it? We can consider it the truth?

412
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,360
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,200
I mean...I didn't know about it...I'm sorry.

414
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,470
Do you feel bad for what you've done?

415
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,160
I mean... I...um...

416
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,460
Yes...um...

417
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,970
Yes.

418
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,310
I should have asked them properly.

419
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,410
Eh?

420
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,410
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,710
Is it Ogata? Who is it?

422
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,820
Is it Ogata?

423
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,820
It's me.

424
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,900
What? Me too.

425
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,500
They told me about that, too.

426
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,740
Wait, what?  Yasumura-san, too?

427
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,740
They told me a girl I had drinks with...

428
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,600
My manager told me between segments.

429
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,370
They said I sexually harassed them.

430
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,000
They accused me, too.

431
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,000
Oh, this is the exact same.

432
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,970
You can go, man.  We'll take care of this.

433
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,120
It happened to me, too.

434
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,220
Eh? What's going on?

435
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
Wait a second...

436
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,220
Wait a second...

437
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,750
What's going on?

438
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,750
It's me...

439
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,370
Wait a minute, what...

440
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,160
Here we step in to reveal the prank.

441
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,990
Oh, we got pranked!

442
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,990
Thank god, I'm so relieved!

443
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,060
I'm so glad!  This was a lie, right?

444
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,060
That was close!

445
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,830
It's not getting published, right?

446
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,370
Oh god, that's a relief!

447
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,640
I thought it was over.

448
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,350
What kind of feeling is this?

449
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,880
Staff: Do you know what show this is?

450
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,700
Eh...Dokkiri Grand Prix wouldn't do anything this messed up...

451
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,770
No, they wouldn't.

452
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,390
Wednesday Downtown.

453
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,390
That's correct.

454
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:57,560
The script said "Other TV Station!"

455
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,150
Are you allowed to do this?! I should sue you guys!

456
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,560
Let's sue them!

457
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,820
That is so wrong.

458
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,230
The script said !@#$

459
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,430
But I'm so relieved...

460
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,590
Seriously, so relieved.

461
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,140
I seriously thought I would have to get a divorce.

462
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,110
Staff: All's well that ends well, right?

463
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:17,410
But that was a close one.

464
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:21,150
If I was pressured more, I might have gone for it.

465
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,150
What?

466
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,950
You would have gone for it?

467
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,950
Yeah?

468
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,180
In conclusion, it was good they didn't go for it.

469
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,740
That was amazing!

470
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,870
All three of them got down in the dumps!

471
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,620
I don't want any of the viewers at home to be confused.

472
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,390
Those three did nothing wrong...

473
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,830
...and this show is seriously messed up.

474
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,260
They asked for their age, and didn't do anything bad.

475
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,660
It's a great educational video.

476
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,700
Even as a joke, licking the chopsticks...

477
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,420
...and doing this with the cup...

478
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,940
...that's seriously gross.

479
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,500
Do you guys do that?

480
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:04,400
Every comedian does that.

481
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,380
That's not true.

482
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,320
There's no reason to do that.

483
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,880
People who do that all become comedians.

484
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
Did you do that?!

485
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,400
Of course not!

486
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,100
Hamada-san definitely does it.

487
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,510
Does everyone do the "nipple cheers" as well?

488
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,310
That one was invented by Hamada.

489
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,310
What the hell?!

490
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,200
Hamada is the originator.
