Tanaka Naoki

7
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,050
Backstage before the recording session...

8
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,050
His hip hurts...

9
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,020
Whose?

10
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,050
Tanakas's.

11
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,950
I have pain in my lower back.

12
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,090
What happened?

13
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,220
Some time ago on this program, I had to carry Heipo on my shoulders...

14
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,260
Some time ago on this program, I had to carry Heipo on my shoulders...

19
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,130
Oh, that was quite a few years ago.

20
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,930
Uh, ten years...

21
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,030
Your back still hurts since then?

22
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,800
15... wasn't it around 20 years ago?

23
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,000
Sounds about right.

24
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,040
Seriously?

25
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,200
You should demand compensation.

26
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,040
From Heipo?

27
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,210
Should I write him a letter?

28
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,680
Make him face his consequences.

29
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,340
I can't do that.

30
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,280
Housei's here.

31
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,950
Good morning.

32
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,720
Greet us properly.

33
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,580
Sorry.

34
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,150
What the hell is "Yo, Yo"?

35
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,150
What's "Yo, Yo,"? You've got to greet us properly,

36
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,720
But the way I greeted you

37
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,820
Housei Tsukitei

38
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,090
was fit for a rapper.

39
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,160
I thought about it last night, and I've decided to become a rapper.

40
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,530
I've gotten a really good grasp on the Japanese language.

41
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,060
I've gotten a really good grasp on the Japanese language.

42
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,200
I've gotten a really good grasp on the Japanese language.

43
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,540
Since i've been trained in rakugo, I have great command of the
Japanese language and its rhythm. Isn't that perfect for rap?

44
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,170
Since i've been trained in rakugo, I have great command of the
Japanese language and its rhythm. Isn't that perfect for rap?

45
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,770
Since i've been trained in rakugo, I have great command of the
Japanese language and its rhythm. Isn't that perfect for rap?

46
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,710
Since i've been trained in rakugo, I have great command of the
Japanese language and its rhythm. Isn't that perfect for rap?

47
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
Let's head into town right now.

48
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,120
I'll be wearing this outfit, and when people
approach us from the front of town...

49
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,420
The 'front' of town?

50
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,420
The front...

51
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,320
You really have no grasp on this language!

52
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,690
The 'front' of town...

53
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,760
So once they approach us, I'll diss them.

54
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,730
So once they approach us, I'll diss them.

55
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,330
Oh?

56
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,160
I'll diss them one by one,

57
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,870
and maybe get into a few brawls.

58
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,070
And once they've been provoked, I'll traumatize them completely.

59
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,240
And once they've been provoked, I'll traumatize them completely.

60
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,970
With your rapping?

61
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,400
With my rapping.

62
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,640
So without using violence...

63
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,210
No, there won't be any violence.

64
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,640
No violence.

65
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,210
Just rapping.

66
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,010
I'll traumatize them all with my rapping skills.

67
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,610
So, could I get you all to get changed?

68
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,080
So, could I get you all to get changed?

69
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,250
We're not getting involved in this.

70
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,550
I don't know you.

71
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,890
Just more or less... Look. I'll do all the
talking, and you guys can be my hype men.

72
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,230
But I'll be doing everything, of course. I'll put on my toughest expression.

73
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,860
Agreed?

74
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,530
I have a feeling this won't be able to be broadcasted.

75
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,000
I have a feeling this won't be able to be broadcasted.

76
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,980
Can he win against people
in the shopping district!?

77
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,980

RAP BATTLE CHALLENGE

82
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
Amidst the terrible, rainy weather,

83
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,030
the member, who have finished changing,

84
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,490
follow Housei to the shopping district.

85
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,200
Is this really okay?

86
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,200
What is?

87
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,170
Can we rally diss our audience?

88
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,840
It's important that we keep an audience.

89
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,840
Wait a minute.

90
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,010
If you're wearing that you might get recognized, people will follow you.

91
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,910
Why am I the only one wearing a wig for disguise?

92
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,180
Why am I the only one wearing a wig for disguise?

93
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,180
Um, can you take the wig off, please?

94
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,950
Wait a minute, that's kind of...

95
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,950
It's a nice wig...!

96
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,220
We're disguised as rappers, It'll be fine.

97
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,220
We're rappers, aren't we?

98
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,350
Do you want to wear the wig that badly?

99
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,420
Do you want to wear the wig that badly?

100
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,490
No, no, no!

101
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,330
Wearing it is fine, right?

102
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,530
He really wants to wear it.

103
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,830
Just take that thing off already!

104
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,030
I'm begging you! Let's do this properly...!

105
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,770
Yes, you should.

106
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,770
You should.

107
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,630
He's definitely going to run off by himself!

108
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,670
No I'm not!

109
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,670
This undedicated person?

110
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,970
That's right!

111
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,470
Don't mess with me!

112
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,310
No sense of teamwork! None...!

113
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,310
What the hell...

114
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

115
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,810
LIGHTNING

116
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,810
m 0 0 l 500 0 500 150 0 150

117
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,440
Whoa!

118
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,580
That's loud!

119
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,150
Shouldn't we stop filming? It's going to be real noisy.

120
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,020
No, we're not stopping. This actually just builds the atmosphere.

121
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,420
Well, yeah. It'll raise the tension.

122
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,980
That's right. It adds to the vibe.

123
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,590
We haven't done anything like this for a
while so we've got to make a grand entrance.

124
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,660
That's right.

125
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,520
Even so...

126
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,890
We'll try our best.

127
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,590
Wait - wait - wait a minute.

128
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,760
Before we start, you need to be my hype men.
Can you give me a demonstration?

129
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,770
Be my hype men.

130
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,600
Yep. Just like that.

131
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,870
That's right.

132
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,610
I'm good at this, right?

133
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,910
Absolutely not.

134
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,910
It's like this, isn't it?

135
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,010
This rapping motion.

136
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,040
Like this.

137
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,540
Like this.

138
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,410
Let's go.

139
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,350
Honestly, Cocorico are doing the best.

140
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,420
Aren't they?

141
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,180
Yes!

142
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,050
So who's doing the worst?

143
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,260
You can tell just by watching. Isn't it obvious?

144
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,260
This colorful guy!

145
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,630
Apart from him, we're all good, aren't we?

146
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,300
So while I'm rapping, you'll be acting like...

147
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,400
Let's stop filming!

148
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,130
Let's stop!

149
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,470
Wouldn't it be better to just stop now?

150
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,470
Let's just go to a café.

151
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,440
We're still doing this.

152
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,870
This isn't the type of weather we can shoot in. Let's just go to a cafe.

153
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,540
The thunder will just get louder and louder.

154
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,180
Like "whaaaa!"

155
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,850
It's definitely gonna happen!

156
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,920
RAP BATTLE START

157
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,920
Amidst the rolling thunder, Housei's challenge starts now!

158
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,990
Say ho, ho!

159
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,760
It's coming along! Terrific!

160
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,320
He's getting into it!

161
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,330
Isn't this rapping project great?

162
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,060
But it probably looks like we're searching for a fight.

163
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,230
Alright, someone come at me!

164
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,370
Anybody will do.

165
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,840
Greengrocer

166
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,840
Housei Tsukitei

167
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,450
I've caught you! I've caught you!

168
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,620
I've caught you! I've caught you!

169
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,820
I've caught you outside with Gaki no Tsukai!

170
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,050
I've caught you outside with Gaki no Tsukai!

171
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,260
The peak in your career was 5 years ago!

172
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,220
The peak in your career was 5 years ago!

173
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,590
When you got whipped with some burdock 5 years ago!

174
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,630
When you got whipped with some burdock 5 years ago!

175
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,230
It's heating up!

176
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,800
He's saying some grand things.

177
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,370
What the hell do you know about the peak in my career?

178
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,570
What the hell do you know about the peak in my career?

179
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,670
You know absolutely nothing about me!

180
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,840
You know absolutely nothing about me!

181
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,340
Absolutely, absolutely nothing!

182
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,910
Absolutely, absolutely nothing!

183
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,970
Absolutely, absolutely nothing!

184
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,940
Oh, What the hell did you just say?

185
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,980
Oh, What the hell did you just say?

186
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,050
I couldn't hear what you said at all, YO!

187
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,550
I couldn't hear what you said at all, YO!

188
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,680
I couldn't hear what you said at all, YO!

189
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,320
This isn't going to happen today.

190
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,850
Alright, let's leave.

191
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,890
Alright, let's leave.

192
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,890
I'm not getting into this at all.

193
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,190
Your popularity has gone straight down!

194
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,460
Your popularity has gone straight down!

195
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,630
Your acting skills have gone straight down!

196
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,860
Your acting skills have gone straight down!

197
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,260
The only show you're a regular on is Gaki no Tsukai!

198
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,770
The only show you're a regular on is Gaki no Tsukai!

199
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,170
That's the simple truth! I pity you!

200
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,700
That's the simple truth! I pity you!

201
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,870
When you gonna quit? Quit Gaki no Tsukai!

202
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,970
When you gonna quit? Quit Gaki no Tsukai!

203
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,210
When you gonna quit? Quit Gaki no Tsukai!

204
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,740
When you gonna quit? Quit Gaki no Tsukai!

205
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,040
When you gonna quit? Quit Gaki no Tsukai!

206
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,680
When you gonna quit? Quit Gaki no Tsukai!

207
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,680
That guy scared me more than I expected.

208
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,780
That guy scared me more than I expected.

209
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,850
He went in hard.

210
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,950
He wrecked you!

211
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,260
What did I even say during that?

212
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,690
Nobody remembers. Not even the audience.

213
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,030
Nobody remembers. Not even the audience.

214
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,460
Nothing that you said left any kind of impression.

215
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,070
All I really heard was the thunder rolling up above.

216
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,730
It's probably gonna do that every time you get into a battle.

217
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,870
It's probably gonna do that every time you get into a battle.

218
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,870
Definitely.

219
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,870
DEFEATED

220
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,870
UTTERLY

221
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,670
With no good points in his rap, Housei was utterly defeated.

222
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,410
It's really pouring down.

223
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,780
It just keeps falling.

224
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,450
Let's quit!

225
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,780
We're not quitting.

226
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,080
Not quitting.

227
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,850
We're gonna keep at it?

228
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,650
I mean, if we were doing it outside I would want to quit too.

229
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,720
But we're not really outside.

230
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,920
We're doing it under the shade.

231
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,290
Someone's coming.

232
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,730
Oi, seriously?

233
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,260
Someone's coming.

234
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,000
You've got to be kidding.

235
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,700
Housei Tsukitei

236
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,700
Old lady

237
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,140
Summer this year has been ridiculously hot, it's pissing me off!

238
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,280
Summer this year has been ridiculously hot, it's pissing me off!

239
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,810
Summer this year has been ridiculously hot, it's pissing me off!

240
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,050
I can't sleep at night because I'm soaked with sweat,

241
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,310
I can't sleep at night because I'm soaked with sweat,

242
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,510
Mosquitoes bite me, it's itchy! Itchy!

243
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:16,980
Mosquitoes bite me, it's itchy! Itchy!

244
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,420
Mosquitoes bite me, it's itchy! Itchy!

245
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,350
My appetite goes down, somen is more than enough for one meal!

246
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,450
My appetite goes down, somen is more than enough for one meal!

247
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,720
My appetite goes down, somen is more than enough for one meal!

248
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,390
Yo, don't you think so too?

249
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,220
Yo, don't you think so too?

250
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,420
What the hell do you think?

251
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,060
What the hell do you think?

252
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,530
A chance!

253
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,830
This is your chance!

254
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,600
Make a comeback.

255
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,930
He can win this one.

256
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,130
They're on the same level.

257
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,770
Where is your house even at?

258
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,940
Where is your house even at?

259
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,440
Where is your house even at?

260
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,940
What you just said was completely wrong!

261
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,770
What you just said was completely wrong!

262
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,340
The location of your house is completely wrong!

263
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,140
The location of your house is completely wrong!

264
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,340
Do you even know why you have to go to work?

265
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,580
Do you even know why you have to go to work?

266
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,850
Do you even know why you have to go to work?

267
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,950
Most of your friends are bad people, Yo!

268
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,650
Most of your friends are bad people, Yo!

269
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,180
Most of your friends are bad people, Yo!

270
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,520
Most of your friends are bad people, Yo!

271
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,290
He sucks.

272
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,560
I'm fed up with how hot this summer has been!

273
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,430
I'm fed up with how hot this summer has been!

274
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,030
I'm fed up with my husband's low salary!

275
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,990
I'm fed up with my husband's low salary!

276
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,430
I'm fed up with my useless son!

277
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,130
I'm fed up with my useless son!

278
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:05,400
But Housei, I'm fed up with you the most!

279
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,000
But Housei, I'm fed up with you the most!

280
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,600
But Housei, I'm fed up with you the most!

281
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,200
But Housei, I'm fed up with you the most!

282
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,530
But Housei, I'm fed up with you the most!

283
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,470
Oh, that was good!

284
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,470
That was good.

285
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,030
Good-for-nothing summer!

286
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,000
Good-for-nothing summer!

287
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,270
Hey! Good-for-nothing summer!

288
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,370
Say something back.

289
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,910
Hey! Good-for-nothing summer!

290
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,910
Hey! Good-for-nothing summer!

291
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,840
Good-for-nothing summer!

292
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,380
Good-for-nothing summer!

293
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,280
Good-for-nothing summer!

294
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,250
He went along with it!

295
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,250
He's going
along with it!

296
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,910
Good-for-nothing summer!

297
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,680
Good-for-nothing summer!

298
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,850
She won.

299
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,420
Good-for-nothing summer!

300
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,090
Good-for-nothing summer!

301
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,750
Good-for-nothing summer!

302
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,090
Good-for-nothing summer!

303
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,820
I think she won.

304
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,420
Just now...

305
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,230
Good-for-nothing summer!

306
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,990
She beat you...!

307
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,530
Yep. You... you lost...!

308
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,860
Good-for-nothing summer!

309
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,770
She came up with a really good phrase, that "Good-for-nothing summer".

310
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,200
Good-for-nothing summer!

311
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,800
See, there she goes again.

312
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,810
Amazing.

313
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,310
I think your rap phrases lack originality.

314
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,610
You need phrases that people will take in.

315
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,180
You're not saying anything memorable.

316
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,080
Actually, I'm hungry so...

317
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,320
Actually, I'm hungry so...

318
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,250
I'm hungry so my rhythm is bad at the moment.

319
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,050
I'm hungry so my rhythm is bad at the moment.

320
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,120
So you're saying that you'll do better after you eat something?

321
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,890
That's right!

322
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,160
Let's head in here for a moment then.

323
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,730
For the sake of Housei, who claims that his rhythm is being
affected by hunger, the members take a break at a soba restaurant.

324
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,730
Thank you for waiting!

325
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,830
5 seiro sobas.

326
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,640
How do you think we went?

327
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,340
How do you think we went?

328
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,410
After we eat...

329
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,040
5 seiro sobas.

330
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,440
Ah... I dissed them real good.

331
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,410
Did he really?

332
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,710
No, I don't think you dissed them that well...

333
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,150
It kind of feels like you're at a disadvantage.

334
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,460
Housei stole that old lady's phrase at the very end there.

335
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,120
Thank you for waiting!

336
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,990
He took her best phrase and kind of went along
with it. Maybe he'll do better after we finish eating.

337
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,460
This soba looks delicious!

338
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,830
It's because I was hungry. I'm just hungry.

339
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,810
Housei Tsukitei

340
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,810
Salaryman

341
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:06,990
Yo, hold up, hold up, do we have here
the comedian who changed his name?

342
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,550
Yo, hold up, hold up, do we have here
the comedian who changed his name?

343
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,120
Yo, hold up, hold up, do we have here
the comedian who changed his name?

344
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,320
Yo, hold up, hold up, do we have here
the comedian who changed his name?

345
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,360
Yo, hold up, hold up, do we have here
the comedian who changed his name?

346
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,990
Your new name... uh... what was it again?

347
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,060
Your new name... uh... what was it again?

348
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,090
Your new name... uh... what was it again?

349
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,400
Your name change leaves no impression at all!

350
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,530
Your name change leaves no impression at all!

351
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,630
Your name change leaves no impression at all!

352
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,870
Your name change leaves no impression at all!

353
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,970
Nobody knows your new name!

354
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,070
Nobody knows your new name!

355
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,270
Nobody knows your new name!

356
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,270
Nobody knows your new name!

357
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,580
What's your name anyway?

358
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,080
What's your name anyway?

359
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,980
What the hell...

360
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,220
So you don't know my name?

361
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,280
So you don't know my name?

362
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,520
So you don't know my name?

363
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,620
Where did you guys even come from?

364
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,490
Where did you guys even come from?

365
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,490
Tell me, that's all I wanna know.

366
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,590
Tell me, that's all I wanna know.

367
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,790
Before we move on, Yo.

368
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,060
Where the hell did you guys come from?

369
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,130
Where the hell did you guys come from?

370
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,100
Where the hell did you guys come from?

371
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,400
Cause I have no idea.

372
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,640
No one cares about your new name!

373
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,840
No one cares about your new name!

374
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,970
No one cares about your new name!

375
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,910
No one cares about your new name!

376
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,240
No one cares about your new name!

377
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,240
No one cares about your new name!

378
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,410
What did he just say?

379
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,150
He dissed you hard.

380
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,750
Those two old ladies were great.

381
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,020
This is delicious.

382
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,090
About those old ladies just before... Were you
trying to get their addresses or something?

383
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,690
"Where did you come from?"...

384
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,660
That "Where did you come from?".

385
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,530
Can you really say that?

386
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,670
He sucks, doesn't he?

387
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,070
Absolutely.

388
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,740
Saying that is no good. He's really bad at this.

389
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,470
I didn't quite know what to say...

390
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,010
You had nothing to say?

391
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,240
I really didn't.

392
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,820
Defeated 3 times in a row with his unmemorable raps,
Housei heads into the shopping district once again.

393
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,990
Let's try to win at least once.

394
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,260
High school girls...

395
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,500
3 high school girls

396
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,500
Housei Tsukitei

397
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,300
Well, well, what do we have here? Yamasaki?

398
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:03,700
Well, well, what do we have here? Yamasaki?

399
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,670
Well, well, what do we have here? Yamasaki?

400
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,170
Totally boring as always (Obviously)

401
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,740
Totally boring as always (Obviously)

402
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,370
Totally boring as always (Obviously)

403
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,370
Totally boring as always (Obviously)

404
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:07,970
Well, well, haven't you gotten skinnier?

405
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:08,440
Well, well, haven't you gotten skinnier?

406
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,470
Well, well, haven't you gotten skinnier?

407
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:09,810
But in the end, you still look gross (Obviously)

408
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,440
But in the end, you still look gross (Obviously)

409
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,310
But in the end, you still look gross (Obviously)

410
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,380
But in the end, you still look gross (Obviously)

411
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,080
Tell him!

412
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,180
Y'all, y'all, what do y'all even know?

413
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,180
Y'all, y'all, what do y'all even know?

414
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,080
Y'all, y'all, what do y'all even know?

415
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,620
Y'all, y'all, what do y'all even know?

416
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,190
I don't think you know anything at all, Yo!

417
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,050
What do y'all even know?

418
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,350
What do y'all even know?

419
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,620
That's right, nothing at all!

420
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,790
Nothing! Your pigtails are dragging the value of your raps.

421
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,760
Nothing! Your pigtails are dragging the value of your raps.

422
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,730
Nothing! Your pigtails are dragging the value of your raps.

423
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,690
Nothing! Your pigtails are dragging the value of your raps.

424
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,460
Down, down, down, down!

425
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,030
Down, down, down, down!

426
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,200
Down, down, down, down!

427
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,300
Down, down, down, down!

428
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,370
Doesn't this suck?

429
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,040
He can't rap at all.

430
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,200
Baldy! Baldy! Baldy!

431
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,510
Baldy! Baldy! Baldy!

432
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,410
Baldy! Baldy! Baldy!

433
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,980
Baldy! Baldy!

434
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,980
Make a comeback!

435
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,950
Your body just keeps on deteriorating!

436
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,580
Your body just keeps on deteriorating!

437
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,680
Your body just keeps on deteriorating!

438
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,320
You're becoming an old man, hahaha!

439
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,820
You're becoming an old man, hahaha!

440
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,150
You're becoming an old man, hahaha!

441
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,650
Your sense of humor just keeps on deteriorating!

442
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,220
Your sense of humor just keeps on deteriorating!

443
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,390
Your sense of humor just keeps on deteriorating!

444
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:55,950
You're becoming an old man, hahaha!

445
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,590
You're becoming an old man, hahaha!

446
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,990
You're becoming an old man, hahaha!

447
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,290
Make a comeback, make a comeback!

448
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,730
He's crying.

449
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,070
He started crying.

450
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,600
Your face looks like Ichiro Mizuki.

451
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,410
Note: Ichiro Mizuki is a singer famous for writing anime theme songs.

452
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,810
After the break

453
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,810
That man joins the rap battle...

454
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:24,620
Who is the next opponent for Housei, who has not
been able to construct a memorable rap up until now!?

455
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,420
I'll heat up the opponent and then beat them down.

456
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,890
Housei Tsukitei

457
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,890
Mother and child

458
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,060
Seriously?

459
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,330
These kind of people are joining in?

460
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:34,830
Wow! Wow! It's Downtown!

461
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,630
Wow! Wow! It's Downtown!

462
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,860
Wow! Wow! It's Downtown!

463
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,300
Wow! Wow! It's Cocorico!

464
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,030
Wow! Wow! It's Cocorico!

465
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,260
Wow! Wow! It's Cocorico!

466

They're really, really, really cool!

468
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,530
They're really, really, really cool!

469
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,570
I love them, yay yay!

470
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:42,900
I love them, yay yay!

471
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,070
I love them, yay yay!

472
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,540
Boo, boo, Housei boo!

473
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,240
Boo, boo, Housei boo!

474
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,940
Boo, boo, Housei boo!

475
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,540
Boo, boo, Housei boo!

476
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,070

Boo, boo, Housei boo!

480
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,570
Really boring, seriously annoying!

481
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,380
Really boring, seriously annoying!

482
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,510
Really boring, seriously annoying!

483
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,380
Do your best, Housei!

484
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,550
Don't make such grand claims.

485
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,380
Don't make such grand claims.

486
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,490
While your nose is running! Your nose is running Yo!

487
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,720

No, that was nothing to celebrate.

529
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,090
You said nothing but "Your nose is running".

530
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,090
Don't say that.

531
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,420
You said nothing but "Your nose is running".

532
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,720
You didn't go with the rhythm at all.

533
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,520
That's right.

534
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,860
The only thing you said was "running, running, running, running"!

535
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,270
Eh?

536
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,800
Seriously?

537
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,670
Housei Tsukitei

538
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,670
Old man

539
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,270
Housei!

540
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,880
Listen to my dream yo, yay, yay!

541
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,180
Listen to my dream yo, yay, yay!

542
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,080
Listen to my dream yo, yay, yay!

543
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,250
Listen to my dream yo, yay, yay!

544
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,350
My dream is to collect figurines, yay, yay!

545
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,480
My dream is to collect figurines, yay, yay!

546
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,420
My dream is to collect figurines, yay, yay!

547
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,250
My dream is to collect figurines, yay, yay!

548
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,390
My dream is to collect figurines, yay, yay!

549
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,120
Housei, let me hear your dream too, yay!

550
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,060
Housei, let me hear your dream too, yay!

551
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,090
Housei, let me hear your dream too, yay!

552
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,030
Housei, let me hear your dream too, yay!

553
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,060
Housei, let me hear your dream too, yay!

554
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,160
My dream is to live in a room full of curtains, Yo!

555
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,300
My dream is to live in a room full of curtains, Yo!

556
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,960
My dream is to live in a room full of curtains, Yo!

557
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,470
My dream is to live in a room full of curtains, Yo!

558
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,630
Do you get it? Do you understand?

559
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,500
Do you get it? Do you understand?

560
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,670
I want a lot of curtains in my room!

561
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,610
And, you get it don't you?

562
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,110
And, you get it don't you?

563
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,980
And, you get it don't you?

564
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,480
I understand that much, yay, yay!

565
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,040
I understand that much, yay, yay!

566
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,810
I understand that much, yay, yay!

567
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,980
I understand that much, yay, yay!

568
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,350
I understand that much, yay, yay!

569
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,350
Let's fulfill our wishes!

570
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,550
Let's fulfill our wishes!

571
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,550
Thank you!

572
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,080
I'll try my best too.

573
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,220
I'll try my best too.

574
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,220
So Housei, try your best even when you lose, Yo!

575
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,120
So Housei, try your best even when you lose, Yo!

576
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,920
So Housei, try your best even when you lose, Yo!

577
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,560
Try your best, Yo.

578
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,360
Laters.

579
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,500
How did I do?

580
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,100
The part about the curtain was unnecessary.

581
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,500
The part about the curtain was unnecessary.

582
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,570
The moment you said that, you both started rapping together.

583
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,270
The moment you said that, you both started rapping together.

584
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,580
That 'curtain' part.

585
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,310
You've been sweating a lot though.

586
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,010
When I got to the bit about the curtain, I just exploded in a ball of sweat.

587
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,380
When I got to the bit about the curtain, I just exploded in a ball of sweat.

588
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,790
Well in the end,

589
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,860
we both found some common ground.

590
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,190
Common ground is no good.

591
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:25,030
But that's what rap is all about, isn't it?

592
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,470
Seriously, let's stop now.

593
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,140
Let's go back.

594
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,000
It just went "bang" up there.

595
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,070
Before we leave, Yo.

596
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,080
What the hell is up with you? What are you doing Yo?

597
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,810
What the hell is up with you? What are you doing Yo?

598
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,180
What the hell is up with you? What are you doing Yo?

599
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,280
At least say one word, Yo! What's with that face?

600
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,520
Housei Tsukitei

601
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,520
Producer Nakamura

602
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,990
What are you doing with that face? At least say one word, Yo!

603
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,550
What are you doing with that face? At least say one word, Yo!

604
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,650
What are you doing with that face? At least say one word, Yo!

605
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,460
I am, I am this show's producer.

606
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,430
I am, I am this show's producer.

607
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:56,990
You're just a comedian!

608
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,500
You're just a comedian!

609
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,430
Please come through.

610
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,400
How can you be making these unreasonable requests Yo, Yo, Yo!

611
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,170
How can you be making these unreasonable requests Yo, Yo, Yo!

612
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:01,670
How can you be making these unreasonable requests Yo, Yo, Yo!

613
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,000
How can you be making these unreasonable requests Yo, Yo, Yo!

614
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,340
Sorry.

615
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,310
We're sorry for the inconvenience.

616
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,310
Oi, tell me about your personality!

617
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,980
Oi, tell me about your personality!

618
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,880
Oi, tell me about your personality!

619
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,110
Oi, tell me about your personality!

620
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,280
What's your personality like, tell me Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo!

621
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,480
What's your personality like, tell me Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo!

622
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,650
What's your personality like, tell me Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo!

623
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:18,980

624
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,280
What's your personality like, tell me Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo!

625
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,850
What's your personality like, tell me Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo!

626
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,920
It's almost...

627
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,020
My, my personality is always the same.

628
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,190
My, my personality is always the same.

629
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,630
My, my personality is always the same.

630
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,360
My, my personality is always the same.

631
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,160
My, my personality is always the same.

632
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,070
That's it for today.

633
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,430
I've got guts, I've got guts, yay!

634
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,070
I've got guts, I've got guts, yay!

635
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,070
I've got guts, I've got guts, yay!

636
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,570
What guts? What guys?

637
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,340
What guts? What guys?

638
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,800
What guts do you have?

639
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,170
What guts do you have?

640
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,270
Tell me, what guts with that same old personality, Yo?

641
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,640
Tell me, what guts with that same old personality, Yo?

642
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,610
Tell me, what guts with that same old personality, Yo?

643
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,780
The way I act at work, at home, and anywhere else.

644
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,010
The way I act at work, at home, and anywhere else.

645
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,240
The way I act at work, at home, and anywhere else.

646
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,510
The way I act at work, at home, and anywhere else.

647
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,550
Is exactly the same!

648
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,020
Was today's project a success?

649
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,820
Was today's project a success?

650
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,950
Was today's project a success?

651
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,890
Even if it wasn't, I still did it!

652
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,690
Even if it wasn't, I still did it!

653
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,460
Even if it wasn't, I still did it!

654
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,360
I did it, Yo!

655
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,730
Look at that group of children.

656
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,960
What you just said makes no sense!

657
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,030
They're going to traumatize the children.

658
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,430
They're going to traumatize the children.

659
00:18:10,700 --> 00:19:10,390
Subbed by J-Hive

660
00:18:10,700 --> 00:19:10,390
j-hive.weebly.com

661
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,940
Yes

662
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,350
Few days ago in the meeting, Matsumoto-san said that

663
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,520
if we did a Kiki Starbucks, he'd get it hands down.

664
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,420
Do you remember saying that, Matsumoto-san?

665
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,130
Honestly, it ain't even funny...

666
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,190
so you'll get it right for sure.

667
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,860
There won't be anything happening.

668
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,630
Seriously, I'll get it right like nothing happened and just end it.

669
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,530
We'd like to see it.

670
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,900
That just goes to shows us how much you consume it.

671
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,900
Yes, yes.

672
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,370
Emergency Planning, Matsumoto's "Kiki Starbucks" Challenge!

673
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:57,520
Out of the 10 coffee shop chains, will Matsumoto identify Starbucks' coffee?

674
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,520
First of all, I can pretty much tell from the foam in the coffee.

675
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,490
You're doing it without sampling it first then.

676
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,490
Without sampling?

677
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,020
Looks like you've already got this one in the bag.

678
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,920
The ones without foam are wrong.

679
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,290
The ones without the foam isn't from Starbucks.

680
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,500
StarBucks' coffee has foam on top.

681
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:19,000
In that case, the ones out of the question are E and H.

682
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,570
"I" as well.

683
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,270
You can just exclude them.

684
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,440
We'll now be looking for the right one.

685
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,440
There's no foam.

686
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,080
You can stay in the back.

687
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:31,180
※ Please enjoy without knowing the correct answer

688
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,850
Please tell us the correct one.

689
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,650
You can take em off now, Matsumoto-san.

690
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,650
The ones without foam are wrong.

691
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,650
Yeah, yeah.

692
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,920
Starbucks' coffee has foam on top.

693
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,820
There's no refuting it!

694
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,260
Anyway, have a taste and tell us if it's wrong or...

695
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,560
It's not even going to be funny, is it alright?

696
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,000
We'd like to see you get it right.

697
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,900
You sure?

698
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,770
Yes.

699
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,630
Then I'll really get it, like nothing happened.

700
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,870
If I don't get it right then I might as well be dead.

701
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,480
If that happened, it'd be quite the surprise.

702
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,250
How about he never drinks from Starbucks again?

703
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,150
That's right.

704
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,420
Why don't we settle on it.

705
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,980
I'm totally fine with it.

706
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,050
No joke.

707
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,920
Totally wrong, what the hell is this?

708
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,490
Is it alright, going through it as usual?

709
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,930
Just don't say, 'I'm going to the store' midway through.

710
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,630
How many times a week do you drink coffee?

711
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,600
Do you have it daily?

712
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,500
I don't know about per week.

713
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,570
Yeah, sorry. It wasn't the right way to put it.

714
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,710
I've never thought it as weekly intake.

715
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,110
You drink a fair amount then, how many times a day is it?

716
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,650
I'd say, about 2 - 3 times a day.

717
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,620
2 - 3 times a day?

718
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,550
2 - 3 times a day?

719
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,920
So it isn't once a week.

720
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,820
Yeah, when he's coming to shoot for Gaki, he's at it right away.

721
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,920
Going by order, it seems.

722
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,530
Even so, since he hasn't sampled it...

723
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:54,630
This one is terribly wrong.

724
00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,570
This one too, totally wrong.

725
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,070
Not this either, it's too acidic.

726
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,450
I'm not sure about this one.

727
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,550
This isnt it either.

728
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,350
This is probably wrong.

729
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,220
Totally not it.

730
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,330
Sorry, this isn't gong to be any fun at all, since i'm going at it seriously.

731
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,830
Then, the ones on the bottom are still...

732
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,100
Those might be the one.

733
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,930
It's the last one now.

734
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,370
It's been narrowed down to three.

735
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Well then, it's gotta be amongst these three.

736
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,670
A, B, F.

737
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:41,650
Will Matsumoto be able to identify Starbucks' coffee out of the ten varieties?

738
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,450
It's been narrowed down to three.

739
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,380
Well then, it's gotta be amongst these three.

740
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,350
A, B, F.

741
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,520
Yeah.

742
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,950
He's taking it seriously, isn't he?

743
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,420
Yeah.

744
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,820
...in all earnestness.

745
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,490
B might be it.

746
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,570
Not this either.

747
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,940
A or B?

748
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,400
Whoa, damn!

749
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,040
So quick.

750
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,270
I've got it, right?

751
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,180
Can't say until you pick one.

752
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,320
B, it is.

753
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,290
B, is it?

754
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,160
Starbucks' coffee...

755
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,760
Please say it then... Starbucks' cofee is...

756
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,370
Starbucks coffee is B.

757
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,310
Just, what was that?

758
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,780
You suck!

759
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,580
Gimme a break!

760
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,280
Can this just not be aired?

761
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,880
Nope!

762
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,880
This will go on air.

763
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,290
Aren't you just something?

764
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,490
What now?

765
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,320
Want me to reveal the correct one?

766
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,590
The correct answer is G.

767
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,690
I'll just say this.

768
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,160
Starbucks has various blends.

769
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,260
It's not like they use the same beans.

770
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,170
It's different everyday.

771
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,740
What blend of Starbucks is this?

772
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,070
Coffee comes in a blend,

773
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,370
what I just drank could've been from Congo.

774
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,480
It's not the same everyday!

775
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,680
Are you all fuckin' idiots?

776
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,280
Go home!

777
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,350
You can't be serious.

778
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,120
Go home! Go home!

779
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,750
What's wrong with you?

780
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,750
Don't ever come back, idiots!

781
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,750
Go home!

782
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,820
He got angry instead.

783
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,190
Third-class comedians!

784
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
Go home!

785
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,490
Third-rates!

786
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,690
Go home, third-rates!

787
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,730
It was prepared since you're '1st-class'.

788
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,670
Go home, third-rates!

789
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,670
What's with him?

790
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,300
He got really angry instead.

791
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,170
This better not get aired!

792
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,740
For real?
