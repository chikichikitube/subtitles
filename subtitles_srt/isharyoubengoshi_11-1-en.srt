00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,050
You have one new message.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,930
This is your realtor.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,320
Your electronic payment for
last month's rent has not come through.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,500
Please make your payment to our account
by the end of the week at the very latest.

00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,490
Kanae-san!

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,080
Hakamada's assistant
Nonomura Kanae

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,100
It's your serial's one-year anniversary.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,300
Congratulations.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,610
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,360
Plus, look at this reader
survey from last month.

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,560
You're in third place.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,390
3rd place: "Divorce Chaser" Nonomura Kanae

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,390
Monthly Manday March Issue:
Author Popularity Rankings Based on Reader Survey

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,610
Wow!

17
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,660
This is the third consecutive month
you've been ranked third, too!

18
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,620
You're a full-fledged,
popular manga illustrator

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,250
and contributor to
Monthly Manday, now.

20
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,530
Nonomura-sensei.

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,900
Oh, don't call me that, please.

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,270
Chief editor of Tokiwa Publishers
Ueki

23
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,530
Nonomura-sensei,

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,370
Would you be interested in doing a serial
for the weekly publication of Manday?

25
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,310
Weekly Manday?

26
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,310
As you already know,

27
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,770
it's Tokiwa Publishers'
powerhouse manga magazine.

28
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,620
We publish five times the number of
issues of the monthly publication.

29
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,960
Your monthly serial is highly
regarded by our readers.

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,420
You can now move up as a
professional manga illustrator.

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,790
Editor at Tokiwa Publishing
Tabata Misato

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,610
Of course you'd have to end the
current serial, which is too bad.

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,780
In the final episode,

34
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,060
we want you to reveal
the protagonist's past,

35
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,220
You will be divorcing
your husband, then?

36
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,790
and bring the series to a
supreme and conclusive end!

37
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,570
You got a serial in Weekly Manday?

38
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,650
Amazing!

39
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,270
You've joined the ranks of top
manga illustrators, Nonomura-sensei.

40
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,710
The pay! How much do you make?!

41
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,380
Is that an appropriate question?

42
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,330
You're so lucky.

43
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,860
You'll be super rich now.

44
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,100
Freelance Investigator
Umemoto Kurumi

45
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,100
Plus, you get monthly compensation
from your ex-husband.

46
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,910
About that, he hasn't been depositing
the compensation fee lately.

47
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,400
What?

48
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,270
Really?

49
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,940
That's quite common.

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,650
Temp
Shinozuka Rina

51
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,360
When compensation gets divided
into monthly payments,

52
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,230
those men eventually fade out.

53
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,680
But even if you grow in
popularity, even if you get rich,

54
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,260
you have to make him keep paying.

55
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,320
That's right.

56
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,160
You can never get enough income.

57
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,390
Office landlord
Toyama Yoshie

58
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,110
I'll teach you how to rent out apartments!

59
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,660
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm still hesitant.

60
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,550
If I have to do a weekly serial,

61
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,800
I'd be too busy to continue
working here.

62
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,730
What?

63
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,170
Why are you hesitating about that?

64
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,050
That's right.

65
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,400
You should dump this place.
The faster, the better!

66
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,450
We don't get paid consistently, either.

67
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,800
I know, but...

68
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,220
Attorney
Hakamada Yukio

69
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,950
Anyway, let's celebrate
Kanae-chan's promotion today.

70
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,270
Sensei, pour some sake!

71
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,220
Wait...
Yoshie-san, not so fast, please!

72
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,050
I haven't received
Hakamada-sensei's permission, yet.

73
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,800
You have my complete approval.

74
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,220
What?

75
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,910
You were once my client,

76
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,130
but you carved out a path for yourself,
and are about to begin a new life.

77
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,500
What better news can there be?

78
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,770
Come on, Kanae-chan. Drink up.

79
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,410
Sensei, my glass is empty.

80
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,440
Sorry.

81
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,040
Hurry up. Sensei, why aren't
you drinking, too?

82
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,320
I can't drink.

83
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,820
You're seriously a bore of
a man, you know that?

84
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,750
Sensei, how come you never got married?

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,290
If you're not drinking, at least
entertain me with stories or something.

86
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,370
Kanae-chan, maybe you shouldn't...

87
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,610
Well, I've never felt the
need to get married...

88
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,240
Be honest. Tell the truth, would you?

89
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,980
Keep it coming.

90
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,430
Wait, I know!

91
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,990
You're gay? Gay?

92
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,210
No, I'm not!

93
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,260
I knew it! He's gay!

94
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,030
If they're busy, I can come back later.

95
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh... one moment please.

96
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,190
Kanae's ex-husband
Kurasawa Yoshihito

97
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,190
Cheers!

98
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,460
You know, it's because he's seen
so many failures come through his office.

99
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,850
"Failures"?

100
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,510
What?

101
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,300
Were you talking about me?

102
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,220
No, I didn't say anything about you.

103
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,020
Sure, my marriage was a failure.

104
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,270
But I chalked it up to experience,
you understand?

105
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,950
How could I have known that
husband was an adulterer?

106
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,000
Sensei, please come with me.

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,820
Oh, yes!

108
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,190
You can't escape me, Hakamada!

109
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,070
We have a client.

110
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,920
A client?

111
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,650
Y-Yoshihito-san?

112
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,160
It's been a while.

113
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,530
What are you doing here?

114
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,400
Oh, well,

115
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,900
I work here now.

116
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,730
Sorry I've been late on
compensation payments.

117
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,670
What?

118
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,590
You came here to tell me that?

119
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,450
Actually, I came to consult
Hakamada-sensei today.

120
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,120
Me?

121
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:50,720
Divorce Chaser
~Let's Turn Your Tears into Money~

122
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,900
Divorce Chaser Episode 11
An unsurmountable crisis!!
A formidable attorney enters the scene

123
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,460
Hakamada-sensei.

124
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,740
I apologize for having caused
you trouble in the past.

125
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,890
No...

126
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,150
So, what can I do for you?

127
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,590
Well...

128
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,720
it's about another
compensation lawsuit.

129
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,480
Compensation?

130
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,880
That guy never learns.

131
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,040
He must've cheated again.

132
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,780
He's sick, that's all. Sick.

133
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,930
He's truly divorce material.

134
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,340
Right, Kanae-san?

135
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,080
Um...

136
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,460
It wasn't me who was cheating.

137
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,250
You heard us?

138
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,520
Sorry.

139
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,980
The one caught cheating was...

140
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,580
my wife, Shiori.

141
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,300
Shiori-san...

142
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,310
Yoshihito's wife
Kurasawa Shiori

143
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,330
How do you do.

144
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,780
Soon after my divorce with Kanae was official,

145
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,980
we legalized our union.

146
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,610
But I had a monthly
compensation fee to pay,

147
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,970
and couldn't afford to give her
the kind of life she expected.

148
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,370
Do you like this? Isn't it cute?

149
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,840
How much was it?

150
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,250
It was on sale. It wasn't much.

151
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,210
About 50,000 yen.

152
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,900
Didn't I tell you we don't have
that kind of money right now?

153
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,470
Oh. Sorry.

154
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,590
Eventually cracks started
showing in our marriage.

155
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,590
I'm home.

156
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,820
I'm going to a dinner party with friends tonight!!

157
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,860
And then, I received an envelope
with a letter from a lawyer.

158
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,200
Compensation lawsuit for damages
incurred from illicit activities

159
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,240
Shiori was accused of
illicit activities.

160
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,670
illicit activities

161
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
3 million yen in damages

162
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,950
Three million yen in compensation?!

163
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,700
Yes.

164
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,020
My wife's illicit partner had a wife.

165
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,120
It was the wife who filed
the lawsuit against Shiori.

166
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,620
Is that what you call
a double-adultery?

167
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,240
Your wife never learns.

168
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,780
She's the kind who wants
what she can't have.

169
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,060
Has Shiori-san admitted
to illicit activity?

170
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,830
Yes.

171
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,380
Yeah.

172
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,220
I did it.

173
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,840
What were you thinking?

174
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,630
It's all your fault.

175
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,810
Our married life wasn't what
you promised it would be.

176
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,340
Shiori!

177
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,310
My wife moved in with
her parents after that.

178
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,290
We're living separately now.

179
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:36,900
I see.

180
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,150
We have no savings,

181
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,420
or any means of paying
for compensation, either.

182
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,230
I was wondering if you
could help me somehow.

183
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,590
Are you sure you
want me to help you?

184
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,010
After all, I'm the one

185
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,830
who slapped you with an
exorbitant lawsuit in the first place.

186
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,240
Actually, it was because of that,
that I am now seeking your help.

187
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,930
We're scheduled for a talk with the
other party's legal representative soon.

188
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,120
I was hoping you could
sit in on the session.

189
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,800
Hakamada Law Office

190
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,900
Today's the day.

191
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,000
Of what?

192
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,350
You know, the meeting with your ex-husband.

193
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,910
The other lawyer's
coming here today, too.

194
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,030
I see.

195
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,750
Kanae-san, are you okay with this?

196
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,130
With what?

197
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,670
Hakamada-sensei is going to represent
your ex-husband's obnoxious wife.

198
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,660
That's Hakamada-sensei's
decision to make, not mine.

199
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,380
Excuse us.

200
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,300
You don't have to hide.

201
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,540
Good to have you here.

202
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,830
Please come this way.

203
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,700
Huh?

204
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,040
This is your lawyer?

205
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,690
It has been a while.

206
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,410
I'm Hakamada, attorney at law.

207
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,380
Wait a second, here.

208
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,220
Why's it have to be this guy?

209
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,840
Huh?

210
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,550
And what's your ex-wife doing here?

211
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,700
Well... she's been working here.

212
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,790
You've been seeing your ex, huh?

213
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,650
And you have the nerve
to berate me for cheating.

214
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,770
That's not how it is, Shiori.

215
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,730
Before we have our discussion
with the other party's attorney,

216
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,460
I have a few questions for Shiori-san.

217
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,720
I have nothing to say to you.

218
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,470
Huh?

219
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,180
Our married life was ruined
because of this guy.

220
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,800
Can't we find another lawyer?

221
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,610
Hakamada-sensei is
an outstanding lawyer.

222
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,860
He's on our side now.

223
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,230
Your ex-wife is working
at this office, too, right?

224
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,920
She might sabotage us out of revenge.

225
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,950
No, that kind of thing will not happen.

226
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,900
Anyway, I refuse.

227
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,960
I'd rather pay the lawsuit
and get divorced.

228
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,150
I want a fresh start,
as soon as possible.

229
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,110
Pardon me.

230
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,340
Oh, yes?

231
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,550
I am Honjo Yayoi-san's
legal representative,

232
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,090
Karasuma Keiko.

233
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,870
Hakamada-san?

234
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,740
It's you, isn't it, Hakamada-san?

235
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,890
It has been a while.

236
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,960
Even when I heard "Hakamada Law Office,"
I never expected...

237
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,270
But, you're still practicing law.

238
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,330
You know each other?

239
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,610
Yes.

240
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,110
Sort of.

241
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,490
Sieg Law Office attorney
Karasuma Keiko

242
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,480
We worked at the same law firm
before I went solo.

243
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,180
You were very kind to me, then.

244
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,910
You were a corporate lawyer, too?

245
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,290
Yes.

246
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,230
In fact, I still specialize
in corporate law.

247
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,030
I'm the in-house attorney
for Honjo Industries

248
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,180
presided over by my client,
Honjo Takashi-san,

249
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,850
who has requested that
I represent his wife in this case.

250
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,290
Hakamada-sensei,

251
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,850
I look forward to working with you.

252
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,720
Hakamada
Law Office

253
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,710
Will your client be joining us today?

254
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,460
Yayoi-san

255
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,730
suffered a physical breakdown after she
discovered her husband's affair.

256
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,490
She will not be joining us today.

257
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,900
I see.

258
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,280
Kanae-san.

259
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,660
You're curious, aren't you?

260
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,030
No, not really.

261
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,880
I'm going to go hunt for material.

262
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,280
Well then, to begin...

263
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,960
please have a look.

264
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,900
These are only a part of
the evidence of the illicit affair.

265
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,280
You have been seeing him with
some frequency, documented here.

266
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,810
Adultery investigation report

267
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,020
So many times...

268
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,890
Can everything listed here be proven?

269
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,860
Yes.

270
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,750
Care to have a look?

271
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,590
I will study it later.

272
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,630
Based on our evidence,

273
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,130
we are suing Shiori-san
for five million yen in compensation.

274
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,630
Five million?!

275
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,300
Isn't that higher than the figure
you gave me the other day?

276
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,820
Yayoi-san and Takashi-san are getting
a divorce due to his illicit affair.

277
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,290
As a result,

278
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,130
Yayoi-san has suffered
psychological illness.

279
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,250
Hence, this trauma was added
in the compensation fee.

280
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,180
Just a moment.

281
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,990
Is there a causal connection between
the illicit affair and mental illness?

282
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,460
Shiori-san.

283
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,960
When did you start seeing Takashi-san?

284
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,220
I don't remember.

285
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,790
According to Takashi-san,
it started six months ago.

286
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,230
Yayoi-san discovered
it four months ago.

287
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,470
This is the doctor's diagnosis report.

288
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,340
The time coincides with her
being diagnosed with depression.

289
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,710
Diagnosis
Mrs. Honjo Yayoi
Ailment: Depression
The above named upon examination has been diagnosed with severe and self-harming depression. We suggest protective hospitalization for one month to monitor her condition.

290
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,660
There is no question that
the situation impacted Yayoi-san.

291
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,590
Why am I being blamed for that?

292
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,930
Takashi-san came onto me first.

293
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,080
Actually, not according to this.

294
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,200
Shiori

295
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,200
Takashi-san r u free next week??

296
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,200
Yes.

297
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,390
This side is Shiori-san's texts,

298
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,740
the other is Takashi-san's.

299
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,200
I want us to go to Yokohama next time <3
There's a super yummy pancake place there.

300
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,740
It is clear from this that Shiori-san
was the active initiator.

301
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,430
Take me out for lunch today

302
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,430
Understood.

303
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,430
Understood.

304
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,440
Those aren't real.

305
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,120
You can fabricate texts.

306
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,890
Fabrications, you say.

307
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,350
Shiori-san, may I see your cell phone?

308
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,810
Perhaps the same conversation
is in the history.

309
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,190
Takashi-san r u free next week??

I want us to go to Yokohama next time <3
There's a super yummy pancake place there.

Take me out for lunch today

310
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,190
Yes.

Understood.

Understood.

311
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,680
Oh yeah.

312
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,620
I forgot because we always
talked on the phone instead.

313
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,590
Then prove to us that you have
had those phone conversations.

314
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,110
Prove? How?

315
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,800
Do you have any recorded conversations?

316
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,110
Who records phone conversations?!

317
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,280
Sensei.

318
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,090
I understand the case you are making.

319
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,080
We will examine the material,

320
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,790
and respond to you accordingly.

321
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,360
However, five million yen

322
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,200
is beyond Shiori-san's means.

323
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,090
I believe you would
have to reconsider it.

324
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,960
You're not just trying to
buy time, I hope?

325
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:44,830
Yes.

326
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,520
Um...

327
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,220
I have a question.

328
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,760
That compensation fee...

329
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,720
Am I the only one liable for it?

330
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,810
Fundamentally, that would be the case.

331
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,220
However,

332
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,580
where you get the money
is not our concern.

333
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,240
I understand.

334
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,700
Hey, can I be sure this
Sensei is trustworthy?

335
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,520
He didn't even argue in my favor.

336
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,930
Well, that was a waste of time.

337
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,770
I apologize for her rudeness.

338
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,850
Do you think we stand
any kind of chance?

339
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,870
To be frank,

340
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,750
we are at a disadvantage.

341
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,030
You might have to brace yourselves
to pay the compensation.

342
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,320
I understand.

343
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,160
Goodbye.

344
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,180
Honjo

345
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,910
I had a conference with the other
party's legal representative.

346
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,690
Takashi's wife
Honjo Yayoi

347
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,190
Thank you.

348
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,950
And how did that go?

349
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,510
You can leave now,

350
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll hear what she's got to say.

351
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,750
But I'm her client—

352
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,920
Never mind. You don't need to butt in.

353
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,230
Shiori's illicit partner
Honjo Takashi

354
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,600
I understand.

355
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,100
So?

356
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,320
What did they say about the
increased compensation fee?

357
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,300
There is no problem.

358
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,150
The other party made only one statement.

359
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,720
That it would be difficult
to make the payment.

360
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,630
I see...

361
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,090
But it was merely
an appeal to sympathy.

362
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,290
There are many ways to extract
compensation from her.

363
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,090
I made the right decision
hiring you for the job.

364
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,250
And it's not even your specialty.

365
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,520
You're splendid.

366
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,950
Speaking as an attorney,

367
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,250
divorce cases are the easiest.

368
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,400
If we are well prepared,
our victory is assured.

369
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,660
Your instill me with confidence.

370
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,410
By the way, I hear you're
acquainted with the other lawyer.

371
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,380
Yes.

372
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,980
Lucky me, too.

373
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,450
He is an easily-defeated opponent.

374
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,320
Glad to hear it.

375
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,760
Now,

376
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,680
until the compensation
agreement is finalized,

377
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,260
you must continue living
together with your wife.

378
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,160
Yeah.

379
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,360
Yayoi, did you hear that?

380
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,420
It's only because you'll need
the money after our divorce.

381
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,650
Yes.

382
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,680
I know.

383
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,140
What's that?

384
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,640
We've got trouble.

385
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,450
Sensei is baking good bread.

386
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,080
What?

387
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,420
Try it for yourself.

388
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,670
It's better than the highest quality
bread at the Imperial Hotel.

389
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,220
You're right. It's delicious.

390
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,320
Which can only mean...

391
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,060
Yeah.

392
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,320
His anxiety this time is
also of the highest quality.

393
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,940
Excuse us.

394
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,660
Wait. Hold on, Shiori.

395
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,130
They sent me this.

396
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,070
Provisional seizure notice

397
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,080
A provisional seizure notice...

398
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,360
What's that?

399
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,090
It's possible to seize the other
party's assets even before a trial,

400
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:30,520
Notice proclaiming seizure of properties and income before trial.

401
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:30,520
Provisional seizure notice

402
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,200
by simply reporting the
illicit activities to a court.

403
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:34,480
This implies Shiori-san's future
income will be garnished.

404
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,550
Huh? They can take her income, too?

405
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,760
They can garnish up
to 25% of her income.

406
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,260
I can't make a living
if they take that much.

407
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,030
And that's not all.

408
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,000
There's a provisional seizure notice
of the bank account in Shiori's name.

409
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,770
You had said you had no savings.

410
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,340
This was a fund we kept
for our wedding ceremony.

411
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,150
Authorization for seizure, index
Amount total: 2 million yen

412
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,680
Because we haven't had one yet.

413
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,160
I moved my savings to her account,

414
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,440
and we've been adding to it since.

415
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,350
Do I have to give it to them?

416
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,270
Yes,

417
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,140
if the compensation lawsuit
becomes officially recognized.

418
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,380
But, that's where you come in, right?

419
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,310
I don't know what to tell you...

420
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,960
I told you we should
go to another lawyer.

421
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,530
Huh?

422
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,820
What's so good about this guy?

423
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,790
They're beating the crap out of him.

424
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,470
Come on. Stop it.

425
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,360
No, Shiori-san is correct.

426
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,020
So for this particular case,

427
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,020
I think you should consult
a different lawyer.

428
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,550
Sensei.

429
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,600
I'm back.

430
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,920
Welcome back.

431
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,670
Where is Hakamada-sensei?

432
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,880
He got a call, and dashed out.

433
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,590
I see.

434
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,330
How's the weekly manga serial going?

435
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,970
Well, so-so.

436
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,320
What was that reaction?

437
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,250
It seems you're not making
any progress with it.

438
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,930
Are you bothered by your
ex-husband's situation?

439
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,030
It's not anything you need
to be concerned about.

440
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,480
That husband's only
reaping what he's sown.

441
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,580
It's not him I'm concerned for,

442
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,160
it's Hakamada-sensei.

443
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,770
Hakamada-sensei?

444
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,660
Yes.

445
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,700
Something's not quite right
with Hakamada-sensei.

446
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,530
Especially after he met
the other's party's lawyer.

447
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,860
Who was it?

448
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,850
Someone called Karasuma-san,

449
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,450
from the Sieg Law Office.

450
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,640
What?!

451
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,140
Could that be Karasuma Keiko?

452
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,250
Yes.

453
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,060
Do you know her?

454
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,320
Karasuma Keiko is...

455
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,250
Hakamada-sensei's ex-lover.

456
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:56,610
What?

457
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,970
Ten years ago,

458
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:03,540
Hakamada-sensei was working at a
firm specializing in corporate law.

459
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:05,230
Attorney at law
Hakamada Yukio

460
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,490
10 years ago

461
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,640
He was an outstanding new
lawyer, with a lot of promise.

462
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,360
He was in charge of forty
clients at the time.

463
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,260
Hakamada-san,

464
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,200
the damages lawsuit of
Asabishi Brokerage...

465
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,980
Karasuma Keiko was working
on the same team at the time.

466
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,720
They worked perfectly
with each other.

467
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,910
The two of them won every case
they fought together as a team.

468
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,480
Ready for the shot?

469
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,910
Strike a pose...

470
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,900
They soon got closer and closer...

471
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,400
That's enough pictures of me.

472
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,430
Let's ask someone to take
a picture of us together.

473
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,530
Don't mind me.

474
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,460
Okay, one more.

475
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,340
I think Hakamada-sensei was
planning to get married to Keiko.

476
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,530
Please marry me.

477
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,150
But...

478
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,880
What's the meaning of this?

479
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,430
That's a client who is negotiating with our firm.

480
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,630
And that's not all.

481
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,520
How many relationships have you had?

482
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,500
Please tell me.

483
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,190
Division Manager's Office

484
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,020
Excuse me.

485
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,680
Division Manager, you wanted to see me?

486
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,940
Karasuma-kun told me everything.

487
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,540
I'm disappointed in you, Hakamada-kun.

488
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,010
Huh?

489
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,900
You're a professional attorney,

490
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,760
and you're stalking your coworker?

491
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,450
Stalking?

492
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,970
No, that's not it.

493
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,440
We've been seeing each other
for six months now and—

494
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,080
That is false.

495
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,450
It was all in Hakamada-san's own head.

496
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,020
What are you saying?

497
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,120
It's all this man's delusions.

498
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,030
There's no proof whatsoever
that I've been seeing him.

499
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,160
I do have proof of that...

500
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,400
And there was no photo, no email

501
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,200
that would have proven
their relationship...

502
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,130
They were all gone.

503
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,430
It was as if she had
anticipated what was coming.

504
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,490
Hakamada-sensei was falsely
accused of stalking ten years ago,

505
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,720
and was fired from the law firm.

506
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:49,330
Karasuma Keiko took over
all of Hakamada-sensei cases.

507
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,430
She used Hakamada-sensei
as a stepping stone

508
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:58,010
to get promoted at the law firm.

509
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,820
What did Hakamada-sensei do after that?

510
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,330
Bad rumors about him spread,

511
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,270
and he couldn't work in
corporate law any more.

512
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,580
A little while later,

513
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,770
Hakamada-sensei opened this law office.

514
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,370
He wanted to save people

515
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,920
from the same kind of pain he endured.

516
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,730
So that's why he decided
to become a divorce lawyer.

517
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,240
Karasuma-san.

518
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,120
I'm glad you accepted my
invitation, Hakamada-san.

519
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,970
What would you like to drink?

520
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,660
I don't want anything.

521
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,480
A glass of water, please.

522
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Yes, sir.

523
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,610
I remember. You don't drink.

524
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,760
I came here because you said

525
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,650
you had information
concerning the current case.

526
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,210
I'm not really interested
in husband-wife squabbles.

527
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,060
We all know who will win, anyway.

528
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,740
Thank you for waiting.

529
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,830
On another note,

530
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,620
would you be interested
in joining our firm?

531
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,040
You have some nerve, asking me that.

532
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,880
Come on, Hakamada-san.

533
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,990
You didn't become a lawyer
to handle divorce cases, right?

534
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,060
It's a lot of tedious
work with little payoff.

535
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,600
Oh, and I did a background
check of your office.

536
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,480
About two or three clients per month...

537
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,830
After deducting all expenses,
you must be flat broke.

538
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,020
If you join our firm,

539
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,240
you'll make ten times
what you're making now.

540
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,230
That is, judging by your ability.

541
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,480
I don't practice law for the money.

542
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,200
What do you do it for, then?

543
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,200
Oh, yes. I remember what you
said a long time ago...

544
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,780
"The work of the attorney is
to walk in your clients' shoes,

545
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,170
and discover the best
ways to help them."

546
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,170
But can you say the same for
clients with malicious intent?

547
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,290
Lawyers can't choose their clients.

548
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:25,370
We are obligated to protect even
those we'd rather not protect.

549
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,440
Justice is a relative thing.

550
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,440
Therefore our sole concern
is whether we win or lose.

551
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,290
There's no justice beyond that concern.

552
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,460
Are you...

553
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,670
still holding a grudge from that time?

554
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,030
I was desperate, then.

555
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,830
I wanted to further my career a lawyer.

556
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,720
But...

557
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,500
When it came to you,

558
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,280
it wasn't like I got close to you
just to use you.

559
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,520
My feelings for you were genuine—

560
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,760
Let's not talk about that.

561
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,840
Anyway,

562
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,810
drop by our office if you want a job.

563
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:24,700
Um...

564
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,960
Excuse me.

565
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,570
That lady who was with you?

566
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,410
She left without paying.

567
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,540
Hakamada Law Office

568
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,960
Where were you?

569
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,500
I should ask you. What are
you doing here so late?

570
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,640
Waiting for you, Hakamada-sensei.

571
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,520
Waiting for me?

572
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,960
Please don't turn Yoshihito-san down.

573
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,890
As I have already explained,

574
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,570
he doesn't stand a chance.

575
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,770
Is that because your opponent
is Karasuma Keiko-san?

576
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:16,930
Yoshie-san told me about
your past history with her.

577
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,420
She did it again...

578
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,520
Are you going to compromise your
fortitude for something like that?

579
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,430
This isn't like you.

580
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,200
You have always put yourself
in your clients' shoes, always!

581
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,840
Then you'd always find the
best ways to help them.

582
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,660
But not this time around.

583
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,970
The opposing lawyer was your ex,

584
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,980
so you're cowering and running away!

585
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,740
You're just trying to
protect yourself!

586
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,860
That is not true.

587
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,370
Why did you refuse him, then?!

588
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,140
Because he doesn't stand a chance?

589
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,860
Those aren't Hakamada-sensei's words.

590
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,010
I read this month's issue.

591
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,490
The protagonist's crisis
in the story is trite.

592
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,560
What?

593
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,800
It makes me wonder if you can
handle a weekly serial.

594
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,120
Now, how did that feel,

595
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,260
to hear an opinion from
an absolute amateur?

596
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,330
You're doing the same thing to me.

597
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,020
If you have time to be
concerned about my work,

598
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,010
you should be getting ready
for your weekly serials instead.

599
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,420
I don't want to hear the opinions

600
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,620
of someone getting ready to quit.

601
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,980
Understood.

602
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,720
But before I quit,

603
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,490
I'm going to take over
this case, and settle it.

604
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,520
There's nothing
that you could do.

605
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,430
I have been watching you
work for a whole year now.

606
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,320
I know the methods you've
used to help your clients.

607
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,850
I know them very well.

608
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,820
So, I'm going to help that client,

609
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,630
the way that you would do it.

610
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,340
Sorry to say,

611
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,210
but I agree with Kanae-chan's opinion.

612
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,440
The way you've been lately,
Hakamada-sensei...

613
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,720
is not like Hakamada-sensei at all.

614
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,860
Not only have you not put
yourself in your client's shoes...

615
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,780
You don't even understand
Kanae-san's feelings, do you?

616
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,880
What do you mean?

617
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,950
Kanae-san turned down
the weekly syndication.

618
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,590
Why?

619
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,780
She said she didn't want to discontinue
the monthly Divorce Chaser manga.

620
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,370
To succeed as a manga illustrator,

621
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,970
weekly serials are the fastest track.

622
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,220
Instead,

623
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:59,740
she said she wants share what
she learns at this law office,

624
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,750
with all her readers.

625
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,000
She wants to help people, too,

626
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,360
using whatever means
she has at her disposal.

627
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,600
In the same way that you
hepled her, Hakamada-sensei.

628
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:23,880
Kanae-chan must be pulling out
her hair, seeing you like this.

629
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,880
You will pay the
compensation!

630
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,880
Of all the men
I have ever met ...

631
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,880
you are a "dumb man"
of the highest order.

632
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,160
And yet, notwithstanding, you haven't
asked Kanae-san's forgiveness,

633
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,070
not even once.

634
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,130
I have no intention of lessening the
compensation for a person like you.

635
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:04,430
Ichikawa-san. You truly
are in pain, correct?

636
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,550
Yes.

637
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,930
In that case,

638
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,740
it is only proper we
demand compensation.

639
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,450
You're nothing but a third-rate
ambulance chaser!

640
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,450
I have representation by a first-rate law firm, you're in for a treat!

641
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,030
Can you stand living
with him as you have,

642
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,200
for the next 25 years?

643
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,180
I can't do it.

644
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,690
In that case,

645
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,730
all we can do is forge ahead.

646
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,230
The total membership fees
and compensation...

647
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,120
you will pay, won't you?

648
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,380
After all, you shallowly judge
people based on appearances...

649
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,700
you're not qualified to
oversee human encounters.

650
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:53,850
I never turn anyone down
if they are truly in need.

651
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,200
You have always put yourself
in your clients' shoes, always.

652
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,760
Then you'd always find the
best ways to help them.

653
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,850
Because he doesn't stand a chance?

654
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,520
Those aren't Hakamada-sensei's words.

655
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,340
I'm glad you came, Hakamada-san.

656
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,210
Thank you for yesterday.

657
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,360
Since you're here,

658
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,000
I assume you're accepting my offer?

659
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,650
No.

660
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,530
With regard to the offer,

661
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,290
I respectfully decline.

662
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:36,820
What?

663
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,860
I came here today because there
is something I want to tell you.

664
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,730
And what could that be?

665
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,600
First of all, please give me 1,200 yen.

666
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:51,460
Huh?

667
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,380
That's the charge for the
glass of wine you drank.

668
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,250
It's fine to put on airs
and walk out of the bar...

669
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,630
but you should pay for
your own beverages.

670
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,310
Still as petty as ever...

671
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,960
And I believe we will be suing
your client, Honjo Yayoi-san's husband,

672
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,920
Honjo Takashi-san.

673
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,020
Are you joking?

674
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,630
You don't stand a chance.

675
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,940
A lawyer who turns down clients

676
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,820
because he believes he
doesn't stand a chance...

677
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,670
is not a lawyer in my books.

678
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,050
I know I'm overstepping
my bounds, but...

679
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,410
you should be prepared to lose.

680
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,630
Your change.

681
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,900
The shocking final episode

682
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:05,570
Next episode

683
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,590
I am prepared
for disbarment.

684
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,450
Now that it's gone to court,

685
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,070
The final battle, laying his life as an attorney on the line

686
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,880
there's no way you can win.

687
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,630
Damn, she got us good.

688
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,670
What will be Hakamada Yukio's fate?!

689
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,080
I won't take
this lying down.

690
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:09,440
This drama is a work of fiction

691
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,820
Now, let me make a counterargument.
