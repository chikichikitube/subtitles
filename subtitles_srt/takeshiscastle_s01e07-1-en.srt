00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,170
THIS PROGRAM WAS PRODUCED
UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MEDICAL EXPERTS,

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,870
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HEALTH
AND SAFETY OF THE STAFF AND CONTESTANTS.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,570
TAKESHI'S CASTLE
THE COUNT'S TOWER

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,530
At last, the final battle is here!

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,730
We've reached the final battle,

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,370
but we'll continue to talk
to the AI count?

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,270
Because the count has been missing,
we have no choice.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,230
We call it AI, but we know it's Matsumura.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,000
Don't say that.
Maybe some people don't know.

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,130
Is it really okay?

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,430
Shall we call Matsumura?

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,630
No. Let's call AI Takeshi.

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,200
Hey, don't make fun of me.

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,530
He's angry.

15
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,670
The count has been missing.

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,600
But can we go on like this?

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,570
Hey! What?

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,170
What's going on?

19
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,370
-Hey!
-The AI is out of control.

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,530
-Wow!
-Oh dear!

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,800
It exploded.

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,700
That's not good.
Now AI Takeshi is gone, too.

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,470
What will we call this castle now?

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,770
What's going on?

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,370
What?

26
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,600
Sorry for the wait, sillies.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,530
Wow!

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,500
What?

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,370
-Please be careful.
-What are you doing, stupid?

30
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,670
-What?
-Wow!

31
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,170
You've got to be kidding me.

32
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,170
What kind of costume is that?

33
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,800
Count, you're finally here with us!

34
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,330
COUNT TAKESHI'S CASTLE
BEAT TAKESHI

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm not some singer with a flashy costume.

36
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,900
-What kind of costume?
-What on earth is this?

37
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,800
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,930
What do I sing in this now?
Whatever it is,

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,130
I heard the attacking force was advancing
while I was gone.

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,570
It attacked with full force.

41
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,470
We are leading them on deliberately.

42
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,700
-I see.
-That's our plan.

43
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,900
-I see.
-So the plan is to round them all up.

44
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,400
-Yeah. To round them all up.
-Sure.

45
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,830
To round them all up, stupid!

46
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,930
COUNT'S BODY DOUBLE
KUNIHIRO MATSUMURA

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,100
Don't wait for me and say your line.

48
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,470
Omodakaya!

49
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,730
THE ARMY HAS LOST
AGAINST THREE CASTLE LORDS

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,270
In the battles so far,
the attacking force boldly challenged

51
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,930
the three castle lords,
but was defeated in the end.

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,630
But third time's the charm,
or maybe fourth time's the charm.

53
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,630
The strongest challengers have assembled
for the final battle.

54
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,000
They take aim at the count, Beat Takeshi.

55
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,630
He's the one they're after.

56
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,270
The final battle is about to begin!

57
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,770
ARMY VS TAKESHI

58
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,030
Takeshi's Castle.

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,370
TAKESHI'S CASTLE

60
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,870
Ladies and gentlemen,
the army has lost three battles so far,

61
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,600
but God must have blessed them
or Buddha had mercy on them.

62
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,470
What a surprise!
They found a way to the main castle!

63
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,600
They have all assembled
for the biggest battle of our time.

64
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,870
THE DAY OF THE FINAL BATTLE

65
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,030
Let's do this!

66
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,170
Now it's time to gather the challengers
who fought in the last three castles.

67
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,970
It's the Takeshi's Castle water pistol
that was sold back then.

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,100
-I heard the games got even harder.
-That's bad.

69
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,270
No one cleared the game.

70
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,700
-What was it?
-The Dragon God's Pond.

71
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,600
How many times have you participated?

72
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,730
-It's our fourth time.
-Perfect attendance.

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,070
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM

74
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,170
My grandchildren were practicing
their cheering

75
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,830
by watching a DVD
of my performance 35 years ago.

76
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,830
That's fantastic!

77
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,230
Charge!

78
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,130
All the finalists are here!

79
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,470
Actually, this time...

80
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,630
HIBIYA HORIZONTAL BAR CLUB

81
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,400
COMPLETE DOMINATION
OF TAKESHI'S CASTLE

82
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,770
-We made these to show our enthusiasm.
-Nice.

83
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,600
One, ten, one hundred, Raimu Sengoku!

84
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,100
RAIMU SENGOKU (25)

85
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,670
We have two finalists.

86
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,770
TEAM SASUKE

87
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you.

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,870
They're some of the best from Sasuke.

89
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,800
Now for some extra training
to prepare for the final battle.

90
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,230
I can't reach my toes,
so I'm touching my knees.

91
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,870
-Seems like you're sweating already.
-I'm losing a lot of weight, today.

92
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,270
This army has the strongest elites ever.

93
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,070
Their goal is the eagerly awaited fall
of Takeshi's Castle!

94
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,700
On the other hand, Takeshi's army
is also putting in extra effort.

95
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,770
THE TOUCH - DRUNK DRAGON TAKU SUZUKI

96
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,400
-It's so hot in this costume.
-I guess so.

97
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,100
It's so hot.

98
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,870
Since they've made this for you,

99
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,100
I don't think you should bad-mouth them.

100
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,800
I didn't mean that.

101
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,670
They didn't mean that.

102
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,970
The first stronghold in the final battle
is the Super Border Wall.

103
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,600
DIFFICULTY RATING: 20%

104
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,430
Spider men moving in all directions
block the path of the army.

105
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:29,230
In addition, a 40-meter-per-second wind
blows against the challengers.

106
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,600
The wall has become more treacherous.
Will they make it?

107
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,200
The wind's as strong as a typhoon.

108
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,730
-It's Mr. Tani.
-General Tani.

109
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,900
You have done well, my elites.

110
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,200
His face has become swollen.

111
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,230
We'll face many obstacles,
so I want you to try your hardest.

112
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,000
-Do you understand?
-Yes!

113
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,870
You have such a nice body.

114
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,630
Aren't you Kasuga from Audrey?

115
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,500
-What? Is Kasuga there?
-Kasuga.

116
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,570
Toos!

117
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,430
-Who are you?
-He's a spy!

118
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,970
Well, calm down.

119
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,030
Toos!

120
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,700
For some reason, Kasuga,

121
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,130
who has been tormenting the challengers
in Takeshi's army, has now joined them.

122
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,970
I thought it would be much more fun
to bring down the castle.

123
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,230
He betrayed us. He's a traitor.

124
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,430
I thought this was more fulfilling work.
So I joined this side.

125
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,370
What? What are you doing?

126
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,200
Hey, the game hasn't started yet.

127
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,600
Traitor!

128
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,070
-Who are you?
-Who are you two?

129
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,970
I won't forgive you! Hey, wait a second!

130
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,870
Good. They said their line.

131
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,630
We won't let anyone through.

132
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,770
-Be prepared!
-I'll knock you all down.

133
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,030
All right. Are you done?

134
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,600
Get over the Super Border Wall.

135
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,000
Charge!

136
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,970
At last, Takeshi's Castle,
the final battle, is starting.

137
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,170
It's so flashy.

138
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,270
It is.

139
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,900
GET OVER THE WALL
WITHIN FIVE MINUTES

140
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,900
-It's so nice to be that flashy.
-Good luck!

141
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,900
REPORTERS - TOKYO HOTEISON
TAKERU &amp; SHOGO

142
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,700
-It has begun.
-Wow. The sound is amazing!

143
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,000
-He's fast!
-They're coming.

144
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,600
You're the first one. Amazing.

145
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,230
SPARTAN RACER
RYUTARO AIHARA (27)

146
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,370
You were so fast!

147
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,400
Can you get over the wall?

148
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,830
Can you do it?

149
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,800
Now, the gale force wind
is attacking the challengers.

150
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,870
The storm is raging!

151
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,500
Kasuga's the only one who's fallen.

152
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,330
It was much harder than before.

153
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,200
KENYA FURUKAWA (30) - ASUKA TAKAGI (29)

154
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,770
The spider men were in our way.

155
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,970
A handsome guy helped me.

156
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,430
EX-MAID CAFE WAITRESS
MAETEL (28)

157
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,730
They're taking aim at the spider man
who is getting in their way.

158
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,900
There's Chiitan, who has fought
in all the battles so far.

159
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,700
Chiitan's so pumped up.

160
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,170
OTTER FAIRY
CHIITAN

161
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,000
As expected of the elites
who participate in the final battle,

162
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,570
more than half of them
cleared the wall in no time.

163
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,070
EX-FOOTBALL PLAYER
RAIMU SENGOKU

164
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,500
Oh my gosh. That was so much harder.

165
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,630
-It was harder than I expected.
-I see.

166
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,430
We'll have more games after this,
how confident are you?

167
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,200
Of course I'm confident!

ACROBATIC YOUTUBER
AUN - KANTA

169
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,230
It's much more spectacular than last time.
I feel like things have truly begun.

170
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,200
Hang in there!

171
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,970
TWO MINUTES REMAINING

172
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,600
COMIC, AUDREY
TOSHIAKI KASUGA (43)

173
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,500
-What? Is Kasuga struggling?
-Kasuga...

174
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,330
What?

175
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,700
-They help each other, don't they?
-Yeah. From now on.

176
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,400
More and more familiar faces are
reaching the goal.

177
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,630
-Congratulations!
-Congrats!

178
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,270
Thanks!

179
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,330
Are you idols?

180
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,500
We worked very well together
and got through it, didn't we?

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,100
-We'll do it again next time!
-Yeah!

182
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,900
No one in Team Sasuke
has been retired, right?

183
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,930
No!

184
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,470
THIRTY SECONDS REMAINING

185
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,700
This is good.

186
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,300
I've knocked down the traitor.

187
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,230
Well done.

188
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,370
Kasuga is the only remaining challenger.

189
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,300
Kasuga is showing off.

190
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,400
That's good. Great.

191
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,970
Everyone got through. Very well done.

192
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,530
I'm glad.

193
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,670
ALL CLEARED

194
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,700
In the first battle of the final round,
the entire army survived.

195
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,700
All cleared.

196
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,000
I see.

197
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,200
You let him through. That's not good.

198
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,870
-I thought we'd all stop him.
-You should've stopped him!

199
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,900
-No. You should've come and stopped him.
-No, you should have.

200
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,630
-You should've stopped him properly.
-What?

201
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,000
-What?
-What?

202
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,000
-Ouch...
-Ouch...

203
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,870
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

204
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,900
The army
made it through the first round.

205
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,300
Next, it will split into two groups
to attack Takeshi's army.

206
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,070
In the early days,
at least five people were killed there.

207
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,800
No! They're not dead.

208
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,470
Kasuga used to be in Takeshi's army,

209
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,530
-but this time, he betrayed us.
-Yes.

210
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,730
He might think he'd be on the air
a lot more than when he was in our army.

211
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,630
Only General Tani has been on the air.

212
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,600
He might be angry because he was
in the pond for a long time before.

213
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,770
Count, the next game is an original one
called Beach Boys and Girls.

214
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,830
The surfboard moves in a circle.
Do you remember that?

215
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,170
-Yeah.
-We made it super hard.

216
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,500
What if we set the rotational speed
up to 5,000 revolutions per second?

217
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,070
No one could ride it.

218
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:49,630
SUPER BEACH BOYS AND GIRLS
DIFFICULTY RATING: 162%

219
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,900
Excuse me. Thank you.

220
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,930
I'm the producer, Katayama.
Thank you for coming here today.

221
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,500
What? Is he real?

222
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,970
Is he real?

223
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,030
It's a different space.

224
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,170
Please watch your step.

225
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,530
Mr. Toshl is coming.

226
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,070
He could be an impersonator of Toshl.

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,670
The second stronghold is
Super Beach Boys and Girls.

228
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,100
For the final battle,
an additional course has been added.

229
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,200
Amazing. Another course.
It has two circles.

230
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,230
If you jump over the balloons and land
on the green mat, you clear the game.

231
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,570
Oh my.

232
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,670
We won't let anyone get through.

233
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,930
It's the Touch.

234
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,230
Super Beach Boys and Girls.
This is the toughest stronghold!

235
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,530
-Okay, let's go! Takeshi's...
-Castle!

236
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,970
-Takeshi's...
-Castle!

237
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,670
Get ready and go for it!

238
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,030
Those college students!

239
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,700
It's the Female College Student Team.

240
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,270
These girls have participated
in all three of the battles so far,

241
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,130
and they are all
perfect attendance award winners.

242
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,370
They're fierce warriors

243
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,130
who have made their mark
during the many battles.

244
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,870
I don't get the impression
you've had any great wins.

245
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,400
We want to show
that we can do it this time.

246
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,600
Good luck!

247
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,330
I'll go for it!

248
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,530
Go for it!

249
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,430
AIRI MATSUZAKI (21)

250
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,200
-This is nostalgic.
-Definitely.

251
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,470
That's scary! Too dangerous!

252
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,130
-She has to clear that one, at least.
-Yes.

253
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,530
MINA SUDO (22)

254
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,530
It's so scary to jump there.

255
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,500
Go now!

256
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,000
She's good.

257
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,500
-Oh no. Hurry!
-Hurry up!

258
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,670
Oh dear!

259
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,770
-Well...
-It's scary!

260
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,900
That's...

261
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,030
It moves fast.

262
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,270
Well, she was too late.

263
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,230
Oh, no.

264
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,330
You have no time to rest here.

265
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,230
-I'll do my best!
-Good luck!

266
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:22,000
EVE HANIUDA (22)

267
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,370
-This jump is scary.
-I know. That bar is quite high.

268
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,430
-All right!
-That's good!

269
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,670
-The water makes you wobbly.
-Yes, hurry!

270
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,000
-They're getting in the way.
-Right.

271
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,230
Okay. Watch out!

272
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,970
-Good.
-It's slippery.

273
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,100
It's coming. It's so high.

274
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,870
You're doing great.

275
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,270
Wow. Well done.

276
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,100
-Go!
-No, she can't!

277
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,000
That's so mean.

278
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,330
I'm the leader.

279
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,500
MIRI KATO (21)

280
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,570
The last one from their team is
their leader, Kato.

281
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,570
A CHEERFUL MEMBER WHO TAKES ON A CHALLENGE

282
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,600
Can she clear this?

283
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,000
Okay, nice! Leader!

284
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,800
I'll be gentle. Come here!

285
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,630
It moves very fast.

286
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,000
-Her jump...
-The water gets in the way, too.

287
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,770
-Hurry up!
-Keep going!

288
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,870
-Well done.
-It's scary!

289
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,330
-She needs to get to the other side now.
-I can see that.

290
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,230
-Jump now.
-No!

291
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,800
-Why?
-She must be tired by now.

292
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,870
I see.

293
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,730
It was hopeless.

294
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,930
-Because it goes around the opposite way?
-I see.

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,970
We'll have a Loser Resurrection
after this.

296
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,500
-We've just got to keep trying.
-I'm a bit scared.

297
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,900
-A tug of war.
-No way.

298
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,030
Up next we have a traitor.

299
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,030
It's Kasuga.

300
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,270
Let's see what you can do!

301
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,330
Toos!

302
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,470
COMIC
TOSHIAKI KASUGA (43)

303
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,400
Here he is.

304
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,800
He also does aerobics,
so he's got toned legs.

305
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,530
He's not as good as we expected.

306
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,200
-He's not good.
-He can't jump.

307
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,270
He can't jump.

308
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,700
He can't jump well.

309
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,470
He fell too soon.

310
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,970
That was fast.

311
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,170
The traitor Kasuga's challenge...

312
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,230
He just can't jump.

313
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,400
...ended in just a few seconds.

314
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,930
What will you do about this atmosphere?

315
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,600
-Well...
-Please do something about it.

316
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:41,230
Toshl, I made an embarrassing mistake.

317
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,000
Apa!

318
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,100
What is he doing?

319
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,900
It's now a more stern atmosphere
than when I fell in the water.

320
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,570
-He said his gag, "Apa."
-That's good.

321
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,570
Now Mayaya, who is looking for love on
Takeshi's Castle, will take the challenge.

322
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,530
It's a long shot.

323
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,600
I'll look for the god of romance
in Beach Boys and Girls.

324
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,700
She's looking for a boyfriend.

325
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,500
I've heard that this program
will be aired worldwide,

326
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,830
so hi everyone around the world!
I'm Mayaya.

327
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,900
I'm Mayaya. I won't fail!

328
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,970
Mayaya! Mayaya!

329
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,970
You can do it!

330
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,430
She dances. She has good stamina.

331
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,370
Mayaya.

332
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,500
That's good.

333
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,270
-This is scary!
-Is she okay?

334
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,000
Mayaya, jump over this.

335
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,100
-She can't jump at all.
-No chance.

336
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,230
She hit the wall hard.

337
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,370
We didn't expect
anyone to fall with the bar.

338
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,530
Onto the wall...

339
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Jump!

340
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,400
Mayaya!

341
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,800
She fell with the bar
in between her legs. Mayaya.

342
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,370
JOURNALIST
MASANUKI SUNAKOMA

343
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,300
-It's a guy.
-Yeah.

344
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,630
I'm feeling better!

345
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,570
Good luck!

346
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,130
"I'm feeling better!"

347
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,130
This is easy-peasy.

348
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,270
Watch out. He fell.

349
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,730
What is he doing?

350
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,500
-No one can clear this part.
-No.

351
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,600
Wow. It's scary.

352
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,700
Keep going!

353
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,900
GRADUATE STUDENT, IRELAND
DÁITHI O HAODHA

354
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,500
Right in the face.

355
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,870
It's scary. Takeshi's Castle is so scary.

356
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,870
-Hey, the Touch.
-Yes.

357
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,170
Isn't the water pressure a bit too strong?

358
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,100
No one has cleared the course yet.

359
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,400
-He's doing too much.
-No. It's you who's doing too much.

360
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,370
-It's you doing too much.
-No, it's you!

361
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,000
What, stupid?

362
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,570
Quotation marks.

364
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,330
IT COMPANY PRESIDENT
YASUYUKI HATTORI (46)

365
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,930
-Team Presidents.
-Yes.

366
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,470
-Go, President.
-He's 46 years old.

367
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,630
What a name they have!

368
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,600
-Presidents...
-That's good.

369
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,000
-He can't jump.
-No.

370
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,600
No!

371
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,370
What is he doing?

372
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,430
Oh, no!

373
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,270
What is he doing?
No point in holding on there.

374
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,030
-He can't get over the mat.
-His knees are straight.

375
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,600
-What? He can't get over the mat.
-It's dangerous.

376
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,770
He's got weak knees.

377
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,170
President! President!

378
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,670
MARKETING COMPANY PRESIDENT
MAKOTO TANIMURA (46)

379
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,700
Come on, President!

380
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,500
Friends for 10 years, Team Presidents.

381
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,400
Miraculous synchro, and it's over.

382
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,930
It was exactly the same mistake.

383
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,900
Great skills.

384
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,730
The army is really struggling
against the fast-moving surfboards.

385
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,470
-A junior high school boy.
-Oh no!

386
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,900
YUMA NODA (13)

387
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,530
Beach Boys and Girls,
the most difficult, deluxe version.

388
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,030
The army is in great danger
of being wiped out.

389
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,900
IAIDO PRACTITIONER
SHIHOMI SUEOKA (30)

390
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,000
It's not so easy to succeed, is it?

391
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,670
That's right.

392
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,330
They say I'm not
enthusiastic enough, so...

393
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,800
I'll be more enthusiastic and supportive.

394
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,970
-I'm sorry.
-But you are excited.

395
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:33,270
Yes. My voice is hoarse.
But they say it's not enough.

396
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,100
-No...
-The producer told me off.

397
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,070
This is where the army must
step up to the plate.

398
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,230
Don't give up. Aim to clear the game!

399
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,870
We can do it!

400
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,130
NARRATOR
SHIZUKA KAWANA

401
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
I will make it!

402
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,100
JOURNALIST
HIDENORI YAMASHINA (48)

403
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,300
TEAM TAKAGI BAKUFU
ASUKA TAKAGI (29)

404
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,600
TEAM TAKAGI BAKUFU
KENYA FURUKAWA (30)

405
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,200
An out-of-body experience!

406
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,900
-Acrobat pole dance!
-Wow!

407
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,570
DANCE DUO
AKINKO (32)

408
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,000
I love girls!

409
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,400
-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry.

410
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,370
Those bars...

411
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,470
They look like iron bars to me.

412
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,800
-They're thin, aren't they?
-If you think of them as iron bars...

413
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,670
-I see. It's all about how you think.
-That's right.

414
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,000
Every day at lunchtime, they gather
in the park to work out on the iron bars.

415
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,800
Hibiya Horizontal Bar Club.

416
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,100
We're finally demonstrating our ability
in the second half.

417
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,930
-Your voice is hoarse.
-Yes.

418
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,070
I lost my voice.

419
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,170
Unlike the younger players, I don't think
we can simply win based on performance,

420
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,130
but I think we can do it
by using our heads.

421
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,670
I'll try my best!

422
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,700
TOSHITAKA HOSOI

423
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,400
The first challenger is Hosoi,
who's 55 years old.

424
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,200
Jump!

425
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,430
Followed by the finalist at Ueda Castle,
Marshall Ikeda also...

426
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,070
HIBIYA CLUB
MARSHALL IKEDA

427
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,570
The power of love gets me going.

428
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,330
HIBIYA CLUB
IPPEI SUYAMA (50)

429
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,570
I'll make the water pressure a bit weaker.

430
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,270
We all failed.

431
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,400
-Useless!
-Useless...

432
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,330
-What a shame...
-I requested a paid day off next Monday.

433
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,100
Next, the Nakamura family
takes on the challenge.

434
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,170
Family?

435
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,430
He has a good sense of balance
because he used to dance.

436
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,670
-There are girls.
-If my dad falls at the early stage...

437
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,130
-Why?
-...I'll be more relaxed.

438
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,430
I see.

439
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,500
That's great.

440
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,100
TOMOYA NAKAMURA

441
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,000
I will do it!

442
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,100
It's Dad's turn.

443
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,470
He might take her home.

444
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,930
He might?

445
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,270
The staff will stop him, though.

446
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,170
-Well done. He's so young.
-Yeah.

447
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,770
Great!

448
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,930
Watch out!

449
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,730
-They know where they're going.
-Yeah.

450
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,100
He landed with a big splash.

451
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,800
I wanted him to succeed, if possible.

452
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,470
Can Tomoki, his son,
settle the score for his father?

453
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,930
-I'll try!
-Good luck!

454
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,930
TOMOKI NAKAMURA (14)

455
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,730
Go for it!

456
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,200
Settle the score for me!

457
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,570
If that shark closed its mouth
all of sudden, that'd be funny.

458
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,630
We'd say, "There was a trap?"

459
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,330
-Watch out!
-He's young. Good balance.

460
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,870
-The mat is bouncy. Hurry!
-Go!

461
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,700
He's good.

462
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,030
Great! Hang in there!

463
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,970
-He's gone to the second circle.
-Take it slow.

464
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,800
-It's very fast, isn't it?
-But it gets harder from now on.

465
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,500
Another jump. That one is high.

466
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,300
-He might make it.
-Go forward!

467
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,530
Go, go, go! You can do it!

468
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,000
I feel like crying.

469
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,500
He will make it!

470
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,700
-He's gonna do it!
-Another one is coming.

471
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,430
Two in a row, but he did it!

472
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,400
-This is mean.
-That's impossible.

473
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,100
That's unreasonable.
The bars are on top of each other.

474
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,270
No way!

475
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,900
-Those bars...
-Like a hot dog on a stick.

476
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,470
-It's tough.
-Toshl is laughing, too.

477
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,670
Tomoki, the 35th challenger from the army,

478
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,370
was the first to come close
to the finish line.

479
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,200
-He did well.
-Yes.

480
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,900
He couldn't get over the last balloons.

481
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,930
He was tired.

482
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,670
He sadly lost.

483
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,330
-They're too high.
-Yeah.

484
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,530
Oh dear...

485
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,470
Don't fawn over the girls!

486
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,430
I heard about you!

487
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,930
I'm sorry.

488
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,970
-You guys aren't wearing life jackets.
-I know.

489
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,930
Somehow, we didn't make it.

490
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:37,630
AUN are acrobatic video creators
and challengers hoping to avoid wipeouts.

491
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,500
The first challenger is Ryu,

492
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,770
who gave an astonishing performance
at the battle of Ueda Castle.

493
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,170
He's the only one on the team
to become a finalist.

494
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,730
AT UEDA CASTLE, HE GOT TO YABUSAME

495
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,630
We did it!

496
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,630
ACROBATIC YOUTUBER
AUN - RYU

497
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,400
Girl power!

498
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,770
Come on!

499
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,770
Not good at all.

500
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,600
What is Kanta like among the members?

501
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,500
-He's our face.
-Yes, I am.

502
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,130
Show us your best look.

503
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:36,070
Kanta played an active role at Ueda Castle
using his outstanding physical abilities.

504
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,330
He cleared!

505
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,900
Can he show us
the same charismatic ability he used there

506
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,530
to complete Beach Boys and Girls?

507
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,470
ACROBATIC YOUTUBER
AUN - KANTA

508
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,370
-High five!
-Girls! The best!

509
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,400
Go for it!

510
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,330
He's the last one from the army.
Can he prevent a total wipeout?

511
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,270
You don't have time to wave to her!

512
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,270
You're enjoying this!

513
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,200
-Keep going!
-Go!

514
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,970
Watch out!

515
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,270
Good luck!

516
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,630
He did it!

517
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,770
You can do it!

518
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,000
Wow!

519
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,030
If he gets over the last two balloons,
he will clear the game.

520
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,770
Go! Jump!

521
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,330
Almost there!

522
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,630
Though Kanta demonstrated
his excellent physical capabilities

523
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,600
while giving high-fives to the girls,

524
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,200
he ultimately failed.

525
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,430
You're so good,
but were those last two bars tough?

526
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,600
Yes. They were much higher than I thought.

527
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,730
NO SURVIVORS

528
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,600
-Would you have won without the girls?
-Sure thing.

529
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:16,400
I feel like I'm dreaming,
being on Takeshi's Castle.

530
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,400
I'm so happy.

531
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,870
When I was living in Los Angeles,

532
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,200
I got video tapes
of Takeshi's Castle sent from Japan.

533
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,830
Takeshi's Castle helped me get through
the hard times.

534
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,930
-Really?
-Yeah.

535
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,670
That's why I'm so pleased.

536
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,500
-So this means a lot to you.
-Yes.

537
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,330
-It brings back memories.
-It does.

538
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,370
Yes.

539
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,930
One of the two sides has been wiped out.
What will happen to the army?

540
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,730
This has become so much harder.

541
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,630
The last two bars on top each other
were not good.

542
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,600
That wasn't fair.

543
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,500
But I'm told that is an order
from you, our count.

544
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:00,230
Even the most athletic people
are losing their strength.

545
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,330
Indeed.

546
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,970
And he is Toshl himself.

547
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,100
He looks like a piece of pottery.

548
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,030
No, he doesn't.

549
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,870
-You meant he has beautiful skin.
-Right.

550
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,730
Next are two games
which are familiar to you.

551
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,130
The Dragon God's Pond
and Straits of Gibraltar.

552
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,600
I hear our Himura actually tried
to show what it's like.

553
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,770
I went there to try it first.

554
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,070
But you're fat.

555
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,400
-Yes.
-"But you're fat."

556
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,500
Were you okay?

557
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,070
-It's amazing.
-Yes.

558
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,100
-I loved the Dragon God's Pond.
-I see.

559
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,230
He admires the Dragon God's Pond.

560
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,930
How far can 50-year-old Himura go?

561
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,770
Five seconds to go. Four, three...

562
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,630
-Well. I can't wait.
-... two...

563
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,200
-Glad you can do this, aren't you?
-Yeah.

564
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,900
PLAYTEST
BANANAMAN - YUKI HIMURA

565
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,100
Very nice.

566
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,000
Nice.

567
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,570
Those are actually quite far.

568
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,470
-You can't jump there easily.
-No.

569
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,900
You made it quite far.

570
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,870
-Oh, no.
-He fell.

571
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,970
Hey, you!

572
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,770
I was scared.

573
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,030
You were.

574
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,670
-You can't get out on your own.
-You're pathetic.

575
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,070
My body is too heavy.

576
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,300
Why don't they edit this clip shorter?

577
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,230
There. That's the problem.

578
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,300
I don't think anyone could clear
this game. Stop worrying. Sure thing.

579
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,500
-You were too slow, anyway.
-Right.

580
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,200
It's more fun to watch people
running across the pond quickly.

581
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,570
They'll either laugh at you for falling
or watch you get it right.

582
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,630
-You have to play the odds.
-Right.

583
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,300
If you don't do either of those properly,
you don't get much airtime.

584
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,430
-I apologize, sir.
-Not much airtime...

585
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,670
SUPER DRAGON GOD'S POND
STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR

586
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,830
DIFFICULTY RATING: 140%

587
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,130
MASARU HAMAGUCHI

588
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,170
This is costing a lot of money!

589
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,470
It's Hamaguchi.

590
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,670
I used to watch this on TV. It's awesome!

591
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,370
What an amazing set! What is this?

592
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,900
I don't want to fall,
because I'm scared of water.

593
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,470
-It's Obayashi.
-I have no choice but to clear the game.

594
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,400
EX-VOLLEYBALL PLAYER
MOTOKO OBAYASHI

595
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,130
I'm afraid of water.

596
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,270
For the next game,

597
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:39,400
two games have been combined
into one much harder game.

598
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,770
Two additional huge rotating bars
were set up in the strait.

599
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,500
In addition, standing up
to the challengers is...

600
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,670
WATER MARSHALL
MASARU HAMAGUCHI

601
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,630
Let's go, everyone!

602
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:07,030
I started working
as a Takeshi's Castle reporter!

603
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,600
-It's AMEMIYA.
-He's here, too.

604
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,500
I'm AMEMIYA!

605
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,430
The other reporters are in Tokyo Hoteison!

606
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,170
-We are Tokyo Hoteison!
-Did you hear how AMEMIYA speaks?

607
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,670
The Super Dragon God's Pond
and Straits of Gibraltar.

608
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,470
The first challenger is...

609
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,230
Didn't you come here to cheer for me?

610
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,670
You aren't doing that at all.

611
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:39,700
The way he performed last time,
it was hard believe he was 62 years old.

612
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:46,800
He's actually a great challenger
who made it to the final 35 years ago.

613
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,300
Wow. Mr. Tani is so young.

614
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:52,430
I lost in the kart game
and failed to bring down the castle.

615
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,800
I want to succeed this time.

616
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,900
It's amazing to see those
who have taken part before.

617
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,730
Grandpa! Go for it!

618
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,100
Let's go!

619
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,000
HIROAKI SHINGA (62)

620
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,930
-He's amazing.
-He is!

621
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,370
He's going. Go! Keep going!

622
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,530
Wow! Great! How did he do that?

623
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,800
Keep it up!

624
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,300
-He can do it! Go!
-Fight!

625
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,830
Good luck!

626
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,830
Good luck. Stay still there.

627
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,170
-Catch this ball. Okay.
-All right!

628
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,670
You need to move forward
while avoiding two rotating bars.

629
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,830
It's much harder than before.

630
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,570
He's calm. Keep shooting!

631
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,230
It's Makabe.

632
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,600
PRO WRESTLER
TOGI MAKABE

633
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,970
-That's too hard.
-That's impossible!

634
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,630
No way!

635
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,500
No chance!

636
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,800
You can do it!

637
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,870
Almost there!

638
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,470
Makabe! You did it!

639
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,970
Masaru! Masaru!

640
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,430
No one can get through this.

641
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,630
In Straits of Gibraltar,
water marshal Hamaguchi's attack

642
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,870
and pro wrestler Makabe's bouncing attack
wreak havoc!

643
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,700
Plus, there are those obstacles.

644
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,630
No mercy.

645
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,670
Grandpa!

646
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,670
I'm sorry.

647
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,000
Grandpa fell into the water.

648
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,170
They are hit with water and balls.

649
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,430
DATA ANALYST, SPAIN
RUBEN BARRENA (34)

650
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
It went straight at him.

651
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,530
All right, let's go!

652
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,770
EX EMBASSY EMPLOYEE, SPAIN
MARC AURA RODRIGO (22)

653
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:59,800
Next, traitor Audrey's Kasuga
takes on the challenge.

654
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:04,270
When I was little,
I was crazy about Takeshi's Castle.

655
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:09,130
-To be on the show at 43 is deeply moving.
-It's Kasuga.

656
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,230
I think so, too.

657
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
Mr. Takeshi, wait for me.

658
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,630
-For what?
-I, Kasuga, will be there for sure.

659
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,800
What are you talking about, silly?

660
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,730
-What will happen to Kasuga?
-He's likely to get through.

661
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,900
I hope a ball will hit him hard, now.

662
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,570
Toos!

663
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,670
Come on, Kasuga! Hurry up!

664
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,470
-Run!
-Run quick!

665
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,430
When a ball hits him,
he doesn't make the slightest move.

666
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,100
Why is Kasuga looking at us?

667
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,270
-He's got it.
-It him in the face.

668
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,200
What a hit!

669
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,530
It's so funny.

670
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,130
Kasuga, defying the flying balls,
passed through the Dragon God's Pond.

671
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,070
-He did it.
-Will he get through easily?

672
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
No problem.

673
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,700
He was just strolling through the pond.

674
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,430
-Please run, Kasuga!
-Please run.

675
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,430
Take it easy.

676
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,400
Come on, Kasuga!

677
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,100
Wait for me.

678
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,130
Can you go now?

679
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,330
Good luck.

680
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,130
-Are you ready? Catch this ball.
-Sure.

681
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,770
Okay!

682
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,130
Let's go.

683
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,530
That's tough.

684
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,070
-Even Kasuga...
-He's amazing, as expected.

685
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,130
He made it.

686
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,270
He's holding on.

687
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,000
Is he gonna fall? It's a tough spot.

688
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,230
They're shooting water at him hard.

689
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,200
-He made it over. Now, he's falling!
-Watch out!

690
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,070
-It's not looking good.
-No!

691
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,970
He fell with it!

692
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,530
He can't take that rock with him!

693
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,900
That's impossible.

694
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,100
-What are we gonna do?
-We'd better fix it.

695
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,170
Yes.

696
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,570
Oh my gosh!

697
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,070
Hey!

698
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,130
That was the most exciting thing ever.

699
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,370
Did you enjoy it?

700
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,370
Yes, this is Takeshi's Castle,
which I used to watch on TV.

701
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,870
I know!

702
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:38,800
Kasuga, they say it'll take 20 minutes
to fix the bridge.

703
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,730
I'm sorry about that.

704
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,370
The next challenger is

705
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,130
former national volleyball player,
Motoko Obayashi.

706
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,170
I'm scared.

707
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,500
Which makes you more nervous,
the Olympic Games or this one?

708
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:01,700
I feel more nervous here,
because I had confidence at the Olympics.

709
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,200
I don't have any confidence here.

710
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,430
How will she do?

711
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,900
-I hope Obayashi gets through.
-I hope so, too.

712
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,600
Obayashi, 55 years old,
cleared the Dragon God's Pond brilliantly.

713
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,600
Now she moves onto Straits of Gibraltar.

714
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,000
Will she make it to the end?

715
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,830
I'm scared.

716
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:22,300
-Obayashi can get far in one stride.
-Really?

717
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,570
Why?

718
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,830
She hit it back well.

719
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,930
Don't bump it!

720
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,270
I usually mustn't catch a ball.

721
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,270
I understand that.
I want you to catch it in this game.

722
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,230
-Okay? Let's go.
-Yes.

723
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,170
I wish her good luck.

724
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,770
Crouch down!

725
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,970
That's good.

726
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,470
She's good.

727
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,000
Bouncing is another problem.

728
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,370
That rock is hard to get over.

729
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,230
Makabe shows no mercy.

730
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,070
She straddled it.

731
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,700
It's because she has long legs.

732
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,030
No.

733
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,670
-That rock is tough.
-Yeah.

734
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,800
Oh, no!

735
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,430
-You were so close.
-Yeah.

736
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,470
That tall rock was hard to get over.

737
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,930
-But you mounted it in one go.
-In terms of height, yes.

738
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,430
Because of the volleyball team and Makabe,

739
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,500
I've started improving my coordination.

740
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,670
It's impossible to withstand us together.

741
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,800
I think the attack will be stronger now.

742
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,200
We have been able to work together better.

743
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,570
-Good luck.
-We'll do it now.

744
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,130
The force is struggling against
the vicious attacks of Takeshi's army.

745
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,700
NURSE
EMIKO KANNO

746
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,630
-Wow.
-But she went that far.

747
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,870
EX-EMBASSY EMPLOYEE, SPAIN
ALVARO CAMACHO CRÍADO

748
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,830
-It's so wobbly.
-Oh no!

749
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,370
Okay! Okay!

750
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,030
We haven't done anything good so far.
We came all the way from Nagoya.

751
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,870
-Today, too?
-Of course.

752
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,030
We drove a van from Nagoya. Yes.

753
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,270
Yeah. By car.

754
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,530
Boys and Men, who almost reached the goal
at Ennosuke Castle's Dragon God's Pond,

755
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,330
and were given the Fighting Spirit Award,
are taking on the challenge next.

756
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,170
We came here from Nagoya.
I will clear this for sure!

757
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,500
BOYS AND MEN
YUKIHISA TAMURA

758
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,600
-You've got this!
-Yes!

759
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,100
Was it good? Yes!

760
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,730
Let's go!

761
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,700
Keep calm and just relax. Go for it!

762
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,730
-Come on!
-I'm taking you down.

763
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,330
-Go for it!
-Thanks!

764
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,230
Let's go!

765
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:01,300
We have an additional guardian,
Kurochan, just before the goal.

766
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,670
YASUDA DAI CIRCUS - KUROCHAN

767
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,330
Fall down!

768
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,200
Fall down!

769
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,930
Okay!

770
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,330
I made him fall!

771
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I did it! There you go!

772
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,730
Go home! Go home!

773
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,000
He's so hard on good-looking men.

774
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:40,830
Boys and Men couldn't withstand
Kurochan's merciless bouncing attack.

775
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,470
BOYS AND MEN
YUHI (29)

776
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,300
Kurochan has no mercy.

777
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,270
BOYS AND MEN
MASATO YOSHIHARA (28)

778
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,170
Good luck!

779
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,000
What's wrong with you?

780
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,430
I did it!

781
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,400
Are you called "Ugly Men"?

782
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,130
No. They're "Boys and Men."

783
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,230
Kurochan is so harsh towards Boys and Men.

784
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,600
I know. He called you "Ugly Men."

785
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,830
-He called us "Ugly Men"?
-Yeah.

786
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,870
I'll think about what to do with him.

787
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,730
Yes, you'd better.

788
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,770
He was nasty.

789
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,800
Mr. Takeshi!

790
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,330
TAKESHI'S CASTLE MUSEUM DIRECTOR
SATOSHI MAEJIMA

791
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,570
Mr. Takeshi, we're coming see you!
Ready?

792
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,730
Bubbly!

793
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,430
-Are they still active?
-Yeah.

794
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,470
Shoot me!

795
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,430
JULIANA NO TATARI
YAJIMA GINTARO (36)

796
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,600
I won!

797
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,770
OTTER FAIRY

798
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,670
BOYS AND MEN
KENTO HIRAMATSU (27)

799
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,770
Fall down!

800
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,870
Good luck!

801
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,870
EX-JAPANESE NATIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER
RAIMU SENGOKU (25)

802
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,630
ATHLETE AND TV PERSONALITY
YUME MOSES (34)

803
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,630
I'm so sad!

804
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,770
IDOL
RISA OKUMA

805
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,500
Bring down Takeshi's Castle!

806
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,200
Next...

807
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:25,170
Team Sasuke, which has been successful
in past battles, finally appears!

808
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,570
-It's Team Sasuke!
-Here they come!

809
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,500
Will there be anyone clearing
for the first time?

810
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,070
He's amazing.

811
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,630
We will conquer Takeshi's Castle
as a team!

812
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,100
They're quite tough.

813
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,130
First, Sato, who is the chairman of Japan
Parkour Association, takes on a challenge.

814
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,300
I'll try my hardest!

815
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,400
-He's great.
-I hope he goes through.

816
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,130
CHAIRMAN OF PARKOUR ASSOCIATION
JUN SATO (30)

817
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,270
-He's fast!
-Fantastic!

818
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,970
It's like he's running on normal ground.

819
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,200
-Did he fall?
-He did.

820
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,600
-You were doing so well.
-I know. I thought I was gonna make it.

821
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,030
Then suddenly, I couldn't see. I failed.

822
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,470
-In the end?
-Yeah.

823
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:09,330
Dad. If you clear this,
we'd call you Mr. Takeshi's Castle.

824
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,730
-If I clear this?
-Yeah.

825
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:14,830
Hioki has tried hard with his family

826
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,000
and played an active role
in the battle of Naomi Castle.

827
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,130
Will he be the first person
to beat this game?

828
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,070
I'll try my best!

829
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:29,600
KITAGAWA ELECTRONICS, STORE MANAGER
MASASHI HIOKI (41)

830
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,030
Dad, go for it!

831
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,200
Take it slow!

832
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,630
That's all right.

833
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:45,800
-He did it!
-He did it!

834
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,270
You can do it! Keep going!

835
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,270
Ready?

836
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:52,230
Okay!

837
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,170
It's wobbly.

838
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:55,170
Ouch!

839
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,470
Wow.

840
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:06,770
It hit him in the face.

841
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,000
-But he's gotten quite far.
-That's good.

842
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,970
-Over that rock?
-He failed...

843
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:22,100
We did it!

844
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,200
Next, Yoshiyuki Yamamoto, a pupil
of Katsumi Yamada, Mr. Sasuke,

845
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:30,630
will take on the challenge.

846
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,400
His master, Yamada,
finished Takeshi's Castle

847
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,830
without performing well.

848
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,530
I didn't show you
anything good at all, again.

849
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:47,030
Mr. Sasuke is absent
from the final battle.

850
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,900
Mr. Yamada has given up
on Takeshi's Castle.

851
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,430
I will do my best to fulfill
Mr. Yamada's wishes,

852
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,530
and bring him good news.

853
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,030
We're counting on you!

854
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,100
YAMADA SQUAD
YOSHIYUKI YAMAMOTO (29)

855
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:12,130
I'll show you what Mr. Sasuke is made of.

856
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,970
He's good.

857
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,270
He's good.

858
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:28,700
Wow!

859
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:32,530
Hey!

860
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,230
You were giving us hope!

861
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,630
Even Team Sasuke is struggling.

862
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,500
Sasuke fans all over the world
are counting on you.

863
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,430
I know.

864
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,430
I want to beat this game.

865
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,200
Yusuke Morimoto, Sasuke Jr.,
is the toughest player on the Sasuke team.

866
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:58,230
He has won a compete victory twice
and is a super hero among athletic men.

867
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:06,000
Sasuke Jr. cleared Straits of Gibraltar
at the battle of Naomi Castle.

868
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,200
I did it!

869
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,400
Will he be the first challenger
to clear this much harder version?

870
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,300
What are you doing now?

871
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:18,570
I'm climbing over the rock
in the middle of the bridge.

872
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,230
I'll try my best!

873
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,230
COMPLETED SASUKE, SASUKE JR.
YUSUKE MORIMOTO (30)

874
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,230
Fight!

875
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,900
-He's the toughest one of all.
-Yeah.

876
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,830
-Keep going!
-How can he do that?

877
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,700
Fantastic!

878
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,600
-Nice!
-He stayed on.

879
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:44,530
He did.

880
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,170
Go!

881
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,930
-He's amazing. He's the champion.
-Yes.

882
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,300
They could make it. He nearly fell,
but he is Sasuke Jr., after all.

883
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,800
Okay.

884
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:05,770
You can do this better!

885
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,900
This is a hard one.

886
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,330
-He might clear this.
-I think so, too.

887
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:21,130
He has excellent balance.

888
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:23,970
That's good.

889
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:34,330
-He got through.
-He made it over.

890
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,470
Even on that wobbly bridge,

891
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,600
-his upper body is still stable.
-Indeed.

892
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,470
-Watch out!
-Seriously?

893
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,170
-He did it!
-Amazing!

894
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,130
Hang on!

895
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,400
Fantastic!

896
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,400
All right! I did it!

897
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:04,400
Damn it!

898
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,500
He did it again.

899
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,970
-He's amazing.
-Yeah. He's great.

900
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,170
I lost.

901
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,900
Sasuke Jr. withstood
Makabe's bouncing attack

902
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:16,770
and reached the goal beautifully.

903
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:18,800
He's incredible.

904
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,630
-He's fantastic.
-That's why he's won Sasuke twice.

905
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,370
Next, this man takes up the challenge.

906
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,500
Haru Yamaguchi,
the finalist at Ennosuke Castle.

907
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,930
He's a super high school student
who has cleared every game he has tried.

908
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,600
Following Sasuke Jr.,
will he be able to clear the game?

909
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,830
I will clear this!

910
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:46,870
Good luck!

911
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:52,900
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT
HARU YAMAGUCHI (16)

912
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,000
He's awesome! Fantastic!

913
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,530
-Stay calm. Let's go.
-Sure.

914
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,200
All right!

915
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,030
You're great!

916
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,370
You can do it!

917
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,570
Keep going!

918
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,030
All right!

919
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,870
Awesome!

920
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,100
Wow!

921
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,730
It's not my fault!

922
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:04,000
Fujitaka, who holds the world's
best cheerleading title, also cleared.

923
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,830
Only three survived.

924
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,030
-In total, three challengers...
-From 300 in total down to three.

925
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,000
...from the army survived.

926
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:16,430
THREE SURVIVORS

927
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:23,170
Miraculously, the army avoided
a total wipeout and will move forward!

928
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:26,370
Count, how was it?

929
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:27,630
Some people got through.

930
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,270
Like Morimoto, also know as Sasuke Jr.,
who has won a complete victory twice.

931
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,170
He has an amazing sense of balance.

932
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,470
-Did three challengers go through?
-Yes.

933
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,800
We need to prepare
three lunch boxes for the evening.

934
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,970
You're stingy. Just a lunch box.

935
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,600
Our staff was worried.

936
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:46,130
Don't worry. We have enough money.

937
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,570
Now, we have Loser Resurrection.

938
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:50,900
Do we?

939
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,530
Yes. Otherwise,
we wouldn't have anyone left.

940
00:51:55,870 --> 00:52:01,030
Loser Resurrection, in which the army
tries to return to the front line.

941
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:06,270
Kasuga has had a poor showing
with his consecutive failures.

942
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,500
Will he be able to return
to the front line?

943
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,000
I'm so sorry about earlier.

944
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,830
-I'll do things right next time.
-I see.

945
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,670
He must've been sorry
for finishing too soon.

946
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:21,530
Kasuga! You've got this!

947
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,100
Can Kasuga get back to the front line?

948
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,000
This is the way, right?

949
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,600
This is what I'm supposed to do?

950
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,630
Looks good. Go!

951
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:37,930
What a shame, Kasuga.

952
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,330
I'm having the most fun.

953
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:46,970

00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:10,870
What are we gonna do?

964
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,770
This'll be our memory of the summer.

965
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:13,670
Ready, go!

Those who fail to return
to the front line after these games

980
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:54,230
are out of the battle altogether.

981
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,400
The winner is Takeshi's army!

982
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:59,300
Well done.

-I know. You were so close.

987
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:16,870
Loser Resurrection should be
a little harder.

988
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,600
-Were they quite easy?
-Yeah.

989
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,130
-They weren't any good?
-No.

990
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,930
But we need them
to return to the front line, right?

991
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,930
We can't have more losers
in the loser's games, can we?

992
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,830
You're right.

993
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,970

00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:51,030
NEXT, TAKESHI'S CASTLE
THE FINAL CHAPTER

1001
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,300
Are you really up for it?

1002
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,130
Go through it if you can!

UNBEATABLE GAMES
PUSHING THE LIMITS

1004
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,330
Takeshi's Castle reaches
its final chapter.

1005
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,500
We're also pushing
the limits of the games' difficulty!

1006
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:07,630
Plus, that super athlete
will also make an appearance!

1007
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,100
I think it was because of your cheering.

1008
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,900
-Was it my fault?
-Yes.

1009
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,700
-That's why no one cleared?
-Yes.

1010
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:23,170
I wasn't enthusiastic enough.

1011
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:26,000
-Please try harder.
-That's hard.

1012
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:28,870
It was so close.

1013
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:35,230
Mr. Makabe,
you aren't wearing a chain today.

1014
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,000
Me? I forgot.

1015
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,370
-Why not?
-I forgot about it.

1016
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:41,570
-Because it was too hot.
-Sure.

1017
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,530
-Do your best.
-You don't sound sincere.

1018
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,270
In this heat?
Of course I'll try my best, silly.

1019
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:48,900
I'll do it!

1020
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:53,830
We can see your human legs, Chiitan.
How many costumes do you have?

1021
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:56,170
You're scary.

1022
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,830
Did you watch Takeshi's Castle

1023
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,430
-when you were little?
-It was my absolute favorite.

1024
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:06,170
Look at this. Am I here for a work?

1025
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,870
I used to watch it every week.
I wanted him to say to me,

1026
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:13,300
"You have survived well, my elites."
Also, "Charge!"

1027
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,370
I grew up hearing those words.

1028
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,800
I did it.

1029
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,500
I'm sorry. I did it again.

1030
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:23,670
Good luck!

1031
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,570
-Do you go to Shonan Beach?
-It's great.

1032
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:31,970
-It's a good place to pick up girls.
-You don't do that anyway, right?

1033
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,770
Go for it!

1034
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:41,130
This is so '80s. We shout, "Girls!"

1035
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,930
-You'll try losers' games, Boys and Men?
-Yes.

1036
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,600
I hope you try hard and fail!

1037
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,900
-We've finished shooting. Thank you!
-Thank you!

1038
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,170
All right. Thank you!

1039
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,330
The water pressure was
strong enough to push me backwards.

1040
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:58,870
-It was so much fun.
-Thank you!

1041
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,830
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

1042
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,030
