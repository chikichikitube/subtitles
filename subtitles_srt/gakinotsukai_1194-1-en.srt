1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,470
There is an inn where a group of liars have gathered

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,190
You!

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,460
You cheated and took a day off!

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,460
I didn't cheat!

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,570
Why'd you do that?

6
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:16,500
Hosei took a day off because he had influenza

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,980
I didn't cheat!

8
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,980
You did!

9
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,500
You could've shown up still!

10
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,500
I definitely couldn't have, sorry

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,330
No, listen-

12
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,770
The 4 had to endure the cold in summer clothes

13
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,410
It was hellishly cold!

14
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,380
It was so cold!

15
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,770
I had it tough too!

16
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,790
I got a brand new hemorrhoid the next day!

17
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,980
That cold made a lot of hemorrhoids appear

18
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,980
Cocorico

19
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,980
Downtown

20
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,980
Endo Shozo

21
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,980
Hamada Masatoshi

22
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,980
Matsumoto Hitoshi

23
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,980
Tanaka Naoki

24
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,980
Tsukitei Hosei

25
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,980
It was that cold

26
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,160
That could happen

27
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,550
Indeed

28
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,550
Because of that shoot?

29
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,860
I wanted to take part!

30
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,410
You've got it wrong!

31
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,860
"Were you alright?"

32
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,180
Nobody asked me that!

33
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,860
For one thing-

34
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,360
"Are you alright? You got influenz!a" - None of you said anything!

35
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,530
Then fine,

36
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,560
Did you get the vaccine afterwards?

37
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,560
Yes did you?

38
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,870
Like I said~ I couldn't get it

39
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,320
So irritating
What the hell?

40
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,940
Why didn't you?

41
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,440
What's with that condescending "Like I said~"

42
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,500
Like we've made him explain this already

43
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,820
On DownTown DX he wanted us to make fun of his bald spot and get laughs,

44
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,360
But then he went "please cut it out :("

45
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,810
Yeah

46
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,290
He had a blatantly pissed off expression

47
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,290
Eh? But it's funny!

48
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,290
Right?

49
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,920
Everyone's laughing
Right

50
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,830
He's balding, and they're laughing!

51
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,830
But then he goes "enough already :("

52
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,860
I'm not even balding

53
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,860
No no no

54
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,500
You're balding!

55
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,770
Look look look

56
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,770
I can see it

57
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,670
Hosei-san

58
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,340
It's been like this for years, I don't really,

59
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,970
I see, so if we say that,

60
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,610
I don't see it

61
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,940
It's like we're lying?

62
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,940
It's bad for you?

63
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,940
It's bad for me

64
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,740
Hmm
Well that's unfortuante

65
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,710
So that's why

66
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,950
Don't every say it again please

67
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,950
It's not that big a deal

68
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:42,420
Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

An inn full of liars!
See how they maintain the lie!

71
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,930
Everything!

72
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,930
Liar's Inn

73
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,930
Totally improvise

74
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,930
Totally Improvise Everythin! Liar's Inn

75
00:01:52,930 --> 00:02:01,000
Whoever's card get's selected picks someone to tell a massive,  plausible, or small lie

76
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,910
Whoever gets picked has to run with the theme and keep up the lie!

77
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,140
Alright, the cards have been shuffled

78
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,820
Yes

79
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,290
Yes

80
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,030
So someone will come up

81
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,990
It's scary

82
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,990
This is scary right?
It is

83
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,290
It is, for the person who gets picked too

84
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,960
Go ahead Hamada
Eh?

85
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,290
Here I go
Yes

86
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,770
Hamada will pick someone to tell a massive  lie

87
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,950
Hamada-san picks a massive lie right?

88
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,800
A massive lie right away?

89
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,770
A massive one first?

90
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,640
Hamada can pick anyone right?

91
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,640
That's right

92
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,100
Hmm

93
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,060
You...

94
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,780
I've head you,

95
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:46,420
You're being targeted by the FBI?

96
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,420
Eh?

97
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,470
That's an American agency too

98
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,990
Eh? You're joking
You're joking

99
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,690
No hold on, this is, I am,

100
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,760
I'm really pissed off at the FBI now

101
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,760
Eh?

102
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,930
They said "Don't tell anyone!" so I kept quite about it,

103
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,240
I wanted to make a joke about, so I did actually want to mention it

104
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,240
I thought saying it out loud would be safer

105
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:15,180
But the FBI told me "I won't say anything, so you shouldn't either"

106
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,030
So I didn't tell anyone, but if Hamada knows then they told someone right?

107
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,790
That's true
That's why right now

108
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,060
I'm really pissed of at him

109
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,060
Him?

110
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,060
There are specific people?

111
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,540
There are

112
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,130
But why?

113
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,800
I don't get the point

114
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,630
Out of the blue they asked me "Is it alright?"

115
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,570
They asked "Is it alright if we target you?"

116
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,900
Directly to you?

117
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,470
Did you do something bad?

118
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,040
It was last week, for real

119
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,740
Last week?
Last week

120
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,130
Umm,

121
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,240
Over there

122
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,110
In the Shinbashi area

123
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,110
Why there?
The FBI, in Shinbashi?

124
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,620
In the Shinbashi area, they asked "Is it alright if we target you?"

125
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,620
Was the FBI guy Japanese?

126
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,510
Yeah?

127
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,120
I wonder what nationality he was

128
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,860
He was a East-Asian

129
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,470
There's a lot of people like that

130
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,430
But you must've done something then, right?

131
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,700
It was like, they needed to decide on who to target

132
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,440
It was really weird! I thought he was lying or something

133
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,640
I have no clue what you're saying

134
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,110
What are you saying?

135
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,640
I can't follow this at all

136
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,640
Are you not lying?

137
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,880
What did you do?

138
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,020
No no, I really didn't,

139
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,830
In Shinbashi, I parked my car,

140
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,740
I had to buy something

141
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,450
I had to pay 300 yen

142
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,250
Oh yeah

143
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,630
I was gonna pop in and out in less than a minute

144
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,020
So I thought "Well it's fine if I don't pay"

145
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,420
But right then, someone stopped me "hold on there"

146
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,790
"Who the hell is this guy" I thought

147
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,570
He said "You're that guy right?"

148
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,110
"You're a celebrity aren't you?"

149
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,870
Oh yeah I know the type

150
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,110
He probably knew you

151
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,340
Well that's-
But why did he ask him that?

152
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,980
Right?

153
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,080
And then he asked "is it okay if we target you?"

154
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,820
But why?

155
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,810
I thought maybe they found something shady

156
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,400
And they found out

157
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,560
It might've been that

158
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,560
No no, I'm pretty pissed off

159
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,630
I'm really pissed off

160
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,030
Is that it?

161
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,550
Like they didn't say someone is gonna follow you

162
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,280
Ah no, not that

163
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,570
Yeah maybe even now

164
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,570
Someone watching him continuously

165
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,570
Yeah perhaps

166
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,340
You might be under surveilance, by the FBI

167
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,340
Ohh

168
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,380
There might be

169
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,220
No listen WHAT did you do?

170
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,430
Right?

171
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,460
No no listen-

172
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,160
The FBI!

173
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,460
Then make up a reason for me! I just heard about this too!

174
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,920
What did I do?!

175
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,460
Wha-

176
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,820
It doesn't matter what I did

177
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,820
Right

178
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,040
He asked me "Can we target you?"

179
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,630
That's where it all started, I see people hiding

180
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,260
It's the same guy?

181
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,670
Like hiding behind poles

182
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,110
Those are FBI agents?

183
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,700
I don't know if they are!

184
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,800
In fact,

185
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,170
I didn't know they were FBI until now

186
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,680
I thought they were random old men

187
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,040
Now that Hamada mentioned I think "Oh, they were FBI"

188
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,800
Now I made the connection - And that's why I'm so pissed off

189
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,580
I wish he would say what he did!

190
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,400
That's right, what did he do?

191
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,300
I don't know! Listen to me!

192
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,670
Why did they ask to target you?

193
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,050
Maybe it was cause I didn't pay the 300 yen

194
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,800
Cause you didn't pay 300 yen?
I don't know

195
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,000
Guys like that are totally random

196
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,000
He did it randomly?

197
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,000
He wouldn't do it randomly

198
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,570
He said "I'm a really random guy"

199
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,710
Lie TIME over

200
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,710
That was brilliant

201
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,710
Is this for real?!

202
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,310
It was a massive lie right away

203
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,600
Why the hell did  you pick me

204
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,570
A big lie right away

205
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,550
A big lie

206
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,570
It's gonna be like this I guess

207
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,720
That was a lot

208
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,340
It was a big lie after all, right away

209
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,590
Indeed

210
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,360
Yes

211
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,330
So Matsumoto-san, choose the next one

212
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,780
Right, of course

213
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,780
Yes

214
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,500
Endo?

215
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,660
I wonder...

216
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,170
Endo picks a big lie

217
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,170
Another big lie...

218
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,240
Hosei-san, is that story true?

219
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,340
Demi Moore

220
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,780
You and Demi Moore had dinner at "Gyoza no Ohsho"?

221
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,780
No way? When when?

222
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,780
At Ohsho?

223
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,410
Is that-

224
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,690
Is that at the Osaka Ohsho or the Kyoto Ohsho?

225
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,110
I don't know, I don't know

226
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,380
You should know that!

227
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,060
Yeah

228
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,060
Have you two done this before a lot?

229
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh you've gone to both?

230
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,940
Oh yeah, yeah

231
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,460
Oh you've been to a lot?

232
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,460
Ah, so this wasn't for TV?

233
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,360
It wasn't for TV?

234
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,990
It wasn't for TV

235
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,220
You did this privately?

236
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,330
It was in private

237
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,030
Right, cause then we would also know, not just Endo

238
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah cause it was private, so you don't know

239
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,310
I was told "Don't tell anyone about this"

240
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,480
Demi Moore's father told me not to

241
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,280
But why do you know her?

242
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,280
How do you know her?

243
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,530
That's-

244
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,980
You really knew her before?

245
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,220
I want a, a detailed explanation

246
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,220
Right

247
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,750
I guess I should explain it clearly

248
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,420
Since I'm saying this anyways

249
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,420
Yes please tell us

250
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:53,920
Right

251
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:05,100
My  relative's grandfather is an American

252
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,100
Your,

253
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,500
I didn't know that before

254
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,940
Your relative?

255
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,940
Yeah he's an American

256
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,140
That's-

257
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,740
What's his name?

258
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,740
Umm

259
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,410
Demi Rouge, that's his name

260
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,410
Demi Rouge?

261
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,130
Demi-

262
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,200
So his name is also Demi?

263
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,620
Demi Rouge?

264
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,380
I didn't think the name Demi would come up this quick

265
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,090
So that's how, you know Demi Moore?

266
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,090
Right?

267
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,000
She's his relative

268
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,280
Right, right she's my relative

269
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,250
So that's how?

270
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,210
Right

271
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,130
Which Ohsho was it? There's a lot of branches

272
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:36,960
Well,

273
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,630
It was in Shinbashi

274
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,360
I know that store in Shinbashi

275
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,260
A lot Shinbashi today

276
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,360
Yeah there is one

277
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,420
Well won't people find out now?

278
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,640
Yeah that's not good

279
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,640
Yeah

280
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,710
It's the place near the small theatre

281
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,710
Won't people find out now?

282
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,610
Nobody found us out though

283
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,480
Nobody knew it was Demi Mo-ore

284
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,390
Cause she was wearing a baseball cap

285
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,790
A Hanshin baseball cap

286
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,360
It was the two of you?

287
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,490
Yeah
What did you get?

288
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,430
Well we went together, we got Kata Yakisoba

289
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,970
So actually, you didn't get Gyoza?

290
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,970
Yeah, cause like Gyoza,

291
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,900
She said it makes her breath smell

292
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,250
She really didn't like it, Mooah didn't like it

293
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,660
You call her "Mooah?"

294
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,960
Mooah

295
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,780
So then why did you go to Ohsho?

296
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,780
Right, why?

297
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,210
Why did you hide it?

298
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,510
Even from us?

299
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,580
Yeah

300
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,520
I don't get that

301
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,520
Yeah

302
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,510
Well,

303
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,980
Cause it's an impressive story

304
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,980
Yeah it's nothing indecent

305
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,450
Well honestly,

306
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,220
If I told everyone I was related to Demi Moore,

307
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,960
People like Hamada-san will come around asking for an autograph

308
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,960
Surely Hamada-san wouldn't do that?

309
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,960
Yeah

310
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,160
It's to avoid something like that

311
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Yeah

312
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,440
It's a burden

313
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,520
It's a burden

314
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,290
Surely it's not a burden

315
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,710
So it's a true story then?

316
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,710
Oh yeah of course of course

317
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,210
Yeah

318
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,450
Are you for real?

319
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,350
Yeah

320
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,420
Why didn't you go to a nicer Chinese restaurant than that?

321
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,420
Yeah

322
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,420
It seems unlikely

323
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,870
A Japanese restaurant maybe

324
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,130
Husband, you know her husband?

325
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,560
Her husband?

326
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,610
It was Bruce Willis before

327
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,700
Well she might be divorced now

328
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,000
It was Bruce Willis, before

329
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,660
That's right, they were married
Yeah

330
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,010
Bruce Willis wa-her-hu-band

331
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,380
Lie TIME Over

332
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,270
He has no punchline

333
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,610
No punchline at all

334
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,920
A judgement call had to be made

335
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,920
Yeah

336
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,520
Cause the Bruce Willis thing is a really old story

337
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,760
Man it's all massive lies!

338
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,370
Yeah

339
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,760
It's scary

340
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,760
They're all massive lies

341
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,130
I'm really nervous right now

342
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,400
Endo picks someone to tell a small lie

343
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,400
I have to say it?

344
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,070
Hamada-san,

345
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,070
What?

346
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,940
I've heard recently,

347
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,640
You've been going to Saitama to drink a lot these days

348
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,280
How do you know?

349
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,280
Well,

350
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,280
Yeah

351
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,970
I've just heard "Hamada-san likes to drink in Saitama a lot"

352
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,930
Ah, yeah, well yeah I have been doing that

353
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,050
Do you know where?

354
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,820
I know the location, it's in Omiya

355
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,060
I see

356
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,990
Omiya Omiya, yeah

357
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,990
It's in Omiya?

358
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,990
Yeah

359
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,590
Omiya is pretty urban

360
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,590
It is

361
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,260
Well yeah I guess there's no point in hiding it,

362
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,200
Chief Producer Suga Kenji

363
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,200
It's with Suga-chan

364
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,200
With Suga-san?

365
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,170
You've been drinking with Suga-san?
Yes yes

366
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,320
He lives in Saitama?

367
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,680
Suga

368
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,680
Suga-san invites me a lot

369
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,680
Ah, you go cause he invites you?

370
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,320
"Let's get something to eat, let's drink"

371
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,100
But you have to go there?

372
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,450
Yeah!

373
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,690
We could go somewhere in the city, but he says "Come please!"

374
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,230
Like a snack bar?

375
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,500
Like an Izakaya or such

376
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,910
What's it called?

377
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,230
What's it-

378
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:05,040
Gonbei

379
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,480
Gonbei?

380
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,610
Never heard of it before

381
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,660
So lame!

382
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,760
So cheap

383
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,270
A chain store?

384
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,580
Sounds cheap
Maybe it's a chain, maybe not I think

385
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,010
What do you guys talk about?

386
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,250
Do you guys go into detail?

387
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,960
"What if I appear at the end of No Laughing?"

388
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,280
He asked that

389
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,590
Ah, stuff like that?

390
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,960
That's not a good conversation for an Izakaya

391
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,950
That's true

392
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,380
We're tired of that

393
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,590
Anyways, that's what he said

394
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,960
Listen to this old man

395
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,960


396
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,770
You drive there?

397
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,970
I take the train sometimes too

398
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,370
Eh?

399
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,080
Ehhh?

400
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,440
Really?

401
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,550
This is surprising!

402
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,710
Well maybe it's to avoid drunk driving

403
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,010
Ah

404
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,440
Yeah perhaps

405
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,440
Yeah yeah exactly

406
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,280
So I go on the train

407
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,550
Why not a Taxi?

408
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,020
Which line?

409
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,350
Hmm?

410
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,710
Which line goes to Omiya?

411
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,500
Yeah which train?

412
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,650
Where do you get on?

413
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,650
I-

414
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
The line?

415
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,790
I don't really know but, I'm just sort of on the train

416
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,860
Amazing, he does it all by sense

417
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,000
Amazing indeed

418
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,330
Lie TIME Over

419
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,330
He doesn't even know the line

420
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,900
Well there's a lot of interchanges

421
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,970
Maybe the Saikyo Line?

422
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,340
Alright

423
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,610
Matsumoto picks someone to tell a small lie

424
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,510
Tanaka?

425
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:26,250
Is it true that out of all the comedians, you're dick is the biggest?

426
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,250
For real?

427
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,190
Out of all the comedians?...

428
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,190
First time hearing this

429
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,220
Did Kato-san from Gokuraku Tombo tell you that?

430
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,220
Oh, yeah, it was!

431
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,090
Well, comparing to other comedians,

432
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,240
I don't really like showing that part of me

433
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,880
Oh yeah, you're not

434
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,880
However,

435
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,940
I've shown my dick to just Kato-san before

436
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,970
And he was really surprised, like "Wow that's big"

437
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,010
And I had no idea personally

438
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,470
But Kato-san,

439
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,030
He's seen almost every comedian's penis

440
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,490
So he can tell

441
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,490
How big is it?

442
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,460
Right now? Well in all honestly it's not that big flaccid,

443
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,430
But it's impressive when hard,

444
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,030
My boner is very impressive

445
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,560
It's embarassing-
So Kato-san saw your boner?

446
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,730
Yeah exactly

447
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,130
What are you saying about Kato-san?

448
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,880
Why were you hard?

449
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,130
So Kato-san, he's seen every comedian's ...

450
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,240
every comedian's erection?

451
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,570
That's the conclusion

452
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,570
Kato-san is the weird one

453
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,980
Yeah that was just, morning wood I guess

454
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,580
In the morning he just pulled the blanket while I had morning wood, as a joke,

455
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,930
So as a joke, he went like that,

456
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,650
And then after seeing my erection,

457
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,190
He was taken aback

458
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,890
"Is it really that big?" is what I said

459
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,360
I wonder how it ranks amongst the other comedians

460
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,670
I think it's within the Top 10

461
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,000
Did he tell you if you're smaller than anyone?

462
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,140
Ah,

463
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,140
He did he did,

464
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,740
XXX-san

465
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,940
Well it's a rumor but,

466
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,920
I've heard his is pretty impressive

467
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,280
Was it erect?

468
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,280
It was an erection I believe

469
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,660
He saw his erection?

470
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,160
I didn't really have that image of you

471
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,590
Coincidentally we have the same birthday
Really?

472
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,870
April 26th

473
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,170
Oh really?

474
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,060
So maybe that birthdate and our dicks are related

475
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,150
I don't know any others,

476
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,100
But like, this kind of story is shocking right?

477
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,370
Yeah I get it

478
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,370
It's difficult to bring up

479
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,170
What about your wife?

480
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,550
Has she said anything?

481
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,070
Well, yeah my wife has seen my erection of course,

482
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,770
What did she say?

483
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,070
My wife, well,

484
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,850
My wife said "Your cock is impressive!"

485
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,920
I've been told

486
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:45,360
Lie TIME Over

487
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,120
What the hell

488
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,310
What the hell man

489
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,360
What kind of story did that turn into?

490
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,360
It's embarasing!

491
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,760
I don't really tell this story

492
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,900
It's actually, difficult to brag about that

493
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,540
Hamada will pick someone to tell a small  lie

494
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,720
Hamada-san...

495
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,100
Again huh?

496
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,440
I want to take this chance to confirm this story,

497
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,580
It's kind of weird,

498
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,280
Endo?

499
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,280
I've heard before eating dinner, you always eat a booger first

500
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,420
Sorry

501
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,870
This is...

502
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,870
Really?

503
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,220
You shouldn't do that!

504
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,590
I know that

505
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,990
It's something children do

506
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,040
That's true

507
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,550
Even kids don't do that!

508
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,160
Actually, have you guys never done that?

509
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,430
Well maybe messing around as a kid I have

510
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,430
Yeah yeah

511
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,890
But as an adult...

512
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,070
Never

513
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,070
Yeah never

514
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,140
I don't understand why you'd eat that with dinner

515
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,640
Well, of course it has that salt taste

516
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,840
It's salty?

517
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,050
It's salty

518
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,050
It's tasty?

519
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,410
Honestly, it is tasty

520
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,080
What?

521
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,350
Honestly, it is tasty

522
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,350
Oh wow

523
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,320
There's no way that is tasty!

524
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,160
Well, like-

525
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,340
You're disgusting man

526
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,720
Why?

527
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,760
What's tasty about boogers?

528
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,400
Well one time, Hamada-san invited me out to dinner

529
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,400
Yes, yes

530
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,130
I thought I would get caught, did you notice then?

531
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,240
I didn't, I didn't

532
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,820
You didn't right?

533
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,100
How do you hide it?

534
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,110
Well for example,

535
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,810
Right

536
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,910
So I do this for snacks, as well as meals,

537
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,640
Like this, when I'm doing this,

538
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,740
Should I do it like I always do?

539
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,580
Yeah like always

540
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,580
Yeah show us

541
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,210
Ah, you wouldn't notice that, yeah

542
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,640
Yeah

543
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,460
Oh like that huh?

544
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,560
You have to pay really close attention

545
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,160
You wouldn't notice that

546
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,160
Indeed, you wouldn't

547
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,630
So you do this multiple times throughout the day?

548
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,270
I do it for sure before eating

549
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,200
So in fact, you save your boogers for before meals?

550
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,870
Yeah I do that

551
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,470
Even when I'm not that hungry,

552
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,910
I have dinner BECAUSE I want to eat my boogers

553
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,230
Ah, it's backwards then,

554
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,790
The boogers are more important

555
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,110
What?

556
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,750
Just eat your boogers then

557
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,280
But, that's the one thing I won't do

558
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,450
That I won't do

559
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,040
You don't like that?

560
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,840
You don't like boogers on their own?

561
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,550
I don't like the that

562
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,590
Cause that's gross?

563
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,010
Do you ever feel grossed out?

564
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,590
Never- Well maybe once

565
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,600
When I had a fever, and I had to eat something

566
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,370
And my wife, or girlfriend at the time would make me food,

567
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,440
And while I was laying down in bed,

568
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,970
She would feed me, since I couldn't do it

569
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,210
And when she would feed me,

570
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,010
When she would feed you,

571
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,280
The person feeding me doesn't know I eat boogers,

572
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,550
So then, I like,

573
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,050
There were a few times I fed myself, and I did this,

574
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,290
And when I did this,

575
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,360
I cut the inside, with my nail

576
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,700
And then I was grossed out a bit, I thought it would taste like blood,

577
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,370
I did think "Damn, I should really stop this"

578
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,200
But other than that incident, I do it nearly daily

579
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,610
Even today,

580
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,610
Today this morning,

581
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:58,380
Lie TIME Over

582
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,380
You should stop doing that

583
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,470
The flashback was too long

584
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,880
Yeah the flashback...

585
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,380
The flasback was a bit too long

586
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,930
Alright then,

587
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,130
Hamada will pick someone to tell a plausible  lie

588
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,790
A plausible lie huh?

589
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I've heard the guy in XXXXXX is you...

590
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,200
Eh?!

591
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,770
After this,

592
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,770
Matsumoto is secretly that person?!

593
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,140
Wow, that's...

594
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:33,420
Hamada will pick someone to tell a plausible  lie

595
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,320
I think you guys,

596
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:33,420
I think you guys will be really surprised at this story, like "Wow really?!"
I just wanna confirm,

597
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,250
You...

598
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,560
I've heard the guy in the Funassyi costume is you...

599
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,570
TN: Funassyi is a mascot for Funabashi, Chiba. The mascot is known for it's energetic movements

600
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,400
Wow, that's...

601
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,290
No no way

602
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,130
I can't really believe that...

603
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,520
Well this is...

604
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,730
Well it was,

605
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,440
I'm not always the guy in the costume,

606
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,770
Ah I see

607
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,440
Yeah, uhhhh

608
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,480
There was just one time I was asked to do it

609
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,350
And I said "Alright"

610
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,750
It was someone who helped me out in the past

611
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,200
Who?

612
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,490
The actual guy in the costume

613
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,290
The real guy inside?

614
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,400
Yeah yeah yeah

615
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,280
Why did he ask to switch?

616
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,490
He was feeling really sick

617
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,660
Well, I guess Funassyi is pretty busy

618
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,980
Yeah

619
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,420
Well it would make sense they'd get tired...

620
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,870
Yeah

621
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,870
Yeah once in a while

622
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,990
But asking you...

623
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,120
You'd get found out

624
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,940
Isn't it really tiring to imitate those movements?

625
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,420
Yeah, he said "Matsumoto, sorry about this"

626
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,210
I just need your time. It's unrelated, but for Fuji TV,

627
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,280
At Odaiba they had some event

628
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,480
They had me running around on a Tatami mat the whole time

629
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,880
Sounds tough

630
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,720
There's a lot of jumping too

631
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,030
Mmmhmm, yeah yeah

632
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,410
How would you do it? Show us

633
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,370
I wanna see that

634
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,100
That's not it

635
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,850
Funassyi!

636
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,580
Ah!

637
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,780
You would say that?

638
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,240
Doesn't she jump a bit more than that?

639
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,730
There's also the greeting

640
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,450
What are you doing?

641
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,610
She jumps too right?

642
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,880
Like this, and then

643
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,490
The "Nashi!" line is something I adlibbed

644
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,490
And they said "That's a great idea!"

645
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,010
Ah, you came up with that?

646
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,290
Yeah

647
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,120
It wasn't there before?

648
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,960
I wanted to say like "This sucks!", so I said "NASHI!"

649
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,960
"Yeah Matsumoto we can use that"

650
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,030
Eh? Did it sound like the normal voice for Funassyi?

651
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,970
Yeah yeah

652
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,440
How many times have you taken over for them?

653
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,440
Yeah

654
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,190
Ummm,

655
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,680
I did it 2 or 3 times,

656
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,480
And you probably don't know this,

657
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,850
There's other celebrities inside the costume

658
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,950
There's like a secret league for the people that have done it

659
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,020
Incidentally,

660
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,560
There's a bear character too right?

661
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,080
Is the guy in the bear costume someone we know?

662
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,440
Yeah, yeah it's Shibata Kyohei

663
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,720
TN: Famous actor

664
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,470
There's a lot of unexpected people doing that

665
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,040
Shibata Kyohei?...

666
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Why not just bring out Shibata-san then?

667
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,600
Yeah that would be better

668
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,140
Yeah forget the costume then

669
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,230
Sounds tough!

670
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,870
It does

671
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,510
I said that too

672
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,640
"Shibata-san, do you really need the costume?"

673
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,350
He said "You flatter me!"

674
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,370
And then we laughed

675
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,560
And then you laughed?

676
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,630
Well, if you say so

677
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,950
Oh wow really?

678
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,050
It was amazing when I found out

679
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,290
Eh so it's like that for other mascots?

680
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,290
Yeah

681
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,270
One of them is TKO Kinoshita

682
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,430
Well anyways, I thought it would be fun

683
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,860
How did it go again? Show us once more

684
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,940
Yeah once more

685
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,650
Funassyi~! - Like that

686
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,780
Do you need to make that face too?

687
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,060
Well after all, it is fun to do so

688
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,830
To get into it like that

689
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,470
I might as well right?

690
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,700
Next week

691
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,670
Improv Liar Inn - Finale

692
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:16,510
"I've been smacked by a Gorilla"

693
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,550
And then the gorilla crouched down and-

694
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:23,710
A sad farewell to the ones who raised him

695
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,510
And last time I saw them, they totally ignored me

696
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:33,560
The truth behind the "Best Father"

697
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,320
All we ever talk about is XXXXX

698
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,650
No way!

699
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,160
That's not on!
