1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,200
Today's presenters are the same as last week

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,200
Please welcome, FUJIWARA

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,640
This is a continuation of last week

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,320
Today is also Kuro-chan's life on an uninhabited island

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,500
Firstly, a brief recap

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,640
A room was built on an uninhabited island

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,470
All of Kuro-chan's items were transported to it

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,470
After which the drunken Kuro-chan was also moved there

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,780
While there, if he collects 7 balls he can make a wish

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,860
Through a mixture of rock and tree climbing as well as swimming, Kuro-chan was able to finally collect all 7

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,450
So, ladies and gentlemen

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,790
What will happen next?

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,900
Being able to get home so quickly wouldn't be great

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,300
What other drama can unfold?

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,900
There's more

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,070
By the way, the balls are quite big, right?

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,170
So actually, he's entitled to him 3 wishes

18
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,470
What do you think Kuro-chan will wish for?

19
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,810
Maybe one of the girls from SUN TV

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,650
Possible, possible

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,040
Maybe his own show as reward for putting him through all of this

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,490
Since the Wednesday Downtown staff put him through so much

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,220
Thus

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,230
Got all 7!

25
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,200
Next I'm going to make my wish come true

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,630
I want to escape from here

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,320
Can you go back now?

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,300
Finally I can go back

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
It took Kuro-chan three days to finally collect all of the balls

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,040
I have collected 7 balls

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,080
Can I get my wish now?

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,350
Make my wish come true-

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,050
What's that sound?

34
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,200
Come back quickly! Come back quickly!

35
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,620
What's going on?

36
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,260
What?

37
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,300
Why is the drone coming?

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,030
Wait a minute... it shouldn't be a drone

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,670
What's going on?

40
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,170
Come on, say your wish.

41
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,840
I can grant you any 3 wishes

42
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,280
The drone speaks

43
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,280
It can talk?

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,680
Is the drone Shenlong!?

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,720
Because the balls are so big I can get three wishes?

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,150
I can say anything, right?

47
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,220
Then,

48
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,690
I want my own show!

49
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,690
You got it, Degawa

50
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,890
Impressive

51
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,030
Bingo!

52
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,800
Kuro-chan's first wish has nothing to do with the island

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,940
Surprisingly, it's his own show

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,380
Shouldn't he find a way to get back first?

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,600
Give me my own show!

56
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,910
I can't do that

57
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,880
Why?

58
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,840
That just wouldn't be possible

59
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,840
Can't I wish for anything?

60
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,310
I can't make that wish come true

61
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,450
No. What's with this lack of ability?

62
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,880
That's reasonable

63
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,920
Consistent

64
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,020
Why can't you do it?

65
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:01,830
Well, first let me go back to Tokyo

66
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,500
I want to go back to Tokyo

67
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
I can't do that

68
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,670
Why!?

69
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,670
I can't make that wish come true

70
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,700
No, wait a minute. What can you do?

71
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,780
That's a little pathetic

72
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,970
Come on, say your wish.

73
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,240
I've been saying it since a while ago

74
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,780
I want to leave this uninhabited island and go home

75
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,650
That...

76
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,220
Boat. Give me a boat

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,990
I see

78
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,220
It's amazing that this wish can be achieved!

79
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,720
Such a weird wish!

80
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,360
I've set up the boat on the beach

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,630
Boat by the sea. Where is it?

82
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,360
Shenlong's ability is limited, sorry

83
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,440
So, he begins searching along the coast

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,040
Finally

85
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,370
Wait a minute, is that it?

86
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,450
It's this one. It's this one

87
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,820
That's good

88
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,320
A small boat, I have a boat

89
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,820
I've got a boat! A boat!

90
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,070
But...

91
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,390
Wait!

92
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,290
There is no rowing thing!

93
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,860
Where's the rowing thing? Where's the rowing thing?

94
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,370
Where is the oar?

95
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,100
Hey

96
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,270
Why didn't you give me an oar?

97
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,570
I'll prepare an oar for you, then

98
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,640
Just one isn't enough, OK!?

99
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,380
I need two, a pair!

100
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,280
I understand

101
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Fulfilling your second wish

102
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,050
Two oars for you

103
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,290
No! Wait a second!

104
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,760
So everyone, dragon humor, what do you think?

105
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,560
Hey, the oar is the second wish? Wait a minute!

106
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,500
And so, Kuro-chan uses up his second wish

107
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,730
The last wish is

108
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,640
In this case

109
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,670
I want to become a rich man

110
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,940
I want 1 billion. Give me 1 billion yen

111
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,100
There he goes

112
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,180
I can't do this

113
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,480
Why!?

114
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,480
Learn your lesson!

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,510
100 million, 100 million

116
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,010
I can't do this either

117
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,800
Isn't that bullshit?

118
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,820
Give it to me, I've been working so hard

119
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,260
1 million, 1 million, 1 million is doable, right?

120
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,660
Becoming less

121
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,400
Starting bargaining

122
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,660
1 million yen

123
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
I can't do this either

124
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,760
Why!?

125
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,830
What about 100,000? 100,000

126
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,940
So real

127
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,430
Ok, here you go

128
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,100
Is it possible?

129
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,740
Although i'm happy

130
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,840
So, goodbye.

131
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,360
Such a realistic amount

132
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,570
No, don't leave. Wait a minute

133
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,620
100,000 yen

134
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,010
100,000 is too little. 200,000!

135
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,010
10...wait a minute, wait a minute

136
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,020
It's come back

137
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,880
This is way worse that I expected

138
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,100
And so, he succeeds in obtaining:

139
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,940
A small boat, two oars and 100,000 yen

140
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,090
What the hell, fulfill your 3 wishes

141
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,400
Nothing was achieved

142
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,100
Unfulfilled wishes are piled up

143
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,670
What the hell!

144
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,000
Incompetent rage

145
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,860
Fuming inside the room

146
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,340
Unbelievable

147
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,710
That said, I'm going

148
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,650
You are responsible for putting the things in the room back for me!

149
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,350
Remember to put everything back!

150
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,580
Or i'll kill you!

151
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,790
Scary!

152
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,520
Angry Kuro-chan

153
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,820
There are too many killings declarations on this show

154
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,060
Ah, moving moving moving

155
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,400
I'm getting on, I'm getting on-

156
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,070
Bye bye, uninhabited island!

157
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,770
A successful escape from the uninhabited island

158
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,320
Is he rowing backward?

159
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,340
It's the other way around

160
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,540
Super tiring

161
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,680
It's too physically demanding. Life on an uninhabited island

162
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,920
With manual labor and unfulfilled wishes

163
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,860
He paddles for 3 hours towards the neighboring island

164
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,020
It took so long

165
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,400
Land, i've reached land

166
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,500
Pretty impressive

167
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,460
Finally

168
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,240
Dangerous

169
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,060
What's he up to?

170
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,950
Finally, i've arrived

171
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,600
The fall just now has a new meaning

172
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,960
Genius

173
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,700
After 56 hours, he steps onto occupied land again

174
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,560
I've arrived, i've arrived!

175
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,270
Then,

176
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,190
Where is this place?

177
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,260
This is Iejima's Bose in Hyogo Prefecture

178
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,800
Hyogo Prefecture?

179
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,460
He confirms the location

180
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,440
And boards a ferry to Himeji Port in Honshu

181
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,650
I took a cab because I had the money

182
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,720
Where is he going?

183
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,620
Please take me to Himeji Station

184
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,660
Are you an entertainer, sir?

185
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,160
Ah, for the moment, yes

186
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,020
You are an entertainer!

187
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,730
Yes

188
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:07,100
It's been a long time since I've talked to someone

189
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,900
I'm here, i'm here

190
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,610
Why should I use my own cash to go home?

191
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,540
I should absolutely let you pay for this

192
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:24,720
A rare return to Tokyo from the uninhabited island project with his own money

193
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,250
He's one of a kind

194
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,460
Returning to his real home again after 4 days

195
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,790
Great, but his stuff?

196
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,480
I don't think it's there yet.
-No, not arrived

197
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,660
But the room is cleaner.
-Yes, it's cleaner

198
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,660
Huh?

199
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,500
There's nothing left

200
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,770
Oh yeah, I haven't gotten my stuff back yet

201
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,780
Huh? Wait a minute, wait a minute

202
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,180
Eh? Eh? Wait, what's going on?

203
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,780
The refrigerator is missing

204
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,820
Eh? There's nothing left. Wait, what's going on?

205
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,480
Also...

206
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,660
The stuff here is missing too!

207
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,980
Scary

208
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,270
What should be here wasn't on the island, huh?

209
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,970
Why is it all gone?

210
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,800
Scary

211
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,340
There's nothing left. Back over here...

212
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,080
Huh?

213
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,740
100,000 yen

214
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,290
Ah, it's 100,000 yen

215
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,160
His wish

216
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,740
And then

217
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,560
What is it?

218
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,330
Another letter?

219
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,120
Congratulations on escaping from the uninhabited island

220
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,480
We would like to inform you of one thing

221
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,260
The house that Kuro-chan has lived in for 15 years is planned to be demolished

222
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,440
Eh?

223
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,010
This place...is going to be demolished?

224
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,920
Surprisingly learned from the show

225
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,080
No, why do you know?

226
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,550
Why do the staff know stuff that I don't?

227
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,190
Yes, so far we have used this site for many shoots

228
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,640
So this house is full of memories

229
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:20,940
After 63 years of existing, the decision was made to demolish the entire building

230
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,010
Residents were asked to move out by the end of August

231
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,810
So from tomorrow, we will start looking for a new home

232
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,100
Please have a good rest in your room today first

233
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,220
Looking for a new home?

234
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,990
Wait a minute, I do not understand this development, i'm not following

235
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,690
It's not over yet? Escaping from the island is not the end?

236
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,460
I do not understand ah... there's so much I don't understand

237
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,670
Where is my stuff? Where is the stuff from the other rooms?

238
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,940
Kuro-chan's belongings are being kept by the program team until he finds a new home

239
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:07,380
So, the island was just a prelude to Kuro-chan finding a new home

240
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,420
Hey, I didn't hear that the house was going to be demolished

241
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,160
It looks like there is still a lot of information for Kuro-chan to digest

242
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,390
For the time being, he heads to a convenience store that he has not visited for 4 days

243
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,330
Delicious~ So delicious!

244
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,820
He eats his favorite convenience store box lunch

245
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,140
And sleeps on the floor like this

246
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,000
Too tragic

247
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,280
What a day after coming back

248
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,010
Sleeping on the hard floor that night

249
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,950
He can sleep anywhere

250
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:50,020
So, a seamless transition from the uninhabited island to looking for a new home

251
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,620
This is the focus of the whole project

252
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,990
The program team has been one step ahead of Kuro-chan

253
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,700
We got the news that the residence will be demolished soon

254
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,640
So since everything needs to be moved out

255
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,000
We began to consider what to do

256
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,370
Which lead to this project

257
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,500
In a sense we're also doing him a favor

258
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,980
That's right.
-Helped him move

259
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,350
By the way, the two of us also accompanied him to find a new place

260
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,350
So folks, here comes the main event

261
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,250
So please continue to watch

262
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,640
Therefore, the day after returning home from the island

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,860
A weird way to wake up

264
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,600
Kuro-chan

265
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,340
Wow, what?

266
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,980
It's you two!

267
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,070
We're in

268
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,800
Coming in!

269
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,840
Wait why?

270
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,540
Wow - how clean it is!

271
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,110
Wait, why?

272
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,610
What? Why?

273
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,910
Why did you come in with the camera so naturally?

274
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,180
Wait a minute, what the hell is going on?

275
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,150
No need to keep playing up

276
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,450
This group of people

277
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,650
The same reaction every time

278
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,590
Okay, let's go

279
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,490
Let's go, Kuro-chan. Let's go

280
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,730
Wait a minute, I don't understand the situation at all

281
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,490
What is going on?

282
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,960
Looking for a new house, of course

283
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,660
What else could it be but this

284
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,860
Eh?

285
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,360
Come on

286
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,330
Eh? Really?

287
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,270
That hurts! Why did you hit me?

288
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,600
The building will be demolished

289
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,940
8 minutes walk from JR Shinagawa Station

290
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,980
Two-bedroom plus kitchen, rent 120,000 yen

291
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,520
Good location

292
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,450
For Kuro-chan, who has lived here for 15 years since arriving in Tokyo

293
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,490
This time, FUJIWARA decided to help him find a new house

294
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,840
So, the first house is

295
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,330
Over here

296
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,600
First of all, a house in Shinagawa Ward, where Kuro currently lives

297
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,960
Looks like a nice apartment

298
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,980
By the way, Fujimoto is the only one who has information on housing this time

299
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,440
Is this a public space? So narrow

300
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,180
Is it a parking lot?

301
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,910
There is such an area

302
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,850
Feels like something everyone can use together

303
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,680
This is not for everyone to use together

304
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,990
Eh? What the hell?

305
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,420
Eh?
-Eh?

306
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,560
This isn't communal?

307
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,160
No, this is a single house

308
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,960
Eh?
-Eh?

309
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,660
It's a lie, right?
-Must be, right?

310
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,260
This is a detached house

311
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,190
This is too big

312
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,160
This is a big deal for Kuro-chan!

313
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,730
Wait a minute, what's up with the detached building?

314
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,530
Please, please, please, please!

315
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,340
Wow, that's awesome!

316
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,200
Absolutely empty

317
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,770
Eh?

318
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,040
Ah, you thought it's an apartment?

319
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,410
No, this entrance is too big, right?

320
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,620
A big mansion!

321
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,070
I don't understand

322
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,540
That spotlight is outrageous

323
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,410
How fashionable!

324
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,210
No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait

325
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,780
This is great!

326
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,220
Wait a minute...wait a minute

327
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,220
Okay, first of all, this is the living room

328
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,320
No, no, no...Fujimoto!

329
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,420
Fujimoto!

330
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,200
This room is 45 mats

331
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,200
※1 mats = 1.62 square meters, so about 72.9 square meters in total

332
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,500
45 mats?

333
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,400
Yes

334
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,370
There's a heater over here

335
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,570
Heaters and other things have never been used

336
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,240
The house is 36 years-old

337
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,170
Unexpected...

338
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,940
It's an older building

339
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,680
The construction cost was 4.5 billion yen

340
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,580
4.5 billion?

341
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,950
A room like this

342
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,750
You can't stop yourself from laughing

343
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:12,100
This three-storey detached house has a total area of about 400 square meters

344
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,220
A 5LSDK mega house

345
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,960
Each room has ample amenities

346
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,310
Bathroom and toilet

347
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,570
It's not a matter of bath or no bath...

348
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,210
Wow, wow, wow, wow!

349
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,650
By the way, this should be introduced

350
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,650
Sauna room

351
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,580
Sauna?

352
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,040
Yes, you can have a steam

353
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,550
It's not even a simple sauna, it's impressive

354
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,120
Standard sauna room

355
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,490
A real sauna

356
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,330
This is not even a one-person sauna

357
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,460
Can fit a number of people

358
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,560
Eh, it's really impressive

359
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,130
Why are you locking up? Why lock me up?

360
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,270
Wait a minute. Open the door quickly

361
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,740
Open, open!

362
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,440
Don't do that kind of thing

363
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,640
Don't make such primitive jokes

364
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,980
It was not my intention

365
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,660
As for the uppermost third floor,

366
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,650
You can barbecue on the terrace

367
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,990
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?

368
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,680
The scenery is also great

369
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,830
Call all your comedian buddies to get together for a small bbq party

370
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,160
It'll surely be a mess in no time

371
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,560
I would never ask a comedian to come to my home

372
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,600
Troupe leader or something

373
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,530
I'd rather die than call him over

374
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,900
TKO's Kinoshita or something

375
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:33,970
※Due to Kuro-chan making fun of TKO's Kinoshita, Kinoshita angrily stomped on Kuro-chan's head backstage and then later abused him during a bout of drunkenness, which shocked Kuro-chan and led to him expressing his disgust for Kinoshita

376
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,200
I'd definitely be stomped on again

377
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,970
You won't get stomped on, it's okay

378
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,140
What's more,

379
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,800
He'll definitely be stomped on again

380
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,180
This is the maid's room

381
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,050
The maid's room? The maid?

382
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,680
Right

383
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,520
This place is exclusively for the maid

384
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,550
Lies!
-A bathtub?

385
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,520
A whole bathroom?

386
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,290
A complete package

387
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,930
The maids can live here comfortably

388
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,860
It's really something

389
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,970
This room is good
-Enough

390
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,030
It's enough for me to have such a room

391
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,380
After a look around the house

392
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,610
So, Kuro-chan, we've looked inside and outside of the house

393
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,540
What do you think is the approximate rent?

394
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,080
The rent for this place?

395
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,280
Looks so expensive

396
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,280
Monthly rent

397
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,550
Haranishi, you also think about it

398
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,060
How much is it?

399
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,230
800,000

400
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,540
Impossible

401
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,090
I don't think I can afford to rent it for 800,000

402
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,730
What about Haranishi?

403
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,560
It must be 2 million

404
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Sorry, Kuro-chan, I think it must be around that

405
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,230
Not 2 million, right?

406
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,900
The rent for this residence is...

407
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,100
1.85 million yen ($13,600)

408
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,880
This is the price

409
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,140
So, to live or not to live?

410
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,410
I can't

411
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,650
So quick

412
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,920
It is impossible to live here

413
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,420
Don't back out and regret it later!

414
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,290
This one is eliminated straight away?

415
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,590
Don't say later that the previous building is better. Don't say such things

416
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,090
Eh?

417
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,120
After all, we're going to see a few more

418
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,590
Of course, we can't just view this one place

419
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,490
Well, let's keep it for now

420
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,120
Seriously?

421
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,590
Let's keep it for now

422
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,930
I can't stay here, I can't stay here

423
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,260
No, this one is kept for now

424
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,630
No, don't make the decision for me. I'm not keeping this place

425
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,470
Kept!

426
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,940
Eh?

427
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,480
The first ultra-luxury residence is kept for the time being

428
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,990
Kuro-chan is now looking at the second home

429
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,330
Over here

430
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,430
Not bad!

431
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,870
How does it look at first glance?

432
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:42,970
Looks good too, right?

433
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,000
Another detached building

434
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,200
A single-family house in Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture

435
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,340
We went to Matsudo

436
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,010
Smells like a new building

437
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,580
This way please

438
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:03,090
This is the open kitchen, which is integrated with the living room

439
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,360
A total of 16 mats

440
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,360
※25.9 square meters

441
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,530
4LDK two-story small building

442
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,380
A common family home

443
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,660
And then

444
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,870
Ah, not bad

445
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,980
5 years old, so it's a relatively new construction

446
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,070
Kuro-chan, how about this residence?

447
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,580
To be honest it feels like it'd be good to live in

448
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,080
Considering the future, getting married or getting a girlfriend or whatever

449
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,920
It should be a good choice

450
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,450
Right?

451
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,060
The only disadvantage is that it is a little bit far from the city center

452
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,090
The only downside is this

453
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,290
If you don't care too much then there's no downside

454
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,230
No problem

455
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,480
So it's time to guess the price

456
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,370
180,000
-A guess of 180,000

457
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,340
I think less than 200,000

458
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,940
Is it that low...it's a single family home?

459
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,240
I don't know, it could be more expensive

460
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,660
350,000

461
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,860
It's not that expensive, right?

462
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,550
The price of this residence is...

463
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,960
85,000 yen

464
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,060
So cheap!

465
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,090
85,000 yen, eh?

466
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,190
So cheap

467
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,430
85,000 yen?

468
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,100
Right? It's cheap

469
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,230
It's so cheap. It's cheaper than where you live now

470
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,530
Yeah, my current place costs 120,000.
-120,000

471
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,240
Is it too cheap? A little suspicious

472
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,540
Yes

473
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,200
This house is a murder house

474
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,470
Scary scary scary

475
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,180
Wait a minute. What's going on here?

476
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,250
Terrifying!

477
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,350
Hey wait wait wait wait

478
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,220
Terrible terrible, what happened?

479
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,390
Why did you bring me to this kind of place?

480
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,520
※According to the Internet, there are three possible incidents: ① a man killed himself after killing his brother-in-law ② someone beheaded their mother ③ a woman hanged herself in a closet and killed her son

481
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,520
I said I said I said why why why why

482
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,820
One second

483
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,430
It's scary

484
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,500
How did it happen?

485
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
What what what?

486
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,030
Don't ask

487
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,770
Stop being nosy

488
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,210
Wouldn't it be troublesome to live here?

489
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,370
Have you decided?

490
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:03,970
Decide what...

491
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,610
Will you keep it?

492
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,110
Just keep it

493
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,260
I'm not keeping it

494
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,150
Absolutely not. It feels like there will be something nasty coming with it

495
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,020
Don't say that something nasty will come with it

496
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,020
It will!

497
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,180
There's nothing

498
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,890
Did this happen long ago?

499
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,590
Well...

500
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,000
So curious, seriously!

501
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,330
If you hear such a thing you can't help but want to know

502
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,080
And so, the second place is not kept

503
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,500
The three then headed to...

504
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,010
A single house in Yugawara, Kanagawa Prefecture

505
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,820
Nice place

506
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,280
Single family home

507
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,380
It's a detached house and...

508
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,050
What's wrong?

509
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,120
What is this?

510
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,620
Isn't it a bit rundown?

511
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,390
It's got charm
-Eh?

512
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,190
This is called charm

513
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,000
Intriguing interior layout

514
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,420
Indeed

515
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,200
How about it?

516
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,700
This...

517
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,570
Did the last occupant run away in the night?

518
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,370
Yes

519
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,570
There is too much life in it

520
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,310
No, no, no

521
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,580
The occupant just left, right?

522
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,580
It's not the kind of place that says that

523
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,480
This side is full of garbage

524
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,120
Can really smell it

525
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,920
It's obviously the smell of dust

526
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:28,550
A two-level 2LDK small detached house with full amenities

527
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,400
The toothbrush can also be used

528
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,460
Ahhh, who used this!?

529
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,470
1, 2, 3, there are three people living here!

530
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,440
Since you're complaining so much
-What?

531
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,910
I'll tell you the best part

532
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,540
There's something good?
-Check this out

533
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,080
Over here

534
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,250
This side is still being cleaned up though
-Cleaning up?

535
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,280
It comes with this garden
-A garden?

536
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,220
A garden

537
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,460
It's about the size of a tennis court

538
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,730
This is that big?

539
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,840
He can take up gardening

540
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,430
You can turn it into a garden of your choice

541
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,060
Even this place with trees growing?

542
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,470
All of them are your own personal trees

543
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,300
Personal tree?

544
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,140
Personal tree

545
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:17,440
One more thing, Kuro-chan, please look over here
-What?

546
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,280
How about that?
-Really?

547
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,080
That right there is an orange

548
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,180
The oranges are said to be really delicious

549
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,590
From whom did you hear that?

550
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,650
Go and look

551
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,060
Orange? The real thing?

552
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,160
Can I walk on there?

553
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,040
Now he's definitely back from an uninhabited island

554
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,180
What the hell is this?

555
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,220
What's going on here?

556
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:09,730
Kuro-chan, you are even allowed to dig traps on this residence

557
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,090
It's a beautiful trap

558
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,390
I recommend this one!

559
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,350
Impossible to find

560
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:19,490
So, as this section is within the lease, the land offers ample opportunities for different shots

561
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,950
He let his guard down

562
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,790
It's the most suitable residence for outside scenes

563
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,020
Kuro-chan would definitely suffer here

564
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,210
This is dug way too big

565
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,110
The hollow inside is too big, right?

566
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,110
Incase you ran over there...

567
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,780
We had to consider all the circumstances beforehand

568
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,250
No, it's not okay. This is really bad, right?

569
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,690
And the house is not good at all

570
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,290
And it's as if the residents ran away halfway through their occupancy

571
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,790
Although their rent predictions are as shown

572
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,400
The correct answer is

573
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,770
0 yen

574
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,470
What is the deal with 0 yen?
-What is the situation

575
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,640
This house is used by the local community association

576
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,520
This is a house where you can move in for 0 yen if you become the house manager

577
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
Manager?

578
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,950
Must become the manager

579
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,510
What is the conditions, what responsibilities are involved

580
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,160
Community affairs are discussed in the living room about once or twice a month

581
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,460
So the administrator has the responsibility of managing the reservation and delivering keys

582
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,470
Isn't this something only the locals can do?

583
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,070
I hope that Kuro-chan will become a more prominent member of the local community

584
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,070
0 yen if you take the job?
-0 yen

585
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,140
0 yen is a big deal

586
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,070
So what to do?
-Free?

587
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,010
Yes, oh?

588
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,210
When it comes to free, a lot of complaints disappear
-Yes

589
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,250
No, there is a slight feeling of nostalgia about it

590
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,720
As soon as you hear 0 yen, you start thinking

591
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,220
You can retain 2 places at the same time!

592
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,290
Keep one. You can keep this one too

593
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,920
But this may also be good

594
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,190
You can also let people fall in the trap here when you hold the meetings

595
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:49,890
They'll be injured!

596
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:53,760
I don't think there are any young people in the community association

597
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,770
Therefore, the trap room with 0 yen rent is kept for now

598
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:04,360
Next is a house in Toshima Ward

599
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,180
It's already dark!

600
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,820
Because we had to travel from Matsudo

601
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,910
This is it

602
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,080
I'll introduce it from this side of the room

603
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,810
This side of the room

604
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,820
This side of the room

605
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,580
Ah, there's a bed

606
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,580
There's a bed

607
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,120
What's this?

608
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,850
Wait a minute. This is a room. Does that mean this is the first room?

609
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,920
Yes, this is the room

610
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,460
Not the first room, but the room

611
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,460
This room?
-Yes

612
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,200
No. Where's the bathroom?
-It's not here

613
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,630
Eh?
-Eh?

614
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,400
What?

615
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
It's a shared apartment

616
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,640
Shared apartment?
-Yes

617
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,940
That means there are shared bathrooms and toilets?
-Yes

618
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:44,270
Yes, this is a six-story building with one room per person

619
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,180
A shared apartment with 36 people living in it currently

620
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,150
Girls too... in shared apartments, there are also girls, right?

621
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,990
Of course.
-Definitely!

622
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,930
Here's some good info

623
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,600
There are more than twenty married couples in this shared apartment

624
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,030
Eh? Love house?

625
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,170
What do you mean "love house"?

626
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:09,820
This is a shared living room with space for ten people to communicate and move around at the same time

627
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,590
There is also a standard gym

628
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,520
Wait, this is great, right?

629
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,850
The gym is so cool.
-Glamorous, isn't it?

630
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,260
Ah, there is also a piano

631
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,690
Do you know how to play?

632
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,630
I sometimes play "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"

633
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,330
Oh really?

634
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,890
Surprised by this

635
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,890
Unique technique

636
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,030
I kind of forgot how to play it

637
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,190
Can you be a little more measured?

638
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,130
Either play badly or play well

639
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,730
I was about to say, "So this guy has that side," when you suddenly started playing badly

640
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,860
Later, the current residents were interviewed

641
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,740
Is it easy to get along with each other?

642
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,850
We are like a family

643
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,750
A family
-Family

644
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,750
Do you remember everyone's names?

645
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,790
Because there are names and nicknames, you make extra effort to remember

646
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,460
Everyone has nicknames?

647
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,630
When did you receive the nicknames?

648
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,060
The residents meeting

649
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,500
There's resident meetings?

650
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,070
First, potential nicknames are put forward then everyone votes

651
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,200
A voting system?

652
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,070
You all decide together?

653
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:53,450
As such, a nickname will be assigned to Kuro-chan, who may become a resident

654
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,240
Adventurer

655
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,250
Please tell us what you like to do and what you're interested in

656
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,420
Originally he wanted to become an idol

657
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,090
I was tricked into becoming a comedian

658
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,560
I also do rock climbing

659
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,220
And I have a Level 1 Dance Certificate

660
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,590
And am also a certified Aromatherapy Master

661
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,430
"Idol", not bad, right? You can be an idol here!

662
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,070
Since you wanted to become an idol before, right?

663
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,530
"Idol"

664
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,400
I am Idol-yo!

665
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,600
I'm super happy!

666
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,240
What the hell!?

667
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,080
Whoa, I didn't expect to have so much fun
-Welcome, welcome

668
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,510
What's your rent prediction for this shared apartment?

669
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,950
It's quite suitable for Kuro-chan, right?

670
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,250
Because it is communal,

671
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,460
I guess there are many people who live here to save money

672
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,390
80,000 yen

673
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,060
80,000 yen

674
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,120
Wow, a good guess!

675
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,390
75,000 yen

676
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,890
So, here we go
-Please!

677
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,630
The rent here is...

678
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,180
115,000 yen

679
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,100
Unexpected

680
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,040
But isn't it nice? It even has a gym

681
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,370
Yeah but, going to the gym is not costly

682
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,380
So, Kuro-chan, what do you think of this place?

683
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:01,910
Keep!

684
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,150
Why?

685
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:11,450
Everyone here is very gentle and friendly

686
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,390
But its a gradual search

687
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,290
So i'd still like to consider other residences

688
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,960
Eh, more?

689
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,100
I mean, I finally found one that I like, so it makes me want to look at even more

690
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,140
Today, it took a whole day just to get to one

691
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,010
Number one and number two are absolutely impossible, right?

692
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,560
I don't know.
-I can't live there!

693
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,680
No, we don't know what you like, Kuro-chan

694
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,680
Keep? So which ones do you want to keep then?

695
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,650
The free one, and here

696
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,090
You're keeping the free one, you just can't let the free one go

697
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,620
I'm keeping the free one

698
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:50,730
And so, the search for Kuro-chan's new home enters a second day

699
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,230
Wow, what will happen?

700
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,140
Just came back from an uninhabited island the day before

701
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,900
Yes

702
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,410
And then immediately went on this location shoot?

703
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,170
Yes

704
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,140
What a mess

705
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,870
There's an "Adventurer" in the shared apartment

706
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,110
Kuro-chan is actually more like an adventurer

707
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,330
Shared apartments are not bad

708
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,810
Yeah shared apartments aren't bad

709
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,050
Yeah, I guess

710
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:14,070
But it'd be a bad choice for filming

711
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,420
Yeah

712
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,020
I don't live in Kasuga's apartment anymore

713
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,430
If Kuro's apartment is available to work with

714
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,560
It'd be a heavy blow to variety shows

715
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,360
A certain death

716
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,330
Especially for Wednesday Downtown

717
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:33,140
However, because Kuro-chan wanted to continue seeing more homes

718
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,540
The staff had to look for more

719
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,670
So after this, a week later,

720
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,180
Just as we were about to do some more viewings

721
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,280
Literally the day before

722
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,320
Kuro-chan got coronavirus

723
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,190
So we had to prepare to find other places after he had recovered

724
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,720
So it's not over yet?

725
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,730
How long will it take him to recover?

726
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,730
How long will it take?

727
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,500
Roughly

728
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,630
He should be out about now

729
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,170
Saying "out" is a bit...

730
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,970
He wasn't in prison

731
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:12,180
After the last episode - One month has passed

732
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,660
So, so...

733
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,710
It's FUJIWARA!

734
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,620
We are FUJIWARA!

735
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,680
Why did you come out?

736
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,790
To put an end to Kuro-chan's house search

737
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,490
I think we've had enough

738
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,360
Does it make sense to do it like this?

739
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,840
What are you talking about?

740
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:38,030
Therefore, one day in August, when Kuro-chan was successfully discharged from the hospital

741
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,570
So, this is the next day of house hunting

742
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,940
Great!

743
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,410
Day 2 day 2!

744
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,840
So excited!

745
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,850
I'm sorry for interrupting the shoot because of coronavirus

746
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,780
Really

747
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,280
It can't be helped...

748
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,620
It can't be helped

749
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,990
So, we've found a house you according to your wishes
-Really?

750
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,420
So please make a decision

751
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:07,440
He couldn't decide on a new home among the 4 residences he visited on the first day

752
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,330
And so, the first residence for this day was...

753
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:15,140
A 14th floor apartment in Chuo-ku

754
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,220
This is a decent place to live

755
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,210
Please come in, please come in

756
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,180
Ohhhh

757
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,610
Okay, okay, let's go

758
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,380
Please, please, please

759
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,580
Take a look

760
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,120
Ah, so spacious!

761
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,560
How about this place? It was built last year
-Last year?

762
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,590
A brand new apartment.
-Eh?

763
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,990
Suddenly a serious one

764
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,430
No, no, no...

765
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,930
You're helping me with this, you're helping me with this

766
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,340
The feeling of "let's stay here" came over me

767
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,300
Yeah, that's for sure

768
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,110
We can't take you everywhere of course

769
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,410
We also want you to make a decision quickly

770
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,210
Looks like it's for real this time, Kuro-chan

771
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,440
Just make a good decision

772
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,280
Did something happen here?

773
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,850
Not at all
-No?

774
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,310
Nothing

775
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,790
Age: one year and 6 months

776
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,980
A little larger than Kuro-chan's current residence

777
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,070
A 50 sqm 2LDK problem-free house

778
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,110
And it's brand new

779
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:13,160
Please look over there
-It's spacious

780
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,030
A walk-in closet
-It's super spacious

781
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,500
Is there any storage here?

782
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,870
What are you talking about? Can't you see?

783
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,940
The tone is so cold

784
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,640
I don't even know what he was asking

785
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,750
A house with plenty of storage

786
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,130
The rent is of concern

787
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,520
27... 8

788
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,120
28

789
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,890
28？

790
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,490
28？

791
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,320
So, Kuro-chan, how much?

792
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,030
This is also an issue, I can't guess the price

793
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,430
220,000

794
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,350
220,000?

795
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,270
The rent for this residence is...

796
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,010
255,000 yen

797
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,970
Ah, so close

798
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,670
You are both very close

799
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,980
There is no reason to refuse a house like this
-So true

800
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,310
So...

801
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,950
I am interested in this residence

802
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,890
Please let me think about it a little more

803
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,620
That's the process, right?

804
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,160
That...

805
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,760
It feels like the first half and the second half are completely different
-Hmm

806
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,550
The time lapse is a bit long

807
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,900
I'm sorry

808
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,440
What was done on the first day of the shoot?

809
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,600
There was too much of a gap between then and now

810
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,570
I don't know what the reason is,

811
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,770
Why did you forget?

812
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,940
You know, the money issue...

813
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,770
A little indecisive about money, I guess

814
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,390
Scared by the prospect of doubling his current rent

815
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,000
Therefore, the residence here is kept for the time being

816
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,000
Next: Room 6

817
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,480
A three-story apartment in Shinagawa Ward

818
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,530
Here, oh

819
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,470
But the problem is the rent!

820
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,200
Eh-

821
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,960
Not bad

822
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,170
Here. It's spacious, isn't it?

823
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,800
Very spacious

824
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,270
Not bad, huh?
-It's not bad

825
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:10,000
28 years old, 87 square meters, 2SLDK house with roof terrace

826
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,120
There is a Japanese-style room

827
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,520
Japanese-style?
-A Japanese-style room

828
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,750
How to put it, the scent of tatami is good.
-Not bad, right?

829
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,220
In fact, check this out

830
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,590
This is a buried type furnace

831
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,260
Wow!

832
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,090
It's like a trap door

833
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,090
If this is it
-A feeling of the Showa era, right?

834
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,060
Nice!

835
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,770
Sitting next to the furnace with a girl

836
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,370
And then, what?

837
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,340
No, no, no. Shouldn't you be calling over the chief and HIRO instead?

838
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,040
Isn't that hell?

839
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,770
Isn't that hell?

840
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,710
Why is it hell?

841
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,610
HIRO sweats from top to bottom all year long

842
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,550
With people like that putting their feet there

843
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,850
The chief would probably keel over

844
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,690
You can have a Yasuda Dai Circus meeting here, right?

845
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,350
No way

846
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,520
The chief will try and say something funny

847
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,230
Like he was pedaling his bike

848
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,590
He obviously doesn't know what is funny

849
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:00,130
He always says stuff like "it's been 20 years, let's take a bike trip" and other confusing things

850
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,000
I don't know what he's talking about

851
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,170
Sorry, it's my fault for bringing up the chief, I'm sorry

852
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,340
Then, in addition to the buried furnace and roof

853
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,470
There is one more thing to recommend about this

854
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,850
This part of the building is completely occupied by this place

855
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,550
So there is no next door neighbor

856
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,020
Just one place?
-Yes

857
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:26,690
Yes, a house that is suitable for entertainers

858
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,490
So how much is it?

859
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,430
About 340,000

860
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,160
340,000?

861
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,830
How is it worth so much?

862
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:38,000
280,000

863
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,840
Okay, lets see

864
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,600
Rent is 290,000

865
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,910
Almost

866
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:46,980
So close

867
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,750
10,000 difference

868
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,420
It feels like fate

869
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,090
So, what to do?

870
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,250
For this residence...

871
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,990
Enough...

872
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,060
Reserved!

873
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,830
Reserved

874
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:08,730
You've pretty much already said "this is the house", and yet there's still more

875
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,000
I don't think that was the tone he was trying to convey

876
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,400
That's what it meant

877
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,870
Isn't it more expensive than the first house?

878
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,540
Maybe a little expensive...

879
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,240
So you're not willing to live here, right?

880
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,950
But you always say something rash
-No, sorry

881
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,610
You can't live here

882
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,450
I do think it's good but,

883
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,450
You're going to run out of places to live!

884
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,120
The next one is the last one

885
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,320
Eh, the last one?

886
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,220
The next one is the last one.
-Didn't you say you've found a lot?

887
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,260
We barely saw any on the first day

888
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,290
Not that many!

889
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:43,550
So, the final residence in Kuro-chan's search for a new home is...

890
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,050
At last

891
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,200
Please enter

892
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,700
Excuse me

893
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,840
Ah, I see, I see

894
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,210
It's pretty good, right?

895
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,510
Yes, it is

896
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,280
Well, how can I put it?

897
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,510
How can I put it? It's a bit...

898
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,520
It feels like it's not the first time

899
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,720
Living room, dining room and kitchen

900
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:08,070
1LDK in Minato-ku, a 38 years old apartment

901
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:14,730
Doesn't it look a bit like your current house that'll be destroyed?
-Yes, it does

902
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,430
How to put it...

903
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:21,500
The size of the space is also similar, and the overall feeling is quite similar.
-Yes

904
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,870
It took a lot of effort to find this

905
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,710
I feel like I can live in it very comfortably

906
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,850
It's good, right?
-Yes, it is

907
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:35,530
The same as Kuro-chan's current house, a 4-story building without an elevator

908
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,020
And so, the rent

909
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,350
119,000 yen

910
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,690
It's below 120,000
-Eh?

911
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,360
And so, almost the same amount as his previous residence

912
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,200
Wow, what to do? This place is too good

913
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,370
Too good?

914
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,800
All the 7 residences we have seen

915
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,710
Think back over all of them again

916
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:07,380
Over the course of two days and viewing all kinds of houses, the one Kuro-chan chose as his new home is...

917
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,190
So Kuro-chan, which residence will you choose?

918
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:17,930
The residence I want to live in is...

919
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,730
Absolutely not!

920
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,130
Hurry up and choose, seriously

921
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,920
I know! Wait a minute!

922
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,270
I thought I would look at a few more

923
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,550
So Kuro-chan, which residence will you choose?

924
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:41,380
The residence I want to live in is...

925
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,720
The 290,000 residence

926
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,290
Is that so?

927
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,130
Yes!

928
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,360
The flat house

929
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,600
Yes, it's decided!

930
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,800
But you've been so concerned about rent

931
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,340
That place is twice as much as the place you live now

932
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,080
It is twice as much

933
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,810
What is the reason for this decision?

934
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,310
More rooms

935
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:16,150
Because there's no neighbors, there's no need to consider anyone else

936
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,190
This last place I was introduced to

937
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,560
Although it's similar to where I live now

938
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,630
It does feel nice

939
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,660
The rent is also low

940
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,130
So it does feel like a bit of a step up

941
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,830
But I also have the desire to live in a nicer place

942
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,240
We told you, right?

943
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:36,370
Eh?

944
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,140
From the very beginning

945
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,110
So after this, a formal residential lease agreement was signed

946
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,730
Finally, the moving day

947
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,850
The table should be...

948
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,820
The table should be set over here, right?

949
00:41:54,340 --> 00:42:00,920
Yes, we provided new types of furniture suitable for the upgrade in house

950
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,830
Earned a lot out of it

951
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,410
Even the widely known bed

952
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,380
Was upgraded to a King Size Extra Large

953
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,550
That's good living

954
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:14,110
Because of the seawater or rain

955
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,380
When it was shipped back it was covered with sand

956
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,050
I was really disgusted

957
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,610
So he got a new one

958
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:26,080
So, after disposing of the furniture that received damage on the island, the move was complete

959
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,800
Right at this moment

960
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,770
It's going to get dirty soon, right?

961
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,100
The team has prepared a moving celebration for you

962
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,530
Moving celebration?
-Yes

963
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,870
What?

964
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,200
Please

965
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,980
Something to hang?

966
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,380
The gifts prepared by the program team for the new home are...

967
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,350
It's a camera

968
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,050
Camera? What for?

969
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,720
Why a camera? Why have a camera there?

970
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:59,060
To prepare for 24 hours 365 days of non-stop uninterrupted Kuro-chan life

971
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,560
For what? No need to...hey wait a minute

972
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,330
Are you really installing it? Wait a minute!

973
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:15,460
Due to disassembling and re-installing, hiding it would be to difficult

974
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,610
Sounds like he's talking about a hair transplant

975
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:26,150
And so, two cameras were installed in the living room and bedroom of this new home

976
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,480
Then,

977
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,990
Really? Is this happening?

978
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:32,220
Wait, so I don't have any room to escape?

979
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:37,330
Change my castle back. Get rid of them!

980
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,160
In the end, he chose the most spacious

981
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,000
Chose a house in Shinagawa Ward with a rent of 290,000 yen

982
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,750
Can't you just tell us the address?

983
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,540
We can't do that

984
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,880
And there are cameras

985
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,210
Not all rooms are equipped with it, right?

986
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,540
Of course
-Just the living room and bedroom

987
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,210
Even in the bedroom

988
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,050
I think it was installed

989
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,720
When Kuro-chan wants to do something, he has to go to another room

990
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,030
He'll have to do it in the buried furnace

991
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,390
This is worse than prison, right?

992
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,900
It's too messy, right?

993
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,940
A great thing has occurred

994
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:20,800
You should let the audience be able to watch it on their cell phones

995
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,810
If Kuro-chan agrees, it's okay, right?

996
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,910
Like that game SEAMAN, right?

997
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,960
Do you mean to go to raising?

998
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,020
Click the phone and a piece of bait will fall down

999
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,150
So how about it? Now

1000
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,070
Now!

1001
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,150
Want to see Kuro-chan?

1002
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,660
There's a camera?
-Do you want to see it?

1003
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,540
Let's see it

1004
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,440
Of course you want to see!

1005
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,150
Really?

1006
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,190
Already a bit messy

1007
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,130
It's a bit messy

1008
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,330
Not at home

1009
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:49,000
Not at home

1010
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,170
Isn't this for a pet?

1011
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,670
What?

1012
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,340
People who have pets usually install this kind of camera, right?

1013
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,110
If you care about your pet

1014
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,510
Could really give him stuff treats and stuff

1015
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,340
So, let's take a look at the bedroom

1016
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,680
Not there

1017
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,360
He seems to be out now

1018
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,150
Gone to work
-Work

1019
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,220
A very precarious spot to place a box of paper, right on the edge

1020
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,760
Right in the corner

1021
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,510
Already jerked off a few times, right?

1022
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,600
Incidentally, the places that Kuro-chan didn't choose

1023
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,040
Apart rom the first residence

1024
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,980
All of them are looking for occupants

1025
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,220
All interested parties are welcome

1026
00:45:29,770 --> 00:46:14,750
Thanks for watching. Support me and get subs early at patreon.com/zwanster03

1027
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,430
Eh?

1028
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,790
Eh, what's this?

1029
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,880
Wait wait wait wait

1030
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,470
Eh, is this being filmed?

1031
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,950
Eh, what's going on?

1032
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,180
Eh, why? A live broadcast?

1033
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,770
Wait a minute. What the hell? Hey, wait a minute

1034
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,520
What's this? How are you doing this?

1035
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,750
I've moved, yes
