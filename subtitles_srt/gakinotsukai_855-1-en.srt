1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,920
[Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai, Thanks For Watching!]

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,320
Before the recording of "Gaki No Tsukai"...

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,000
As usual, the members are having a nice chat in the waiting room.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,580
As usual, the members are having a nice chat in the waiting room.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,480
However, Matsumoto is nowhere to be seen.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,380
-I mean, he's married and all...
-Right, right.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,420
Excuse me.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,760
Good morning.

9
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,830
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,590
Ehm... Matsumoto-san has asked me to deliver this.

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,470
Please take a look at it.

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,320
Again with this?

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,450
Today's card is pretty big.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,210
Letter of challenge.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,170
"You lot are a bunch of uncultured fools that don't understand sexuality."

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,250
"It pains me to hear how you fools philosophize about the meaning of sexuality with your wives."

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Here he goes again.

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,030
"So let's see who's the real sex technician, the real leading man."

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,950
"Let us see who truly is the uncontested key master of this craft."

20
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,130
"We will find out today."

21
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,870
"Hitoshi Matsumoto."

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,750
He's drawn a map again.

23
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,670
What in the world is this?

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,190
It's like one of those ancient maps.

25
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,130
What does "Old CX" mean?

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,700
That's true, it says "Old CX".

27
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,110
It's pretty far away.

28
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,770
"Old Edo Castle"? What's this?

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,110
What does that mean?

30
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,750
I know where the old Akasaka Prince Hotel is...

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,160
I mean, it's in the neighborhood.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,620
It's here, just downstairs.

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,420
Isn't it here?

34
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,790
-Right, it's just the second floor.
-He must be down there.

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,680
He should have just told us it was downstairs.

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,310
Is he waiting for us?

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,420
-Yes, he is waiting.
-What's with him?

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,910
I mean, he can do this because he's not losing every round.

39
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,710
For now...

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,430
Let's go.

41
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,360
Let's just go and get it over with.

42
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,040
In the past, the members have put their male pride on the line and fought each other.

43
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,880
Matsumoto came ahead in the first round, "Bra Unhooking Contest".

44
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,960
And Endo won last time's "Nipple Caressing Match".

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,930
On the other hand, Tanaka came last both times and got punished accordingly.

46
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,400
Now, who will be the one to take the punishment?!

47
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,720
Over here.

48
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,390
Whoa, that scared me.

49
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,380
So scary.

50
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,610
-He looks so scary.
-He seems super pissed.

51
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,080
-But why? I don't get why he would get mad...
-Right?

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,530
W-What's up?

53
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,880
Who was it?
Who said, "Let's get it over with"?!

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,010
I was listening to you!!

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,790
-That was me... Sorry...
-It was Endo.
-Endo.

56
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,870
-It was me... Endo...
-So he was listening...

57
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,560
I'll replace you with "Hello Keisuke"!

58
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,640
What'd you say?

59
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,980
I still don't know how "Hello Keisuke" is...

60
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,340
-He's "Hello Keisuke"!
-He's the same age as me.

61
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,360
Do you guys know what we're doing today?!

62
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,730
You fools!

63
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,070
I mean, you always say the same thing...

64
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,020
But you never have anything prepared...

65
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,840
You're always winning by pure chance.

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,970
You're right...
This project is pretty half assed.

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,320
Right?

68
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,950
That's true.

69
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,050
Only the location of the first one was different.

70
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,980
Right.

71
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,670
I mean that's true.

72
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,180
However!
Today's project is one I have been really wanting to do.

73
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,340
I wanted to strip off some underwear.

74
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,230
It's the first time we've heard anything about "underwear".

75
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,080
You did say "underwear" right?

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,630
I did.

77
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,440
So are we stripping off some underwear today?

78
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,210
Is this the first time I said it?

79
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,490
-Yes.
-Yes.

80
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,850
You didn't write anything on that challenge letter.

81
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,920
Oh so it must have been a careless mistake on my part.

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,880
How can you mess that up?!~

83
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,590
You could have noticed what we were doing if you were paying attention!!

84
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,170
I see...

85
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,710
Anyways!!

86
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,820
We're all ready to do.
Let's do it.

87
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,240
Alright.

88
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,590
Didn't you guys see it?

89
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,320
Come on!

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,550
You fools!

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,960
Whoa, this is pretty great.

92
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
It's a pretty amazing set.

93
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,840
That's amazing.

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,640
Listen!
10 women will drop down!

95
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,410
The rules are simple.

96
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,420
You can only use your feet to remove the underwear of the 10 mannequins that drop out of the machine.

97
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,090
The fastest contestant wins.

98
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,880
And the slowest contestant will have to suffer a humiliating punishment.

99
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,540
So for example...
Endo! How do you take off your partner's underwear?

100
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,170
-Can I be real with you?
-Of course.

101
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,390
My partner takes off her clothes first and I actually like my clothes taken off me.

102
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,880
I don't wanna listen to such graphic talk.

103
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,020
How about you?

104
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,470
I haven't removed panties with my legs either...

105
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,870
I just tell them, "Undress".

106
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,270
That's the worst!

107
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,410
Really?

108
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,070
What about you, Hamada?

109
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,750
I haven't done it either...

110
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,790
You guys haven't lived.

111
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,720
That's the funniest part!

112
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,340
I mean, do you go like this with your leg?

113
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,380
Basically, yes.

114
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,990
Whaaat?

115
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,260
-I've never done that!
-Me neither.

116
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,840
Like a cicada hanging from a tree.

117
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,380
That's really weird, isn't it?

118
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,750
-And then they suck on the resin.
-Resin?

119
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,950
That's so nasty!

120
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,070
The girls suck on the resin.

121
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,280
Alright, Endo!!

122
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,710
Huh?

123
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,750
Let's go!

124
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,910
Endo again?

125
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,200
I always go first!
I don't want to.

126
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,580
Let's go with someone else.

127
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,610
-I can go first.
-You're right Tanaka.

128
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,040
-Really?
-Huh? What?

129
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,380
-It would be great if Hamada went first.
-Please do.

130
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,790
Alright, then.
I'll go first.

131
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,910
-Alright!~
-Let's go!

132
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,280
What a man!

133
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,270
Okay then, it's decided.

134
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,830
Let's go with Hamada first!!

135
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,180
Isn't this impossible?

136
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,810
Do you think so?

137
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,770
I mean...

138
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,770
Look, look at it from over here.

139
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,260
Those are some crazy moves!

140
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,260
I've never done this before!

141
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,490
Will our Top Batter, Hamada, have the confidence?

142
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,700
How will he fare?

143
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,940
-Here we go.
-Let's go.

144
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,970
Here we go.

145
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:15,880
Start.

146
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,410
Here it comes.

147
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,290
Whoa, here we go.

148
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,500
Isn't he too fast?

149
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,570
You have to take off everything.
And you can't use your hands.

150
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,060
-Amazing!
-Amazing!

151
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,340
This is a bit...

152
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,280
Second one.

153
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,670
Isn't he too fast?

154
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,000
He's super fast.

155
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,540
Whoa! Amazing!
It fell off in one swoop!

156
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,570
-So fast!
-It fell off immediately!

157
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,290
You're kidding me!

158
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,820
-The shape of the underwear is also important.

159
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,750
Yes, they are all different.

160
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,250
-Amazing!
-The shape of each one is different.

161
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,430
Amazing.

162
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,200
This is pretty tiring.

163
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,020
-Whoa, awesome!
-That was so fast!

164
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,570
You just tore it apart!

165
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,450
-He's pretty rough.
-Awesome!

166
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,260
-That's rough!
-Yeah!

167
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,660
What was that?

168
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,190
That was pretty fast.

169
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,090
You did that on purpose!

170
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,730
That was on purpose!

171
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,690
This is looking more like a wrestling match!

172
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,530
-Just 3 left...
-Just 2 left!

173
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,570
Amazing!

174
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,320
He's so fast!
-He really is.

175
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,160
He's got great timing.

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,150
He's just breezin along.

177
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,770
Last one! Last one! Last one!

178
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,180
This one's got a big belly.

179
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,580
-Its belly is sticking out.
-Oh, you're right.

180
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,340
-The end!!
-Amazing!

181
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,350
That was super fast.

182
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,500
-Hamada, you were so fast.
-For real?

183
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,450
Amazing.

184
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,190
This is super tiring.

185
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,380
-Alright, let's take a look at his time.
-Okay.

186
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,460
Go ahead!

187
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,020
-That's so fast.
-Whoa!

188
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,710
-This must be super fast.
-1:30 is pretty fast.

189
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,320
I guess anything below 2:00 is pretty fast.

190
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,660
He was below 1:30.

191
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,050
-Okay then, who's next.
-Who's next?

192
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,400
-Whoa, Hamada... That was too fast!
-You should have gone first then!

193
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,730
Look at him.

194
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,490
He's already out.

195
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,580
Hamada, how did you do that?

196
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,900
Were you hugging it like this?

197
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,740
What do you mean?

198
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,790
It looks like Yamasaki has no confidence...

199
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,110
How will he fare?

200
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,860
Alright, here we go.

201
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,470
I'll do my best!

202
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,630
Start!

203
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,500
Look, look, he's struggling already.

204
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,250
It's getting stuck there.

205
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,930
-Did he get stuck in his feet?
-The button!
-The button!

206
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,710
Oh, he just lost some time.

207
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,500
He just lost a lot of time.

208
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,180
Watch out for his hands!

209
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,070
Push it!

210
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,340
This is bad!

211
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,850
Don't you have any self-awareness?

212
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,360
That was good.

213
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,720
He's so red!

214
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,760
How is he doing?

215
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,860
I guess it's easier from the back.

216
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,460
-It's harder from the front.
-He's so inefficient.

217
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,890
Hold on...

218
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,370
Look at his face.

219
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,580
He's so desperate.

220
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,310
He's desperate to avoid the punishment.

221
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,350
Oh no! It's stuck!

222
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,380
Come on.

223
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,550
-You don't have to kick it!
-Only 3 left.

224
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,340
Almost there.

225
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,090
You really need some stamina for this.

226
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,160
This one is pretty stuck.

227
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,510
She doesn't want them off.

228
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,420
It's off, it's off.

229
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,380
He's very rough.

230
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,620
-Last one! Last one!
-At then end you have to ******.

231
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,000
-It's off, it's off, it's off, it's off, it's off!
-Don't kick them in the head.

232
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,190
If he didn't press it this time...

233
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,160
-Right...
-It made a sound for a while.

234
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,330
Saki!!

235
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,990
-Saki!!
-You look so tired!

236
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,180
How did you feel?

237
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,430
-Of course I was slower than Hamada.
-You were so slow.

238
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,630
-But not by that much... I think...
-That was an average time.

239
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,280
Alright, let's see it.

240
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,970
What's his time?!

241
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,430
Alright!!

242
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,070
Whoa!

243
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,290
it's below 2 minutes.

244
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,110
I see!!

245
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,130
I see, I see...

246
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,010
-Alright!
-He did it below the 2 minute mark!

247
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,640
I mean, you were still close to 2 minutes.

248
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,770
-But it wasn't that bad.
-Let's go!

249
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,280
It really isn't that bad!

250
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,660
Alright.

251
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,300
-Who's next?
-I'll go.
- I wanna go too.

252
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,710
-I wanna see Endo next.
-I wanted to go next...

253
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,980
And we can save Tanaka for last.

254
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,530
-I see.
-Let me do it.

255
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,450
Let me do it first.

256
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,320
Let me pull those panties first.

257
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,610
Alright.

258
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,150
Hold on... This way...?

259
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,620
Which side you go is important.

260
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,220
Right... It changes.

261
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,950
You know... I have some muscle sores today...

262
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,040
Endo, who is used to getting undressed by a woman himself

263
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,230
is now taking on the challenge with a bit of uneasiness in his heart.

264
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,440
-Let's go then.
-You can do it.

265
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,480
Start!

266
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,330
Here it comes.

267
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,100
Alright, first one.

268
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,650
Okay, okay, okay.

269
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,140
Hold on...

270
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,540
Alright, that's good!

271
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,410
That's good.

272
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,600
-He looks so desperate.
-You can do it!

273
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,100
That's good.

274
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,020
That's good.

275
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,630
This is tough, it's tough.

276
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,250
Seems like the rest will be tough.

277
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,200
The rest will be hard for you.

278
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,010
He's moving his body a lot.

279
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,100
Here it comes!

280
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,260
-You'll start drifting away from the button if you move too much.
-That's right.

281
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,380
This thing is very well made.

282
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,650
Alright, alright, Endo is screwed here.

283
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,830
-This is bad.
-It's bad.

284
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,230
It's bad.

285
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,460
I don't think I'll make it.

286
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,220
Endo, you have to be more swift.

287
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,120
You have to make good use of the bed to be good at this.

288
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,510
Have you gotten the hang of it on the fifth try?

289
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,930
Oh, he's going for it.

290
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,920
What the heck?

291
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,230
-The panties from before are stuck on his leg.
-Right, the ones from before.

292
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,980
It's still there.

293
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,100
The previous panties.

294
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,020
The soup is getting cold...

295
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,640
You're talking too long.

296
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,930
Wait!
Oh my god.

297
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,430
-He's managing...
-He is.

298
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,310
What was that?

299
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,500
What was that?

300
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,820
What's wrong?

301
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,430
Endo looked like a mannequin just now.

302
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,190
What's wrong?

303
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,030
That one just now was good.

304
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,990
-This is the last.
-The last, the last.

305
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,050
It's the last.

306
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:37,720
Alright.

307
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,280
Why are these things getting stuck?!

308
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,470
Hold on!!

309
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,120
What's wrong with him?

310
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,290
Come on, Endo!

311
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,830
Look, it won't come off.

312
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,390
Hold on.

313
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,280
-Endo! Endo! Endo!
-Hold on, I'm trying here.

314
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,580
That was so bad!

315
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,660
-This was bad.
-This was really bad.

316
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,350
-Alright, what is Endo's time?
-Please...

317
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:03,910
Please...

318
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:05,860
Alright!

319
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,320
It's alright, it's alright.

320
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,110
It's not that bad.

321
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,640
He got 1:59 and you got 2:17.
It's not that bad.

322
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,190
It's alright.

323
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,760
But he was the worst in terms of beauty points.

324
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,790
Right.

325
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,090
-There's beauty points?!
-Yeah, there are.

326
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,160
That was bad.

327
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,720
You were carrying it like this.
No way that's possible.

328
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,690
Oh man...

329
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,750
But Tanaka, now you can relax.

330
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,970
That's right.

331
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,930
Hold on, let me just do this.

332
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,810
-What do you mean by "this"?
-You idiot.

333
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,460
Just like this.

334
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,020
What do you mean...?

335
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,190
I really can't move this part much.

336
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,140
You're really opening up your legs to us...

337
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,540
That's true.

338
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,220
Why are you doing it in this direction?

339
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,940
Sorry, just let me do this quickly.

340
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,740
Tanaka has gotten last place in the past 2 challenges...

341
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,150
He's burning with fighting power.
But how will he fare?

342
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,680
Alright.

343
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,900
It depends on how you move it.

344
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,710
Let's go.

345
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,270
Start!

346
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,640
Here comes the first one.

347
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,700
Oh, this one...
-Right...

348
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,310
-He's turning her around.
-Huh? He seems very calm.

349
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,190
Amazing.

350
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,950
Alright, that wasn't too shabby.

351
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,560
-That wasn't bad.
-Right?

352
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,530
He's pretty good at lifting them up.

353
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,300
That's good.

354
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,280
Whoa.

355
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,680
He'll get some beauty points for that.

356
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,240
-At the moment he's got those extra beauty point.
-I see...

357
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,700
Amazing.

358
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,170
It's stuck.

359
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,470
You lost some beauty points there.

360
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,680
-That wasn't too bad, was it?
-It was fine.

361
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,800
It was fine.

362
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,100
What's wrong with you?
Don't you think about the woman's feelings?

363
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,920
-He really doesn't care about the woman at all.
-Right, he's being too rough.

364
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,350
Huh?

365
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,170
Alright, here comes the seventh one.

366
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,860
He's gotten very good at catching them.

367
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,260
Since the first one I mean.

368
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,310
Whoa! So fast!

369
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,370
That was fast!

370
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,680
But he only has 2 more left.

371
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,990
This is good.

372
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,880
He's pretty good.

373
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,810
So fast!

374
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,270
-This!
-This was a surprise.

375
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,420
Last one.

376
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,000
He's going from behind.

377
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,100
Right.

378
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,100
Alright!!

379
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,720
I think I'm in the lead now.

380
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,450
Alright!

381
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,570
-You're right, there wasn't much wiggling around with him.
-Yeah.

382
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,190
Is he getting first place?

383
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,050
Come on, please.

384
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,850
Tanaka's time is...

385
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,140
This!

386
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,680
Amazing.

387
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,010
Alright!!

388
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,120
1:45.

389
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,910
-That was pretty fast.
-Right?

390
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,970
Okay, Endo is really in trouble now.

391
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,210
You're right, everyone else was below 2 minutes.

392
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,660
Everyone.

393
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,480
-Endo?
-Yes?

394
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,170
In that sense, Matsumoto has to be feeling the pressure as well.

395
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,520
Let's go then!

396
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,190
He might lose.

397
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,550
What is he doing now?

398
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,340
He must do this every night at home.

399
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,660
I'm always doing this whenever she takes a shower.

400
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,140
What's that?

401
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,040
Some stranger would be shocked if they walked in on you doing that.

402
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,690
That's so true!

403
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,830
I'm getting nervous.

404
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,820
-It's nerve wracking, right?
-Of course.

405
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,810
I don't like it at all.

406
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,980
Our last contestant is Matsumoto.

407
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,390
Will he manage to retain his self-proclaimed title of "King"?

408
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,840
It's all mind and spirit.

409
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,880
Can you quit it already?

410
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,800
-Just get it over with already.
-You know, we're all waiting here.

411
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,950
-Hold on! Wait! Wait!
-Oh no!

412
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,820
-I didn't mean to!
-It's coming! It's coming!

413
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,750
He pressed it, right?

414
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,750
You pushed it!

415
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,470
-It's started.
-You pushed it!

416
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,900
Look! He's wiggling around!

417
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,700
He's squirming a ton!

418
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,170
See? See?! See?!

419
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,090
He's doing it! He is!

420
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,990
He's squirming around.

421
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,200
Look!

422
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,560
This is not good, is it?

423
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,490
He's squirming a lot.
I mean, was I moving this much?

424
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,990
He's having a tough time.

425
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,900
Right?
He's gotta hook them.

426
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,580
Look, look.

427
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:28,770
Right, right.

428
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,790
He's struggling.

429
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,630
Look, look, look.

430
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,360
A miracle might happen for me.

431
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,810
You bastards!
Stop commenting on my every move!

432
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,530
What's he saying?

433
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,750
That one was clean.

434
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,220
-Yeah, that was good.
-It was.

435
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,170
Look, here.

436
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,740
Not yet, not yet, not yet!

437
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,010
Not yet!

438
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,000
I already did that!!

439
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,930
That's no good!

440
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,580
It's no good!

441
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,190
You're not done!

442
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,250
-No matter how good your time is, you're already out!
-He's out!

443
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,660
Look.

444
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,160
All done!

445
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,990
I'm safe, right?

446
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,630
What is it?
What is it?

447
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,900
One of them wasn't completely off the mannequin, right?

448
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,350
-Yes, there was one.
-Yeah, there was.

449
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,650
You dirty bastards!
The next one had already come down the hatch!

450
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,870
-But those are not the rules.
-It will come down if you press the button.

451
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,040
This one.

452
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,090
He definitely went over the 2 minute mark.

453
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,630
He definitely went way past 2 minutes.

454
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,350
Right?

455
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,020
Ready?

456
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,060
What will happen to Endo?

457
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,950
I think I'm safe.

458
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,520
I also think he's past 2 minutes.

459
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,340
-Or we can do a playoff with the loser from the first challenge.
-Right.

460
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,530
-He has to beat 2:17.
-Playoffs?!

461
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,490
-Here we go.
-Alright.

462
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,800
-Then let's see the last number first.
-Here?
-Yes.

463
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,030
-Five...
-Five seconds...

464
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,140
-Five...
-Hold on...

465
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,730
-Five... So it can be 2:15...

466
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,570
-Or even 2:25....
-Right...

467
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,250
Come on, give me something higher than 1.

468
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,220
Bam!

469
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,500
Isn't this bad?

470
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,110
-I mean, it could be 1:35.
-No way!
-No way!

471
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,140
Alright!

472
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,830
Here we go!
Here we go!!

473
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,370
-No way! It's definitely a 1.
-Yeah, it's a 1.

474
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,760
It's a 1!

475
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,300
No way it's a 2.

476
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,700
-It's definitely a 1.
-Here we go!

477
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,470
Let's go!!!

478
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,980
You're kidding me...

479
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,440
I knew it was this.

480
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,810
2:35 would have been bad.

481
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,760
Endo will take the punishment!

482
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,010
You're kidding me.
For real?

483
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:01,990
Endo!

484
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,630
Alright, for the punishment...

485
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,090
-Endo...
-What is this?

486
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,060
Really... What is it?

487
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,640
So the punishment this time around is...

488
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,330
Wear panties and go around a trendy part of town!

489
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,680
In my head?

490
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,660
Yes, you'll have to wear the panties on your head.

491
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,470
And you'll have to walk around in a trendy spot within the city.

492
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,510
-For real?
-Yes.

493
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,440
And the camera will be very far away.

494
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,720
For real?!

495
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,270
Yes.

496
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,820
A town for young people, it's Omotesando.

497
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,470
No one is coming near me.

498
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,470
They must think I'm a big pervert.

499
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,910
I was last place in the underwear competition so I'm here for my punishment.

500
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,030
I'm Endo from Cocorico.

501
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:56,340
Today I'm in a town for young people, it's Omotensando.

502
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,650
I'll be going then.

503
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,370
This is the worst.

504
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,340
This is really the worst.

505
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,200
These stores are so cool though.

506
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,830
As you'd expect from big brands...

507
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,880
No one is coming near me.

508
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,300
They must think I'm a big pervert.

509
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,540
They must think I'm a pervert.

510
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,950
I'm wearing women's panties on my head and all...

511
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,330
Everyone's looking at me.

512
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,750
This place looks alright.

513
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,790
Let's see.

514
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,370
How is the size?

515
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,660
It's perfect.

516
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,970
Do you only have this size?

517
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:17,900
Yes, only that size.

518
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,310
Do you think it goes well with these kinds of panties?

519
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,010
Yes, I would say so...

520
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,070
Is this some kind of dare?

521
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,540
No at all, I'm here on my own.

522
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,860
On your own?

523
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,030
But even so... I never see you on the street.

524
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,230
I mean, these are panties, right?

525
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,240
What do you mean?

526
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,520
Sorry.

527
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,710
I mean, this is not a hat, is it?

528
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,120
See you then.

529
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,060
-Say hi to your wife for me.
-Oh, thanks.

530
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,600
Look at him, he's shameless.

531
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,210
This store...
