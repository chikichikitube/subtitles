00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,820

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,820
New Years Party!

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,110
Excuse me please,

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,490
Excuse me, sorry,

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,530
Yes?

11
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,360
Surely this is too unfunny?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,220
Hosuei-san really wanted to start it off with this

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,080
Seriously?

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,130
In the midst of this explosive laughter,

15
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,330
this party has started!

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,060
His hearing is off

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,560
Let's ring in this year!

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,260

00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,730

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,210
PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,440
With that said,

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,890
Are you gays rady?

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,600
They literally won't laugh at all

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:13,910
Yeah

28
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,820
You're just saying normal things

29
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,640
You just stuttered a bit

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,640
Just stuttered is all

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,730
If I can't even get a laugh by stuttering, I've had it

32
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,930
They should laugh at that at least, right?

33
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,800
Please go ahead!

34
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,900
This is kinda scary

35
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:48,730
The 22nd annual Gaki No Tsukai New Years Party!

36
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:55,870
Plenty of great food and sake!

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,070
I haven't watched TV in a while,

38
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,070
so I thought let's watch TV once in a while,

39
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,980
TN: Housei often appears on this show

40
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,980
and DRIVE A GO GO was on

41
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,980
Thank you very much

42
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,180
You were mentioned in the episode right?

43
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,640
Oh I don't know

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,640
I just turned it on, and honestly,

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,220
I said "Wa!" and changed the channel

46
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,490
Why?

47
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,160
I mentioned you in that episode

48
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,180
Oh really?

49
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,160
I said "Matsumoto-san is watching this!"

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,640
"He loves this show!" I said

51
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,540
The staff gift them brand new Gaki no Tsukai merch!

52
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,530
Jenga!

53
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,800
This is pretty good

54
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,290
52 things Hamada Masatoshi Quiz

55
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,560
Let's see one of the cards

56
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,360
"Which of the four do you think is the filthiest?"

57
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,820
The answer,

58
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,560
"Tanaka"

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,560
Yeah, this is where that all started

60
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,600
The start of the joke

61
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,840
The start of the joke

62
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,270
Oh yeah, Takasu-san is...

63
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,000
Takasu's getting married

64
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,160
You didn't know?

65
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,290
I had no idea!

66
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,820
Ahh maybe cause you went to Australia?

67
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,130
I had no idea

68
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,200
Him and hip-shaking Obachan

69
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,220
Congrats!

70
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,780
Ms. Hip-Shaking Grandma

71
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,670
Congratulations!

72
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,070
I'm not sure what to say

73
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,490
Marrying who?

74
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,110
Her name, what's her name?

75
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,240
That's enough man

76
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,670
Look into the camera,

77
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,490
and say "I love you"

78
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,380
This is Gaki's tradition

79
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,250
Staff: Into that camera

80
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,550
Ah, so this is how Endo felt

81
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,530
I wanted to just simply say it, but I just can't!

82
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,160
Uwah do I really have to say this?

83
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,130
It would be better to hurry up

84
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,150
Right?

85
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,070
If you wait too long it's weird

86
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,530
This is the worst!

87
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,980
Do I really have to say this?

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,070
Hurry up and say it

89
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,750
Then here I go

90
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,930
Midori! I love you!

91
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,670
Now I don't care anymore

92
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,660
You already stopped caring?!

93
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,360
Honestly I,

94
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,070
I wish you didn't say that

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,640
Wait, wait

96
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,090
So evil

97
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,470
What's up with these two?!

98
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,470
So evil

99
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,310
Would normal people do that?

100
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,330
Would people normally say that?

101
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,580
He'll do anything you tell him to!

102
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,270
5th ever, Yama-1 Grand Prix!

103
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,890

Who will win this year?!

106
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,540
Zaki-san, how do you think this Yama-1 will go?

107
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,040
M-1 Grand-Prix is a television manzai contest

108
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,040
There is no more M-1 Grand Pee

109
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,780

110
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,780
only this YOWA-1 Grand Prix will do!

111
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,200
"YOWAMAN"?

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,560
Let's have some fun-piahhhh

114
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,860
Tamura Kenji's gag is "Chiaaaah"; See Documental Season 5 episode 1

115
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,860
You're ripping off Tamura Kenji's joke

116
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,060
Totally ripping him off

117
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,400
With that said, let's begin the YAMA-1 Grand Prix!

118
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,600
What a shit intro!

119
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,170
Let's introduce our first presenter!

120
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,270
Please come out!

121
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,310
Ignoring every tsukommi, super masochist comedians in their 5th year,

122
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,520
Presenting, "Open Space"!

123
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,320
Hello everyone!

124
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,960
What is it man?!

125
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,700
What is it with you already?

126
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,710
Hello Everyone!

127
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,290
On this new years,

128
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,200
This fatass is here

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,760
You're the fatass!

130
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,040
The fatass is clearly you!

131
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,870
You goddamn pig! (buta)

132
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,970
I'm not a buta!

133
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,400
I'm not!

134
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,400
You're a buta!

135
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,360
Then what are you?!

136
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,620
I'm a "pig"!

137
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,200
That means buta!

138
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,340
"Pig" is English for buta!

139
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,680
BUTAAA!

140
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,220
You bloody BUTA!

141
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,380
Anyways, I'm really into these dramas right?

142
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,620
There's a common scene I like in them

143
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,840
The father asks the teacher how his son's exam results went

144
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,190
Oh yeah I know that kinda scene

145
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,840
"Teach, how did my son do?!"

146
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,700
"I'm so sorry sir, he tried his hardest, but unfortunately ..."

147
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,700
"Why did my son ... why?!"

148
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,720
"WHY?!!!!"

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,900
"This is a prank!"

150
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,220
Why the hell?!

151
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,440
Why the hell is it a prank?!

152
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,040
What kind of teacher would do that?!

153
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,980
BUTAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!

154
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,080
Alright just cut it out

155
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,220
Thank you very much!

156
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,580
Thank you very much!

157
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,760
Let's ask them their impressions of your act

158
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,840
Matsumoto-san, what did you think of Open Space's manzai?

159
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,800
I think it was very good, however

160
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,830
During the performance,

161
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,680
Hamada-san was, uh,

162
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,480
checking his text messages

163
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,560
Hamada-san!

164
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,560
We're counting on you, please!

165
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,020
His text messages

166
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,020
I didn't, I didn't!

167
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,220
They probably caught it on camera

168
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,450
That definitive moment was caught on camera!

169
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,260
Hamada checking his texts during the performance!

170
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,260
An unexpected shocking moment!

171
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,400
Hamada-san please we are counting on you

172
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,780
Yamasaki-san, your impressions?

173
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,770
I'm gonna give the score first

174
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,070
Ah I see

175
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,540
OK let's get the score first

176
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,540
Please, present their score!

177
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,980
10 is the highest right?

178
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,680
Yes, 10 is a perfect score

179
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,280
TEN POINTS!

180
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,190
Wow full points, right out of the gate!

181
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,460
Why did you give them full points?

182
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,380
I thought I should give 10 points as soon as they got on stage

183
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,560
Before the performance?

184
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,290
Before the performance

185
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,000
But after the performance,

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,480
I'm glad I thought that they deserved 10 points straight away

187
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,070
Thank you very much!

188
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,070
Thank you very much!

189
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,070
It's this kind of thing, every year

190
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,010
OK thank you very much!

191
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,410
Let's continue

192
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,610
If you listen to them once, you'll get hooked

193
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,120
In their 9th year, presenting "2700"

194
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,700
2700?

195
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,560
I have prepared a marvelous song, please listen to it if you'd like

196
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:10,700
Right elbow, left elbow, look at them alternatively (x3)

197
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:20,980
Right elbow, left elbow, look at them alternatively (x3)

198
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,620
When I meet, a new friend,

199
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,480
I don't rub the right one

200
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Only rub the left one

201
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,880
I'd like you, to confirm, that I've cleaned it up, nicely

202
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:53,380
Right elbow, left elbow, look at them alternatively (x3)

203
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,540
Look at my shoe

204
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,540
Look at my shin

205
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,540
Look at my knee

206
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,660
Look at my thigh

207
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Look at my hips

208
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,660
Look at my abs

209
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,780
Look at my chest

210
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,920
Look at my shoulder

211
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,970
OK, here we go

212
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,940
Right elbow, left elbow, look at them alternatively (x2)

213
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,940
Thank you very much

214
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,480
Matsumoto-san, what did you think of this performance?

215
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,460
After watching that whole thing, what you said at the start,

216
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,500
"I've got a great song please listen to it" is funny now

217
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,390
That set the tone right?

218
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,160
OK, let's continue

219
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,160
Judge Yamasaki, their score please!

220
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,630
TEN POINTS!!!

221
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,160
Another 10 points!

222
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,040
Could you please explain why they got 10 points?

223
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,460
It felt set up like a German Suplex Hold

224
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,850
To use an analogy

225
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,650
Bring out the next guys, hurry

226
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,680
I don't see anyone, hurry up

227
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,000
Let's continue,

228
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,960
Up next, in his 11th year, Toshi

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,630
TN: This guy's act is Dajare (wordplay). Sort of like puns. I suck at translating them to English, so I will do my best to explain

230
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,220
11th year huh?

231
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,320
Hello!

232
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,280
Berry nice to meet you!

233
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,280
TN: I hate puns

234
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,040
I'm a fruity comedian,

235
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,660
[Yorushiku onegaishimasu + Muskmelon]

236
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,940
Yorushiku onegaishi-Muskmelon!

237
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,980
You see, I made a pun using Muskmelon!

238
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,340
Fruit Man wants to show you Fruit Man's special skill

239
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,650
Fruit Man is very good at fruit wordplay

240
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:49,590
If you give Fruit Man the names of three fruits, Fruit Man will make a short story for you

241
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,560
Counting on your cooperation,

242
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Yamasaki-san, a fruit please

243
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,030
Muscat! (Grape)

244
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,030
Muscats. Those are tasty!

245
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,980
Matsumoto-san?

246
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,670
Uhhh, lemon

247
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,140
Lemons? Those are sour!

248
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,680
Hamada-san, last one please

249
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,760
Peach (Momo)

250
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,440
Peach?

251
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,280
Those are pink!

252
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,400
OK so, Muscat, Lemon, and Peach

253
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
It's ripe! (the story)

254
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,040
Already ripe?

255
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,760
That's fantastic

256
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,270
Fruit Man,

257
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,140
the other day, I fell in love with a peachy young girl

258
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,800
I wanted her to like me, so I bought her lots of stuff

259
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Stuff like this, and that, and this and that

260
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,800
[This and that: a-re mon, ko re-mon (lemon)]

261
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,850
But still, she rejected me!

262
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,600
But anyways,

263
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,040
[Impossible: Masaka -> Muscat]

264
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,040
you thought this was gonna be impossible, right?

265
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,900
It's Fruits!

266
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,500
Wait, did he use the momo (peach)?

267
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,560
"Peachy"

268
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,060
"Peachy young girl"

269
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,970
I sort of, this is my personal opinion,

270
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,970
It was similar to W-Colon (comedy duo)

271
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,060
Oh I only watch the Fruits Channel, so I wouldn't know

272
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,520
Let's see his score, please

273
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,280
TEN POOOOINTS!!!!

274
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,790
Hold on, 3 in a row?

275
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,990
Toshi got 10 points

276
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,520
Please explain why he got 10 points

277
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,420
We're still filming this episode

278
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,320
Sorry give me a second

279
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
I have a headache...

280
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,300
Just get lost

281
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,040
With his refined impersonations that capture the spirit,

282
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,040
in his 9th year, Koga Shu

283
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,250
With that said, first off we have,

284
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:59,860
Suzuki Muneo gets too excited at a public conference, and becomes inarticulate

285
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:59,860
TN: Suzuki Muneo is a politician

286
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,980
TN: He is speaking incoherently

287
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,580
Next up,

288
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,840
Hamada Koichi laughing wickedly after getting angry

289
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,820
What are you saying you bald son of a bitch?!

290
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,880
Please #!@$$!
*@!@# please!

291
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,820
You there, laugh please!

292
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,780
Thank you very much!

293
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,280
Hamada-san, your impressions?

294
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,280
It was great, he nailed the impressions

295
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,280
Yeah it was amazing

296
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,960
I want to watch some more

297
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,920
Right?

298
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Yamasaki-san is kinda ... right?

299
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,320
He's giving off a bad vibe

300
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,160
He looks to be in a bad mood, but regardless,

301
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
the score please!

302
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,440
TEN POINTS!!!

303
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,800
10 points again!

304
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,440
All 10 points so far

305
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,160
All 10 points so far

306
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,180
Why 10 points I'd like to ask

307
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,140
He had a headache before ...

308
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,700
What did you just say, Endo?

309
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,380
You had a headache before

310
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,320
Before that, before that!

311
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,960
What did you say before that?

312
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,990
Uhhh

313
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,760
This is the fourth 10 points in a row

314
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,800
I asked you about this before but your headache ...

315
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,300
Before that, before the headache

316
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,020
Before that?

317
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,160
What the hell?

318
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,160
Nobody remembers that

319
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,440
"Why 10 points" is what you said

320
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
Yes, yes

321
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,800
Right?!

322
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,080
Yes, exactly

323
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,180
Why do you think?

324
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,760
Well 10 points is a perfect score, so

325
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,000
You thought the performance was funny

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,620
Or like Hamada-san said, the imitation was good

327
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,480
So something like that could be why

328
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,840
That is exactly why

329
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,660
OK thank you very much!

330
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,320
You got a perfect score

331
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,670
Let's present the next competitor

332
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,240

"Real" Theme Park

336
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,960
The Elephant's fart ended things nicely, right?

337
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,060
Next up is this,

338
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,780
That's one fast mouth!

339
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,920
Fighter Plane Baby

340
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,180
This really is the ending

341
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,500
Thank you very much!

342
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,320
I heard you have a bonus performance?

343
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,320
I will clean a perverted window

344
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,550
Huge-Face Obachan didn't laugh at all

345
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,720
OK, Yamasaki-san?

346
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,930
The points, please

347
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,230
TEN POINTS!!!!!!!!

348
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,320
10 points!

349
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,230
This was like art

350
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,660
It was amazing

351
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,040
2-chome is Tokyo's LGBT hotspot

352
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,040
Aiming to be 2-chome's top queer character,

353
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,670
in their 13th year, Kathu-Naoya

354
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,500
2-chome Tongue Twisters!

355
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,170

358
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,200
Held at Ni-chome!

359
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:20,820
(can't understand this part lmao)

360
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,050
To the transvestite next door, watch out!

361
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:26,700

362
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,150

364
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,680
Finished

365
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,180
You're not a real transvestite right?

366
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,090
To your rude question I say,

367
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,420
Ogenko!!!

368
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,060
"Ogenko" is supposed to be like 2-chome slang, like "Dondake"

369
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,850
That is my gag (catchphrase)

370
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,620
Kathu-san,

371
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,640

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,460

376
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,920

00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,390

378
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,760
You might awaken something

379
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,170
If you keep it up Endo, to you I say;

380
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,220

Why 10 points?

388
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,180
This fully bloomed flower of a newhalf,

389
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,780

390
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,240
Thank you very much!

391
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,260
That's my thing!

392
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:54,740
Ah!

393
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,210
I'm so sorry!

394
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,770
Don't worry!

395
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,580
You did nothing wrong

396
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,740
It's not your fault

397
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,410
They apologised on stage!

398
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,350
Then let's continue

399
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,820
Finally, something to succeed the air guitar

400
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,620
in his 20th year, up next is Chubby Cowboy

401
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,030
Hello everyone!

402
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,200
The belly guitar is here!

403
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,860
Oh, fatty fatty

404
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,500
Oh, fatty fatty

405
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,180
If you ask a fatass, for advice in the desert,

406
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,620
He'll just tell you to eat watermelons

407
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,620
TN: I'm not sure about this translation

408
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,620
I'm the Chubby Cowboy

409
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,090
I've been earning my keep with this belly guitar

410
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,290
Why is he tuning it?

411
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,230
There's places where fatties like to gather

412
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,430
For example, Akihabara

413
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,640
Ryogoku

414
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,740
Famous for its sumo wrestlers

415
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,060
Or perhaps,

416
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,340
Chikage!

417
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,570
Yup

418
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,570
Oh, fatty fatty

419
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,720
Fatties are,

420
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,100
He's humming

421
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,360
Thank you very much!

422
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,010
Time for the score

423
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,370
Yamasaki-san!

424
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,060
TEN POINTS!

425
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,700
10 points again!

426
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,030
That's amazing

427
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,640
You're in your 20th year?

428
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,380
Yes this is my 20th year

429
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,940
So that means,

430
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,940
You're a senpai to Cocorico?

431
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,170
He's the senpai, yes

432
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,170
What do you say to that Cocorico?

433
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,950
What do we say?

434
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,740
He's pretending to be angry

435
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,670
Honestly uhhh,

436
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,690
He is our senpai so, we watched him with that in mind

437
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,890
So we can learn something from him

438
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,610
Save me, please

439
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,050
Save me, please!

440
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,050
Those guys are looking this way

441
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,130
Can you please get me out of this?

442
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,780
We're waiting on you, Yamasaki-san

443
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,230
He just,

444
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,250
As if he was proclaiming his love in the centre of the world

445
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,250
he said "Please help me"
