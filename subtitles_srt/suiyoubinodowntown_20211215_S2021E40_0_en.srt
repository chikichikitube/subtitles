00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,450
This is Suiyōbi no Downtown.
Welcome everyone

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,780
Hamada Masatoshi
(Downtown)

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,350
Fujimoto Miki

4
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,350

00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,350

Shibuya Nagisa

7
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,450
So let's begin.
Our first presenter...

8
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,120
will enter now. Come in!

9
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,130
(Matsumoto) Are they coming?

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,730
Yes, it's Koyabu Kazutoyo

11
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,730
Presenter:
Koyabu Kazutoyo

12
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,200
So then everyone

13
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,040
The Yoshimoto giant ('kyojin')

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,310
No,
there's already an actual Kyojin

15
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,340
All Kyojin

16
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,310
It's not me. Well, then...

17
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,310
I'm annoyed

18
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,310
You're back on track

19
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,380
Today we have the annual favorite

20
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,080
What I've brought with me today is this:

21
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,450
The 7th Annual Lyric Changing Tournament

22
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,830
Yes, it's the one that's
always extremely funny every time

23
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,030
And once again the jury is changing

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,300
The jury for the 7th tournament is University of Tokyo students

25
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:01,710
Elementary
school students

26
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:01,710

27
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:01,710

28
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:01,710
High school

29
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:01,710
Middle

30
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:01,710

31
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:01,710
Uni. of Tokyo
students

32
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,000
Ah, I see

33
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,000
Tokyo University. It's going to be hard

34
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a different angle

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,010
They're the one who never messed
around in class

36
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,410
That's biased

37
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,110
They don't know the difference between
what's funny and what's not

38
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,020
Biased

39
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,120
Don't you think?

40
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:17,460

Rookie comedians

42
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,120
The annual favorite.
This year we're doing the 7th...

43
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,420
Lyric Changing Tournament

44
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,990
Tonight we've once again gathered 8 groups of singing comedians

45
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:35,570
1st Tournament Winners
Doburock

46
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,960
Staff) The jury this time is current Tokyo Uni students

47
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,600
Well, here we are

48
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:35,570
Tokyo University Students? They're mostly virgins, right?

49
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,570
That's rude

50
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:46,420
Koga Ken

51
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,710
I've been doing funny songs for a long time

52
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:46,420
I have to try to win in one shot here

53
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,790
My material's in a bit of a quiz style. Something you need to think about

54
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,390
So I might just have a chance this time

55
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:03,670
Razor Ramon RG

56
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:03,670
Once again I've made the lyrics about a heavyweight

57
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:14,050
Yuriyan Retriever

58
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,970
Well they're studious people so

59
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:14,050
I think it'd be better to make the song more intellectual

60
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:24,920
Yasei Bakudan Cookie!

61
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,820
I think I can come up with ideas you won't find in the brain of Tokyo University student

62
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,920
I think I'll go with just a little science and math

63
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:35,530
Iron Head

64
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,660
There's a contest in Kansai called "The King of the Song Contest"

65
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,330
We've been in it 4 times at most

66
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,530
So we were probably invited because of that. We're very confident

67
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:42,940
4th & 6th Tournament Winner
Hollywood Zakoshishō

68
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,040

78
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,640
In all, 8 groups entered.

79
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,650
From the first round to final,

80
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,980
they will switch lyrics for the 3 assigned songs.

81
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,690
This time, the decision will be made by
51 students currently enrolled at Tokyo University

82
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:04,060
Who on earth will match with the students' taste and be victorious?

83
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,260
Also...

84
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:11,870
Theory: The make-your-grandkid-laugh
challenge where the grandkid doesn't laugh at all. A painful reverse prank

85
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
And then...

86
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,070
Theory: Even 'The Touch' do some solo gigs

The Lyric Changing Tournament.

96
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,460
The first assigned song is...

97
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:55,610
Usseewa ("Annoying")

98
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,300
♫ Huh? You're annoying, annoying

99
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,130
It became a hot topic
with its aggressive lyrics

100
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,470
A big hit from the first half of 2021

101
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,770
Ado's "Usseewa"

102
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,880
How will the 8 groups change this song?

103
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,080
♫ There's no problem

104
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,620
Doburock    VS.    Koga Ken

105
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,620
Round 1
Match 1

106
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,450
First, Doburock

107
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,090
(Eguchi) Music, start!

108
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,660
I'm going to show my dick to my partner

109
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
♫ Huh?

110
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,500
It's small, small, small!

111
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,240
If it were a battery it'd be AA-sized

112
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,040
No! It's big, big, big

113
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,140
When it matters, it's D-sized

114
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,380
Well it's true that the size may be AA but

115
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,050
It's super powerful and long-lasting

116
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,160
In terms of type, it's alkaline, not manganese!

117
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,640
Doburock    VS.    Koga Ken

118
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,640
Round 1
Match 1

119
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,640
Up against Doburock, it's Koga Ken

120
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,570
What's right is

121
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,950
What's that?

122
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,750
♫ Huh?

123
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,950
Annoying, annoying

124
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,750
More than you thought,

125
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,420
Don't hold back,

126
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,260
You don't understand

127
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,100
Annoying, annoying

128
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,750
Judgement

129
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,680
With both songs finished, it's time for...

130
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:49,130
The 51 Tokyo Uni students were asked to vote for the funnier song, with the song receiving most votes winning

131
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:55,030
Let's see how the Tokyo Uni students judged this battle

132
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,440
Round 1, match 1
Here's the result:

133
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,370
Unai Risa
(TBS Announcer)

134
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:13,150
Doburock

135
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:13,150
Koga Ken

136
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,580
Doburock-san get 44 votes

137
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,910
and Koga Ken gets 7 votes

138
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,750
Advancing to the semi-final is Doburock-san

139
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,110
So few...

140
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,750
Thank you very much

141
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,750
Thank you very much

142
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,750
Thank you very much

143
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,750
As we thought...

144
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,890
You're Tokyo Uni students so batteries

145
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,190
They're smart

146
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:25,000
I think it was a good idea to
include elements of physics and engineering

147
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:35,010
2nd-year student
Human Sciences III

148
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:35,010
Q. What did you find
funny about Doburock?

149
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,270
Well, it was...

150
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,500
Using AA batteries as a metaphor in a dirty joke

151
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,340
It was like the slang my friends use

152
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,010
It was kind of silly, and it made me laugh

153
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,780
All our hard work paid off

154
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,910
Because the truth is, you know, it's not AA-sized

155
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,910
That's not the point

156
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,920

Match 2

167
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,760
First up, Razor Ramon RG

168
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,500
There's one thing Beat Takashi's been doing lately

169
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,540
And I'd like to sing about it.
Music, start!

170
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:14,350
What's Beat Takeshi has been doing lately? I'll tell you now

171
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,580
His belt's high, high, high

172
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,350
It's higher than you thought

173
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,020
High, high, high

174
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,960
It's probably near his nipples

175
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,560
If you want to make your legs look longer

176
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,870
Put the belt high, high, high

177
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,700
It'll keep your balls stable. There's no problem

178
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,150
Right?

179
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,150
That wig should be a bit better

180
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,580
The wig's all unkempt

181
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,760

189
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,810
My opponent, opponent, opponent

190

When he uses scissors, it's 2 wins, 2 losses

191
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,620
My opponent, opponent, opponent

192
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,420
When he uses paper, it's 2 draws, 2 losses

193
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,290
Ah... Thumb, middle finger, ring finger, little finger

194
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:41,000
Are the fingers you don't use when twirling around a dragonfly's eyes

195
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:43,430
TL note: Apparently a way to catch dragonflies is to make them dizzy by spinning your finger around their eyes

196
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Thanks

197
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,910

Music, start!

214
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,310
I cut my nails, cut my hair, cut ties with you

215
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,180
Cut the ties, but don't cut the dollars!

216
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
♫ Huh?

217
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,590
Annoying, annoying, annoying. You really are

218
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,920
You're so annoying

219
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,020
You're the annoying one! What are you on about?

220
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,430
What are you saying? It's you

221
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,430
It's you who's annoying

222
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,490
Annoying, annoying

223
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,130
You're the one being annoying

224
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,660
What are you saying? It's you

225
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,800
Oh, is it? Is it? Is it?

226
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,470
What?  Seriously, that's enough

227
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,800
You're the annoying one

228
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,740
That's enough

229
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,270

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:10,520

233
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,830
The strongest from America

234
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,230
I'll show you what that is

235
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
♫ Huh?

236
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,670
Fat arms, arms, arms

237
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,040
Scott Norton's the strongest

238
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,940
Jura- Jura- Jurassic Bomb

239
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,740
If you eat it, you're done

240
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,050
Ah, Roppongi Ibis Hotel's computer room suits you well

241
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,620

Thank you

245
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,300
In a contest to change Usseewa's lyrics,
Yuriyan mostly just said "Ussee"

246
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:07,780
And Cookie! sang about Scott Norton, leaving the audience behind as usual

247
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,210
He just couldn't stop himself

248
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,950
It's a sickness

249
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,950
Who will the winner be?

250
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:31,270

Congratulations.

255
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
(Yuriyan) Thank you very much

256
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,270
You didn't change the lyrics

257
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,240
I did change them

258
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,040
No, you didn't. It was all 'ussee ussee'

259
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,540
I did

260
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,480
I changed them so much

261
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,840
I did change the lyrics

262
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,950
You're colluding with the students

263
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,420
You don't know Scott Norton?

264
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,120
He'll kill you all

265
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
Idiot. They're a national treasure

266
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,920
You'd be the dead one

268
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:58,760
Q. What did you find funny
about Yuriyan Retriever?

269
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,830
It was very Yuriyan-like

270
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,760
It was funny how it defied the common wisdom of lyric changing

271
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,430
You did it for her, Suiyoubi

272
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,370
You've been working in the shadows

273
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,970
Is it Yoshimoto? Yoshimoto told you to let Yuriyan win

274
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,180
What the hell's going on?

275
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,880
I'll kill you

276
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,610

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,070
I'll work part-time, save up money

289
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:40,340
cut back on food expenses, and buy a moped

290
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,210
♫ Huh?

291
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,640
No socializing or studying, just the moped

292
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,180
Work hard, live frugally

293
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,920
I'll be sitting astride a moped

294
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,120
Ah, I think. That mediocre exhaust sound

295
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:06,200
Even if I don't have insurance, there's no problem

296
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,960

♫ Huh?

305
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,700
Shinji Shinji Shinji, are you going to pilot the Eva or not?

306
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,410
Let's clear this up

307
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,010
If you won't pilot the Eva, go home

308
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,510
Ahh, Fuyutsuki too. Ride the Eva, ride it, ride it

That is all

312
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Who will the winner be?

Well, it was an easy win

The first one, like that

321
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,990
I've won twice, right?

322
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,730
I showed them what a winner looks like

323
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,630
Huh?

324
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,900
I never expected someone else to have glowing eyes

Right or left? Which testicle are you?

356
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,250
I'm a left testicle

357
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,250
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no

358
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,450

I've made a huge mistake

362
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,900
I'm actually a right testicle

363
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,500
They're backwards?

364
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,290
Doburock    VS.   Razor Ramon RG

365
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,290
Semi-final
Match 1

366
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,440
And up against Doburock,

367
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,140
Razor Ramon RG

368
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,690
There's one thing Summers-san have been doing lately

369
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,660
And I'd like to sing about it.
Music, start!

370
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,260
What Sum- Sum- Summers-san have been doing

371
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,030
What Summers-san have been doing, I'll want to say

372
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,810
What Summers-san have been doing, starting now

373
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,040
Their pants are super wide

374
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,910
Sum-um-um-um-ummer's pants are super wide

375
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,320
Sum-um-um-ummer, both of them have super wide pants

376
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,460
I'll tell you something else Summer-san have been doing

377
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:10,130
They keep wearing tight jackets

378
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:21,440
Who's going to be the first to advance to the final?

379
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,640
Here's the result:

380
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:40,040
Doburock

381
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:40,040
Razor Ramon RG

382
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,780
Doburock-san get 31 votes

383
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,450
RG-san gets 20 votes

384
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,120
Progressing to the final is Doburock-san

385
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,790
Thank you very much

386
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,790
We did it! Thank you very much

387
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,490
Thank you very much. Phew!

388
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
Well, um...

389
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,930
It's because everyone sees us the other way around

390
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,230
So that's...

391
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,300
It's like "which one's on the right?", isn't it?

392
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,700
I think Summers-san probably wear Red Wing shoes

393
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,740
Today, unfortunately, I wore Timberlands

394
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,960
Tokyo Uni students notice such things, right?

395
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:58,990
Doburock

396
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:58,990
Hollywood
Zakoshishō

397
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:58,990

Yuriyan
Retriever

402
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,150
Next in the Lyric Changing Tournament...

403
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,770
Semi-final
Match 2

404
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,770
Yuriyan Retriever       VS.   Hollywood Zakoshishō

405
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,650
First, it's Yuriyan Retriever

406
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,940
I've got one thing

407
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,300
I've got one thing on my mind

408
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,470
The dust in every house...

409
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,620
It's gray...

410
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,620
It's gray... but why?

411
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,820
It's gray...

412
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,820
It's gray... but why?

413
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,200
It's gray...

414
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,200
It's gray... but why?

415
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,420
Even if there are no gray things in the room

416
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,470
It's gray...

417
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,470
It's gray... but why?

418
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,820
Semi-final
Match 2

419
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,820
Yuriyan Retriever       VS.   Hollywood Zakoshishō

420
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,530
Up against Yuriyan, it's Hollywood Zakoshishō

421
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,440
Hanmakanma Ambaramba

422
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,650
Hanmakanma

423
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,690
Hanmakanma Hanmakanma

424
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,890
Hanmakanma

425
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,030
Ambarakamba Ambarakambara Hanmakanma

426
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,200
Ambarakamba Ambarakambara Hanmakanma

427
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,100
I know how you feel, I know how you feel

428
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,710
Hanmakanma. That was Furuhata

429
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,510
(Zakoshishō) I know how you feel

430
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:46,630
Who will win this battle and face Doburock in the final?

431
00:19:46,630 --> 00:20:01,010
Hollywood Zakoshishō

432
00:19:46,630 --> 00:20:01,010
Yuriyan Retriever

433
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,420
Yuriyan-san: 10 votes,
Hollywood Zakoshishō-san: 41 votes

434
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,860
The finalist is Zakoshishō-san!

435
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,360
Yes, yes. I knew it

436
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,010
I knew Tokyo students would get it

437
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,530
On the other hand, Yuriyan-san, what happened?

438
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,990
I'm documenting this

439
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,660
Scary

440
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,980
It's scary

441
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,050
So scary...

442
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,450
It's scary

443
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,700
('Kongo' means 'later')

444
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,650
I'll use it as a reference video, kongo

445
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,700
Kongo

446
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,970
Republic of the Congo

447
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,970
Republic of the Congo? What republic?

448
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,030
This is so stupid

449
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,120
What are you filming?

450
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,730
Don't film like that

451
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,030
I'm going to use it for next time, for myself

452
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,960
That's nice

453
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,730
Weren't you like "let's kiss" when we were waiting for the results?

454
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,080
I wanted to kiss you, yes

455
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,080
What's that about?

456
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,690
I wanted to kiss when the curtains opened

457
00:20:41,690 --> 00:21:00,670
'Usseewa'

458
00:20:41,690 --> 00:21:00,670
Doburock

459
00:20:41,690 --> 00:21:00,670
Hollywood
Zakoshishō

460
00:20:41,690 --> 00:21:00,670
Iron Head

461
00:20:41,690 --> 00:21:00,670

Yuriyan

465
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,910
So, our finalists are
these two groups

466
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,080
And our last song is...

467
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
♫ We are...

468
00:20:49,390 --> 00:21:00,670
'Homura'

469
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:57,860
The theme song from the
number-1 grossing film in Japan,
'Demon Slayer'...

470
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,360
LiSA's 'Homura'

471
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,380
Doburock

472
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,380
Hollywood Zakoshishō

473
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,290
The two finalists that will be competing...

474
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:10,350
Runner-up

475
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:10,350
Winner

476
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,350
are the same as in last year's final

477
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:17,790
1st Tournament Winners
Doburock

478
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:17,790
4th & 6th Tournament Winner
Hollywood Zakoshishō

479
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:17,790
Final

480
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:17,790
VS.

481
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,640
Will they be able to redeem
themselves from last time?

482
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,740
First, it's Doburock

483
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,830
Fish ball soup,

484
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,830
Fish ball soup, Dumpling soup,

485
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,830
Fish ball soup, Dumpling soup, Pork soup,

486
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,830
Fish ball soup, Dumpling soup, Pork soup, Rice cracker soup

487
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:35,470
The most erotic soup is

488
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,470
The most erotic soup is nameko soup

489
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:42,880
TL Note: The word for soup (shiru) also means bodily secretion and nameko is a type of mushroom

490
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:43,470
Nameko soup, Nameko soup

491
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:50,350
But on other hand the least erotic soup is...

492
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,360
Sumashi soup

493
00:21:50,920 --> 00:22:02,800
TL Note: A kind of clear soup. 'Sumashi' also means uptight/prude
or serious (like the face he's making now)

494
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:11,140
1st Tournament Winners
Doburock

495
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:11,140
4th & 6th Tournament Winner
Hollywood Zakoshishō

496
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:11,140
Final

497
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:11,140
VS.

498
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,620
Up against Doboroku...

499
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,630
It's Hollywood Zakoshishō,
whose 3rd victory is at stake

500
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,700
Chanchakachan Chanchakachan

501
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,140
Chanchakachan Chakachan

502
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,110
Chanchakachanchanchachanchan

503
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,830
Damn it, Da-damn it!

504
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,780
Chanchakachan Chanchakachan

505
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,770
Chakachakchaka, Damn it!

506
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:42,260
Damn it,

507
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,260
Damn it, Damn it,

508
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,260
Damn it, Damn it, Da-damn it!!

509
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:49,000
I thought it was air

510
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,000
I thought it was air but it was ice!

511
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,000
I thought it was air but it was ice! Damn it!

512
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:03,110
With dicks, testicles, and nameko soup, all of Dobrock's lyrics were all in the same dirty-joke style

513
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,120
On the other hand...

514
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,190
Zakoshishō continued to attack with his unchanging style while introducing new material

515
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,940
So which side will come out on top?

516
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,460
In the Lyric Changing Tournament

517
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,170
Here are the results of the final match:

518
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:36,890
Doburock

519
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:36,890
Hollywood Zakoshishō

520
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,470
Doburock-san, 17 votes

521
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,140
Hollywood Zakoshishō-san,
34 votes. Which means...

522
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Zakoshishō-san is the winner!

523
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,140
I did it!

524
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,150
(Fujimoto) It feels like if
you play fairly, it's not enough

525
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,450
I did it!

526
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,180
This is just...

527
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,020
Victory 3!

528
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,820
Yeah, really

529
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,720
This is unprecedented

530
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,260
Seriously, it's the exact same result as last year

531
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,790
Exactly the same

532
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,230
Damn... it's really frustrating

533
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,300
What is it?

534
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,770
We did everything we could in this tournament

535
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,570
We did, really

536
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,970
I'm probably more passionate about this than any other contest

537
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,780
What we'll be doing for the next year

538
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,950
Is checking all of the shows Zakoshishō appears on

539
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,080
Who's going to beat me?

540
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,080
Who's going to beat me? I'm waiting!

541
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,790
Huh? Yeah

542
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:25,180
Doburock

543
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:25,180
Hollywood
Zakoshishō

544
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:25,180

Winner: Hollywood Zakoshishō
(2 years in a row, for the 3rd time)

551
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,790
And with that...

552
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,120
the winner of the 7th Lyric Changing Tournament

553
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,130
is once again Hollywood Zakoshishō

554
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:57,440

Right?

562
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,800
Again?

563
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,140
He was a huge hit
with the Tokyo students, wasn't he?

564
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,470
I think it's because Tokyo students

565
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,480
spend all their time thinking too much

566
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,480
His stuff is really about nothing, isn't it?

567
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Amazing

568
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,150
I really loved Doburock-san's
'Te-te-te-testicle' from the semifinals

569
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,130
You do?

570
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,160
Hey

571
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,160
I knew it when you became a mother

572
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,160
These two were laughing
so much at the testicles

573
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,460
Doburock-san had
dirty jokes but...

574
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,180
They didn't sound dirty

575
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,100
(Shibuya) It was like they were
dirty jokes girls can laugh at too

576
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,700
I think it was great

577
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,490
There's shades of dirtiness

578
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,110
There's shades? Really?

579
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,110
Yeah, it went down well

580
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,760
Everyone's Theories

581
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,060
Everyone's Theories

582
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,360
Everyone's Theories

583
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:21,670
Next, introducing and
verifying various theories...

584
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,660
Everyone's Theories

585
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:15,960
Everyone's Theories

586
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,670
Everyone's Theories

587
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Tonight's presenters are...

588
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,130
It's FUJIWARA!

589
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:29,540
Presenters:
Haranishi Takayuki / Fujimoto Toshifumi

590
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,130
Yes, we're here, we're on TV!

591
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,130
Well then everyone...

592
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,980
What kind of person was your grandpa?

593
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,140
My grandpa got stomach cancer,

594
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,810
had his whole stomach taken out,

595
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,510
and I remember he lost loads of weight

596
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,120
You don't have to tell us that

597
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,780
It's okay. It's...

598
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,360
Mikitty

599
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,360
Mikitty is cracking up

600
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,820
I couldn't help but laugh

601
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,820
It's like 'why is she saying that?'

602
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,150
Because everyone loses
weight if that happens

603
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:01,760
Today we've brought you a theory related to grandpas and their grandkids

604
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Here it is!

605
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:10,010
Theory: The make-your-grandkid-laugh
challenge where the grandkid doesn't laugh at all. A painful reverse prank

606
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:17,390
We're trying to have fun on this show
so why make such a painful theory?

607
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:23,110
Matsumoto-san, have you ever seen your mother try to make your daughter laugh?

608
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,120
I've never seen her laugh that much

609
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
How about yours, Gotō?

610
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,120
My dad, when his grandkid, my son, comes

611
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,460
is like "Ah, here you are!"

612
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,040
and then goes straight to his room

613
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
What's that? Why?

614
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:48,420
Theory: The make-your-grandkid-laugh
challenge where the grandkid doesn't laugh at all. A painful reverse prank

615
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:55,760
And so, we invited grandpa comedians with grandkids to this fake project

616
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
The first:

617
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Hello

618
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,500
Gushiken Yōkō

619
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,940
Staff) Do you think you'll be able to make your grandkid laugh?

620
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,840
Of course I will

621
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,240
Without a doubt, she'll laugh I think

622
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,680
Gushiken's granddaughter is...

623
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:19,750
Gushiken Kanna-chan

624
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,450
Staff) Is your granddad usually funny?

625
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,820
Yes

626
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,820
Staff) He makes you laugh?

627
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,060
Staff) What kind of things does he do?

628
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,190
Funny faces

629
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,860
Staff) Today, if you make her laugh

630
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:40,700
Staff) we'll give Kanna-chan a product she wants as a gift

631
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,670
Yes, yes

632
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,700
Woah, she'd love that

633
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,210
But on the other hand, we also told Kanna-chan...

634
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,780
Staff) What do you want most of all now?

635
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,380
Sweets Recipe

636
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:58,590
Card game

637
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:58,590
Sweets Recipe

638
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:58,590
What she wants

639
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,150
(Staff) Sweets Recipe

640
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,850
Staff) If you don't laugh once, we'll give it to you

641
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,590
I'll do my best not to laugh

642
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:05,860
So, both of them think she won't get the
present if she fails the challenge but...

643
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,870
Izakaya - Asakusa Ichimon

644
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:12,640
Actually, she'll get the present no matter what

645
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,640
in this super heartwarming project

646
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,710
So both of them don't know that

647
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,210
It can only end happily

648
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,180
Kanna!

649
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,180
Kanna! Long time no see

650
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,450
Sorry, I need to go to the bathroom

651
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,050
Kan... long time no see

652
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,050
When he's alone with his grandchild...

653
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,650
the investigation begins

654
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,490
His first tactic is...

655
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,130
I've got loads of funny glasses

656
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,430
I'll use a variety of glasses

657
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:43,400
I'm thinking it'll be quite funny, you know?

658
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,700
Earlier, these I...

659
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,710
I got some new glasses I want to show you

660
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,910
I'll put on the new ones for you...

661
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,720
I'm thinking I'll go with the ones that are cute

662
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,950
I've bought a few kinds

663
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,820
Look down, look down

664
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,590
How are these?

665
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,000
Bad?

666
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,030
Why are they bad?

667
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,770
They're not cute?

668
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:26,610
The first pair of glasses falls flat

669
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,280
If my granddad did this I'd laugh

670
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,620
(Gotō) Yeah

671
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,620
I know, right?

672
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,020
Next...

673
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,920
What about these?

674
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,690
Are they cute?

675
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,230
Are they cute?

676
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,410
Gushiken lands a clean right jab

677
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,580
TL note: Gushiken is an ex-boxer,
hence all the boxing metaphors

678
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,710
Kanna-chan looks like she's about to laugh

679
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,280
That's not even his intention

680
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,580
And then...

681
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,700
Gushiken throws out a barrage of blows
as though this is the critical moment

682
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,640
His desperate attack continues but

683
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,710
Kanna-chan somehow
manages to endure it

684
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,120
And then...

685
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,050
I'm Butada the Pig-Man!

686
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,130
But Butada the Pig-Man...

687
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Simply falls flat

688
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,700
This is high quality stuff!

689
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,960
Gushiken-san must be shocked

690
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,970
Give me a moment

691
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,670
Grandpa will show you something funnier

692
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,670
One moment

693
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,310
Gushiken's next tactic is...

694
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,310
Chocopla

695
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,580
With the T written on it

696
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,450
Staff) The TT brothers one?

697
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,450
TT brothers

698
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,980
I've seen her laugh at it

699
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:18,820
Using Kanna's favorite, the TT brothers,
he goes for the win

700
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,890
You can look now!

701
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,690
T!

702
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,030
Hey! T

703
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:32,700
Gushiken unleashes the TT brothers
combined with Butada the Pig-Man

704
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,540
Here's one!

705
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
T!

706
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,050
TT TT T

707
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,050
T!

708
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,650
Upside down

709
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,650
Upside down T

710
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,520
Flipped...

711
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,450
Here's one!

712
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,960
TL note: This is the kanji for his first name, Yōkō

713
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,720
Yōkō

714
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,730
T...

715
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,670
And so...

716
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:10,470
Prank Reveal

717
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:07,000
(↑an impressionist)

718
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:07,000
to a Gushiken who's doing so much at once that he looks like Dancing Tanimura ...

719
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,010
we reveal the prank

720
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,580
Staff) Gushiken-san, it's over

721
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,150
Staff) You didn't make her laugh

722
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,880
She wasn't herself...

723
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:25,060
Staff) So we'll give you this "Recipe Card"

724
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
Congratulations

725
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,320
To Kanna-chan...

726
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,860
He's become like "Ashita no Joe"

727
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,330
Staff) We told her if you don't laugh, you'll get a present

728
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,270
You said she'd get it if she laughed, to me

729
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,700
You said she'd get it if she laughed

730
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,100
That's why I was trying so hard

731
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,640
You were laughing inside, weren't you?

732
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,810
You can laugh now at the end

733
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,880
She laughed

734
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,380
She laughed!

735
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,180
Be quiet!

736
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,520
'Be quiet'...

737
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,050
Next, our second granddad is...

738
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,960
That's the spirit!

739
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,790
Hey!

740
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,760
Animal Hamaguchi

741
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,800
Staff) How are you going to make him laugh?

742
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,970
Staff) Do you have a plan?

743
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:19,080
'Did it make them laugh?' and 'Is it popular?' are the kind of things I research every day

744
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,680
So leave it to me

745
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:27,050
For some reason, Animal's tone
is more serious than usual

746
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:34,320
What he wants

747
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:34,320
Game

748
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,690
And once again

749
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:34,320
Hamaguchi Kyōtarō-kun

750
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,020
once he's alone with his grandchild

751
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,020
the investigation starts

752
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,100
What do you want to do in the future?

753
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,670
Ah.. umm..

754
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,400
Work for a sporting goods manufacturer

755
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Sporting goods manufacturer?

756
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,500
Yeah

757
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,340
Well there'll be a lot of challenges but

758
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,780
Kyōtarō, overcome them
and make your dream come true!

759
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,380
Yeah

760
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,880
Grandpa's going to give you
some encouragement now

761
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,550
Alright

762
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,290
Let's go, Kyōtarō!

763
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,190
Ready, start...

764
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,320
Go go go go go

765
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,860
Go go go go go!!

766
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,000
Hey hey hey

767
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,300
Hey hey hey!!!

768
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,370
(exhales)

769
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,040
Kyōtarō, today...

770
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:32,680
The chanting fell flat but
Animal continues like it was nothing

771
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,320
And then...

772
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,600
Yes, Kyōtarō

773
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,200
Kyōtarō, do you remember?

774
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
Yeah

775
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,510
At Sensō-ji there's that statue of Kannon-sama

776
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,740
There, when you were 18 months old...

777
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,210
The wig that once got instant laughs...

778
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,650
got no reaction at all, so...

779
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,720
he hurriedly changes direction to telling anecdotes

780
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,890
There were visitors everywhere

781
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,620
In front of the visitors, you know?

782
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,990
And after that...

783
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,330
Ai Ai Aiai Aiai

784
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,330
Aiai Aiai...

785
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:26,000
Apart from the wig, Animal continues acting how he usually does

786
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Aiai Aiai

787
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,010
Aiai Aiai
Aiaiai

788
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,580
He isn't even holding any laughter in

789
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,350
So, because both of them couldn't make their grandchild laugh...

790
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:48,160
We're doing an additional investigation with non-celebrities

791
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,300
Pe! Kato-chan pe!

792
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,530
How about this face?

793
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,140
No good?

794
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:05,280
But these also ended in victory for the grandchild

795
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,110
(retching)

796
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,680
Kato-chan's no good?

797
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,720
Granddad, hello

798
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
But among them...

799
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,120
There was this granddad too...

800
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,730
Alright! Which one...

801
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,430
1 2 3 Go!

802
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,070
Then...

803
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,070
1 2 3 Go!

804
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,070
Daaa

805
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,510
Oh?

806
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,820
Alright!

807
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:53,560
Next, grandpa's bringing his friend here

808
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,730
And then...

809
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,000
Ryōta! It's grandpa's friend. 1 2 3

810
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,040
I'm Bellytarō!

811
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
What?!

812
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,450
Hehehe

813
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:23,520
And so, in the make-your-grandkid laugh challenge, the sole winner was Bellytarō

814
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:23,520
Investigation Result

815
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Bellytarō

816
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Yes, congratulations!

817
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,060
The winner was Bellytarō-san

818
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,060
In the case of Hamaguchi-san,
his grandson...

819
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,830
Wasn't holding anything back at all

820
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,570
Animal-san
chanted "Go!" 10 times

821
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,070
To make his grandkid laugh

822
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,670
But they often do that same
chant of 'Go!' at athletic ceremonies

823
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,610
Does that mean they're trying to laugh too?

824
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,410
That's right

825
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,410
Today, we have one more

826
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,120
Gotō, today you on here as a solo act,
without your partner, right?

827
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,090
How often do you appear solo instead of as a duo?

828
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,690
I appear solo about 60 to 70% of the time

829
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,690
I don't think it's more than 70%

830
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,690
Downtown-san,
are you about half-half?

831
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:07,700
Hamada-san does loads of solo gigs

832
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:07,700
I think so

833
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,400
Hamada-san
I see you doing them all the time

834
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,400
I don't

835
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,940
I always see you on "Tonight on TBS"

836
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:18,040
(sings) You know, that advert?

837
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,710
(Haranishi) I like the background music

838
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,710
I always see you on there

839
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,710
So then, today...

840
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,380
we've brought you a theory
related to solo gigs

841
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,380
Here it is!

842
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,950
Theory: Even 'The Touch' do some solo gigs

843
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:42,430
The Touch

844
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,290
They do? Really?

845
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,260
Definitely not

846
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,060
How about it? Have you
ever worked with only Kazuya?

847
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,060
I don't remember!

848
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,070
For them, definitely not

849
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,070
No way

850
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,670
Have you ever wanted to?

851
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,400
It's not that I want to...

852
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:54,880
The Touch

853
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,070
You've never felt like
working with Kazuya?

854
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,070
How about you, Gotō?

855
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,480
They can't

856
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,480
They're a package deal. They can't appear solo

857
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:15,330
Theory: Even 'The Touch' do some solo gigs

858
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,300
And so...

859
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:24,540
The Touch

860
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:24,540
Twin comedians

861
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,040
Hello

862
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,040
Hello

863
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:30,680
When we asked them about the work they've been doing recently...

864
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:34,020
Investigation programs, right?

865
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,850
Yes

866
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,890
As you'd expect since we're twins with the same body and lifestyle

867
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,790
Takuya will for example eat spicy food

868
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,830
Kazuya will live normally

869
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,770
To see what happens

870
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,170
Because we've always done lots of experiments

871
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,540
They call us 'guinea pig comedians' at the office

872
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,880
It seems that, as twin comedians, experiment shows are their primary source of jobs but...

873
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,480
Staff) By the way, do you do any solo gigs?

874
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,490
I did Ametalk! solo for example, as a sweet-loving comedian

875
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,490
Yeah

876
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,060
As expected...

877
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,460
They do sometimes do solo gigs

878
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,990
We were in our 3 or 4th year then

879
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,030
Even if we were on a show, it was just for a gag

880
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:26,100
We mostly would just do "Wait Wait Wait" or "Out-of-Body Experience"

881
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,240
Going there alone meant you couldn't do anything

882
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:35,550
It's like your only weapon, being a twin, is blocked

883
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,850
It's like you're just an ornament on the stage

884
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:43,920
Staff) By the way, why did Takuya-san do that solo gig?

885
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,620
Yes?

886
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,430
The program makers thought it'd be funny if only one of us appeared

887
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,700
Both of us love sweets so...

888
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,700
Our manager was  like

889
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,200
'Well, it might as well be you because you're older'

890
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,040
It was age-based for some reason

891
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,510
There was no good reason

892
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,580
Similarly, for Kazuya...

893
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:14,520
"Impossible!" Episode 4

894
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:14,650
He appeared alone on a late-night
anthology drama called "Impossible!"

895
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:22,630
He was specially selected to appear in a tricky role as a stupid cat burglar who gets stuck in a washing machine

896
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:30,430
Was it like "We need a small, fat, dull middle aged-man"

897
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,440
"Let's use either one of The Touch"?

898
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,270
That's right

899
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:39,010
Here too, it seems either would've been fine

900
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:43,910
Staff) So what do you two think of solo gigs?

901
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,980
Umm...

902
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:48,990
About 10 years into our career, our chief manager told us

903
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:53,320
"It'd be good if you two started doing more solo gigs now"

904
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,090
We're firmly against it

905
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,630
Not everyone has to be like Osugi-and-Piko-san

906
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:06,200
And that's all because of the trauma from 'Ametalk!'

907
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:22,650
Ametalk!

On Stage

912
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:22,650
Takuya, 9 roles

913
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:22,650
The Touch's solo gigs by year (2003 to 2021)

914
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,640
The two of them...

915
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,970
in the 18 years
they've been active...

916
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,980
have done this many solo
gigs:

917
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,980
Takuya, 9 roles;
Kazuya, 6 roles

918
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,650
And after the last in 2017...

919
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,350
They haven't done any
solo gigs at all

920
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,150
Only Takuya's been on Lincoln

921
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,990
You're right

922
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:32,930
Dai Taku

923
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:32,930
Dr. Heinrich

924
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:32,930
Harapeko Twins

925
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:32,930
Yoshida-tachi

926
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:32,930
At this point, we investigated other
twin comedians who don't seem like they'd do solo gigs

927
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,970
Kōhei

928
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,970
Older
Brother

929
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,970
Yoshida-tachi

930
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,970
Younger
Brother

931
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,970
Yūhei

932
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,600
When it comes to the manzai artists, Yoshida-tachi...

933
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:45,410
Older brother Yuūhei: 4th place
Younger brother Kōhei: Didn't qualify

934
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:45,410
Yoshimoto Ugly Ranking 2019

935
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Older brother Yūhei alone
was selected as an Ugly Comedian

936
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,010
and appeared solo at the event

937
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:50,310
As for the competitive eater Youtubers,
the Harapeko Twins...

938
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:50,850
Ako

939
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:50,850
Competitive eating YouTubers

940
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:50,850
Harapeko Twins

941
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:50,850
Kako

942
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:50,850
Older
sister

943
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:50,850
Younger
sister

944
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:58,450
Kako

945
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:58,450
Older
sister

946
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,950
Because only one
competitive eater could appear

947
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:57,550
older sister Kako
appeared alone on a gourmet show

948
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:03,290
And comedian twins Dai Taku and Dr. Heinrich also

949
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:10,330
Dai Taku

950
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:10,330
Dr. Heinrich

951
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:10,630
have experience working solo in live performances and reenactments

952
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,640
Among these famous twins...

953
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,210
How about the ones you'd least expect to have solo gigs?

954
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,980
Kin is 100 100

955
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,980
Gin's also 100 100

956
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,990
Call Duskin on 100 100

957
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:28,480
Duskin

958
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:28,480
Free

959
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:28,480
Trial campaign for new customers

960
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,590
For both the happy and the sad

961
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:38,960
Kanie Gin

962
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:38,960
Legendary twins

963
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:38,960
Narita Kin

964
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,330
The legend celebrity twins
that debuted at 100,

965
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,330
Kin-san Gin-san

966
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,330
However...

967
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:46,640
Tetsuya-san, I won't die

968
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,010
Surprisingly, we found a solo appearance by Gin-san

969
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,780
Kin isn't here. I'm very sorry

970
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,010
No, no, it's fine

971
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,010
That's totally fine

972
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,020
What do you mean?

973
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,690
Kin-san had gotten a
fish bone stuck in her throat

974
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,690
so had to miss the shoot

975
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,360
So, it was due to a health problem but

976
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:14,800
Even Kin-san Gin-san had a solo gig

977
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:19,700
Yes, that's how it was

978
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,100
(Staff) I see

979
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,100
Yes

980
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,010
Staff) OK, thank you

981
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:27,180
Staff) Now, could you move to the other seat please

982
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,710
Sure

983
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,710
(Gotō) Huh?

984
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,710
Huh?

985
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,710
(Shibuya) Huh? Huh?

986
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,150
Staff) Thanks. Now, let's do the same questions again

987
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,320
Got it

988
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
(Gotō) Huh? I'm scared

989
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,620
And so...

990
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:43,030
Investigation Result

991
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:43,030
The Touch appeared solo
for this segment too

992
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,690
I'm annoyed!

993
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,000
That's cute

994
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,670
Do you understand what happened?

995
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,670
I get it

996
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,670
I'm annoyed!!

997
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,340
You thought it was The Touch
talking for the whole thing

998
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,340
I didn't notice at all

999
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,340
Nothing seemed odd

1000
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,340
Wow, it's kind of scary

1001
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,350
So that's why they seemed a bit odd,
like they had no energy

1002
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,350
Because they couldn't interact

1003
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,350
(Gotō) They couldn't have a conversation

1004
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,520
That's right

1005
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,920
I definitely thought you'd notice since their moles are in different places

1006
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,360
How would we know that?

1007
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,360
I was really nervous

1008
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,690
I thought they looked too similar.
They don't look that alike

1009
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,030
Which of them was it?

1010
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,730
It was Takuya

1011
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,030
(Fujimoto) The older one

1012
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,030
It was the older brother?

1013
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,500
Yes, it was the older one, obviously

1014
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,040
No, no, no

1015
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,940
What was the aim here?

1016
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,970
(Fujimoto) Exactly

1017
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:35,640
So we could be like
"The Touch DO have a solo gig"

1018
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,350
But now doesn't this raise the question...

1019
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,350
Do twins really exist?

1020
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,720
(Gotō) I'm scared

1021
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,720
That's scary, stop

1022
00:45:42,790 --> 00:46:14,750

1023
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,570
Next week, a 90 minute extended special

1024
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,570
I'm so scared, my head hurts

1025
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:51,340
Theories so scary they'll make your head hurt

1026
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,010
You don't have to do it
to know it's difficult

1027
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,010
and theories anyone can see are difficult. Also...

1028
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,010
Who could make that funny?

1029
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,020
A theory that seems
impossible to make funny

1030
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,690
A special set of theories,
for this year's last broadcast

1031
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,690
This'll be hard, for us too

1032
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,690
A scandal...
