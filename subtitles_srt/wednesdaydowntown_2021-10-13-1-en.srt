1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,520
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,060
Thank you

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,220
It's good to get paid for this

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,790
Letâ€™s get on with our first presenter please

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,410
Welcome Shoji Tomoharu
-Mikitty-!

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,910
Was that a deliberate lowering of the volume just now?

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,360
I'm trying my best!

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,010
Didn't you do a silent version last time?

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,590
A "sprayless" Mikitty, indeed

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,790
Now is not much better than then
-Nothing has changed

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,050
So why today...

12
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,110
Because no one laughed last time

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,820
Okay, so...

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,280
Changing the subject

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,850
It's not too late
-Yes

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,330
I bring this theory today

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,100
The Second "While lecturing someone, it's ok to add Nagabuchi's lyrics"

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,830
The last episode was a big hit...

19
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,640
We just did the first one
-Yes

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,710
If you saw it already then it'd ruin it

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,510
That's why both were recorded before the first broadcast

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,910
I challenged the song "Captain of the Ship"

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,970
It was a good attempt
-Yes

24
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,490
"Captain of the Ship" is unusual

25
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,390
It's very dense

26
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,780
And the second half is like a speech

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,350
Do you have any thoughts about the songs of Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi?

28
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,460
I only know the song "Cheers"

29
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,900
Haven't you heard of "HOLD YOUR LAST CHANCE"?

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,900
Never heard of it at all

31
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,350
Haven't you ever heard of "Life of an Asshole"?

32
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,100
Is there really such a song?

33
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,710
Don't you know that "Dad Who Became a Crane"?

34
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,040
What's that?

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,640
Don't know it?

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,870
The dad turns into a crane!

37
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,920
You're making fun of people, right?

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,310
No no no, I swear

39
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,550
It's feels a bit like that.
-Right?

40
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,120
No, it's not

41
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,060
So, later is the second leg of the "lecturing with Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi lyric's"

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,350
You're "really not nice"!

43
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,960
And

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,560
Does the child look-alike still look like the celebrity?

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,470
And the Wife Battle:

46
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,870
Who can make their husband laugh with supposed sleep talking?

47
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,900
Favourite

48
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:21,890
2nd "While lecturing someone, it's ok to add Nagabuchi's lyrics:

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,100
The first challenger is

50
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,100
Thanks for having me

51
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,230
Viking's Kotoge

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,440
This time, the title is also chosen from these songs that are suitable for lecturing

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,960
Kotoge's choice is

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,800
Three songs have already been chosen

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,110
Nagabuchi's "It's Not Like That"

56
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,280
Will this one work?

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,450
It's a bit difficult

58
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,790
Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi's famous song "It's not like that" includes the lyrics "pipipi"

59
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,700
It feels like something I would say

60
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,140
And i've been known to spit out some golden nuggets of wisdom from time to time

61
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:13,480
This time, the lyrics are also divided into 10 stages according to the ease of use

62
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,480
"pipipi" is not possible, right?

63
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,400
The time limit is 30 minutes

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,430
If the content is pointed out as lyrics by the junior in the process of lecturing

65
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,430
They will be immediately disqualified

66
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,250
A sentence with fewer words will score relatively less

67
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,450
The target is a junior from the same company

68
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,170
Darlings Oda

69
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:45,510
He lured Oda out with a fake plan of "having a talk with a senior who is close to him"

70
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,850
The rest period before the supposed recording is used for the "It's not nice" lecture challenge

71
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,130
What will be the result?

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,150
But ah

73
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,420
No its not like that

74
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,970
No, no, no, no, no, I mean you

75
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,660
You said it

76
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,490
No more "i'll come"?

77
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,080
They are referring to participation in Viking's live performance

78
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,860
In which he failed to say hello to Kotoge

79
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,170
This incident is used as an entry point to start the lecture

80
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,140
This may be a little bit of that

81
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,340
Generally speaking, at least let us know

82
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,110
I'm very sorry about it
-Because I...

83
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,840
Until now I also don't know what to say

84
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,650
I also thought about saying something about it to you, but I didn't think it was appropriate

85
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,020
I wanted to tell you in person, but I'm sorry

86
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,190
You shouldn't have done that
I'm sorry, yes

87
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,660
Really

88
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:39,400
The "heart is torn" and the "heart is chastised"

89
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,690
It can be said like this

90
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,750
Can't you hear?

91
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,440
That feeling

92
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,780
Yes

93
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,680
What...what do you say, no reply?

94
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,680
Reflecting

95
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,950
How long has the show been over? It's been 2 weeks

96
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,160
"A night of remorse, sadness, and misery"

97
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,310
That's not good, right?

98
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,460
A little dangerous...

99
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,500
I was shocked

100
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,880
But completely...

101
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,900
Yes...

102
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,720
Indeed

103
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,610
Unexpectedly, there are very serious complaints

104
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,240
And Kotoge brings in Nagabuchi's lyrics with a good rhythm

105
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,020
You've also entered King of Conte, right?

106
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,280
A tiebreaker.
-2 times?

107
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,980
Yes

108
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,810
It's like that

109
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,520
"It's something that's hard to catch when you're drowning in stumbles."

110
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,530
Very good.
-Very clever

111
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,900
You're not happy about it, are you?
-Yes

112
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,000
Next

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,560
Coming here today

114
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,000
"Say this, say this," or something like that

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,070
Do you have an idea in mind?

116
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,240
Ah, I do

117
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,970
For example, what do you want to talk about today

118
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,820
You've remained unchanged from before to now

119
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,680
Have been drinking green juice or something?

120
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,320
Well well well well...

121
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,050
I would like to talk about foreign travel if I can

122
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,650
What's happening abroad

123
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,790
When traveling to Thailand

124
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,390
When we went to the bar together

125
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,600
Gradually we became very close to the female customers in the store

126
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,160
With the local girls

127
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,300
But you were unexpectedly unpopular

128
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,500
And you kept saying, "Oda, open up Yahoo!"

129
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,740
"Let these girls know what an awesome celebrity I am"

130
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,510
I wanted them to see it, but there was no Wi-Fi in the store

131
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,720
I wanna talk about that fatal blow to you or something

132
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,950
What the hell?

133
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,120
Let me tell you, this thing in Thailand or whatever, it's not good, OK?

134
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,600
Yes, so...

135
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,660
"It's not like that." Seriously

136
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,630
Nah, that can't be told, right?

137
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,330
Although you "pipipipipi pipipipi" keep on talking

138
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,180
There it is!

139
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,070
You can't talk about that, OK?

140
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,890
Something's not right

141
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,280
Right?

142
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,980
Yes... I'm very sorry

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,460
He's laughing

144
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,480
No. If it's funny, forget it

145
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,570
Found out?

146
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,650
From "not like that" to "pipipi"

147
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,860
Oda can't help but laugh

148
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,590
As I said earlier, because of this occasion

149
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,230
We have to be good... we have to be sure of everything

150
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,470
Is Kotoge doing too much?

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,870
100%, be 100% sure before you say

152
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,970
Yes, I came here with this realization

153
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:40,240
Keeping up the didactic atmosphere, the challenge continues into the final stretch

154
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,890
Thrilling

155
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,620
Next

156
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,920
It is not "pushed from behind by something invisible"

157
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,310
Not a good idea

158
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,740
Normally you wouldn't say such things

159
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,340
Your "love always looks like a big lie"

160
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,820
Speak up!

161
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,290
I've really "become comfortable with being alone without realizing it"

162
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,960
Keeps stacking

163
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,800
Practically singing already

164
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:23,200
Without mentioning anything, 30 minutes pass

165
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,920
Close call

166
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,930
So, the truth is revealed

167
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,930
Passed?
-Yes

168
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,130
It's a theory.
-A theory, is it?

169
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:41,870
"While lecturing someone, it's ok to add Nagabuchi's lyrics"

170
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,940
Correct answer
-Whoa! Is that an awesome guess?

171
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,010
After Kotoge said "pipipi"

172
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,650
I was going to say something, but instead he moved on to the next lecture like he was running for his life

173
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,250
Sort of realised, then

174
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,780
The next challenger is

175
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,880
Thank you for having me

176
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,190
Jungle Pocket's Saito

177
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,700
I think a more direct song would be better

178
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,200
"The Only Flower in the World"

179
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:20,710
The best-selling SMAP song "The Only Flower in the World" is used to lecture SPIKE's Matsuura

180
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,210
What will be the result?

181
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,350
Well, how can I say this

182
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,950
The M-1 or The W is basically the same

183
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,460
Everyone has a strong feeling of "wanting to be at the top"

184
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,490
Similar contests are all like this

185
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,830
But its not really appropriate to compare your work to that of another comedian

186
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,470
"Even so, we humans always want to compare ourselves to each other." Absolutely

187
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,050
Very smooth

188
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,370
Very smoothly slipped in

189
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,760
Such a long line

190
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,250
People have different ways of doing things

191
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,220
Of course, there are all different types

192
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,050
But really, although there are many different types

193
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,220
This girl is quite strong
-Really willing to engage

194
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,190
Not convinced.
-Yes

195
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,030
Because the personal characteristics differ

196
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,060
Yeah, that's right.
-Yeah

197
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,030
Like different flowers

198
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,520
"You just have to work hard to make that flower bloom."

199
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,290
A little dangerous

200
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,370
It feels like it will be exposed

201
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,080
Totally lyrics!

202
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,810
Bring out your own personality

203
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,320
That's true

204
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,260
Connecting to SPIKE's current status

205
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,960
Familiar lyrics cleverly do not register

206
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,830
When female funny entertainers are funny

207
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,230
I think it's really awesome

208
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,230
I think "every one of them is beautiful"

209
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,610
When you say "beautiful", do you mean in a funny way or something?

210
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,580
No, no, no, no, no

211
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,120
So what? Generally speaking

212
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,520
So scary!

213
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,780
Won't you be criticized for your ugly appearance or something?

214
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,620
But yet, in the midst of this

215
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,190
Solidly winning the audience's laughter by being a funny female artist

216
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,570
I am not commenting on the beauty of the appearance

217
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,830
But I think everyone is very attractive and looks very beautiful

218
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,000
Ah - so that's it!

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,800
No feeling of being lectured at all...

220
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,930
No sense of admiration whatsoever

221
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,500
I've been walking on the road of being funny

222
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,700
The happiest part

223
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,640
Is seeing audience members waiting outside after live performances

224
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,210
Just for us alone

225
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:39,050
"Though we don't know the name of the person, he showed his smile to us on that day"

226
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,760
And has been our fan ever since

227
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,990
That made me feel very happy

228
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,160
The final task...

229
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,500
Is dropping a super-famous lyric

230
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,740
Anyway, it's not like you have to become the top, right?

231
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,570
You don't have to be No.1, right?

232
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,140
There's no such thing as becoming No. 1

233
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,180
After all, there are so many monsters around

234
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,810
"You don't have to be No.1" to do it

235
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,880
Just do it with the feeling of "Only one is special"

236
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,040
This is not a problem, right?

237
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,400
But I am now striving for "only one"

238
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,560
No problem?
-No problem at all

239
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,730
SAFE

240
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,730
I am now running my own Youtube channel

241
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:36,310
Even after uploading videos, the number of plays is only about 23

242
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,740
This is pretty close to "only one" as you said

243
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,950
It's not at all like being lectured

244
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,530
With only 5 minutes remaining

245
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,320
Saito makes his last attempts

246
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,420
So there is such a thing

247
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:57,660
"We all saw all kinds of flowers in front of the flower store."

248
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
This does not work, right?

249
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,250
This is the lyrics at the beginning

250
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,930
What're you talking about flowers?

251
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,700
What do you mean, flower store?

252
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,610
Hey, flower store...

253
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,840
Isn't that the lyrics?

254
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,480
Lyrics to "The Only Flower in the World"?

255
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,540
What?

256
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,820
Haven't you been filling me with the lyrics to "The Only Flower in the World"?

257
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,870
Saito Disqualified

258
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,060
So we reveal the truth

259
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,690
It was super natural. In retrospect

260
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,160
Very relevant to the topic

261
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,400
"In front of the flower store" is destined to be noticed, right?

262
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,600
I felt like a fool when saying it

263
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,660
Next is the final challenger

264
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,170
Panther's Ogata

265
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,040
I choose "Poem Without a Name" by Mr. Children

266
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,240
The first time "Poem Without a Name" by Mr. Children

267
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,260
Will be used to lecture Ogata's junior

268
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,860
Isn't that hard?
-It's hard

269
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,720
Why did you choose him out of so many people?

270
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,890
We all know

271
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,730
First of all, his intuition is not great and then there is...

272
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,820
He's a very honest and nice guy

273
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,710
He should take everything I say at face value

274
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Your instincts aren't any better

275
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,810
Let me tell you

276
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,210
I think you've been a little uninspired lately

277
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,720
Oh, really?

278
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,880
I am quite worried

279
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,220
That's not the case!

280
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,860
To have spirit... is the most important thing

281
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,090
No, Ogata, I'm super energetic

282
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,490
He's saying he has spirit

283
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,230
I'm just saying what I see.
-Oh, is that so?

284
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,860
He said he has
-What kind of lecture is this?

285
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,770
I hate people with no spirit.
-I'm sorry

286
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,600
When you are in front of people, it is absolutely necessary to have spirit

287
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,310
I'm super lively, okay?
-No, you're not

288
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,570
It's obvious
-This is just what I think

289
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,670
I'm most upset by people who have no spirit

290
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,790
Let's just say I'm in good spirits.
-That's enough

291
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,980
I've had enough of this.
-I'm really energetic

292
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,550
Not really, at least in my opinion

293
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,650
I can't be fooled

294
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,300
On the subject of "having spirit"

295
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,240
These two idiots have a discussion about a fake subject

296
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,160
Are you not quiet when you're alone?

297
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,590
But very lively with everyone
-Very lively

298
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,870
Because I treat everyone as my own people

299
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:22,810
"Even if you are a good friend, the night of loneliness will still come."

300
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,200
I'm glad he added it in

301
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,710
Ah, there is a bit of a mistake

302
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,880
Sounds extreme, what lonely night?

303
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,250
I've had some, quite a long time ago, for example

304
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,460
We performed in the same theater

305
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,890
Didn't we have noodle soup?
-Yeah

306
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,230
I saw you had some vegetables left

307
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,760
I really hate people who don't finish their food

308
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,600
The two are inextricably linked.
-I understand

309
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,770
No one around will have the leftovers

310
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,110
Some people can't even get enough to eat

311
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,780
You can say it to me
-Say what?

312
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:05,920
"If it's just a little dirty, I'll help you eat it all up."

313
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,450
All of that just lead up to this

314
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,390
But it'd be weird to give it to you

315
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,220
It's okay. I just want to eat

316
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,950
Thanks to the thick skin of his junior

317
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:26,300
Ogata somehow manages to say the most difficult lyrics

318
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,970
You really are a bit gloomy

319
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,940
I'm not, Ogata, I'm super lively, okay?

320
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,980
I'm honestly lively, Ogata

321
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,780
How to put it

322
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,450
I'm feeling "despair and disappointment"

323
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,160
Huh?

324
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,080
What are you "sulking about"?

325
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,540
The other side is saying "huh?" now

326
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,790
Sulking can not be helped, right?

327
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,960
I've been working hard even if you don't think so.
-What are you sulking about?

328
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,330
I'm not sulking, I'm trying very hard, what can I do?

329
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,370
Wait, what?

330
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,370
What's with "despair" and "disappointment"?

331
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,010
I can't believe what i'm seeing, this guy is not right, really

332
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,010
From now on, work hard for me

333
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,380
I'm doing it already!

334
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,840
You have to work even harder after making it

335
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,670
Whether it is "Love, Freedom, Hope, Dream"

336
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,720
What, ah what?

337
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,220
"It will all roll under your feet"

338
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,220
Look, it's all under your feet!

339
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,380
Too dumb, didn't realise at all

340
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,460
Huh? What love and freedom?

341
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,360
Hope and love
-What the hell!?

342
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,730
You've become a philosopher
-Listen carefully

343
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,370
"Love is not something that is fought for or given, but something that is around when you look back."

344
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,210
Such a long speech, why the hell are you talking about love?

345
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,770
Very bad attitude

346
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,840
Toward his senior

347
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,470
It's okay to talk about love, right?

348
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,010
So it also depends on who is doing the lecturing

349
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,080
But it's a good thing he was able to get in

350
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,120
"Falling in love naturally"

351
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,060
"even if it may sometimes hurt others"

352
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,190
"It is no longer the time to be sad about it."

353
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,000
What the hell is this bullshit?

354
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,810
It's normal to say!

355
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,300
That's a song!

356
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,470
It's about time to realize now

357
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,440
You're so noisy, stop talking about this time and that freedom

358
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,640
The responses are nothing like what you'd expect from a junior

359
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,210
Despite becoming extremely heated

360
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,100
He still fails to realize everything he is being told is a lyric

361
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,080
He can't realize because he's getting too angry

362
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,140
He's sick of being told off

363
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,450
When 5 minutes are left

364
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,670
You

365
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,940
Wow, enough, it's enough, surely?

366
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,570
Look at you

367
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,310
"The weakness of not being able to continue to live with a free mind"

368
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,270
It seems to me like "blame it on whose fault it is and live"

369
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,020
Very afraid tone

370
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,770
This is the part of the chorus

371
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Something is wrong, something is wrong, something is really wrong

372
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,540
That's enough. You must think I'm short of brain capacity

373
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,440
"I have insufficient brain capacity"

374
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,080
Don't joke with me, I went to university, OK?

375
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,310
What about insufficient brain capacity!?

376
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,710
I went to university!

377
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,280
I know!

378
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,840
But insufficient brain capacity

379
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,190
Now he's doing it!

380
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,020
You

381
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,760
So weird
-You are my...

382
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,790
No more "you", it's really weird, every sentence is super weird

383
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,600
"If you doubt me, come and slit my throat."

384
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,000
Mr. Children!

385
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,370
Mr.Children!

386
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,540
Ogata Disqualified

387
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,460
"Cut your throat" is the lyrics of Mr. Children

388
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,440
The truth is revealed

389
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,950
What?

390
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,820
Mr. Children!

391
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,920
It was Mr. Children

392
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Indeed, Mr.Children

393
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,680
I was really angry, I thought "this guy is super annoying"

394
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,230
"This guy" is not quite right, is it?

395
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,080
The results are shown in the figure

396
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,040
Although Ogata got a lot of points, the 1st place is Kotoge as only he was not disqualified

397
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,860
There you have it
-That's the results

398
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,440
Only Kotoge wasn't disqualified

399
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,410
Comedians are not very strict when it comes to the senior-junior relationship

400
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,380
The lyrics weren't the point anymore, more the interaction that made it interesting

401
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,750
It just confirmed how despised Ogata is

402
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,020
So it still depends on who's lecturing

403
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,930
I think there is still room for development on this

404
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,200
How about "Yesterday" or something like that?

405
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
No way!

406
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,920
It's too strange to start speaking English all of a sudden

407
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,400
Let's welcome the next presenter

408
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,710
It's Kanazuki

409
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,910
Thank you for having me

410
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,930
First time on the show?

411
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,710
Second time

412
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,250
So it's the second time?

413
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,420
First time was having professional impersonators impersonate teachers

414
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,200
Ah that one was very touching

415
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,600
That won a Galaxy Award

416
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,860
Award-winning
-Indeed!

417
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,440
Then they were immediately warned by the broadcasting ethics agency, right?

418
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,640
Erratic programming

419
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,870
On behalf of all impersonators, I would like to apologize to everyone

420
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,960
What?

421
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,340
Without further delay, the theory I bring today is this

422
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:42,520
Does the child look-alike still look like the celebrity?

423
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,470
I want to see it

424
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:07,780
Does the child look-alike still look like the celebrity?

425
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:14,830
First of all, he appeared in the parody segment of "It's okay to laugh", "Parody of Red and White" and other shows

426
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,930
On the show many times

427
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,920
Really?

428
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,090
Often on TV

429
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,120
A child who looks like Toshiaki Karasawa

430
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,290
6 years old?

431
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,290
After 15 years

432
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,990
Does he look more like the celebrity as a grown-up?

433
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,330
See him now at age 21

434
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,620
Not similar at all

435
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,140
Indeed

436
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,110
No similarities still exist

437
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,730
Completely went in a different direction

438
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,680
Since when did you stop being told you look alike?

439
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,190
After junior high school I began to become a bit of a gangster

440
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,060
Turned into a punk

441
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,660
There was a time when even my eyebrows were shaved

442
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,660
Ooohhh so excessive

443
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,890
And my hair was permed into short curly hair

444
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,670
Looks bad

445
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,630
His appearance completely diverged from Toshiaki Karasawa

446
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,840
Of course, no one said I looked like him anymore

447
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,190
Although Nakazawa was once similar

448
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,720
He has undergone a complete transformation and now works in a decoration company

449
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,940
Next is...

450
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,570
Two children who looked like Nishikido Ryo

451
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,060
Ren and Rei Morita, 4 years old at the time

452
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,370
So cute
-Very similar

453
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,860
Both of them are similar

454
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:38,600
They appeared in many shows as the "Nishikido Ryo Twins"

455
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,720
Really similar

456
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,980
13 years later they've become these high school students

457
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,140
17 years old

458
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:52,480
Although not dissimilar, they're also not especially similar

459
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,640
But the temperament is similar
-Well, the temperament does remain

460
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,920
Do people still say you guys look like Nishikido Ryo?

461
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,130
No one says that at all anymore

462
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,830
Thought so

463
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:09,770
Did you think that you would continue to be in show business?

464
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,400
Although I didn't really think much about it

465
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,710
Inside

466
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:23,210
I was happy to be on TV

467
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,480
Doesn't seem happy at all

468
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:30,520
I just want to live a normal life

469
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,120
For some reason, the mood of the two men is worryingly low

470
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,460
Thankfully they agreed to the interview

471
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,130
Next is

472
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:47,040
Mikupi, who looks like Naomi Watanabe, was 16 years old

473
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,540
New member Mikupi! Nice to meet you!

474
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,830
Thank you everyone

475
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,640
Though it was me for a second

476
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,230
Joining an agency, she participated in various shows

477
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:10,110
Let's see her 5 years later at the age of 21

478
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,110
Eh? Lost weight?

479
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,390
Totally different

480
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,480
Not alike at all

481
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:20,740
Losing half of her weight, she became a different person

482
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,140
Weight loss

483
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,140
What kind of work do you do now?

484
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,640
Artistic activities have come to a halt

485
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,010
Now i'm a conservationist

486
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,520
After Naomi, who has changed a lot, the fourth one is...

487
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,810
A child who looks like Aina Ashida, who is only one year different

488
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,420
So cute

489
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:48,570
Although the celebrities and impersonators, so far, have not been similar

490
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,570
Will it be the most similar?

491
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:53,280
Will these two still be alike having both gone through the process of growing up at the same time?

492
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,200
Highest probability

493
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,020
What is the result?

494
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,180
Although the traces of Aina Ashida are vaguely recognizable, it is no longer possible to say that she looks similar

495
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,990
There is a hint of the look that remains

496
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,590
Do people still say you look like Aina Ashida?
-Not anymore

497
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:22,160
If I had to say, it's more like Aina Ashida and Meiko Nagano combined and divided by two

498
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,130
Because the elements of both sides are not that strong

499
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:31,170
So, the further one grows it seems the less similar they become

500
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,590
The child who looked like Oguri Shun also

501
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,590
Is

502
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,330
Also not similar anymore

503
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,530
The child who looked like Yuzuru Hanyu previously also

504
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,430
Has changed completely

505
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,300
But he's grown into an interesting look

506
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:07,230
In the midst of this, in 2004, he appeared in the parody segment of "It's okay to smile"

507
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,190
The Tiger Woods kid

508
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,970
I'm not sure about this one

509
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,360
His name which is also Tiger, aged 8

510
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,890
Do you also have this?

511
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,400
After 17 years, here's what he looks like now

512
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:27,100
Hello. Nice to meet you

513
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Not the same at all

514
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:34,610
If the kid doesn't look like them to begin with, its even less likely for them to look alike when they're older

515
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:41,640
Since junior high school, because the singer JERO was often on TV

516
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,850
At that time, they said, "Jero, Jero, Jero"

517
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:51,890
When I was in high school, the singer Chris Hart was always on TV

518
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,290
Then in college it was Anthony

519
00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:03,530
Basically just any well known black sports players or stars who were on TV in different eras

520
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,000
I would be told I looked like them

521
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,090
So far the theory is practically dead

522
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,940
So, with such expectations in mind

523
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,850
Let's look at Tanaka, also known as Ma-kun, who has a younger lookalike

524
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:31,410
With the experience of having won out of 3,300 people in a 27-hour program broadcast in 2016

525
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:38,160
Does this child buck the trend?

526
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,160
Hmmm

527
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,540
Ah, very similar

528
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,550
This one is awesome!

529
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,600
Exactly the same

530
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,660
Katsuki Masuda at 11 years old

531
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,340
Very similar

532
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,740
Not bad for a kid who won 1 million yen

533
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,720
So alike

534
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,850
With such a similar look and feel

535
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,580
Come on, look a little bit like ma-kun

536
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,650
What does he look like now, five years later?

537
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,180
He's grown into a perfect likeness

538
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,410
Do you play baseball?

539
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,800
Not at all

540
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,210
What club are you in now?

541
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,570
The science department

542
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:25,350
Make some slime, send rockets into the sky, that sorta stuff

543
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,690
Making slime and flying planes

544
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,530
This is a big event for his department

545
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,710
Since this is a rare find, we take it a bit further

546
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,690
Not that similar? After putting on the hat

547
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,400
In summary
The result depends on the original similarity

548
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,290
I gues so

549
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,860
It's hard to get people to perform

550
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,760
When they all come out, everyone just replies, "Uh-huh."

551
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,370
I feel sorry for them now that they've grown up

552
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,220
It feels like only 15% of the image is left

553
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:09,160
I still think the Nishikido Ryo twins have retained the same vibe

554
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,790
They're today's best

555
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,570
Awesome
-Great, right? They're good fun

556
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,110
It's a good thing they are willing to be on the show

557
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,160
Still willing

558
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,210
Well, maybe Nishikido Ryo is also like this nowadays

559
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,850
There's no way!

560
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,950
Let's welcome the next presenter

561
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,190
Who is it?

562
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,230
It's Kawashima!

563
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,470
Hello everyone

564
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,630
Thank you for having me

565
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,150
I'd like to ask a question

566
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,670
Do any of you talk in your sleep?

567
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,210
Has your wife ever told you "you talk in your sleep"?

568
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,110
Do you, Hamada?

569
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,440
No, but I grind my teeth

570
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,760
He grinds his teeth very badly

571
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,540
I think he has talked in his sleep before

572
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,620
When we used to go out for performances and sleep in the same room together

573
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,650
"Mattsun, eat quickly"

574
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,960
Dreaming of being good friends
-A great relationship

575
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,700
Dreaming of his student days
-Yeah

576
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,630
Hamada had already finished eating, right?

577
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,270
Who knows?

578
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,550
Do you, Toyosaki?

579
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,630
I don't know if I do

580
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,040
But my husband and kids often do

581
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,480
What do they say?

582
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:35,850
Yesterday it was "That's the wall over there"

583
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,980
Your husband said it?
-Yes

584
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,450
I have no idea what kind of dream he was having

585
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,250
The dreamer can't explain it either

586
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,790
Maybe he's playing an escape room...

587
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,090
In relation to this, today I bring you a theory about sleep talking

588
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,230
Who can make their husband laugh with supposed sleep talking?

589
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,060
Can it be done?

590
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,900
Honestly, when sleeping people suddenly talk, everything they say is pretty interesting, right?

591
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,940
Yes, sleep talking itself is very interesting

592
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,280
If they realise, then the round finishes

593
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,050
That's for sure.
-That's when it ends

594
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,320
So if you want to score highly the words you say will have to be dissonant

595
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,950
Otherwise they'd realize its fake
-Indeed

596
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,620
You also have to make it funny
-Make them laugh

597
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,530
And pay attention to naturalness and all aspects of rhythm

598
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,930
A sense test!

599
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,270
Who can make their husband laugh with supposed sleep talking?

600
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,250
This time, these three wives are participating

601
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,500
I'd like more tolerance

602
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,460
What does more tolerant mean?

603
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:48,990
With this couple that frequently appeared in the past

604
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,460
Why is he naked

605
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,790
First of all, each determines a natural setting to encourage sleep

606
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,550
Maruyama's location involves an overnight stay

607
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,400
Sleep nice and heavy

608
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,860
Paradise' Nakagawa's and Kazuyo's setup is

609
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,910
Let's go take a bath, Dad

610
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,280
Want a drink? Yeah, sure

611
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,980
One falls asleep after drinking

612
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:31,360
Harukara Izumi and Wednesdays Hikari are in their living rooms waiting for their husbands to finish work

613
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,480
Pretending they fell asleep while waiting

614
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm back

615
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,670
At this point

616
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,640
So hot, so hot

617
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,970
What's he doing!?

618
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:47,010
Wednesdays Mitsuhashi gets naked as soon as he arrives home

619
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,840
Is there such a person?

620
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,140
This guy really takes it all off as soon as he arrives

621
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,750
That seems to be the case

622
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,120
It can't be helped

623
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:03,560
The husband naked in his house as before is already in place

624
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,890
He can't live without this

625
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,560
So annoying!

626
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,540
The 30 minute period begins

627
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,540
Unbearable

628
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:11,870
The "amuse the husband with sleep taking" tournament begins

629
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,990
Don't want to go near that couch

630
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:14,170
Direct contact with the sofa is disgusting

631
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,230
First is the Kikuta family

632
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,230
He's a comedian

633
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,150
Harukara Izumi's first attempt is...

634
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,650
My husband is incredibly fond of Tsuda

635
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:34,560
He likes him so much he always uses his jokes at home

636
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,860
So he should laugh if he hears me saying the jokes in my dream

637
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,830
su-

638
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,530
su

639
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,620
Sleep talking begins

640
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,700
su su su

641
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,970
su

642
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,470
I offer a su to you

643
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,860
Smiling obviously

644
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,570
Not wanting to wake up his wife, Kikuta laughs quietly

645
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,970
And

646
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,860
Saying something meaningless should make him laugh out loud

647
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,390
On the elbow

648
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,440
Sitting up and listening now

649
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:18,730
Please tattoo the dog on the elbow

650
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:26,270
Faced with this interesting event, Kikuta couldn't help but take a video

651
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:31,280
What should I do with the tattoo of the dog, Okabe?

652
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:33,840
Laughed

653
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,310
Nice phrase

654
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,750
Okabe says put the text on the forehead

655
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,560
You can hear it very clearly!

656
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,560
And Maruyama...

657
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,790
So sleepy

658
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,460
So sleepy

659
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,370
Let me sleep

660
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,730
Sleep talking

661
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:57,090
Not only did he not laugh, Ben didn't respond to the sleep talking at all

662
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,330
Ignored

663
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,240
But there's a reason

664
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,410
I usually talk in my sleep

665
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:06,650
So saying usual sleep talking stuff wont make him laugh

666
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,820
I'm going to be radical

667
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,850
And exaggerate

668
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,580
Wouldn't be surprised

669
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,890
So

670
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,290
Lets introduce the participants

671
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,290
Talking normally

672
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,190
No way

673
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,660
No reaction at all

674
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,670
First, Alcinder

675
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,070
On the left is Bismarck

676
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,610
Kitazawa and

677
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,950
Center back is Emberma

678
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:44,450
The goalie is Oliver Kay

679
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,270
Listening carefully now

680
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,130
Disappointing

681
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,890
What do you mean? I don't understand

682
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,890
Can't laugh!

683
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,270
And Paradise's wife

684
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,900
I...

685
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,740
I...

686
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,840
I...

687
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,170
What?

688
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,060
Ah, shooting a video

689
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,340
I...

690
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,510
I am Shinnosuke

691
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,180
What are you talking about?

692
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,320
So boring

693
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,050
So boring

694
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,220
Laughing super happily

695
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,340
And

696
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,930
Hello, give me a grilled salmon

697
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,470
It's sold out

698
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,300
Conversation begins

699
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,020
Then regular salmon is fine

700
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,180
We're talking to each other

701
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,020
What?

702
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,380
Finally, Wednesday Izumi's attempt

703
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,220
A dream of being wooed

704
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,020
To make sure he listens carefully

705
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,560
It'll be regarding Toshida

706
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,260
Although his senior

707
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,190
He has a really good relationship with him

708
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,160
Don't do that...

709
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,900
I've just gotten married

710
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,720
Always naked...

711
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,740
What, what?

712
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,610
I'm coming to save you

713
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,120
Coming to your rescue!

714
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,390
Don't do that, Toshida

715
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,460
The butt is really there

716
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,690
Why Toshida?

717
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,960
This angle

718
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,090
Why?

719
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,770
Looks like a dugong

720
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,290
Why?

721
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,200
Why

722
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,340
I can't believe it's Toshida...

723
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:46,650
At this time 15 minutes has passed from the total 30

724
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,110
The current scores are as shown

725
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,170
As much as Maruyama would like to score...

726
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,280
Does Alcinder eat chow mein with sauce?

727
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,330
Don't you want to pour on the sauce?

728
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,260
What?

729
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,670
Don't do this. Don't brand me

730
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,940
Never brand people on the forehead

731
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,750
So radical!

732
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,670
The soccer team can not be branded on the forehead

733
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,980
At least do it on the arm

734
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,210
It's the same

735
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,850
I said you can't do it on the forehead

736
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,350
Impossible

737
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,220
So noisy

738
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,570
On the other hand, the Kikuta family, now in second place, is...

739
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,570
No laughing

740
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,290
Welcome~

741
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,690
Thank you for visiting so frequently

742
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,890
S...S isn't available

743
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,330
M isn't available

744
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,250
Very good performance

745
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,170
Is that OK?

746
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,640
Well said

747
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,170
Barely noticeable

748
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,270
Gold Member~

749
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,140
Please come this way~

750
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:58,190
And so, Izumi accumulates points smoothly

751
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,190
Not exposed at all

752
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,580
Even trying this too

753
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,420
Locust pose

754
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,980
Too much, right?

755
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,360
This definitely won't work!

756
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,600
The yoga pose proves a step too far

757
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,840
Yeah

758
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:19,410
As such, she is forcibly awakened by a worried Kikuta

759
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:25,280
So Harukara and Izumi have a final score of 100

760
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,440
Kawashima, what about you?

761
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,510
On public transport once I shouted "stop" when I was particularly tired and drunk

762
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,490
The office worker put down his egg sandwich in an instant

763
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,850
I really made a noise

764
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,480
After some time, the Paradise family's husband moves into another room

765
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,170
Yes, this could happen

766
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,730
Ah, gone

767
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,430
And so

768
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,500
By doing the Woman Rush Hour bit

769
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,140
He should laugh by hearing his own skit

770
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,080
Coke Coke Draft Beer Oolong Tea

771
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,410
Wait, don't order so many at once

772
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:08,430
I don't know what to do, ah

773
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,370
It's fine

774
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,010
This voice...could it be

775
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,890
Can using manzai succeed in making them laugh?

776
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:22,430
Coke Coke Root Beer Oolong Tea to Wine Coke

777
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:26,170
Ah, I don't understand, I don't understand

778
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,640
It's fine

779
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:38,910
Although not laughing, she successfully summoned the performer

780
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,420
The entrance is disgusting enough

781
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,880
Successfully summoned though

782
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,780
But...

783
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,850
This voice...could it be

784
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,970
Eh...

785
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,290
It's over, right?

786
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:56,130
The voice is the captain of the workforce

787
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,090
A disgusting way to get someone to tell the truth

788
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,010
No, no

789
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,750
Really disgusting

790
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,030
What is he doing?

791
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,310
Surely exposed

792
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,780
Help

793
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,190
We're seeing something bad

794
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,320
Looking for bare skin

795
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,810
As we can no longer allow Kazuyo to experience this

796
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,330
Her round ends with a score 90 of points

797
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,090
So scary

798
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,130
Next: Maruyama, who has not yet scored anything

799
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,600
Sleepwalking?

800
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,050
Jiang shi?

801
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,800
What are you doing?

802
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,940
What are you doing?

803
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,430
Is that dreaming?

804
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,070
Really

805
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,480
Jiang shi?

806
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,650
Yeah, jiang shi

807
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:50,220
You're definitely awake

808
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,190
Exposed

809
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:55,120
No matter what, it can't be like this

810
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,370
The exposure ends with failure

811
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,590
Final score 10 points

812
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,450
Blocked

813
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,000
Creepy

814
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,770
He said creepy

815
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,480
On the other side is Wednesdays...

816
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,180
Not even for dinner

817
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,240
Don't play this shot

818
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,620
Now, the approach changes from cheating to a lover's quarrel

819
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,190
Like Yu

820
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,290
What's up with this guy?

821
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,790
Like?

822
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:34,300
Super like
-Me too

823
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,130
It seems to be working but...

824
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,720
Enough

825
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,060
Impossible

826
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:45,940
What are you doing?

827
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,640
What's starting?

828
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,570
It's starting. It's starting

829
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,080
What are you doing?

830
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:57,750
Mitsuhashi Bad Switch: ON

831
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,420
Thankfully the specified time has ended

832
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,870
And so, the truth is revealed

833
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,140
What are you doing?
-That was close

834
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,400
I saw on the Internet that people who talk in their sleep do it because they're under a lot of pressure

835
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,240
So you must've accumulated a lot of stress

836
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,570
No, no, there's nothing wrong with kissing your wife's back

837
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,880
What are you doing?

838
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,310
It's mutual

839
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,080
At home she's always sleep talking

840
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,420
This was a light one

841
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,890
Sometimes she chants mantras

842
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:33,450
What kind?
-Arabic or something

843
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,790
Something I can't understand
-No way

844
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:36,820
I'm not sure

845
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:45,170
And so, the winner is Kikuta's wife Hanako

846
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,480
I see

847
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,970
So there's the result

848
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,870
Maruyama's jiang shi routine was little too much...

849
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,950
She just had 0 at the point so she had to take a big risk

850
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,630
What Maruyama said was also radical

851
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:06,420
But her usual self is actually more radical

852
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,750
Thats true

853
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,560
Her husband barely reacted at all, right?

854
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,860
Impressive

855
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,200
What do you think, Toyosaki?

856
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,050
The couple's relationship is very clear from the videos

857
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,240
I saw too much
-Agreed

858
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,070
Wednesdays are really ready to go

859
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,370
He must be stopped

860
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:25,890
Imagine if the camera crew came in just a bit later

861
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,550
A shocking video would be captured

862
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,050
Tell him to observe silently in the future

863
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:34,750
It made it more interesting though
-True, more interesting

864
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,250
The guy was really naked all the time.
-Really was

865
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,790
It's not that disgusting of an ass though

866
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,790
