Translation: eChie

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,350
Under the Stars

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,050
Ryoko, here you are.  You'll catch a cold.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,260
What are you doing?

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,260
Looking at the stars.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,390
Stars?

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,060
I made a promise to my boyfriend.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,600
That every night at this exact time,
we would look at the stars.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,930
It doesn't matter how long we are apart.

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,000
We'll be looking at the same stars.

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,200
That's what he said.

12
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,370
How romantic.

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,240
But tonight, that star isn't here.

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,480
Huh?

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,050
OK, everyone.  Did you hear?

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:41,720
Yeah.

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,720
This is for her and her boyfriend.

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,390
We shouldn't fall no matter what! OK!?

19
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,290
Hey you!

20
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,770
I can't hang on, my hands area in the wrong position.

21
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,510
Hey wait, I can't, I can't.

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,940
I can't.

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,310
I'm shooting.

24
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,920
Come here.

25
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,960
I won't fall!

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,590
Wait, wait!

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,990
I give up, I give up!

28
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,360
I'm scared, I'm scared!

29
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,760
I'm scared!

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,730
It's scary!

31
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,570
Switch to a commercial, hurry!

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,970
I can't!

33
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,540
I'm serious!

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,300
Hey!
