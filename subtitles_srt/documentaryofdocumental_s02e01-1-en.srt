00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,340
Well... to be honest...
The thing is that...

3
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,780
we had to let it go…
and put it away.

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,120
But I negotiated something

6
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,520
and I think some people
may actually like it.

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,960
Especially since we
went so far with this one.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,030
And if possible,

00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,940
I'd really like everyone
to take a look at it.

doing comedy nonstop
since we won the M-1

91
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,470
but I'm feeling pretty excited
for the first time in a while.

92
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,570
I like Documental
as a comedian

93
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,470
And I laugh
with the straight man role.

94
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,510

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Something I'm expecting from this

96
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,950
is for Soshina to be able to

97
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,320
take a new step forward
during this competition.

98
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,890
Depending on the other
straight man roles,

99
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,830
I might have to
refine my strategy.

100
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,030
Maybe I'll go all out,

101
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,760
or look at the others,
and act like an idiot.

102
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,470
He's pretty orthodox,

103
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,140
and doesn't have
experience with women.

104
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,770
So you have to wonder

105
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,180
how far a cherry-boy (Virgin) like him can go

106
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,310

107
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,380
I wonder what he'll do
after 20-30 minutes.

108
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,460
Alright, a guy...

109
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,660
Yo-san has some good surprises for you.

110
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,730
Whoa!

111
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,940
Good morning, Sensei!

112
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,440
—Akiyama-sensei!
—You're here? Hey!

113
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,440
You too, Soshina?

114
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,750
Akiyama-san!

115
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,480
I'm Akiyama Ryuuji from ROBERT.

116
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,450
You can leave
Documental to me.

117
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,130
I wonder
how many times it's been.

118
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,930
This is already
his fourth time.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,070
So I want to see...

120
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,200
what else he can do,

121
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,410
or come up with.

122
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,210
I also wonder if I might
use up everything

123
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,950
that they haven't seen before
this time around.

124
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,850
I've already used the
Umemiyage act before,

125
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,620
so I've added some improvements
and I want to give it a try.

"The reliable creators"

127
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,770
I want to put up a fight
for the ages this time.

128
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,540
So I was talking to a female announcer,

129
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,670
and she got all embarrassed,

130
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,580
and told me she watched it.

131
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,380
I asked if she watched
the "hand service" part as well.

132
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,620
So her face got beet red,
and she left.

133
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,690
Maybe she liked it.

134
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,790
It wouldn't surprise me
if he won it eventually.

135
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,130
So maybe this time?
Finally?

136
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,430
I'm sure no one

137
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,330
would complain if I finally
won it all.

138
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,800
It's finally time!

139
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,470
Finally! Documental!

140
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,910
For real, I have to
settle my score here,

141
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,240
or I won't think straight.

142
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,180
Yeah, I know
this is how I'm ending the month.

143
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,950
What's with those sandals?

144
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,360
Who's gonna show up?

145
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,760
Wait, that's too soon!

146
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,630
You're dressed like that?!

147
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,930
So Matsuo's not coming?

148
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,870
I'm Matsuo from
Chocolate Planet.

149
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,200
I came to take
the ten million today.

150
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,770
Huh? Which one—? Whoa!

151
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,810
Ah right!

152
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,180
Matsuo-san!

153
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,510
Matsuo-san from Chocolate Planet...

154
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,050
Don't read as Ikko-san!

155
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,890
You should leave Ikko-san
for later! Later!

156
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,020
Chocolate are funny
and sometimes spontaneous,

157
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,630
so even if he has no plans
I still think

158
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,430
that maybe something good
might happen.

159
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,900
I'm the Kamikaze Captain
in Chocolate.

160
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,940
They like more
power play and stuff.

161
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,340
But the destructive one
tends to be me.

162
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,810
Recently,
I've been doing impersonations.

163
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,910
So I've prepared
a few of those for today.

164
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,250
How much?! (Alternatively: How long?!)

165
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,020
I don't think many people there
will be doing impersonations.

166
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,390
So I think this might be innovative.

167
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,400
I usually do Ikko-san
on TV, but

168
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,430
I want to do an Ikko-san

169
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,470
more aimed for comedians.

170
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,610
So... a pleasure to
be here today.

171
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,980
I hope I won't
cause much trouble to you all.

172
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,810
Just don't hurt me physically.

173
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,710
Next year, it'll be 15 years in comedy for me.

174
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,090
But I've never tried any
solo comedy so far,

175
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,920
so I think winning this
might make me a better comedian.

176
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,760
That's why I'm here today.

177
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,700
What happened to you there?

178
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,470
I just had...
an incident, you know.

179
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,480
Another guy...

180
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,680
Oh no...

181
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,750
I hate this.

182
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,450
This is a newcomer.

183
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,850
No way...

184
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,020
Someone good showed up.

185
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,130
No way, man!

186
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,190
Koumoto-san!

187
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,330
Come on!

188
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,370
I'm Koumoto from Jicho Kacho.

189
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,400
I'm so nervous
I feel like

190
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,440
asking someone to
switch places.

191
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,680
Good morning!

192
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,010
Good morning!

193
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,580
Take this.

194
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,680
I've seen this.

195
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,650
It's finally here!

196
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,850
It's hard to believe
but this is his first time!

197
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,190
I guess I wasn't
expecting it,

198
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,390
or maybe the timing was
kind of funny.

199
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,630
Koumoto tends to laugh a lot.

200
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,300
Yeah.

201
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,670
"Well then, I'll give you
something to think about."

202
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,540
Come on!

203
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,780
You laugh at everything...

204
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,810
I do!
So...

205
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,720
I'm the type to laugh
even when I'm in the shower.

206
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,290
It can't be helped that I do
so I'll take advantage of it.

207
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,290
I'll teach you a lesson, okay?

208
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,600
Give me a break!

209
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,730
Koumoto-san! Damn!

210
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,400
He might be older
for sure.

211
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,640
Maybe that'll put
some pressure on him.

212
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,240
I didn't prepare any weapons,

213
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,610
instead I was thinking of
counter-attacks.

214
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,750
I have high expectations,

215
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,950
So I'll try to
do things my way.

216
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,120
Stop it, guys!

217
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,460
Huh?

218
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,420
You're trying too hard!
Huh?

219
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,690
Matsuo, right?

220
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,860
Stop it, you two.

221
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,300
You two?
You're trying.

222
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,370
I'm not trying anything.

223
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,670
The Oguri Shun impersonation. (EN: 2)

224
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,200
Who's doing that?
Oguri Shun?

225
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,810
I'm sure we'd know immediately
if he was.

226
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,380
Seems like everyone
brought a lot of stuff today.

227
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,210
I've never seen this
from up close.

228
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,680
I hate this, man.

229
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,350
Huh?

230
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,250
Hello!

231
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,020
I'm dead!

232
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,320
This sucks!

233
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,460
These guys are all great!

234
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,060
Sorry!

235
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,560
I hate this already.

236
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,330
I won M-1 2017.

237
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,670
I'm Kubota from Toro Salmon.

238
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,870
I do everything aside from
shady business and lying.

239
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,640
I want to make a mess.

240
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,550
Good morning.

241
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,650
What? I have to quit? (EN: 3)

242
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,020
Quit Yoshimoto?

243
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,820
We haven't seen each other for a while.

244
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,860
So I thought it was fine.

245
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,760
I thought it could be fun
to see him explode.

246
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,000
Late last year...

247
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:13,100
I made some remarks that almost made the country explode, and burned bridges. (EN: 3 cont.)

248
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,610
And that's how I got here.

249
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,080
I think maybe I shouldn't

250
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,310
be talking about this,

251
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,150
I thought I was going to die

252
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,450
and I was planning on dying
late last year,

253
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,760
but I couldn't take the last step

254
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,960
and I'm still alive

255
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,070
Damn it! I wanted to die!

256
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,500
But it's finally time

257
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,740
Can I send everything to hell?

258
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,470
I don't care if they cancel me.

259
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,040
Are you sure you want to have me here?

260
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,250
You didn't get the money from the Omura boat race? (EN: 4)

261
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,890
Now's not the time.
I like that!

262
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,530
Don't do that now.
Don't do business now!

263
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,290
Damn, this is scary.

264
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,600
Pretty bad, for real.

265
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,900
How did you choose to do that?

266
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,570
Look, look!

267
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,540
There he is!

268
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,610
There he is, this is serious!

269
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,040
For real?

270
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,380
Drop the T-shirt!
What are you doing?

271
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,980
I'm Inada from Einstein!

272
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,750
I'm ready to lose face!

273
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,790
A million yen!

274
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,400
I'm glad but also scared.

275
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,600
A million yen sounds good, though.

276
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,170
How much was your hair transplant?

277
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,430
1.04 million

278
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,730
And it moves?

279
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,600
Lately he's been

280
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,310
pretty incredible.

281
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,310
Like deep inside he's...

282
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,910
breaking all kinds of walls.

283
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,580
With a face like mine, it would be embarrassing

284
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,820
to lose against anyone else.

285
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,030
I used to suffer from stage fright,

286
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,900
and I didn't laugh much either.

287
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,430
But if you meet people's true selves,

288
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,700
you realize they're mostly good people

289
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,470
Just like yokai

290
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,670
so I started laughing a lot more.

291
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,080
I started questioning

292
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,080
if he really was so clumsy.

293
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,480
And he definitely is clumsy, but...
you know...

294
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,450
I started getting my hands dirty

295
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,760
and I wanted to become a filthy
but cool

296
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,760
type of comedian.

297
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,660
He's here! Damn it!

298
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,330
This is Documental

299
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,470
He's huge!

300
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,940
Good morning

301
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,550
I guess you could call him a regular by now!

302
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,280
Are you getting used
to that door?

303
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,820
You should be too!

304
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,260
Hello, I'm Kendo Kobayashi.

305
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,630
This is my third time here.

306
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,090
It's here?

307
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,430
I've lost a lot, so I have no real right to be here.

308
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,770
My age!

309
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,240
—So this time...?
—I'm going for sure.

310
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,810
I'm going.

311
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,780
I just don't have the right.

312
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,710
I want the money.

313
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,250
Koba has been trying
with this show for a while.

314
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,380
He's kind of a team with Akiyama.

315
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,520
He does pretty filthy things
but he's not super filthy.

316
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,460
I think that's his strength.

317
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,530
But he can't win with that.

318
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,230
And I think Koba
believes so as well.

319
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,100
I just wanted to be relaxed.

320
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,470
I should have probably been more nervous.

321
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,370
I think it's weird, to be honest.

322
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,710
Why was I so relaxed,

323
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,580
with a pink dildo inside me?

324
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,790
We can stop right now.

325
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,920
The bastard with phimosis showed up too (EN: 5)

326
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,460
That doesn't matter.

327
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,960
That was a personal thing,

328
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,270
I was with a girl, and she said it.

329
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,030
This isn't about comedy, though.

330
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,470
I ended up doing it with
one of those TV girls that come and go...

331
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,640
That wasn't me but Jinnai, by the way. (EN: 6)

332
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,810
It wasn't me.

333
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,420
I'm counting on you.

334
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,890
This is too scary.

335
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,000
He has a travel bag and...

336
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,200
he's ready for anything I guess.

337
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,270
No way he's here!

338
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,970
That's enough.

339
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,480
This is getting fun.

340
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,450
He's a newcomer.

341
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,810
Where are you going?

342
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,650
I just brought some weapons.

343
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,650
I'm Nadal from the Korokoro Chikichiki Peppers.

344
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,490
This gets me the most nervous.
Damn it!

345
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,260
There it is!

346
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,400
I think that Nadal has
a pretty good defense.

347
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,610
I don't really know what
makes Nadal laugh.

348
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,740
I get the impression that he's
kind of a psychopath.

349
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,850
So he can act like one if he wants to.

350
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,520
I kinda feel that

351
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,090
it would be nice to see him face off
with Zakoshi someday.

352
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,860
I'm happy as a comedian, yeah.

353
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,190
Right now, whenever I'm on TV,

354
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,430
I usually get pranked,

355
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,830
or bullied a lot.

356
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,330
But you know?

357
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,270
I guess I can try something different here,

358
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,970
and do my best.

359
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,310
I don't think
I have much pressure on me.

360
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,380
But I want Matsumoto-san
to think that I'm funny.

361
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,360
That's a huge amount of baggage.

362
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,920
But I'm sure that you'll be laughing
in just two minutes.

363
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,230
Please do that! I've come here to learn.

364
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,440
Don't tell me...

365
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,140
He's tall!

366
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,510
No way!

367
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,610
There he is!

368
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,840
Again?!

369
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,380
They're also shocked he's here again.

370
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,850
You got ten million already, right?

371
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,680
No, no, I don't have that anymore!

372
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,890
Hey, I'm Cookie from Yaseibakudan.

373
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,420
I don't wanna, I don't wanna.

374
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,390
Anyways, nice to meet you.

375
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,490
Good morning
This is for you.

376
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,260
There's the red letter.

377
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,400
This is Cookie's fourth time.

378
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,600
Is this some sort of
champion round?

379
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,940
Give me a call when you do one,
no more regular ones.

380
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,010
You did one?

381
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,980
Ten million!

382
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,020
Sometimes I watch Cookie on amazon

383
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,620
But sometimes even I can't watch.

384
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,360
I can't watch him drink sock sweat.

385
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,600
He's pretty... reckless.

386
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,530
That's enough already!

387
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,540
You can't run away and win.

388
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,410
I think either Zakoshi or I

389
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,410
will become Documental's emperor.

390
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,990
That's why I have to win this time,

391
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,560
and get a little nasty

392
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,690
with Mister Documental.

393
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,300
Who's the only one left?

394
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,070
This is enough!

395
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,840
It's no small fry.

396
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
There he is!

397
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,710
He's too quick!

398
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,720
That's enough!

399
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,490
Why are you like that already?!

400
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,990
He's acting already!

401
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,190
I'm Jimmy Onishi!

402
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,830
I'm going to win

403
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,970
no matter what today!

404
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,030
Excuse me!

405
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,140
Good job today.

406
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,140
This is for you.

407
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,400
There it is...

408
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,440
There it is.

409
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,180
This guy's not going to win.

410
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,020
But I want to see how far he goes.

411
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,920
This isn't just for laughs.

412
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,650
I have to put pressure on everyone from the get go.

413
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,860
What's up with your eye?

414
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,060
I don't really get his lead ups.

415
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,230
He's prepared a lot of things.

416
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,610
He looks like he'd bring dynamite with him,
but not a lighter

417
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,910
I have to give it my all, or else...

418
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,950
It's gonna be bad.

419
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,950
I trained for a full week
with my manager.

420
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,420
I got good laughter at first,

421
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,360
but I ran out of ideas along the way.

422
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,130
That's how I became Jimmy-san.

423
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,860
I'm always serious, but this time

424
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,870
I'm several times more serious.

425
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,540
I have to win this.

426
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,810
Ah, sorry

427
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,160
Why are you dressed like that?

428
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,140
Did you quit comedy
and become an escort?

429
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,300
You said that.

430
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,540
No, they told me I couldn't.

431
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,670
Who?

432
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,880
The company told me I couldn't.

433
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
Told you to respect yourself?

434
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,510
They told me I couldn't, yeah.

435
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,260
Good morning.

436
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,760
Hey!

437
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,370
We have a good cast

438
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,840
Is this a good cast?

439
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,540
I changed the color of my hair.

440
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,180
It looks really good.

441
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,040
Really? Thanks.

442
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,410
It's dull.

443
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,110
Pretty dull.

444
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,450
He's a first timer.

445
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,650
And well... the regulars, or veterans would be

446
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,560
about half the room.

447
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,390
Koumoto hasn't been here, somehow.

448
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,890
I haven't, yeah.

449
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,960
My first time out of eight.

450
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,560
I remember Nadal doing pretty well...

451
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,800
Stop it, I haven't been here.

452
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,130
You haven't?
I haven't.

453
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,570
I really thought you had been here once...

454
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,370
I haven't! For real!

455
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,140
Ah, and then there's Ina-chan.

456
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,680
This is serious!

457
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,910
You're laughing.

458
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,180
You're laughing just looking at him.

459
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,450
It's like it's your first time.

460
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,950
And you have time, right Kubota?

461
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,860
Yeah, I'm free right now.
Why?

462
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,720
I said...

463
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,390
Something that shook the country
to a woman.

464
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,960
You're an idiot.

465
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,770
And so I'm here.

466
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,870
I don't even know how much time I have left.

467
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,500
A lot happened, huh?

468
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,170
Are you sorry?

469
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,780
I'll repent, come back to life, and participate here again.

470
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,920
Feel free to get nasty here, though. It's fine.

471
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,390
So uh... you all brought it?

472
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,690
We can gather it, and

473
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,830
This is a big competition.

474
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:56,900
It's huge! Just look at how much
money we have right here.

475
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,700
Everything okay? I trust you all!

476
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,510
So this is almost ten million,

477
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,210
but right now, we only have 9 million.

478
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:16,190
That's why every single time, I do this.

479
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,090
Really, every time.

480
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,620
I have to use this envelope
as soon as possible,

481
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,890
we don't know
when it'll be over

482
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,030
Yoshimoto's going to be over?

483
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,600
It's going to disappear?

484
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,860
No, no, it's not.

485
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,870
Thanks to your effort,
it's not going anywhere.

486
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:38,110
And so this becomes this.

487
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,820
And now, this one
goes here, right? Right here.

488
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,450
And that's how it is.

489
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,250
We also have the rules,

490
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,360
which I think should
be fine, really.

491
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,360
But this time,
they're a little special.

492
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,660
We have a new stage,
a different room

493
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,700
where you can do what you want.

494
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,370
I think it can
be pretty useful.

495
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:09,710
So first we have yellow, then orange.

496
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,310
And finally the red.

497
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,910
You can get it directly, if it's too obvious.

498
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,150
It can happen.

499
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,280
Got it?

500
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,020
Okay.

501
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,590
You can try to stop it.

502
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,090
Huh? What?

503
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,590
You can try to stop it.

504
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,160
That's enough of that!

505
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,100
Seems like all of you have a lot of baggage today!

506
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,670
That's good, I think it shows spirit!

507
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,110
And we have some toys
around here as well.

508
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,580
You can use them
or not, whatever.

509
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,050
To take a look
make sure you do.

510
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,520
—Okay, Jimmy-chan?
—All okay!

511
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,250
We're the same age, so I'm counting on you!

512
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,690
Are you the only one

513
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,590
without anything?

514
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,260
That's what's unnerving!

515
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,560
I'm getting nervous!

516
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,700
What's going on, man?

517
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,340
So we can't just
target Jimmy-san, then.

518
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,340
Sorry, but I'm
not laughing at all today.

519
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,850
Are you actually sick or something?

520
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,080
Is it contagious?

521
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,880
It's onset is at dawn!

522
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,750
Show us your eye!

523
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,520
Do it right now.

524
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,690
We want to see!

525
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,860
—You sure?
—It's the best option.

526
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,490
But I'll lose a chance!

527
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,360
Maybe two.

528
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,400
You're already two down.

529
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,840
Before we begin... it's nothing special.

530
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,640
Why did he take it off now?!

531
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,240
—You laughed!
—We haven't started yet.

532
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,910
Why did you take it off?

533
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,320
Everyone told me to do it!

534
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,380
Documental start!!

535
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,660
You laughed though!

536
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,860
When you chat with Matsuhito

537
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,800
at this distance,
do you get nervous?

538
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,730
Ma-Matsuhito?

539
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,100
Matsuhito?

540
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah, Matsuhito!

541
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,970
No one calls you Matsuhito, though.

542
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,470
Ma-chan is better!

543
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,310
Has anyone called you Matsuhito?

544
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,720
If you were still a novice
and we met somewhere

545
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,280
would you ask for a handshake?

546
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,780
Yeah, I would've.

547
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,020
Yeah, me too.

548
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,820
But now I'm used to it.

549
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,760
That doesn't matter!

550
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,390
Startled me.

551
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,900
Why did you shout?

552
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,970
Why did you call us four here?

553
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,740
Just tell us what's going on!

554
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,980
This is Documentary of Documental.

555
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,010
So I asked you all
to come here.

556
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,450
We have to talk.

557
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,820
You know the newest Documental

558
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,390
has been delayed, right?

559
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,460
Yeah, kind of.

560
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,060
I thought it was
about time it released.

561
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,160
Yeah, yeah.

562
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,200
And that's what
Matsuhito said as well.

563
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,140
Stop it with the Matsuhito thing!

564
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,000
And he does it like...

565
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,810
Keep it up for a couple days

566
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,580
Well you see, we had
a bit of trouble.

567
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,880
Trouble?

568
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,050
That's confusing, right?
I think it is, so...

569
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,420
So I want you to
take a look at this.

570
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,460
Hey, hey, hey.

571
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,810
Huh?!

572
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,150
Huh?

573
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,090
Why?

574
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,660
What's going on?

575
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,190
—No way!
—I guess that's that!

576
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,260
That's that, yeah.

577
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,960
Vulgar?

578
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,170
Whoa!

579
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,110
They called him out directly!

580
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,340
This is serious.

581
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,180
It's family-friendly?

582
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,420
Right, right.

583
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,590
We're sabotaging family reunions.

584
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,450
Hey, Kubota...

585
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,140
Wait, is this real?

586
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,510
They called you out.

587
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,980
You're blacklisted for sure!

588
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,280
It's like a
murder report!

589
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,190
What's going on? Why?

590
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,590
It was vulgar!

591
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,990
Too vulgar!

592
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,030
That's not just this time, though!

593
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,530
It's a weird translation, right?
It's kind of backwards!

594
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,230
Aren't they saying
that it was good?

595
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,870
For now, yeah.

596
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,070
Maybe it's a typo?

597
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,610
—So they're angry?
—A little!

598
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:53,150
Originally, next year was already

599
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:58,750
rearing up to be great content
for Amazon.

600
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,120
But it's all Kubota's fault.

601
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,430
What? I'm reported everywhere now?

602
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,290
What should I do?

603
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,130
To be honest
we were also pretty shocked.

604
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,640
Well, we had pissing too, yeah.

605
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,410
So those bits were
family-friendly after all?

606
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,470
Until now, yeah.

607
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,510
Maybe it was worse than pissing!

608
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,840
Toro Salmon's Kubota is
going to become a slur now!

609
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,950
So why had everything
been fine until now?

610
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,290
We didn't really remember either

611
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,750
and we had our doubts...

612
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,220
So today we wanted to

613
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,860
see what went wrong with you guys.

614
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,000
We're settling this?

615
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,230
We're debating like this.

616
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,940
Yoshimoto is debating Amazon

617
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,140
on what to do to get it online.

618
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,880
But they don't
have much hope.

619
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,010
I want it to go live!

620
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,280
It would suck if it didn't.

621
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,090
We thought that Amazon
would accept basically anything

622
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,990
Everything goes, right?

623
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,390
But it seems like
we went too far.

624
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,960
We went all the
way with this.

625
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,830
So now we know that
there really was a limit!

626
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,340
Why can't they tell us?

627
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,240
So let's see where the line is.

628
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,880
I think it might
have been that thing...

629
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,110
Well, I want to check
and see in real time what went wrong.

630
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,420
So let's have a look.

631
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,350
Documental start!

632
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,220
You laughed!

633
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,720
But before it started.

634
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,630
Let's get our bags.

635
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,230
What's up with your eye?

636
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,500
This?

637
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,970
The eye that's to your left?

638
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,040
No, it's to our right.

639
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,940
It's to our right.

640
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,110
—To your right?
—Yeah.

641
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,210
Your left eye
is to our right.

642
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,220
Touch it.
Touch your own eye.

643
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,520
Huh? What?

644
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,050
Huh? What was that?

645
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,390
Why don't you touch
where it's red?

646
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,560
Here?

647
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,420
(No way!)

648
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,060
Was that you?

649
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,930
You have-You have to be silent!

650
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,730
Be silent?

651
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,700
Is that a
"be silent" sampler?

652
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,510
Don't push me!

653
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,710
Why?

654
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,710
What was that sound?
Who was that?

655
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,880
That was Tamuken-san, right?

656
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,520
Icchan, that's not funny.

657
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,160
What's wrong?

658
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,970
Um... just phlegm.

659
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,440
You have some?

660
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,110
Do you have some allergies?

661
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,610
Huh? It's coming back?

662
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,080
No, I think
it has to be that thing.

663
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,460
That's kinda funny.

664
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,890
It's going smoothly.

665
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,260
It's good,
same as always.

666
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,130
See? It's the same.

667
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,010
There's no punchline, though.

668
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,110
Back to the phlegm?

669
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,950
What was that?

670
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,180
Why do you always wear
a tank top to Documental?

671
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,150
Well, it's just
to regulate my temperature.

672
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,490
This, this!

673
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,260
You know this, you guys?

674
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,630
Matches?

675
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,090
You know how to stick them together?

676
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,600
Huh?

677
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,900
You go like this,
and stick them...

678
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,170
—No idea.
—You don't know?

679
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,070
You stick them like this.

680
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Don't grab that.

681
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,500
It's hot!!

682
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,840
Eh? Why?!

683
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,070
Yeah...

684
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,640
I wanted to see them stick together.

685
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,410
What's going on?

686
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,980
What kind of matches are these?

687
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,550
Read this.

688
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,280
Those matches are huge.

689
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,680
Positive...

690
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,290
Positive matches?

691
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,920
I'll do your reading.

692
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,730
A positive and simple heart.

693
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,560
You gonna stay as Ikko?

694
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,600
What do you mean?

695
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,530
A regretful heart.

696
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,100
—A thankful-
—Admiring...

697
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,840
admiring heart.

698
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,470
They don't know shit.

699
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,780
A responsible heart.

700
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,980
He can't read properly, man.

701
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,810
What do you mean?

702
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:57,750
A loser's heart. A helpful heart, thankful words.

703
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,150
He's getting it all?

704
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,720
For real?

705
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,990
Watch out, man!

706
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,690
They won't stick!
They're not sticking!

707
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,090
Look, everyone!

708
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,260
I couldn't do it.

709
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,300
Why?

710
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,800
We have to put out the fire.

711
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,570
Watch out.

712
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,340
Let's put it out. Wait, I'll do it.

713
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,410
Watch out! Put out the fire!

714
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,780
Ready? I'll do it
let's put it out!

715
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,220
Extinguish!

716
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,550
Extinguish!

717
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,260
Extinguish!

718
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,220
Nothing's sticking anywhere.

719
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,200
Hey, stop it.
Can you stop it?

720
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,770
It won't come out from the mouth.

721
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,070
You're soaking wet, besides.

722
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,440
Stop it.

723
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,910
Just for a little while.

724
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,210
It's stopped, it's stopped.

725
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,740
Stop it! Stop it! Just a little!

726
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,840
I stopped, I stopped!

727
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,010
Okay!

728
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,450
There's no more fire, it's fine.

729
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,250
Stop, stop! Stop it!

730
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,850
It's leaking everywhere.

731
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,490
Stop it~ Man~!

732
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,730
Did you put it out?

733
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,660
It got hot, but yeah.

734
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,570
Looks like I pissed my pants.

735
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,470
You can't piss in that direction.

736
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,800
Please stop when I tell you.

737
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,670
Now I look
like I pissed myself.

738
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,910
Hey man, you think you could

739
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,410
put some tuna inside your foreskin?

740
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,680
No, I don't wanna.

741
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,150
You don't?

742
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,250
Do it man!
He's older than you!

743
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,690
If he tells you to put tuna

744
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,260
on your dick,
you fucking do it.

745
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,590
Okay, but...

746
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,290
You're a Yoshimoto, right?
You do it if he says so.

747
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:48,030
Stop it, stop it.

748
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,370
You have to do it right away.

749
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,640
I've hurt people, you know?

750
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,780
I'm sorry.

751
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
You need help?

752
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,620
Ah, kind of.

753
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,330
Is this it?

754
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,630
Isn't this it?

755
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,960
This is it, right?

756
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,570
Jimmy-san, the time.

757
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,300
What time is it right now?

758
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,670
What?

759
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,170
I mean, look.

760
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,840
2 hours 45 minutes.

761
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,680
It has to be this.

762
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,090
This is serious.

763
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,760
In just a second.

764
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,500
Everyone reacted like that.

765
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,170
2 hours 46 minutes.

766
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,520
This is Sato-san...

767
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,520
This sucks!

768
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,990
That one has
no mosaic at all!

769
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,260
You're really fucking with me, man.

770
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,700
What were you thinking
showing that on air?!

771
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,600
What did you show?

772
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,800
What did you show?!

773
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,400
Come on, man

774
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,610
Scold him, Matsumoto-san!

775
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:41,740
This might be
more than a yellow.

776
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,880
I think this might be
close to a rule violation!

777
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,820
Let's verify at once.

778
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,450
I'll fully admit that
I laughed, of course.

779
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,190
But punish Kubota

780
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,520
I see, I see

781
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,320
Because there's some things
we can't do, right?

782
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,860
Did he show you from his phone?

783
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,030
It's a video...

784
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,900
Are you stupid?

785
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,400
Why do you have that?
You use that?

786
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,600
But there's some females later.

787
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,640
What good would some
female porn do?

788
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,140
Actually, I think female
porn would be even worse.

789
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,440
I'm sorry

790
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:18,310
I'm glad Coo-chan laughed
this early on!

791
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,480
It was nervous laughter

792
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,190
This is Sato-san...

793
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,530
We're in a pretty tight spot!

794
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,530
At first I thought
orange was good enough,

795
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,830
But Coo-chan, you get a yellow!

796
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,100
Yeah, I get it. Thank you

797
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,440
He was just like a
bystander watching.

798
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,540
But there's that!

799
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,480
Let him see

800
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,520
Look at the time, man...

801
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,920
You're both the same!

802
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:58,990
Why're you mad at me?!

803
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,320
This is just like playing concentration!

804
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,630
One pair!

805
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:18,710
Now, I won't say it's
classy or anything

806
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,780
We've had stuff like that before

807
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,610
We have, yeah.

808
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,880
We can edit something like this
with a mosaic and stuff.

809
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,450
Looking at it
I'd say this part is safe.

810
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,660
Of course, objectively speaking
we're insane

811
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,520
Yeah, definitely.

812
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,960
But in the world of Documental...

813
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,760
A fictional land...

814
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:46,330
In that world, yeah...
I'd say it's safe.

815
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,440
Yeah, I don't think Amano-san minds this...

816
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,340
Which means,
that was fine, right?

817
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,010
If we crossed the line
then what bothered Amazon?

818
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,550
We don't see the problem so far.

819
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,220
I'm starting to get sad.

820
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,020
This was on about the same level
as Hirunandesu. (EN: 7)

821
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:04,650
Idiot!

822
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,890
So this is Nanchan standards?

823
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,020
Nanchan wouldn't be able to handle this!

824
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,790
Hey man, that's rude!

825
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,030
No, no, no

826
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:15,200
No matter how you slice it,
a "boke" doesn't set standards.

827
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,760
Because it doesn't suit him, right?

828
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,000
Someone could misunderstand you

829
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:19,370
Sorry, sorry

830
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:21,000
Sorry for doing that.
