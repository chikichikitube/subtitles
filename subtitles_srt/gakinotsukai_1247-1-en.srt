In the heart of a Top-class residential area

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:30,240
If you walk around Tokyo you will meet celebrities

49
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:30,240
It's time to investigate if that's true!

50
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,970
When I say "Jiyugaoka", What do you think of Tanaka?

51
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,640

Yea, I get that but

61
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,390
What's funny about it?

62
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,690
It's something a girl would wear

63
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,690
It's amazing. Seriously Tanaka

64
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,690
It's like a mini-skirt

00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:10,180
Search Rules

66
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:10,180
They can't stop the walk until they meet a Celebrity

67
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:10,180
If they can't say their name it's    NOT CLEAR

68
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,180
If they get the no good from the producers   NOT CLEAR

69
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,580
There is no time limit!

70
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,850
Now, The curtain for the Challenge rises!

71
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,520

Madame-like feeling

73
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,350
Pretty huh?

74
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,050
There's no one here that doesn't stand out you know..

75
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,190
There's no one here with rice on their sleeve

76
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,400
The Symbol of Jiyugaoka procceding through the Green Road

77
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,400
Jiyugaoka

78
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,900
I want to find someone already

79
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,800
Seem's like Model's come through here

80
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,540
It seem's like there's Clothes and Accessory Shop's this way

81
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,540
Oh, That's what it is

82
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,910
Why did you buy these clothes?

83
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,440
What's so weird about it?

84
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,040
These part and the sleeve's

85
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,080
It doesn't reach

86
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,380
Seriously?

87
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,120
Really?

88
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,020
Honestly?

89
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,790
Your

90
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,790
unfashionable

91
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,590
WHAT!?

92
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,320
What do you mean!?

93
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,220
What does he mean?

94
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,660
Please, Wait a second

95
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,560
Imagine if a Gaki no Tsukai Regular was called Unfashionable!

96
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,030
Right now...

97
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,740
Do you think there could be

98
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,740
people getting a hair cut?

99
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,140
In Jiyugaoka huh?

100
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,300
Yama-san, Do you mind checking?

101
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,710
A haircut huh?

102
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
Alright I'll go!!

103
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,140
There's probably someone in there

104
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,380
It'll be amazing if we find one here!

105
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,480
The way he went up the stair's

106
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,480
was really light huh?

107
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,780
Amazing right?

108
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,150
Yamazaki has entered the hair salon

109
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,720
I'm looking for celebrities but

110
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,760
There's not one having a haircut right now is there?

111
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Anything would be good

112
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,730
What if we run into a 5 celebrity group?

113
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,070
A group like Ayaman JAPAN would be good huh?

114
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,070
You have to say their
names though

115
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,070
What are their name's again...

116
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,100
5 min's later

117
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,100
Huh, This is unexpected

118
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,740
It's been a while huh

119
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,350
Isn't it good if its been a while?

120
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,540
Yea, I think so

121
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,010
It seem's like he found someone huh

122
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,350
Seriously

123
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,350
Wait, we have to try and call the Producer's as well

124
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,220
HUH!?

125
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,820
Wait wait, Is someone there?

126
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,490
Is it over!?

127
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,690
Is this the end already!?

128
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,320
This quickly?

129
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:05,320
Yea, but this is normally difficult

130
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,930
If nothing was there He would of be coming back already

131
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,390
That's right

In the Hair Salon

139
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,650
The rest of them are waiting on Housei who's in the Salon

140
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,950
Why is he taking this long

141
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,950
If he's getting a frizzly perm

142
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,950
I'll Laugh

143
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,490
And Then Finally....

144
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,690
No way

145
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,190
No one is there

146
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,190
No one is there BUT

147
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,060
Alright, Let's go

148
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,560
Wait a minute!

149
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,600
No one is there but?

150
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,400
No one is there BUT

151
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,410
"A lot come"

152
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,010
Men and Women

153
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,680
Celebrities come a lot

154
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,840
Ah, So That's it

155
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,680
Wrong time huh

156
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,210
It's a timing problem huh?

157
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,650
Search Time 14 mins

158
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,780
It's a timing problem

159
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,650
Will they be able to meet a celebrity? Only God knows

160
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,420
I don't know...

161
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,990
Strange huh...

162
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,690
|I wonder if Anmika is here

163
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,930
Said they shop at Jiyugaoka

164
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,930
Oh, is that so?

165
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,930
But do you know their names?

166
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,840
Definitely not

167
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,840
But It seem's like Jiyugaoka has things like General Stores

168
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,840
Yea your right

169
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,140
But Here...

170
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,210
There's not that many people here huh?

171
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,210
Because of that

172
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,550
It's easier for celebrities to come through the crowd

173
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:45,190
Headed to the North Entrance Shopping Area

174
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,730
There's no street that a car can't go through huh..

175
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,030
When I met Iyo Matsumoto, It was like that as well

176
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,330
How long has it been since then?

177
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,330
Hmm.. It's still been

178
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,330
32...

179
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,510
Because im 40~♪ right?

180
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,510
That was a long time ago

181
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,870
About 15 years ago

182
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,050
Iyo is 57!!?

183
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,820
According to the Staff's information

184
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,820
Before the walk started

185
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,950
Masakiyo Maezono was here

186
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,650
Seriously?

187
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,790
So it's that sort of place huh

188
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,790
A place where Maezono would be..

189
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,360
Maezono is good huh...

190
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,890
Eh, Where are we going

191
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:31,400
Arriving at the Shopping Area

192
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,900
It's been 30 min's since the start

193
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,400
They arrive at a shopping area of General Stores and Boutiques

194
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,540
Isn't it strange

195
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,810
Search Time 30 Min's

196
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,770
This look's like a place celebrities would go

197
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,810
Do Celebrities come here?

198
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,810
No one's there

199
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,380
Yes they do

200
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,150
They come?

201
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,050
Who come's here?

202
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,210
Nene Ohtsuka

203
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,020
Didn't I say it was a sure thing!!

204
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,020
Nehe Ohtsuka is good huh...

205
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:55,290
This street

206
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,130
The smell?

207
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,290
smell's amazing

208
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,290
Ah, It's good huh

209
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,000
Expectation's rise from the eyewitness report

210
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,000
The 5 get excited knowing that someone they know was spotted

211
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,740
There's not that many people Yama-chan

212
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,740
Your sure we can meet someone at this place?

213
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,940
Probably not

214
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,010
Didn't you say to go this way?

215
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,810
Supposing If it's a miracle

216
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,480
Amazing Sunglasses and

217
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,480
mask

218
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,480
Really?

219
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,490
She seemed full of Rikaco but I was wrong

220
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,260
I dont think she would ride a bike

221
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,330
Searching Time: 52 Min's

222
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,330
Detemined, The walk continues

223
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,360
There's no way they would come to pray at a Shrine

224
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,100
Were there Celebrities in there?

225
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,100
None

226
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,100
None huh?

227
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
No one

228
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,410
There's absolutely No one

229
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,380
He completely

230
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,380
lost all motiviation

231
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,110
What?

232
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,480
This is bad huh

233
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,480
It's something like

234
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,420
The atmosphere

235
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,420
is completely gone

236
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,420
Seem's that way huh

237
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,390
Time continues to pass

238
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,420
With the circumstances turning bad

239
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,390
The 5 are running out of reluctance

240
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:06,260
Over there, There's shops like

241
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,260
Uniqlo and Gindaco

242
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,260
Ah, I wanna eat at Gindaco

243
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,970
Wanna go eat at Gindaco?

244
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,370
Somewhere like Gindaco

245
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,570
I don't think Celebrities would eat there

246
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,540
Can I drink Hot Whiskey with my Gindaco?

247
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,650
Headed toward's Gindaco Peacock Shop

248
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,650
With that, They head towards the Gindaco Peacock Shop

249
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,050
Kobe Croquette

250
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,050
seem's delicious

251
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,050
Buy!

252
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,050
Buy!

253
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,020
The surroundings are filled with delicious things

254
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,020
All around

255
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,030
Having a Meal at the Croquette Store

256
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,030
First before Gindaco, They go to the Croquette Store

257
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,100
Ready to eat?

258
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,400
Yes

259
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,570
At last, they go to Gindaco

260
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,700
Excuse me

261
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,970
One of these and

262
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,670
Negidaco as well

263
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,510
Delicious!

264
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
There's no celebrities?

265
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,180
They continue to search while waiting for their Takoyaki

266
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,250
Honestly, I'm getting excited if were going to find someone

267
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,560
*Because Endo is the youngest*

268
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,560
Can Endo look for them by himself?

269
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,560
If we can't find anyone

270
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,570
Wait, I don't understand

271
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:19,640
In the beginning

272
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,640
it was supposed to be Your Program

273
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:26,310
Originally there was a talk between Yoshimoto and Japan TV

274
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,310
"What program should we do with endo?"

275
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,410
At that time I was a shitty amateur

276
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,420
Takoyaki ready

277
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,420
Thank you very much

278
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,860
Your eating from here huh?

279
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,830
Gimmie one

280
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,900
Now that they have Takoyoaki

281
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,970
Headed Toward's the South Entrance again

282
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,970
Once again, They head towards the south entrance

283
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,180
Endo Still has

284
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,180
Crust from the Croquette stuck to him

285
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,010
So where are we going

286
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:12,090
OGO

287
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:12,090
Pteranodon Endo

288
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,750
At that time

289
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,050
I really wanted you

290
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,050
to say OGO

291
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,650
He won't ever say it

292
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,090
Your aiming to make it a popular phrase

293
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,090
You definitely have to use it everyday

294
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,760
Like what?

295
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,660
Is your zipper open?

296
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,660
OGO

297
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,700
Good, Good...

298
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,200
Can I speak frankly?

299
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,200
I hate OGO

300
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,800
Did someone drop their wallet?

301
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,800
OGO

302
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,940
They've arrived at the Green road for the second time today

303
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,380
Searching Time: 1hr 18 min's

304
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,450
Temporarily taking a break

305
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,180
The five enjoy some good Takoyaki

306
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,220
Spread the Mayonnaise equally already

307
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,490
I'm spreading it!

308
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,490
It's not a delicacy anymore

309
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,260
Your doing it completely wrong

310
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,260
This place is too upscale for this crudeness

311
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Ah, I thought that was Muji-san

312
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,200
Muji-san huh

313
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,570
Looked a lot like him

314
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,680
At the place we bought this earlier

315
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,540
They said that

316
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,680
Sekai no Owari Fukase came

317
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,910
Yea but you wouldn't have been able to say his name

318
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,080
Yea

319
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,920
(Celebrities) Will they come or not

320
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,090
Bang

321
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,290
Eat one already!!

322
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,290
Im looking

323
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,660
for Celebrities

324
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,930
Endo is your fly open?

325
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,930
OGO

326
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,930
No, My fly is good

327
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,440
Your voice on that OGO was tiny

328
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,710
What time is it?

329
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,710
OGO

330
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,810
I don't understand OGO

331
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,810
What do I do?

332
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,350
But your OGO  was interesting

333
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,280
When you checked your fly it was the worst but

334
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,280
This OGO  was good

335
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,750
Matsumoto

336
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,750
On your shirt

337
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,330
Takoyaki

338
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,330
flew from

339
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,330
Housei's mouth

340
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,100
OGO

341
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,000
When we did this in Daikanyamacho

342
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,900
I got bird shit on my hat~

343
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:11,580
Searching Time: 1hr 31min's

344
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,070
After taking a break, A fresh start

345
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,580
Once again they approach the fashion area

346
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,580
This is bad huh

347
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,580
Really bad

348
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,180
No sign's appearing

349
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,180
Now, There are no sign's of celebrities

350
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,190
Have you been on TV?

351
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,190
No I haven't

352
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,320
Have you welcomed any Celebrities?

353
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,660
Yesterday

354
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,660
It seem's there were some

355
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,870
The Search Continues

356
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,330
In order to break-down the situation

357
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,870
The Search Continues

358
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,970
Were already at the station huh?

359
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,540
This place isn't showing any sign's of celebrities huh

360
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,540
The Situation isn't changing

361
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,070
Searching Time: 1hr 52 min's

362
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,210
It's been 1 hour and 52 min's since the start

363
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,050
After Walking around, The green road once again

364
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,050
Look we came around in a circle

365
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,450
This is the main street huh?

366
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,380
Yes, The main street

367
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,420
I call it the Celebrity Street

368
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,660
I see

369
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,730
This is the Celebrity Street?

370
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,870
Celebrity Street

371
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,870
Yet There isn't a single Celebrity

372
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,770
To sum it up for everyone

373
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:15,010
This time

374
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,010
It is the end of the program

375
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,440
Until Next Week!!

376
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,440

377
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,850
Were ending the program like that huh?

378
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,520
Resuming the Search

379
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,280
Mustering all their willpower

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,520
The resume the search

381
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:33,290
Determined to Find a celebrity

382
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,620
They continue to search

383
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,290
In store's as well, They search every nook and cranny

384
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,490
No one

385
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,830
Searching Time: 1hr 52 min's

386
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,430
There's no one

387
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,230
Well, This is impossible

388
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,030
In front of the station there's people coming and going

389
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,030
You want to go there?

390
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,030
Yea

391
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,100
Gravure Idol groups and other's

392
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,140
Ah, I see

393
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,510
Actor's that go back and forth as well, Use the trains

394
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,570
Because there's a lot of cars

395
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,970
I see...

396
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,580
Jiyougaoka is probably filled with people like that

397
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Aiming for Celebrities that use the train for commuting

398
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,080
With this, They squeeze down on the Celebrities that commute from train's

399
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,990
Ambushing at the Ticket Gate

400
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,990
They play to Ambush them before the Ticket Gate

401
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,220
We've come to the station

402
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,550
Searching Time: 2hr 27 min's

403
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,990
How is it, Is anyone here?

404
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,330
How many are here?

405
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,290
None...

406
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,130
Squeeze out one!!

407
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,200
They'll begin to come out

408
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,500
It's gonna be a big haul

409
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,500
"A Big Haul"

410
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,370
They won't escape

411
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,370
Definitely!

412
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,370
They definetely won't escape!!

413
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,280
Believing in a Possibility

414
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,640
They believe in a small possibility

415
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,280
Determined, they continue to wait

416
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,480
In the group

417
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,650
The man who vote's to quit is....

418
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,650
There is one man who is cutting the mood

419
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,590
There's no one

420
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,590
Even at this place

421
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,790
Express Train at 39 Min's

422
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,790
The local at 41 min's

423
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,030
They'll come on the Express

424
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,030
They won't come

425
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,530
The people that come on the next express

426
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,530
will be Exposed!

427
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,530
Yea!

428
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,000
They're gonna be found out!

429
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,430
Were gonna expose them huh?

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,970
They won't come

431
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,030
Ah, The train's here

432
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,030
Alright!

433
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,440
It's gonna bring some fresh celebrities

434
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,910
The long awaited Express Train

435
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,910
The express train they placed their thought's on

436
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,880
Squinting their eye's

437
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,040
The result!?

438
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
They stare at the passengers!

439
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,920
No Celebrities Found

440
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,810
It's strange

441
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,180
No, It's not strange

442
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,850
The next one,

443
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,850
If there's no one on it, Let's Quit

444
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,290
Yea, But well...

445
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:16,830
I guess we have no choice but

446
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,830
to wait till the last train

447
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,590
No Way, No way, No way

448
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,830
Honestly,

449
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,230
After the next train

450
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,230
We quit

451
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,700
The next Train is also empty as well

452
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,400
Now what?

453
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,840
Can we go back for the last time to the "Celebrity Street"?

454
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,280
I think we should go to the Train "Rotary"

455
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,280
If we do that, Can we wait for the Express at 7:49?

456
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,050
I think we should go to the Rotary

457
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
I said the Rotary is no good!

458
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,050
But the Express at 7:49

459
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,460
At the rotary

460
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,460
Can we wait for the Express?

461
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,460
The rotary is no good!

462
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,330
Let's wait for the Express at the Rotary

463
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,330
Let's try it once

464
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,390
Because there's another exit from the station right?

465
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,390
Alright let's try it once

466
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,390
Let's wait for the Express at the Rotary

467
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:59,870
Going to the Rotary at the North Entrance

468
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:06,510
Cocorico

469
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:06,510
Downtown and Housei

470
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:06,510
Separate and Search

471
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,510
With this, Cocorico and Downtown and Housei split again

472
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,510
Yea but you know..

473
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:13,680
Searching Time: 2hr 50 min's

474
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,680
I guess we have no other option but to trust the atmosphere

475
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,320
Meanwhile, Downtown and Housei

476
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,860
Is that person

477
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,860
a celebrity?

478
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,860
Which one?

479
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,160
The woman in the white

480
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,800
Excuse me, Are you a celebrity?

481
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,340
Is that person

482
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,340
a celebrity?

483
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,340
Which one?

484
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,510
The woman in the white

485
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,650
This one?

486
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,650
Yea

487
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,290
Excuse me, Are you a celebrity?

488
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,490
I'm trying to be

489
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,490
Oh, Your trying to be?

490
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,960
Can you just come over here for a bit?

491
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,800
We found one!

492
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,800
Eh?

493
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,430
They're Celebrities

494
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,430
Seriously?

495
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,640
I'm only trying to be...

496
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,370
She's trying to be

497
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,640
Ah!

498
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,140
So that's it!

499
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,710
This is OK right?

500
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,710
It's not OK

501
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,710
It's not OK?

502
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,620
Please work hard at it!

503
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,980
Sorry about the inconvenience, Good Luck!

504
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,020
Thank you!

505
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,090
Understand

506
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,090
Something

507
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,490
Hopefully one day we can perform together!

508
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:35,300
They must find a Celebrity Otherwise

509
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,560
If all 5 of them don't find a celebrity they know

510
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,300
The Walk wont end

511
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,300
The walk wont end!

512
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,800
What the hell are Cocorico doing?

513
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,800
Their Job's!!

514
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,710
Enough Already!

515
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,580
Searching Time: 3hr 04 min's

516
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,580
3 hour's have already passed since the start

517
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,540
I told you it was impossible

518
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,350
In 3 minute's an Express Train come's one time

519
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,350
The Railway Schedule was detailed

520
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,350
We understood Jiyugaoka's Train's

521
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,350
I see

522
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,190
Don't you understand? This atmosphere

523
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,360
On Ougon Densetsu

524
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,360
Ougon Densetsu is Cocorico`s show

525
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,360
We only do these kind of thing`s

526
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,100
From now on

527
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,100
we'll do this program

528
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,570
Alright I know

529
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,370
Let's Try going back to the "Celebrity Street"

530
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,110
Over there you said there was no one so we came here

531
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,780
Then we went to the station and no one was there

532
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,420
The station was useless so we went to the rotary

533
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,690
Ahh, It's difficult

534
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,320
Then Now....

535
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,390
And now he want's to go back to the Celebrity Street

536
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,890
YOUR NOISY!!

537
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:46,300
Headed toward's the shopping mall Fullel Uizu in Jiyugaoka

538
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,370
Come on let's shoot the ending

539
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,370
Downstair's!!

540
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,680
Up!

541
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,640
Upstairs huh

542
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Downstairs

543
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,380
It seem's like

544
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,380
people are going up huh

545
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,180
Yea

546
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,920
Even though it's the second floor there's still people

547
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:07,120
Continuing to search for Celebrities

548
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,050
Hamada's Spirit is running out

549
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,120
The Search within the store continues

550
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,530
And then!

551
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,430
Now what?

552
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,530
Of course until the end

553
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,540
The rule until we find one

554
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,470
I as well

555
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,470
want to push through and find someone

556
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,470
And you Yamazaki?

557
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,740
Well, I sorta...

558
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,410
Say it clearly!

559
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,410
It's impossible

560
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,750
I want you to lend me that

561
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,690
There's no other option but to decide by majority

562
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,630
The people that say it's impossible?

563
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,230
Yes!

564
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,360
And you Cocorico?

565
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,870
Of course we want to continue!

566
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:57,310
I

567
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,310
want to try going to the Rotary

568
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,870
