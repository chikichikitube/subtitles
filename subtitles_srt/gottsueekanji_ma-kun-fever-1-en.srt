00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,950
Fever

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,150
Next please.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,220
Mah-kun, you have to tell doctor. OK?

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,120
WHAT'S WITH YOU!?

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,060
Wait outside!

7
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,920
NO!

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,400
Excuse us, Doctor.

9
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,900
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,970
Hey!

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,240
Tell him!

12
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello.

13
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,110
What's the matter?

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,540
Well, Doctor. He's been coughing since last night.

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,820
Mah-kun, tell him. He won't understand
unless you tell him!

16
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,550
You're irritating.

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,150
What's with you? Tell him!

18
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,090
My throat is hurting.

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,090
He's been coughing with a sputum.

20
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,230
Excuse me.

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,030
Could your hold up your top?

22
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,230
What are you doing?

23
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,500
Why are you doing it?

24
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,430
Front?

25
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,040
Yes, front.

26
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,580
Mah-kun...

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,910
Don't touch me!

28
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,780
What's with you...

29
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,210
Why are you touching your son's nipple?

30
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,720
Your my son!

31
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,320
Shut up.

32
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,920
Don't slap me!

33
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,960
Turn this way...

34
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,990
It doesn't matter!

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,840
How is it, Doctor.

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,170
Does he have a fever?

37
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,670
Um fever...

38
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,970
Stop it!

39
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,010
I can't tell.

40
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,910
You're too noisy. Stay outside.

41
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,210
I have to be here.

42
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,780
Well, this is a cold.

43
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,920
Is that so? Doctor, I shouldn't allow
him to smoke cigarettes, right?

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,720
Not when he has a cold.

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,760
This kid smokes even if he's under age.

46
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,090
Shut up.

47
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,090
Mild Seven FX.

48
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,600
Stop it.

49
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,660
What's with you?

50
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,530
Too noisy.

51
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,830
You should refrain from smoking.

52
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,830
See? Doctor is telling you not to.

53
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,440
Also at night, he always takes off his
underwear and is doing something.

54
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,910
He scares me.

55
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,410
He scares me. I don't understand.

56
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,040
Parenting.

57
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,880
Shut up!

58
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,580
It's just his youth. It has nothing to do with cold.

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,580
Really?

60
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,180
It's good to hear, huh? Mah-kun.

61
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,190
Shut up!

62
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,320
I'm going to give him a shot.

63
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,050
Are you?

64
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,460
On his butt.

65
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,690
That sounds good, Doctor.

66
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,420
It'll be fine.

67
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,730
Listen to Doctor!

68
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,860
You don't have to be here, right?

69
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,060
I should right, Doctor?

70
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,500
Go outside!

71
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I will when it's done!

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,550
You're pulling it down too much!

73
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,080
Mah-kun, you got poop stains,

74
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,820
No way, stupid!

75
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,960
Mah-kun has poop stains.

76
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,490
Here's a red spot.

77
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,630
Let me sanitize.

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Mrs, please do not touch.

79
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,570
Oh, Mah-kun.

80
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,870
Mah-kun, it's dried out.

81
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,110
It doesn't matter!

82
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,710
I'll sanitize, don't touch.

83
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,710
Oh, it looks great.

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,410
Irritating, really.

85
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,290
No!

86
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,820
Be quiet!

87
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,260
Ouch!

88
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,990
Ouch!

89
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,690
It's done. Massage it well.

90
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,060
That's fine. i'll do it.

91
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,060
No, you can't!

92
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,070
I'll do it!

93
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,330
Stop it! Don't touch me!

94
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,300
Is that so? Oh, I'm sorry.

95
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,710
It has to be done.

96
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,070
That's fine. You've done it.

97
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,070
Let me massage you.

98
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,980
Why?

99
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,210
Doctor, there's an urgent patient!

100
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,950
We're shot of type A blood.

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,020
Oh! Mah-kun is type A!

102
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,750
Right?

103
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,120
Mah-kun, you should give a transfusion!

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,890
Why me?

105
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,320
Let's go, doctor.

106
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,990
Why me? Stupid...OUCH!

107
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,460
Mah-kun!
