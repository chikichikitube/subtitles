1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:16:03,680
ShinobiSubs

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,680
(Director Nishida is on holiday)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,290
Our next letter is from a resident in Tokyo, a 52 year old male

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,560
The other day my wife goes to me, look at this~! Isn't it great?

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,990
It was a ceramic milk pot she had bought

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:25,360
On closer inspection, there was another ceramic pot inside the pot that was perfectly wedged inside and won't come out

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,820
Even though I used all my might, I was unable to remove the pot

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,880
It's like its cursed and won't come out!

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,560
Won't the wonderful detectives please help assist me in separating these?

10
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,310
If at all possible please don't send Detective Tamura Kenji

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,910
What the...

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,250
There are people who make requests like that?!

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,790
The client just doesn't like you

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,160
-Well you went to investigate it right?

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,560
We went to find out, but were we able to safely remove it?

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,340
Please watch and find out!

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,420
So here we have the problem in question from our client

18
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,340
As you can see it's quite the fit

19
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,280
It certainly is...

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,960
Totally in there tight

21
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,280
I thought it would move but...

22
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,480
It's perfectly snug in there such a tight fit

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,710
As you look at this on camera it's hard to tell so...

24
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,880
We have made a digital composition of it

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
An accurate recreation

26
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,910
This is the cross section of contents

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,510
It's easy to understand right?

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,540
This has made it set in place

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,250
And the handles are jarred so that...

30
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,860
They are keeping it fixed

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,020
This is the situation

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,020
And today's client is?

33
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,960
-He's here

34
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,960
The client arrives

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,540
-Thank you for helping

36
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,850
This is a regular off shoot

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Wait, wait, wait... What's going on?

38
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,940
Hold on!

39
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,740
Detective Sawabe was unaware of whom the client was

40
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,370
I'm the person that sent the letter in

41
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,790
Hold the... Wait, wait!

42
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,390
The client this time is really Matsumoto Hitoshi...-San ?!

43
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,880
The real requester is Matsumoto Hitoshi-san

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,590
Pleased to work  with you

45
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,540
This is...

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,020
I'm a huge fan of the show

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,680
Yeah but... Really?!

48
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,110
Honest! Event hough I've been living in Tokyo for a while now
(Matsumoto is from Osaka and where Knight Scoop is shot)

49
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,820
Still?
-Yes

50
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,680
The pair discuss the favourite parts

51
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,390
Well I think it would have to be...
Do you remember that one with...

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,160
I was really surprised, the girl who could hear the 4 leaf clovers

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,450
That one was legendary

54
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,710
(Subbed, link in the description)

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,510
The other one was with the old lady who wanted to meet Ika-chan
(01-05-2015)

56
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,940
And the one where Ishida gets under the house

57
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,760
Where he lost his license down there!

58
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,990
(02-27-2015)

59
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,140
That was a really great piece

60
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,880
Even though I hate Ishida...

61
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,140
You hate him why?!

62
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,880
When he slaps your head, he hits too hard

63
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,450
I have felt it before so I understand...

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,510
The audience doesn't even laugh!

65
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,680
It really feels like I'm back in Osaka round here

66
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:50,580
It's not a good or bad thing, but it's like I've gone though a time slip coming back here in Osaka

67
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,360
It's not like I want to take Director Nishida's job but...

68
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,790
I'm sure he will be pleased

69
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,190
Please wait until Director Nishida returns

70
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,420
We get on really well I think!

71
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,880
What if it was you sat there!

72
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,250
This is... I mean, really, look at it

73
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,620
Have you felt how tough it's in?

74
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,450
My wife asked me to have a go at it...

75
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,420
I've looked and tried

76
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,650
But nothing was really effective

77
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
I have become kind of attached to it...

78
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,110
Well we have a few Knight Scoop standard procedures to test through

79
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,790
I see, the basic tests right?

80
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,650
The first will be heating and expansion. Then we will cool and contract

81
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,990
You will expand the outer and contract the inner part?

82
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,080
To shrink the inner part, we will place dry ice inside

83
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,850
Then place the whole piece in hot water to warm the outside

84
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,530
That is the experiment

85
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,020
So uh...

86
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,190
Please give it a go

87
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,420
Of course the detective will usually do it but...

88
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,150
Today is have the client experience day on Knight Scoop

89
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,140
The dry ice is -79'c

90
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,190
And the hot water is 100'c

91
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,160
The temperature range difference is 179'c !!

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,620
Well, look... I know we want to take it out but..

93
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,660
If it comes out like this first time

94
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,220
It will be a little disappointing

95
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,790
Well the objective of the show is to have some fun after all...

96
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Yes, yes that is true I suppose

97
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,450
It feels like it should explode
-I'm scared, there is a possibility of that

98
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,590
Please remove it!

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,110
It won't budge!

100
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,360
Not at all!

101
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,110
Sawabe-san, seriously, not an inch!

102
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,160
Wait what

103
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,710
It's in there tight

104
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,880
We have the professor to help us

105
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
I heard him muttering earlier

106
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,140
He is here to help

107
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,910
He is well renowned as the Knight Scoop professor

108
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,650
Of course, I have seen him plenty on here

109
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,880
If we force it, it is likely to break

110
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,140
We need to increase the temperature range

111
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,420
Make it so the difference in temperature range is larger

112
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,750
Please make your way over there

113
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,740
What's this?!

114
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,590
This time we have a little...

115
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,360
Well you see...

116
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,310
Fire proof clothing

117
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,220
It's dangerous

118
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,790
Sensei! You are fully prepared

119
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,610
I think... It's Yamada-Sensei

120
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,340
That can't possibly be liquid nitrogen?!

121
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,520
That's right

122
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,340
Woah woah woah liquid nitrogen...

123
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,740
Liquid... Liquid nitrogen!

124
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
It will be turned into nitrogen!

125
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,250
This liquid nitrogen is -169'c

126
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,900
And the hot water is 100'c

127
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,590
Are you ok?

128
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,710
He has to be careful not to get the nitrogen in the hot water

129
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,850
Be careful!! Are you ok?!

130
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,280
Liquid nitrogen reacts violently in hot water

131
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,680
Can you, this way, with...

132
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,540
I can't do it from this angle

133
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,590
Like this

134
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,220
Is this going to be okay to put in hot water?

135
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,680
-I don't know

136
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,620
What do you mean you don't know!?

137
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,190
I'm so scared!

138
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
It's in! Damn that was hot!

139
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,050
And?

140
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,740
And?

141
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,250
And?

142
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,390
So...

143
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,790
With this hot and cold variance

144
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,480
We also add some vibration

145
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,050
We are going all out with this one then

146
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,400
Ready?

147
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,990
Then you will apply some movement to it

148
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,590
With this temperature variance we add vibration!

149
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,250
Ok! Matsumoto-san! Let's take it out!!

150
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,080
Is it okay to touch?

151
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,480
Damn that's hot!

152
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,140
Of course it will be hot!!

153
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,310
I'm pretty tense right now

154
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,480
It's completely stuck!

155
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,280
No way!

156
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,820
It just won't budge!

157
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,450
Why!

158
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,560
What will we do?!

159
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,510
But...

160
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,820
Shall we give that a go?

161
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,850
It's worth a try at least

162
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Floss?
-Shall we give it a go?

163
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,620
Shouldn't we have tried this from the start?

164
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,160
This is pretty surprising these basic science principles

165
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,310
We have it looped round

166
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,650
All you have to do is pull?

167
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,540
See!
-Please observe everyone...

168
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,880
Completely stuck.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,480
It's not moving

170
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,310
-It's soon time that Matsumoto-san has his next shoot...

171
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,680
What are you filming? Matsumoto's home on a day off?
松本家の休日

172
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,850
Well which Matsumoto has this as a problem?!

173
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,910
This is a real Matsumoto's home problem

174
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,020
-Do you wanna try yanking it out?

175
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,020
Try pulling it out in 1?

176
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,790
If it's Matsumoto-san...

177
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Ready?

178
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,740
I'm disgusted.

179
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,620
Terrible

180
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,560
What is the bad sentiment about this?!

181
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,510
So it's possible to have failed investigations?

182
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,620
It's a possibility we don't succeed

183
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,220
We sometimes have those on Knight Scoop!

184
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,960
Well what are you going to do about this now?

185
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,090
I'll... Probably give up

186
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,910
WHAT DO YOU MEAN GIVE UP?!

187
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,850
Well, if you can't do this then, if we work together again on a different show...

188
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,250
To put it bluntly, I'll ignore the shit out of you!

189
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,990
That's not what a good senpai does!

190
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,680
Is it really impossible?

191
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,820
Well I'm going to the next shoot...

192
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,790
If you do it, bring it to me?

193
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,710
We don't usually have such unreasonable requests!

194
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,020
Well, I have to go...

195
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,390
Ah, this isn't my jacket...

196
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,960
Please I'm counting on you!

197
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,110
DON'T BREAK IT!

198
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,190
I'm not allowed to break it?
-Of course NOT!

199
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,400
Got it, good luck

200
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,220
Man this is a pain

201
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,140
So, Matsumoto has gone to film and now by myself

202
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,990
I shall prevail

203
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,850
We have warmed it, got the dry ice inside...
Now we need some lubrication

204
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,280
This is washing up liquid

205
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,880
If I can just ease it like...

206
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:06,420
WAIT!! THIS JUST NOW...!! IT MOVED! IT MOVED!

207
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,650
I got it out !!!

208
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,540
Alright!

209
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,590
Amazing!

210
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,540
Perfect

211
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,690
This is a perfect success!

212
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,300
Matsumoto's house on a day off studio

213
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,450
Hello, sorry to interrupt so suddenly

214
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
You did it?? No way

215
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,020
Really? That quick?!

216
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,680
The result...

217
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,560
You got it out!

218
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,590
It's out!

219
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,340
How? How? How? How?

220
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,560
Perfectly came out

221
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,820
How?

222
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,220
It still has dry ice in it!
-Don't touch it

223
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,220
We got it out perfectly in one piece!

224
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,940
Win!

225
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,650
But I want to see how it was inside can we...?

226
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,880
WHY?!

227
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,960
We haven't seen how it was inside it

228
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,020
You don't understand the troubles we had!

229
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,310
How it must have got inside is unbelievable

230
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,940
To get at that angle

231
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,360
Oh, it's in!

232
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,050
That was the one thing I didn't want !!!

233
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,710
You better get it out !!
-I can, I can!

234
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,130
Give it a go

235
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,080
It came out like sloppy seconds

236
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,010
Honestly thank you so much!

237
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,740
That is wonderful

238
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,390
We managed to remove it!

239
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,760
I have some other problems at home that might take a bit longer to resolve

240
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,630
Macchan was the requester!

241
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
He suddenly he came in...

242
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,590
It was really unexpected

243
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,310
But I honestly had no clue about it

244
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,280
I just saw this hench blonde guy in the corner of my eye....

245
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,620
I was so surprised, then I realised it was Matsumoto Hitoshi-san

246
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,280
It was a unbelievable situation that worked out well in the end!
