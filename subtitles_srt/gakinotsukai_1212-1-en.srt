DOWNTOWN

Naoki Tanaka

Shōzō Endō

11
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,280
Matsumoto-san, what's this all about?

12
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,400
I'm not enthusiastic about this at all.

13
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,680
This is just at one's own timing.

14
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,180
Well, everyone will be put in various situations,

15
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,180
Yes

16
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,060
in which you'd cry for real at your own timing.

17
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,060
(A contest of dramas that will make you cry)

18
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,060
(Today's aim)

19
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,100
Yes... for real.

20
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,460
I'm not looking forward to this at all.

21
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,860
What are you talking about?

22
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,080
It's really hard.

23
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,600
Tsukitei-san seems relatively enthusiastic though

24
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,980
Yeah, I worked hard for this.

25
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,060
What I heard was that Tsukitei-san and Tanaka-san were all in for this idea.

26
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,620
Not at all.

27
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,360
It's more like...

28
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,720
Tsukitei-san and Tanaka-san want to earn as actors as well.

29
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,620
No, no, no.

30
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,540
Not at all.

31
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,480
Endo-san wants to do the same but his acting skill just isn't up to par.

32
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,880
Lacking in capacity.

33
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,260
The rules are quite simple: the act will continue until tears have been shed.

34
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,300
It's not a time trial race, however timing is paramount.

35
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,300
Giving up is also possible.

36
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,060
Now then...

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,700
Basically, there's no talking involved.

38
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,540
Ah yes, it's all about emotions.

39
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:20,110
(Plays must be silent with no lines/script)

40
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:20,110
(Rule 4)

41
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,540
Yes, just emotions.

42
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,660
You sure seem to be brimming with confidence.

43
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,180
No, I'm seriously not.

44
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,420
I'm serious.

45
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,240
Tanaka is just great at it.

46
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,500
Really?

47
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,600
Can you just stop..?

48
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,940
Tanaka's already working seriously with Yomiuri TV.

49
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:33,320
"Settlement Lawyer"

50
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:33,320
Lead actor in

51
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:33,320
Yomiuri TV

52
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,920
The connection between
Tanaka and Yomiuri TV is no joke.

53
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,320
He did an insane amount of work for them.

54
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,340
With that said, let's see Tanaka's acting skills as he takes on the challenge.

55
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,580
Will he be able to cry?

56
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,080
What scenario is this?

57
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,020
Summer...

58
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:01,460
Sad situation

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:01,460
Visiting a grave

60
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,420
I see.

61
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,700
He's playing himself.

62
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,780
Seems so.

63
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,180
This is...

64
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,460
Seriously, what is this?

65
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,220
Obviously, he can't hear us.

66
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:09,090
* Tanaka cannot hear the member's voices.*

67
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,860
So that we don't disrupt his concentration.

68
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,340
Who's this supposed to be?

69
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,100
His father?

70
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,200
Maybe an ancestor? Depends on how Tanaka's looking at the situation.

71
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,260
Looking at this face though,

72
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,160
he's already begun acting.

73
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,500
Sure does.

74
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,500
He's an actor after all.

75
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,720
He is an actor.

76
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,040
Wow.

77
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,500
That's an actor's face.

78
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,820
It sure is, alright.

79
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,900
Like he's channeling it all in.

80
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,700
He looks like Saitou Yosuke here.

81
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,480
He's an actor, time to show his skills.

82
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,320
He's been staring at it the whole time.

83
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,820
The acting's already begun.

84
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,780
It's slowly building up.

85
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,780
He's doing well. Eyes are getting heavy.

86
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,780
It's coming.

87
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,540
You're kidding me.

88
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,380
It's coming. It's coming.

89
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,620
It's coming.

90
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,220
There it is.

91
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,100
No way.

92
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,900
It's comin' out.

93
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,900
Go, go.

94
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,500
It's really coming out.

95
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,980
Yomiuri TV definitely won't be cutting him loose.

96
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,840
Fall, fall.

97
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,660
They won't let go of him.

98
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,760
Seriously, the tears won't fall if he blinks.

99
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,620
That's right.

100
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,660
Wait until he cries, right?

101
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,660
Yep.

102
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,540
Nope, he blinked once.

103
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,500
He messed up.

104
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,700
He got excited instead.

105
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,400
And he was doing so well.

106
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,860
Just one more step and he'd have nailed it.

107
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,740
The thread of tension has been broken.

108
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,800
He has let an early big chance go...

109
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,440
Will he be able to create that feeling once more?

110
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,820
But still, that's an actor's face.

111
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,020
Looks good.

112
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,580
He's attempting to pull it off from expression.

113
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,040
Seems so.

114
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,740
Rather than tricking the mind, he's trying to trick the brain with expressions.

115
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,260
His mouth though...

116
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,060
it's shaking.

117
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,980
His mouth is shaking.

118
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,620
Looks like he's trying to trick his mind into it.

119
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,700
He sure is an actor.

120
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,700
Hang in there.

121
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,380
Ah, this is where you've seriously just got to hang in there and keep at it.

122
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,940
Once he crosses this hurdle...

123
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,860
He couldn't pull it off on the previous one.

124
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,400
Come, come, come.

125
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,340
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

126
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,960
There, there, it's coming...

127
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,180
Just a bit more...

128
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,200
It's coming.

129
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,520
Go, go, go.

130
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,080
It's coming.

131
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,400
When it's about to come out, he blinks.

132
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,740
His heart is betraying him?

133
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,140
That's because he's making the expression.

134
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
This pressure...

135
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,740
Nope.

136
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,740
It stopped.

137
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,960
Did it?

138
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,620
I'm already tired of watching.

139
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,260
By the way...

140
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,040
Certainly, nothing's really changed.

141
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,440
Entering an unexpectedly long battle

142
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,640
The more he panics, the more he is unable to cry

143
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,640
No need to move your mouth.

144
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,380
That mouth is... cheap, isn't?

145
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,360
A cheap move.

146
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,900
Normally at those times there's a priest with a harisen.

147
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,490
Note: A harisen is a giant paper fan used for slapping. It is used to smack a funny man in response to their jokes or idiocy.

148
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,920
There has been no change whatsoever.

149
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,220
That's his normal face.

150
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,220
It's his normal face.

151
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,540
It's that normal face since his debut.

152
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,660
So true.

153
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,680
Only the time heartlessly passes by.

154
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,740
There it is.

155
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:19,610
(They can GIVE UP by pushing the button)

156
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,820
The button is there in a worst case scenario.

157
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,000
We're watching the same thing, but it's kinda different now.

158
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,480
Hang in there, Tanaka.

159
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,580
You're the lead after all.

160
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,280
It's funny watching the same thing, but...

161
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,840
He's always getting stuck there.

162
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,420
That's right.

163
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,220
A bit more, go for it!

164
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,240
Look, in the corner.

165
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,980
Yes, the corner.

166
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,080
From the outer corner, come out.

167
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,180
Ah, it's coming...

168
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,480
Yes, yes

169
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,900
Fall, fall, fall...

170
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,580
Fall, fall, fall.

171
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,060
Stop blinking!!

172
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,400
Nope!

173
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,220
You won't recover if you blink here.

174
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,040
Yeah, if you blink, the tears won't come out.

175
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,660
Nope, he lost it.

176
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Of course that happened.

177
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,160
He messed up blinking his eyes.

178
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,640
The hell're you laughin' at!?

179
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,640
He did his best.

180
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,120
He was very persistent.

181
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,300
This is tough.

182
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,240
It truly is.

183
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,240
I didn't even imagine that Tanaka would fail here.

184
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,840
I'm sorry.

185
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,760
So quiet.

186
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,760
24 minutes 6 seconds.

187
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,080
My real dad...

188
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,560
Ah, you were thinking about your father.

189
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,240
He's still kickin' around.

190
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,980
But the tears just wouldn't fall.

191
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,740
Yeah, it didn't.

192
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,740
Even then it didn't come out.

193
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,700
We were here forever.

194
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,520
Yes.

195
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,820
I'm so sorry.

196
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,580
Was it hard?

197
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,280
Yes, it was hard for me.

198
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,200
I couldn't do it.

199
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,220
Actor-comedian Tanaka unexpectedly gave up.

200
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,120

217
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,180
His acting abilities are unknown.

218
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,020
Tsuketei Housei, will he be able to cry?

219
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,780
What's his scenario?

220
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,740
That's the question.

221
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,580
He's a dad.

222
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,840
Ain't this some serious shit?

223
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,360
Just how much does he believe in himself?

224
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,340
You can't do it
without confidence.

225
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Dad, may I have a word?

226
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,940
What is it?

227
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,300
What do you wanna talk about?

228
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,680
He actually has a daughter.

229
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:42,100
Dad, thank you for raising me so preciously up to now.

230
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,160
This is hitting his core.

231
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:53,080
Greetings from daughter who is getting married

232
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:53,080
Sad situation

233
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:53,080
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

234
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,240
I am getting married today.

235
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm sorry for all the times I've worried you from misbehaving.

236
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:06,820
I'm truly happy having been born to you and Mom.

237
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:15,520
From here on, I want to have a happy marriage like the one you and Mom share,

238
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,360
It's coming.

239
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,660
Wow!

240
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,380
It's already coming.

241
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,780
with a family household which is fun.

242
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,780
I'm truly grateful for everything you've done for me so far.

243
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,340
It just keeps on coming.

244
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,140
No way, this idiot...

245
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,840
Damn!

246
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,920
So quick!

247
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,600
Wow!

248
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,880
Damnnnn!

249
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,280
That was too damn quick.

250
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,540
Something's definitely wrong with him.

251
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,360
Just amazing...

252
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,580
That was too damn quick!

253
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,940
There it is.

254
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,740
That's it, it's over.

255
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,800
The daughter's letter was just perfect.

256
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,100
I think there was more to it.

257
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,920
It could've been just the middle part of the letter.

258
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,100
Just amazing...

259
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,800
That's enough.

260
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,600
He still can do it.

261
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,240
Even now he's crying.

262
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,880
Too long with his winning mode.

263
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,840
So quick!!

264
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,720
This one's the winner.

265
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,560
You were terrific.

266
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,230
Crying time:  2 min 3 sec

267
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,920
Just about 2 minutes.

268
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,680
Yamasaki-san, you were great.

269
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,660
2 minutes.

270
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,180
You were definitely thinking about your daughter, right?

271
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,140
I absolutely was, but...

272
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,420
It was coming outta your nose too.

273
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,520
It was coming out nonstop.

274
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,140
Like Ishida Ayumi.

275
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,440
Coming up, how does Matsumoto lament?

276
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,180
Is this guy an idiot!?

277
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,740
As a movie director, he can't show an embarrassing performance.

278
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,880
Will Matsumoto be able to cry?

279
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,380
A park?

280
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,720
It is.

281
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,700
Looks like it.

282
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,320
There's a kid playing in it.

283
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,780
Ah, it's the real thing.

284
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,340
Yeah, in the sandbox.

285
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,700
There's a kid playing in it.

286
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,920
What's the matter?

287
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,360
What's this supposed to be?

288
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:23,550
A young boy playing in the park

289
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:23,550
Sad situation

290
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:23,550
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

291
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,850
Like after a divorce...

292
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,200
Ah! He can't be with his son
as much.

293
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,540
Something like that.

294
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,960
We don't know his job.

295
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,180
He probably can't see him as much.

296
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,660
Ah! But...

297
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,620
He's getting into it through expression.

298
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,660
He totally is.

299
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,120
He's going down that route.

300
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,720
Ah, but...

301
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,400
He's doing well.

302
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,100
Isn't it coming?

303
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,540
It's the first hurdle...

304
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,540
Yes, this is the one.

305
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,480
But man, it's hard to look with those wires.

306
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,620
You're right, that wire is hiding his eyes.

307
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,970
I see, it's tied together so perfectly.

308
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,120
The wire should go away.

309
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,940
The damn wire.

310
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,560
But there's a bit coming out.

311
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,660
Ah, it's there.

312
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,760
Can he do it on his first try already?

313
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,420
If the tears don't come out here, it'd become impossible

314
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,600
He'll do it!

315
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,780
It's out.

316
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,780
The tears came out.

317
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,320
What the..? He's amazing.

318
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,520
Just amazing...

319
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,840
There it is, there it is.

320
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,000
That wire was getting in the way.

321
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
Wow, amazing!

322
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,980
That's just amazing.

323
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,640
It really is.

324
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,700
The tears came out.

325
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,340
You've gotta be kiddin' me.

326
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,300
Is this guy an idiot!?

327
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,900
Since he has a real daughter...

328
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,920
No wonder he felt sad.

329
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,360
So quick!

330
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,180
Even faster than Yama-chan.

331
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,960
1 minute 50 seconds.

332
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,300
No way.

333
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,900
He's still into the act.

334
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,060
He's still at it.

335
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,280
The act is still ongoing.

336
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,440
What's with him?

337
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,260
Man, he was great.

338
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,440
Damn, that was amazing.

339
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,700
He definitely created some story in his head.

340
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,980
He wasn't able to be with the kid much.

341
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,940
Looked like it.

342
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,040
Was that fast or what? Amazing, right?

343
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,260
You were quicker than Yamazaki.

344
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,800
Eh, I wonder why?

345
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:22,970
Crying time:  1 min 50 sec

346
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,800
You timed at 1 minute 50 seconds.

347
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

348
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,280
You were amazing.

349
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,040
Damn!

350
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,920
What were you thinking about?

351
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,820
Seriously, it looked so sad seeing him play all alone and by himself.

352
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,460
Ah, is that so.

353
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,620
I see.

354
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,340
We thought you couldn't be with your kid.

355
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,980
Yeah, and that you just couldn't be around as much.

356
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,140
That... whoa, whoa, whoa, I did it.

357
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,760
Hamada-san!

358
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,420
Finally.

359
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,500
Anyway, when you're out there, you shouldn't think of the staff as variety staff.

360
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,260
You have to think those staff members are proper people.

361
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,440
I see.

362
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,280
With two successful challengers in a row...

363
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,260
Will Hamada be able to cry?

364
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,600
What's with the scenario?

365
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,860
He's a kid?

366
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,640
This is...

367
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:26,640
Note: Shiro was Hamada's pet dog in his
childhood. It was based on the true story.

368
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:27,000
Beloved Shiro ran away

369
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:27,000
Sad situation

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:27,000

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,240
This is one big hurdle.

372
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,320
Shiro ran away.

373
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,440
Feeling dumbfounded after noticing it.

374
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,500
Well, Hamada's dog...

375
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,300
This is just...

376
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,020
You know about his dog, right?

377
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,300
Yes, yes.

378
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,840
Surprisingly, it's about his dog.

379
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,100
He's in trouble.

380
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,600
It's the same scenario?

381
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,000
This is just wrong.

382
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,720
Looks like he's accepted the situation.

383
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,420
Seems so.

384
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,280
With such a difficult situation, he's unable to get into his role.

385
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,300
However, the crying switch is suddenly turned on.

386
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,720
What's he going through here?

387
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,940
I wonder too.

388
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,600
But, somehow it's taking effect.

389
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,580
It's coming.

390
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,420
It's coming, look.

391
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,340
C'mon, c'mon.

392
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,380
It's accumulating.

393
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,020
For real?

394
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,580
Yes, yes, yes, Hamada-san.

395
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,840
It's not a joke.

396
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,520
This, this here is the important part.

397
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,440
This, this, this is the important part.

398
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,640
After he feels, he just need to wait.

399
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,400
It's starting to look like it will take a while.

400
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,620
The first hurdle.

401
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,840
It's headed in the same direction as Tanaka.

402
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,160
Come here already Hamada.

403
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,140
It was so close.

404
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,120
The situation changed to a long war battle.

405
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,720
Come, come.

406
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,880
Left eye!

407
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,240
You can do it!

408
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,960
Don't! Better not lose here.

409
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,160
It's come down to this.

410
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,080
Yeah, the button appeared.

411
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,260
During my turn, it wasn't
there at all.

412
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:14,610
(They can GIVE UP by pushing the button)

413
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,260
I didn't where it was.

414
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,880
He looks like
Mikawa Genichi now.

415
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,480
See.

416
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,480
What the hell is this?

417
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,160
This is like a Fumakilla commercial.

418
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,660
So true.

419
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,100
It's been 10 minutes since the start

420
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,500
searching for a breakthrough

421
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,520
He's not looking towards Shiro at all.

422
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Where's he looking at then?

423
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,900
What is he thinking about? Shiro?

424
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,920
Yeah, you would've thought he would at least looked towards where Shiro was.

425
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,940
What's this?

426
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,660
You gotta shit or what?

427
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,040
You gotta shit or what?

428
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,780
He's trying to bring out with expression.

429
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,040
It's come down to expression.

430
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,240
His expression is already taking 10 min.

431
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,600
At this point, he has to rely on expression.

432
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,760
No good.

433
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,300
It's tough after all.

434
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,460
He's coming back.

435
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,500
Man, it looks tough.

436
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,160
Oh man, too bad he couldn't do it.

437
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,180
In the end, no good.

438
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,720
Next one is the last one.

439
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,700
It's too bad.

440
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,340
That's just impossible.

441
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,840
When I first saw the dog house,

442
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,400
it kinda cracked me up.

443
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,700
We were crackin' up on this side as well.

444
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,700
We could only see it as a Fumakilla commercial

445
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,880
Seriously, you've gotta get it right on the first try.

446
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,200
From the start.

447
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,440
Speaking of Cocorico,

448
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Tanaka failed.

449
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,620
I apologize.

450
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,820
The connection to Yomiuri TV is beginning to disappear.

451
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,300
The person in Cocorico who can't act;

452
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,560
will Endo be able to do it?

453
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,480
Concert?

454
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,200
This?

455
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,980
This is a tough one.

456
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:16,030
Sad situation

457
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:16,030
The changing room after his pro wrestling retirement match

458
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:16,030
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

459
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,560
He's so strict on himself.

460
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,420
This is tough for him
and for the program.

461
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,260
What is this?

462
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,800
He was holding a flower though.

463
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,960
Retirement?

464
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,920
Ah, yes...

465
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,120
I wonder what it is?

466
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,220
It's should be hard to see with that mask on.

467
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,500
His eyes look like they're...

468
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,120
Looks like his eyes are becoming red.

469
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,380
Really?

470
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,220
Yes, good.

471
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,360
Looks promising.

472
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,200
This looks promising, ah he's taking it off.

473
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,200
It's better to take it off.

474
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,480
It's better to have it off.

475
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,240
That was fur?

476
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,180
I didn't really find that funny at all.

477
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,360
A wig.

478
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,820
He's acting while looking at the mask,

479
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,380
while thinking of various past events.

480
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,380
I see.

481
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,800
He's waiting now.

482
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,900
This guy, to begin with, his acting is fishy.

483
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,720
But...

484
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,720
A moment please...

485
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,480
His first chance.

486
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,760
It's coming, it's coming.

487
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
He widened it.

488
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,440
That ain't good.

489
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,760
He opened it.

490
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,320
He opened his eyes wide.

491
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,920
This smells like Daiei Film.

492
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,760
You're right.

493
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,640
He's really glaring at the mask.

494
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,940
He has to reflect on his good memories; there must be something.

495
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,780
Ahh, no good?

496
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,480
He came back to zero again.

497
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,160
He let the chance go?

498
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,300
He lost it.

499
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,300
Lost the first chance.

500
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,100
He changed?

501
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,260
He changed.

502
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,780
He changed the setting.

503
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,200
Doing it from the belt?

504
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,560
Endo fails at the start.

505
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,980
He started to move now.

506
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,300
I see.

507
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,300
Trying to find a breakthrough, he tries various things.

508
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,440
What's he doing?

509
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Yomiuri TV's watching

510
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,760
That tan he got from golfing...

511
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,040
He doesn't look like a pro wrestler at all

512
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,600
That's a polo shirt tan

513
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,840
He's keeping his eyes wide open this whole time.

514
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,820
That's just dirty.

515
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,760
Leaving them open to make it dry.

516
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,440
What's going on?

517
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,500
Enough already! Go change clothes and take a shower.

518
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,700
It's no good. He didn't live up to the expectation.

519
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,900
That's right, next, the expected mediocre show.

520
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,500
He's doing a big expression.

521
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,720
Mori Shinichi's out.

522
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,740
You're right.

523
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,460
And after this?

524
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,900
Ah, he widened his eyes.

525
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,860
This pattern.

526
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,020
It's a public drama.

527
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,880
Ah, he's looking up and having it open the entire time.

528
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,540
He might be able to pull it off.

529
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,160
He's really at it.

530
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,740
Using the glare of the studio lighting...

531
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,300
How cheap...

532
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,300
He's gonna burn his eyes.

533
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,660
Shameful and hideous.

534
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,700
Hurry up.

535
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,040
What's with the face?

536
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,700
Like I said, Mori Shinichi.

537
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:25,700
Note: Mori Shinichi is a Japanese male
enka singer and composer, who also
sings folk and pop music.

538
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,740
What the heck is this face?

539
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,780
This is Mori Shinichi when caring about his mother.

540
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,560
"Eh? Really?"

541
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,900
"Then, what song should I sing?"

542
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,520
20 minutes pass

543
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,920
Cocorico has seriously taken a boatload of time.

544
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,440
Really, how much time he's taking? More than all of us together.

545
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,760
Cry already.

546
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,560
What's the matter?

547
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,940
What the? This is new.

548
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,220
Compared to the previous expressions, this is something new. Isn't this good?

549
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,840
He's should really just stop widening his eyes.

550
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,180
That was no good.

551
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,540
What impeccable timing.

552
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,720
Struggling with this hard time, but the conclusion wasn't long enough.

553
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,060
He did it.

554
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,340
The chance was at the beginning.

555
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,940
That's the way to do it.

556
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,460
Return faster man!

557
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,260
You stink at acting.

558
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,820
I stink at acting?

559
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,140
When you widened your eyes...

560
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,000
I stink at acting?

561
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,560
What were you thinking about when you were looking at the mask?

562
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,000
I thought maybe I should take it off.

563
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,540
Getting into Shikoku's mindset?

564
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,640
That I got the championship belt mindset.

565
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,660
You also looked at the belt.

566
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The fight with Escargoman

567
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,160
If you were thinking of such a thing, of course you weren't able to cry.

568
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,340
What's the point of the fight anyway?

569
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,400
In the end, only two members cleared and three failed.

570
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,200
For Tanaka who had worked on many dramas, hopefully this won't affect future offers

571
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,480
Tanaka, wanna give it another go?

572
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,400
Such situations do actually happen.

573
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,460
But, that...

574
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,700
Whoa, this is just...

575
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,240
it's too difficult with this.

576
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,340
This thing here is just amazing.

577
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,320
I see.

578
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,160
After using this return to me, okay?

579
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,680
I'm going to borrow this.

580
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,160
Are really going through with it?

581
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,720
I really don't think it's gonna work.

582
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,920
Ah, how about you visit the grave with the Shikoku mask on?

583
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,960
Ah! You were fighting your opponent in the ring and you accidentally killed him.

584
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,340
And you visit his grave wearing this.

585
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,420
And he's your best friend.

586
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,660
So just wear this that you'll be nail this quickly.

587
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,960
I got it, here goes.

588
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,540
Tanaka's weeping performance revenge.

589
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,820
How'll he fare?

590
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,560
How nostalgic.

591
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,700
I definitely think he'll pull it off.

592
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:09,850
Sad situation

593
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:09,850
Visit his beloved opponent's grave

594
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:09,850
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

595
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,940
Looks good.

596
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,460
Sure does.

597
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,200
Looks good.

598
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,000
Compared to the
previous attempt...

599
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,680
Such a restless pro wrestler...

600
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,680
You can totally tell it's a fake Shikoku.

601
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,800
Yeah.

602
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,920
But he also knows that if he doesn't succeed in the first 3 min it's over.

603
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,280
He has a long opportunity to concentrate.

604
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,680
Good, it's coming.

605
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,120
So fast.

606
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,820
Looks like if will go like this.

607
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,320
He's moving his jaw like this.

608
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,560
Good, good, good.

609
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,440
It's coming.

610
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,900
One more gear, c'mon.

611
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,480
C'mon.

612
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,920
Vroom~ come out.

613
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,180
Can't do it.
