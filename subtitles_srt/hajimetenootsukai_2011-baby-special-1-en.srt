2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,640
For those who cannot wait
we have a very special episode today.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,860
Let's reveal it:

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,860
My First Errand

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,860
Never give up Baby Special

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,690
George Tokoro

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,080
Is it "Never give up Baby Special"?

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,880
It is.

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,880
We brought the staff to talk about the special.

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,830
My First Errand staff room

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,960
What is it really like?

12
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,170
Really, when watching from home

13
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,170
I cry

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,200
When I cry in the studio

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,900
I hate being filmed by you.

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,780
I really have to endure it.

17
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,300
You know, it's not a cool emotion.

18
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,700
You know, the camera is constantly pinned on me.

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,060
No matter how much wells up

20
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,190
I have to suck it back in.

21
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,980
I try to find ways to dry it.

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,980
I can never express myself fully.

23
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,830
I open my eyes fully so

24
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,160
the tears

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,160
will dry easier.

26
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,740
Is that so?

27
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,240
How is it for this person?

28
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,140
Never give up Baby Special.

29
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,240
Moriguchi Hiroko
Singer

30
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,800
Doesn't that strike a chord?

31
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,260
Never give up baby.

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,860
I am sure that this song will play in your heads

33
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,920
as you realize that it's the new theme song.

34
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,620
"My first errand".
I've recorded them all.

35
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,380
And I rewatch them when I need to be moved.

36
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,160
It's so powerful that I completely cry.

37
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,600
Complete

38
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,600
emotional crying

39
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,600
how refreshing

40
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,840
Thank you children.

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,160
Let's cry and feel emotionally refreshed.

42
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,160
First up

43
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,340
The 6 year old bigger brother has a little brother who looks up to him.

44
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,470
Fukuoka ● Kyushu

45
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,080
Kyotaro, dinner is ready.

46
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,760
The big brother Kyotaro is in
third grade elementary school.

47
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,760
The one going on errand
is the little brother, Minato.

48
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,760
He is only 2 years and 8 months old.

49
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,150
2 years
8 months old

50
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,150
Minato

51
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,890
Will he be okay?

52
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,880
I am worried.

53
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,320
Big brother, stop playing around.

54
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,660
Kyotaro,

55
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,660
dinner is ready.

56
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,760
Kyotaro, the big brother, went on his first errand when he was 2 years and 3 months old.

57
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,370
Kyotaro (big brother)
Elementary school 3rd grade.

58
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,620
That's great.

59
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,980
Well it was for his own ice cream.

60
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,260
When his younger brother heard
he couldn't take it.

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,680
Isn't it dangerous to go to the apartment complex?

62
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,660
He wants to assist his brother.

63
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,750
I'm leaving.

64
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,750
Take care.

65
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,680
Kyotaro leaves for his penmanship classes.

66
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,720
The penmanship school is past the park
inside the apartment complex.

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,120
Cars can't go there.

68
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,160
Right! Time for Kyotaro's plan

69
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
his first errand.

70
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,430
Look at this.

71
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,430
Minato,

72
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,330
Your big brother
has forgotten this.

73
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,480
Did he forget it once again?
It can't be helped.

74
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,660
The goal is to go to the penmanship class
and give the pen to his big brother Kyotaro.

75
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,650
If you go

then say

Kyotaro, okay?

76
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,750
OK.

77
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,320
It is one way up the hill.

78
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,760
There are many students in the class
so he has to call out "Kyotaro brother".

79
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,740
In order to not scare the 2-year-and-8-month-old boy
the crew is hiding while filming him.

80
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,360
It's raining lightly outside.

81
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,060
Don't slip, okay?

82
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,220
Even when she has to throw out the trash
he hates being apart from his mother.

83
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,940
What an emotional second son.

84
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,760
But today there is something that he must do.

85
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,200
Since his forgetful brother is in trouble.

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,740
His shoes are cute.

87
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,100
When being told to wear a raincoat he answers
"I want to use the umbrella like my big brother"

88
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,180
He has started to use umbrellas recently.

89
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,220
It must be heavy, right?

90
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,640
Whoa, all those huge people.

91
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,540
They are middle school students.

92
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,000
Without mommy
everything feels so far away.

93
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,360
The umbrella feels heavy.

94
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,420
1 week from now and
he will be finished with nursery school.

95
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,660
Growing a little every day
his mother can't keep up.

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,660
These are the steps leading to the class.

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,940
Kyotaro brother,
is doing pretty well.

98
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,740
The entrance to the school.

99
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,130
Phew, I arrived.

100
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,120
Let's show you a brief moment of a growing 2-year-and-8-month-old kid in one cut.

101
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,120
He is putting it in like that.

102
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,620
No, the umbrella can't go in like that.

103
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,760
"Oh, so it can't go in like that."

104
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,320
No no no, this isn't it.

105
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,560
Oh? Indeed.

106
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,880
Yes, yes, yes. That's how you close it.

107
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,540
Exactly. That's how.

108
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,540
He did it.

109
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,620
Doing like others. Look!

110
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,900
Oh no, it can't stay still.

111
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
He thought of something.

112
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,540
Finally managed to put the umbrella in.

113
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,920
Pheew

114
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,780
From here he will call his brother.
Do it in a loud voice.

115
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,690
Kyotaro

116
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,160
Kyotaro, your dinner is ready.

117
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
Dinner?

118
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,240
Though a bit embarrassing for his big brother
he couldn't help himself from being so worried.

119
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Minato,
You sure have a great big brother.

120
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,220
Thank you Minato.

121
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,860
Brother, if you forget it again
I will bring it to you.

122
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,950
After these stairs
will you go
by yourself?

123
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,880
Can you go back alone?
Mom is waiting.

124
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,520
Bye.

125
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,060
Splish splosh.

126
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,740
Big brobro, make sure to do it well.
He parts with that emotion.

127
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,940
Hold on. My head feels wet.

128
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,940
Umbrella, umbrella.

129
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,820
The umbrella!

130
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,560
He has forgotten what it is that he has forgotten.

131
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,650
Mommy, open up, please.

132
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,000
Did you come running?

133
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,190
You are
awesome,
Minato.

134
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,500
Where is
the umbrella?

135
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,140
Did you forget the umbrella there?

136
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,400
Yes, even though you went all the way.

137
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,070
You forgot
the umbrella.

138
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,210
Just like your
big brother.

139
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,260
Yes, just like his brother.
He forgot it.

140
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,820
My First Errand staff room

141
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,160
So this is how
the cameramen
disguise themselves?

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,960
In the staff room we keep the disguises.

143
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
This looks good on me.

144
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,120
Wait a minute. This isn't the reason why I am here.

145
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,680
You have collected the request letters here.

146
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,040
The mothers send us letters.

147
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Everybody, they really have gathered all the letters.

148
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,900
For the mothers, the memories of the first errand

149
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,100
turn into mail correspondences back and forth several times a year.

150
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,180
Happy new year

151
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,280
Children really grow up in the blink of an eye.

152
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,610
New year greetings

153
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,860
I would truly be happy if I received this kind of letter.

154
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,590
Right?

155
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,480
Yes.

156
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,160
It really is impressive.

157
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,160
Putting things

158
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,160
in order is important.

159
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,720
If you just leave the letters around in a big messy pile

160
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,440
when you want to look back
you would think "where did I put it again".

161
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,000
This is a folder.

162
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,140
Folder

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Holds something important.

164
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,960
Inside of the folders we have also collected images from the errands.

165
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,200
We have shown the images to Moriguchi.

166
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,660
These are the brothers Hen!

167
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,780
She remembers the entire story.

168
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,680
This is when they went out.

169
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Ah, it's that, right?

170
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,120
It's the errand where they had to bring a hairpin from the beauty salon for a wedding.

171
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,200
That's right.

172
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,340
These children sure can talk.

173
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,430
The

174
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,430
chit

175
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,430
chat

176
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,430
kind of women.

177
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,340
Now we will present you the chit chatting for free.

178
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,070
Talking sisters in practice!

179
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,640
Aichi ● Toyokawa

180
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,940
Toga shrine in Aichi prefecture.

181
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,500
It's been said that
a bride marrying here will be happy.

182
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,080
Since the one making sure you look pretty is the esteemed Beru.

183
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,340
She runs the beauty salon
associated with the shrine.

184
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,640
She has two grandchildren. Maya and Momoka.

185
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,490
Maya
4 years and 3 months

186
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,490
Momoka
2 years and 7 months

187
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,700
"Grandma is great" the big sister says admiringly
followed by her little sister.

188
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,040
The grandmother's beauty salon.

189
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,540
Grandmother is busy so they have come to help their mother.

190
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,960
The grandmother's beauty salon.

191
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,120
Salon
Belle Jouvence

192
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,260
Grandmother is busy so they have come to help their mother.

193
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,000
Please line up the slippers.

194
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,600
Momo sure is in high spirits.

195
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,940
Not those slippers.

196
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,940
She is so mature.

197
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,230
These are for the customers. Not us kids.

198
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,300
A model big sister.

199
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,000
Not like that.

200
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,070
These can be found over there.

201
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,820
I see.

202
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,240
She was arranging them?
That's a big sis for you.

203
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,180
She has lined up
many slippers.

204
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,650
What a
prosperous help.

205
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,840
Here is the phone.

206
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,700
The errand is about to start.

207
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,880
Hello, this is Belle salon.

208
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,540
It's me.

209
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,300
Yes?

210
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,620
It's the grandmother.

211
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,380
I want to use a yellow ornate hairpin for the bride

212
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,140
Can you have Maya and Momo bring it?

213
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,140
Yellow hairpin.

214
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,400
They have a lot of hairpins at the headquarters. About 40.

215
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,400
Look here.

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,340
Cute.

217
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,080
Dreamy ❤

218
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,320
A desirable bride.

219
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,700
You understand that it's no good if they break.

220
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,240
Can you bring those?

221
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,720
Yes.

222
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,720
Yes.

223
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,980
Even Momo?

224
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,730
Momo, can you do it?

225
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,160
If sister is going then I will too.

226
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,360
Since mom here can't go,

227
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,770
Maya will be mother.
Mother Maya.

228
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,860
Call her that.

229
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,770
Mother Maya

230
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,500
Listen to what mother Maya tells you.

231
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,580
Can you pay attention to cars?

232
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,580
Always doing the routine.

233
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,760
Raise your right hand.
You can't cross yet.

234
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,920
Right, left, right ...
You are not looking.

235
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,540
Cute.

236
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,220
And now Momo can cross with a raised hand.

237
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,780
Yes, perfect.

238
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,700
I want to see how pretty the bride is

239
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,300
Can you take
a picture?

240
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,480
Also taking a picture?

241
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,770
Say to the bride
"Congratulations
on the day"

242
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,070
"So beautiful"

243
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,660
Just like how adults do.

244
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,260
Do you want me to apply makeup
so you don't lose to the bride?

245
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,910
Yep.

246
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,600
Mother, letting the two girls do it takes great preparation.

247
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,120
Of course, it's the first time they try makeup.

248
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,760
Momo's extraordinary smile.

249
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,000
Lipstick?

250
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,480
Fabulous.

251
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,500
What to do. You've become
prettier than the bride.

252
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,380
Momo loves being treated as an adult.

253
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,960
What about big sister?

254
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,840
You don't have to make that face.

255
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,560
How great. It's done.

256
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,860
Are you ready? Can you go?

257
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,150
Yep.

258
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,290
Grandmama is waiting, let's run.

259
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,460
You shouldn't run. You will fall over.

260
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Totally mother Maya.

261
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,960
We crab walk here.

262
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,860
Overcoming it superbly.

263
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,100
Next obstacle is to cross this bridge.

264
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,940
Toga shrine

265
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,940
Toga shrine

266
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,180
For 2-year-and-7-month-old Momo
these stairs are a bit too tough.

267
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,320
Why haven't we arrived at Toga shrine yet?

268
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,140
After you cross here it's not far.

269
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,760
Good day.

270
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,140
Someone they know?

271
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,380
Mother Maya greets strangers in the neighborhood.

272
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,470
We finally reached the hallway.

273
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
I see, the shrine gate is a hallway.

274
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,480
Mother Maya keeps others safe.

275
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,780
Cars are crossing.

276
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,650
Momo, don't raise your hand.

277
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,850
You must hold my hands.

278
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,820
Momo

279
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,440
She's mad.

280
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,730
What did mom say?

281
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,800
Listen to what mother Maya says.

282
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,700
That's what she said!

283
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,000
Jeez

284
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,670
You don't listen to what I say.

285
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,670
Mother Maya

286
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,540
What?

287
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,140
Momo, you sure know the words to please your sister.

288
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,260
Let's go.

289
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,410
Ah, there are leaves.

290
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,010
Yes, because it is autumn.

291
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,960
Ah, it's because
it is autumn.

292
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,880
She understands
the seasons.

293
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:22,880
Right.

294
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,150
When it becomes autumn, Momo becomes

295
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,650
so super happy inside.

296
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,750
What about you Maya?

297
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,960
Maya likes winter

298
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,960
Winter is so darn cold

299
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,490
But you can make snowmen

300
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,760
which makes me happy.

301
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,430
Yes! Momo loves snowmen.

302
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,520
Sorry to stop you here but you've already arrived.

303
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,540
Ah! This is grandmas house.

304
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,360
No, not her house, her workplace.

305
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,740
Amazing.    So white.

306
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,210
Mr. horse is here.

307
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,850
See the horsie.

308
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,080
What about the compliments to the bride?

309
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,950
Congratulations for today

310
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,950
beautiful

311
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,360
Sorry, they just arrived.

312
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
The grandmother is inside.

313
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,600
This is the first time they enter
grandmothers workplace.

314
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,240
The carpet is so soft and
the kimonos are so pretty.

315
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,270
Momo

316
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Cheer up Momo.

317
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,920
Excitingly entering the dressing room.

318
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,680
Scared of disturbing their grandmother during work.

319
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,780
Thanks for
helping me out.

320
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,380
She is especially kind today.

321
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,660
Thank you both for bringing it to me.

322
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,000
Even congratulated the bride properly.

323
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,340
Isn't it great?

324
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,780
Did you go to the bride?

325
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,520
So this is where grandmother works.

326
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,200
The bridal dress matches the color of the hairpin.

327
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,600
Isn't the bride
beautiful?

328
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,680
Yellow makes her even more beautiful.

329
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,410
Does it
suit her?

330
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,660
Isn't the ornate hairpin you brought elegant.

331
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,960
Thanks.

332
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,520
Let's take a picture of the bride.

333
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,340
Yes, we must also take a picture.

334
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,040
A testament to grandmother's important job.
Will it be fine?

335
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,070
I took it.

336
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,700
Image ● Maya

337
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,800
Got it all.
Even our staff in the background.

338
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,840
What kind of charm do you want? Momo.

339
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,060
"Go and buy a charm" said grandmother.

340
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,810
charm for being able to do homework fast

341
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,950
a charm for curing sickness.

342
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,050
There are many kind of charms, so?

343
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,350
What kind of charm do you want?

344
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,660
For babies

345
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,660
thing

346
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,660
So that a baby will be born healthy?

347
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,660
Momo wants a little sister.

348
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,860
If she has a little sister
she can help her mother.

349
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,640
A charm for babies being born healthy.

350
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,140
A safe birth charm.

351
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,040
Mom doesn't have such plans, though.

352
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,150
quick           quick

353
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,660
I want to hang it quickly.

354
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,060
Hand, hand, hand.

355
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,630
Don't complain.

356
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,530
That's what matters.

357
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,340
Again with that.
I want a little sister fast.

358
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,180
Let's do our best.

359
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,110
Mom will definitely be happy.

360
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,900
Momo, give me your hand.

361
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,280
Momo! Give me your hand. ☠#️💣!

362
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,680
Do not cry.

363
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
I want a little sister.

364
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,540
We are back.

365
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,760
Welcome back.

366
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,580
Did you go and come back?

367
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,300
Amazing.

368
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,940
What a big sister.

369
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,100
I knew that I was able to do it.

370
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,200
Hurra

371
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,370
Here, a charm.

372
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,500
Wow, what charm did you purchase?

373
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,310
Momo wants that a baby

374
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,620
comes out healthy.

375
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,180
You bought a charm for that? Really?

376
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,920
Mom, I will ask for one more thing

377
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,420
A little sister that listens to what I say.

378
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,480
We keep our special filming equipment in the staff room.

379
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,040
Wait...

380
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,820
Isn't this great?

381
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,360
A remote controlled camera for filming inside.
Specially made.

382
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,410
I

383
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,410
this

384
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,410
want

385
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,140
It's too expensive.

386
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,700
I want this for my office.

387
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,060
It can be operated from 30 meters away.
In an apartment it can be used 1 to 5 floors away.

388
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,420
I wonder what it can be used for in a house.

389
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,390
I want everything.

390
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,760
This is nice.

391
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,100
At the bottom of Japan's tallest, Mount Fuji,

392
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,100
Yamanashi ● Fujikawaguchiko town

393
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,460
is a boy going on his first errand.

394
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,020
Mount Fuji can be seen from their house.

395
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:15,700
While known for strictness in his work
the father has a soft spot for children.

396
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:22,580
3 years
8 months

397
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:22,580
Shougo

398
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,900
He loves to pamper his only son.

399
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,420
He is raising a boy who is quick to cry.

400
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,680
His tough mother has decided
to send Shougo on an errand.

401
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,720
She believes that he can do it if he is by himself.

402
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,360
Can he do it without crying.

403
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,240
This is Shou(go).

404
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,280
The product that his mother has ordered has arrived.

405
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,080
It's here. What is it.

406
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,060
What has arrived is malt starch syrup.

407
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:56,350
Malt starch syrup

408
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,570
After hearing on TV that it is good for the throat after mixing it with daikon

409
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,020
she had it sent all the way from Sendai.

410
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,850
It's here.

411
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,490
I want to send some
to Runa's house.

412
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,720
Shougo, can you
bring it to them?

413
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,720
Eh!?

414
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,920
Look, it has started.

415
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,680
He will cry at these times.

416
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,380
Come come.

417
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,620
Not you Ri.

418
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,480
Shou.

419
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,580
Shou has been crying for 30 minutes.

420
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,720
Since mom has decided to make him go on an errand

421
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,140
she is hard set on not spoiling him no matter how long he cries for.

422
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,780
Sit!

423
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,580
Are you going?

424
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,550
I want to go.

425
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,580
You want to go?

426
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,220
Yes.

427
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,060
So he wants to go.

428
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,000
Can you do it?

429
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,820
Yes.

430
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,280
Will you do your best?

431
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,620
Yes.

432
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,260
Do you really mean it?

433
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,090
Yes.

434
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,060
Do you want to try?

435
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,090
Yes.

436
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,860
Okay.

437
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,300
Yes.

438
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,640
Will you go and see?

439
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,070
Mom, will you teach me?

440
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,240
I will,
I will teach you how.

441
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,470
Will you teach me the way?

442
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
I will. I will.

443
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,900
Can you quiet down
and go?

444
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,560
Yep.

445
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,680
Then go and pee first.

446
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,200
Yep.

447
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:12,520
Home

448
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:12,520
Runa's house

449
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:12,520
Shared farm

450
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:12,520
Sister Chi's house

451
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,020
Taking daikon from everyone's farm

452
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,220
Giving sister Chi the daikon and 3 syrups
and finally giving Runa 2.

453
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,020
Sister Chi's baby, Mana, has a cold.

454
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,860
I have to bring this to her.

455
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,000
Arriving in the shared field.

456
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,740
All the children in the nursery school are free to take from it.

457
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,770
Everyone's field.

458
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,780
First, a quick lick of candy.

459
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,780
Yes, this is the good stuff.

460
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,680
The farm worker is a cameraman.

461
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,280
Shougo is too focused to notice.

462
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,380
This one.

463
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,120
He chooses the biggest one.

464
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,360
I will take this one.

465
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,560
Found it!

466
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,280
It's huge!

467
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,320
It stood out.

468
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,740
The biggest one.

469
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,140
So big that even mount Fuji would be surprised.

470
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,820
Isn't this the biggest daikon
in the entire shared field?

471
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,880
It will be tough to carry.

472
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,880
That's right.

473
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,780
Straight like a bee on an autumn road.

474
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,140
he has marched in small steps for 10 minutes

475
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,980
He is dragging
the daikon

476
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It will bruise.

477
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,920
Ah, the syrup.

478
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,520
Oh no, he will cry.

479
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,660
Once he starts crying he can go on for 30 minutes.

480
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,100
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

481
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,840
But he won't cry.

482
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,980
Mommy

483
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,780
He promised his mom

484
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,020
not to cry.

485
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,820
Do not cry, do not cry.
Today I will not cry.

486
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,060
I have decided not to cry.

487
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,140
Using the spare bag that the mother packed.

488
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,680
The mother
is remarkable.

489
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,620
As the mother said: "if you feel like crying
then look at mount Fuji."

490
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,280
All good. I won't cry.

491
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,780
Is the daikon alright?

492
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,600
It's no good if it becomes small.

493
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,750
But the daikon
is disappearing

494
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,750
Don't cry








Don't cry








Don't cry

495
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,320
Having overcome the urge to cry
the heavy carrying Shougo has come this far.

496
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,700
What? Is the daikon alright?

497
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,080
Hasn't it become small?

498
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,360
It's chafing, it's chafing.
It's chafing on the ground.

499
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,740
It sure was a big daikon.

500
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,800
It's being grated.

501
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,960
The beige house over there is sister Chi's house.

502
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,360
She is mother's cousin so they often come here.

503
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,840
Oh noes, there is a dog.

504
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,290
Woof

505
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,360
Got to escape.

506
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,090
I dropped it.

507
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,340
The bag ripped.

508
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,420
Have to overcome the disaster.
Won't cry this time.

509
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,260
Admirable.

510
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,670
Malt daikon.

511
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,720
He can't carry
all this.

512
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,280
He even became able to carry the entire daikon.

513
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,220
He sure has dragged it a lot.

514
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,240
So short.

515
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,000
Facing his fears.

516
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,860
Yes. I made it safely.

517
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,440
Phew, arrival.

518
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,980
Why is he still holding two?

519
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,680
I see, for Runa's house.

520
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,880
Pass the scary dog again.

521
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
Don't look, don't look

522
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,980
Yes, yes. If I don't look it won't be scary.

523
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,420
Runa's house is here.

524
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,420
No one is here so I will just leave it.

525
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,420
This is where
he leaves it?

526
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,990
Shou?

527
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,260
Where is
your mom?

528
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,020
This is Runa's mamma.

529
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,000
Mom is home.

530
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,860
You came
by yourself?

531
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,050
Yep.

532
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,160
That's so amazing. I got a phone call about it.

533
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,920
When it runs out I will personally bring you some more.

534
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,040
Thank you.

535
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,400
You came by yourself?
That's remarkable.

536
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,080
This is Runa who is the same age.

537
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,080
A policeman!

538
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,560
It's a cameraman.

539
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
A policeman.

540
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,120
Be careful.

541
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,550
He will arrest you.

542
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,390
Walk properly.

543
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,940
Suspicious.

544
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,380
Scary.

545
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,920
Please don't arrest me.

546
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,560
Bye bye

547
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,100
Bye bye.

548
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,940
Mother has called Chi and explained that something nice will arrive.

549
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,000
TN: Not actually his sister. He uses a honorific used
for someone who is like an older sister figure.

550
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,100
Sister
Chi.

551
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,200
Yes.

552
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,070
Malt daikon here.

553
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,300
It's you Shougo?

554
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,720
What? It's the daikon from before.

555
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,800
Ah, despite all his hardships it has become this small.

556
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,400
Where did you bring it from?

557
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,560
From the nursery school.

558
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,660
Nursery school?

559
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,100
Yep.

560
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,840
It used to be the biggest one.

561
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,280
Shou, you brought it?

562
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,960
It has become
grated daikon.

563
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,680
Mana has a cold.

564
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,340
Show us how you cut it at your home. Let's do it together.

565
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,340
Careful of your fingers.

566
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,360
So skilled.

567
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,260
Indeed, this is how you put it in.
Just like how your mother taught you.

568
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,620
5 minutes later.
Wow, we put more daikon in it than mother.

569
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,290
It's true.

570
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,290
the juice

571
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,300
Brother Shougo brought this for you.

572
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,620
This will help cure your cold.

573
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,940
She licked it.

574
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,100
Even if it doesn't taste good.

575
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,920
Try it out like you always do with your mother.

576
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,560
Did the mother's errand succeed or not?

577
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,760
Okay.

578
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,560
Okay, okay.

579
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,580
Not scared of a simple dog anymore.

580
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,680
I am not afraid

581
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
See? I am composed.

582
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,600
Maybe a bit scared still.

583
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,920
Bye bye.

584
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,960
Shougo has grown a lot.

585
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,280
Chi called mother right away and said:

586
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,900
"He was such a cry baby yesterday
what he accomplished today really surprised me."

587
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,800
Bye bye.

588
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,540
He returns home bigger and stronger.

589
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,540
Mother.

590
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,140
I'm coming home.

591
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,800
What's up?

592
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,280
Did you go?

593
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,280
Yes.

594
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,120
You are amazing.

595
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,940
Mom, I can do it.

596
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,200
Awesome. It's so amazing that you could.

597
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,900
Did you cry, though?

598
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,900
I totally did.

599
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,360
Shou, you might be greater than mount Fuji.

600
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,040
Fight!

601
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,040
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

602
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,280
Dad will be surprised.

603
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,180
Nine years

604
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,180
later

605
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,780
Was it really
that long ago?

606
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,240
Are you always preparing the daikon like this?

607
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,920
13 years old

608
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,920
Shougo

609
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,240
Yes.

610
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,900
Shougo is in 2nd grade of middle school.

611
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,060
He can even grate daikon now.

612
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,100
So you like
to cook?

613
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,140
I like it relatively.

614
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
On what
occasion?

615
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,630
When my mother is (coming home) late.

616
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,470
I think about what I want to make for her.

617
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,140
I will peek into the fridge and notice potatoes

618
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,280
so I start to wonder what can be made with potatoes

619
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,110
I will look into it and find out.

620
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,300
He finds it on the Internet.

621
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,340
What makes you want to make this for her?

622
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,360
Because she is always working so hard on her job.

623
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,440
Mix potatoes, starch and milk.

624
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,360
What is today's meal?

625
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,560
It's imo (potato) mochi.

626
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,260
Imomochi?

627
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,840
Mash the potatoes until soft.

628
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:15,220
If you don't
straighten it thin

629
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,220
it will become
like powder

630
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
I see.

631
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,740
I make
it round

632
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,210
and stretch
it thinner.

633
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,580
He puts cheese in it.

634
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,880
Instead of
salad oil

635
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,880
I usually
use butter

636
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,980
The flavor
is strong

637
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,980
which makes
it delicious.

638
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,880
It's done after being heated on both sides.

639
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,290
It's finished.

640
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
It's imomochi.

641
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,760
No way!

642
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,060
It's

643
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,060
Shou-made 「Imomochi」

644
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,800
- I'm home.
- Welcome home.

645
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,020
Today, mother comes home all happy.

646
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,810
We will add
grated daikon
for today.

647
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,560
They also add grated daikon?

648
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,110
Thanks for
the food.

649
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,110
Please enjoy.

650
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,020
Just right.

651
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,890
It's fluffy.
Just like always.

652
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,790
Thank you.

653
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,980
Mana has come over to play.

654
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,120
She's the baby from before.

655
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,820
She is in 5th grade in primary school.

656
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,730
Mana

657
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,820
No way.

658
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,860
She is destined to eat what Shougo makes for her.

659
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,560
Be honest if it's bad.

660
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,260
Delicious?

661
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,260
Delicious

662
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,000
She has become somewhat better at complimenting.

663
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,980
I also want to meet Runa.

664
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,580
So I decided to call her.

665
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
Runa?

666
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,580
They've come so...

667
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,580
What will do you? Can you come?

668
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,030
Right away!?

669
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,480
That embarrassing thing years ago.

670
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,300
What is she saying?

671
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,320
Wait 10 to 15 minutes.

672
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,160
10 to 15 minutes? Okay, okay.

673
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,880
We decided to go over there instead.

674
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,660
Runa is also in 2nd grade of middle school.
They are in the same class.

675
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,780
Runa

676
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,220
'day.

677
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:07,780
TN: It's worth noting that they use san next to her name - unlike what they did to Shougo - to treat her as an adult since she is a bit embarrassed by the past.

678
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,020
It's Runa.

679
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,780
I hate this.

680
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,380
Is that a policeman?

681
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,800
Yes, it's the same cameraman from that time.

682
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,480
What will he introduce us to this time in the staff room?

683
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,600
Seems like he has given up.

684
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,080
What's up with this coffee.

685
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,970
Smash in one of those that go grr grrr

686
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,970
buy it!

687
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,000
Is that possible?

688
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Remember to put the recording equipment back.

689
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:39,050
What a plain-looking boombox.

690
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,260
We value our things. We have made the program for 20 years now.

691
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,950
Isn't it too plain-looking?

692
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,420
The chair is new.

693
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,400
Can't you use a nicer chair?

694
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,100
Is it not good?

695
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,180
It's no good. The dreams. The children's dreams.

696
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,520
Little by little we have surpassed the 20 year anniversary for the first episode.

697
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,000
It's like

698
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,000
my own neighborhood

699
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,000
that you are filming.

700
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,200
That's because we film from the perspective of a neighborhood.

701
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,980
"My First Errand" is wonderful.

702
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,980
No no.

703
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,440
Really.

704
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,310
Gotcha

705
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,310
Gotcha

706
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,500
What is that?

707
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,340
There was a gotcha.

708
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,400
What was gotcha again?

709
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,700
I remember! Choo choo.

710
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,860
What was it again? Oh, it was that. Gotcha.

711
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,320
Presenting Gotcha

712
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,320
Roar with laughter!

713
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,660
Tatsuya
4 years

714
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,200
This talkative brother just loves TV commercials

715
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,960
and his little brother follows suit.

716
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,040
Both the nursery school teachers and people from the neighborhood agree

717
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,440
Sacchan talks funny. That's what they say.

718
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,640
Their house is a store that's why he is so talkative.

719
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,900
Helping out today?

720
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,360
Here?

721
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,650
Yes, put
it there.

722
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,140
Here? Next to it?

723
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,240
This is Sea bream ● Japanese butterfish ● Tuna

724
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,240
This is Sea bream ● Japanese butterfish ● Tuna

725
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,240
This is Sea bream ● Japanese butterfish ● Tuna

726
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,460
The dad thought up an errand to make him buy an important item used in the store.

727
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,420
Look here Tatsuya, what has happened here?

728
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,440
The bulb has burned out.

729
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,070
LED Reflector Lamp

730
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,360
Has it happened again? Without the reflector lamp the sashimi won't look as appetizing.

731
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,180
Mom has thought of an errand.

732
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
There is no pacifier.

733
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,220
It has been lost. He will have to buy a new one for his little brother.

734
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,000
Not here?

735
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,380
Tacchan, can you go?

736
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,120
I will go.

737
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,900
Do your best.

738
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:33,900
Drugstore

739
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:33,900
Home

740
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:33,900
Home center

741
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,280
He will buy the lamp at the store with the red sign.

742
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,960
And a pacifier for his little brother at the drug store.

743
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,600
Even if Tatsuya is by himself he talks all the time.

744
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,300
Walking, walking, walking.

745
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,480
If I keep walking

746
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,880
won't I arrive?

747
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,840
The name of the lamp is difficult.

748
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,190
Reflector lamp

749
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,600
Indeed, reflector lamp.

750
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,220
We have told the store in advance that a camera man will come inside.

751
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,580
But we haven't told them who will come and purchase what.

752
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,740
"Please do as you always do" is what we told them.

753
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,480
Sounds hard.

754
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,320
This person is the customer

755
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,320
even though he is small.

756
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,000
What?

757
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,480
Perhaps the shop personnel hasn't noticed?

758
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,980
One of our reflector lamps burned out.

759
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,660
Say it in a loud voice.

760
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,860
Talking about the reflector lamp. It burned out.

761
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,840
Did it burn out?

762
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,360
We are fishmongers.

763
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,240
You have a fish store?

764
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,000
After it burned out we went into deep consideration about what to do

765
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,740
Then my mom said "go by yourself and get it".

766
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,570
What did you
come to
purchase?

767
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,970
Reflector lamp

768
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,970
Reflector lamp

769
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,660
I told you from the start that I want to buy a reflector lamp.

770
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,900
It's over here. There.

771
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,540
You finally get it. Reflector lamp.

772
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,300
Is this it? Reflector lamp.

773
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,980
Can you take it with you?

774
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,880
It's such a difficult thing to buy.

775
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:18,800
This is the correct item but this product is slightly different from our usual.

776
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,060
Is there another kind?

777
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,340
Amazing.

778
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,140
There is a different one but...

779
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,800
Here we go again.

780
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,320
Yeah, it was different but one burned out. So...

781
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,380
I see.

782
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,740
Thank you for going with it, sister.

783
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,860
Tatsuya's talking engine has been kickstarted.

784
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,660
Next is his brother's pacifier.

785
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,680
Not talkifier, pacifier.

786
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,000
A pacifier please. Remember to say that.

787
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,980
Welcome.

788
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,620
Hey you, gotcha.

789
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:47,960
What?

790
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,760
Gotcha is totally lost.

791
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,240
Gotcha?

792
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,500
Gotcha is lost.

793
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,260
Do you understand "to lose"?

794
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,200
*Mumbling* Rikuto.

795
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,000
Rikuto...  gotcha... lost. What?

796
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,350
Gotcha!

797
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,800
Cameraman please make it clear. What is gotcha?

798
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,060
We don't know.

799
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,020
Sorry, some assistance please.

800
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,840
Hey, it's a pacifier.

801
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,920
Tatsuya doesn't get it.
Why don't you know gotcha?

802
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,580
Get me a real adult.

803
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,620
Please, can you take care of this customer?

804
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,620
Someone must know. Since there are so many people here.

805
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:35,010
Veteran
shop employee.

806
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,280
Where is the gotcha? Gotcha.

807
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:40,150
Rikuto's gotcha. Where is it?

808
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,540
Just as expected from a veteran.
She knows what a gotcha is.

809
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,020
That's what we thought but then she just got another person from the back office.

810
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,200
Gotcha.

811
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,240
Gotcha?

812
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,280
It's a gotcha.

813
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,000
It belongs to Riku.

814
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,960
Then he lost it. We can't find it anywhere.

815
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,200
What is it used for?

816
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,400
Let me see. It's used for sleeping.

817
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,920
Used for sleeping?

818
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,540
That's what a gotcha is.

819
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,400
Used when sleeping?

820
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,160
Can't know.

821
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,760
And...

822
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,900
In the shop... until noon.

823
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,100
Sleeping until afternoon.

824
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,020
Since he eats lunch.

825
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,020
At that time.

826
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,460
During that time he uses the gotcha.

827
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,940
The staff hurries to the mother and asks her.

828
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,240
We need to ask you.

829
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,280
What happened?

830
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,180
What is a gotcha?

831
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,860
A pacifier. A pacifier.

832
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,180
A pacifier?

833
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,040
How did it become a gotcha?

834
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,460
When Rikuto finds the pacifier he gladly proclaims "gotcha!"

835
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,380
so Rikuto calls pacifiers for gotchas.

836
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,620
Doesn't Tatsuya know it's called a pacifier?

837
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,500
How could he know?

838
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,490
It's a gotcha, you know.

839
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,920
That's right, a gotcha.

840
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,560
It's a gotcha. That's what they are.

841
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,300
Was it really a gotcha...?

842
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,100
Gotcha is just fine.

843
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,970
Gotcha

844
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,080
Is it called a gotcha?

845
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,060
It must be hard for him.

846
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,710
It's not
something
you eat?

847
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,100
You shouldn't never eat it.

848
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,650
Do you
put it on
your head?

849
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,840
What will you do if you put it on your head?

850
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,080
Wrong

851
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,990
You chew on it.

852
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,920
Exactly, it's a pacifier. What a great kid. Now the store manager has to know.

853
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,900
Is this it?

854
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,240
It's a bit too small.

855
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,000
Actually, it is breast goods.

856
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,500
What a tough situation. Maybe they've sold out of gotchas.

857
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Found it here.

858
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,560
It is there.

859
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,920
-This thing here?
-No.

860
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,820
It is yellow here.
And there is no Winnie-the-Pooh on it.

861
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,160
That's how a proper gotcha looks.

862
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,280
Please have a look and tell me which one.

863
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,740
-Among these?
-Which?

864
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,560
-Like Ronald McDonald's...
-Ronald's?

865
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,040
Ronald's...

866
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,560
-The normal kind.
-Normal?

867
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
Found it

868
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,900
Found it

869
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,080
This this.

870
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,120
This indeed.

871
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,180
Found it. This is it. Finally found it.

872
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,500
Found it.

873
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,880
Gotcha           found it.

874
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,660
This here is a gotcha.

875
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,150
「Gotcha」

876
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,500
The yellow and blue kind.

877
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,400
Precisely the same as the one Rikuto has.

878
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,280
Congratulations, big brother.

879
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,140
There are so many adults who are unfamiliar with gotchas.

880
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,340
Even that man following me didn't know.

881
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,070
I went by myself.

882
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,600
Welcome back. Did you come back from shopping?

883
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,940
I went by myself.

884
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,780
All by yourself? Oh, father is waiting. Hurry up.

885
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,780
Yes, the lamp.

886
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,360
This is great.

887
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,500
Amazing.

888
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,220
Did it.

889
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,180
It's bright now.

890
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,700
What is this?

891
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,350
Gotcha

892
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,960
Is it a gotcha?

893
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,920
No mistake about it.

894
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,330
Wakayama castle

895
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,080
In Wakayama castle Yoshimune was born as the Tokugawa shogunate.

896
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,080
Speaking about lords, doesn't that make you think of umeboshi?

897
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,600
Here is a shop that sells luxury umeboshi.

898
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,800
Please regard these optimal

899
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,240
a vast amount of the most luxurious plumps.

900
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,460
At this shop the one who will go on their first errand is

901
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:34,320
Ririi

902
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,320
4 years
3 months

903
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,480
Ririi who is refined like an adult.

904
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,240
Please give a hand over where.

905
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,420
She is very self-composed.

906
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,460
She never troubles her mother.

907
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,220
And often helps out.

908
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,360
Even friends of the mother say: "She is like an adult".

909
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,660
Though she is
at such a
young age.

910
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,540
She is like a mother.

911
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,700
Yeah, she's great.

912
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,380
She's still a child, though.

913
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,340
Cute.

914
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,660
Grandmother often visits and

915
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,840
they often go shopping in the neighborhood together.

916
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,880
Great. Just like me.

917
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,850
Mama...

918
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,850
Tomorrow,
we will get
some visitors

919
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,720
Can you go
and purchase
umeboshi?

920
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,460
Yes.

921
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,380
Two of mothers friends will come from Tokyo.

922
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:21,300
The umeboshi's
name is

923
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,300
「Kuu」

924
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,300
Kuu!

925
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,300
I understand.

926
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,360
Kuu (sky) refers to the size of the box.

927
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,560
The size for a personal gift.

928
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,710
Kuu sized

929
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,800
Honey and
shiso
(a mint plant)
please.

930
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,380
Honey and shiso please.

931
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,080
Okay. Great.

932
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,300
They are ordering two kinds, made with honey and shiso.

933
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,450
Today is
my birthday.
I would like
to eat some cake.

934
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,450
You can!

935
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,000
Can you buy it for me?

936
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,260
What I want
from the
cake shop

937
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,130
is 「cabbage」.

938
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,630
Roger that.

939
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,380
Cabbage from the cake shop?

940
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,060
Sprinkling macha powder on huge cream puffs

941
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,940
wow, it looks like cabbage.

942
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,620
Looks tasty.

943
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,570
Money for visiting
Ksitigarbha*.

944
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,570
TN: Ksitigarbha is a bodhisattva who looks over children, travelers and the underworld

945
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,940
I will

take it

in my hand.

946
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,640
You will hold it in your hand?

947
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,960
Same as when she goes with grandmother.

948
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,180
I will depart!

949
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,040
Yes.

950
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,780
Will you
be fine?

951
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,780
I will be fine!

952
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,960
-See you.
-See you.

953
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,790
Take care.

954
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,120
I will.

955
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,300
When people say she is adult-like this could this be it?

956
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,720
Pink boots and strawberry fur coat.

957
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,120
Cute.

958
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,020
Making a fine face.

959
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,500
We can now see the shop for the luxury umeboshi.

960
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,880
Looking right, looking left and then right again.

961
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,840
Even if there are no cars she is a kid who does what she sets out to do.

962
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,900
This is not the kind of shop where a kid goes inside by themself.

963
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,340
Can she carry herself as an adult?

964
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,720
Welcome.

965
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,920
Shiso and

966
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,620
Hello.

967
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,920
honey,

968
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,920
please.

969
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,920
She remembered.

970
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,500
Honey and what?

971
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,200
Shiso please.

972
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
Honey and shiso.

973
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,500
What honey
did mother
say?

974
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,200
Kuu

975
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,200
「Kuu」,
you are
awesome.

976
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,200
I was so nervous.

977
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,840
Will you eat
umeboshi?

978
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,710
Yeah

979
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,420
Since we are being refined

980
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,740
we will sample the umeboshi with some warm tea.

981
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,740
Just like a proper adult.

982
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,980
Here you go valued customer.

983
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,480
She seems
a bit perplexed.

984
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,960
Yeah.

985
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
What a gracefully light-colored tea cup.

986
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,340
Get a good grip on it.

987
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,360
Will she
find it
palatable?

988
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,260
What a refined way to hold it.

989
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,220
It's hot.

990
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,040
She totally drinks
like an adult.

991
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,700
They are using a pretty nice tea here.

992
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,340
My mother loves umeboshi

993
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,340
Does she?

994
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,400
Here you go.

995
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,840
Please flatter a bit more.

996
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,860
This is her first time trying umeboshi.

997
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,540
First experience.

998
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,020
Wonder how
she'll react.

999
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,960
A bit
too sour?

1000
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,120
Sorry.

1001
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,080
What an adult taste.

1002
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,420
"I will put your change in" thinks the shop assistant.

1003
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,180
I will give it to Ksitigarbha

1004
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,980
so I will hold it in my hands.

1005
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,500
You will
hold it?
Okay.

1006
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,880
For Ksitigarbha? I apologize.

1007
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,920
Since I couldn't enjoy the umeboshi

1008
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,960
I hope I behaved well today.

1009
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,960
Maybe I didn't.

1010
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,650
Thank you
very much.

1011
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,180
It's fine. Looks like I didn't do badly.

1012
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,720
I am able to do this errand just like an adult.

1013
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,380
Next is the cake.

1014
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,120
This is Ririi who has finished purchasing luxury umeboshi.

1015
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,200
If it is a cake shop then I can go in without constraints.

1016
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,200
Despite there being no customer on the other side the door moves.

1017
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,780
She noticed.

1018
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,410
Welcome.
Hello.

1019
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,380
Her face is relaxed.

1020
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,390
What do
YOU want?

1021
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,390
What looks
good?

1022
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,620
The cream puff that looks like a cabbage, right?

1023
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,580
This one?

1024
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,280
Strawberry short cake?

1025
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,420
It has been purchased.

1026
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,160
Oh yeah, even the coat is strawberry.

1027
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,960
She must really like strawberry.

1028
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,240
It's fine.

1029
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,240
It's supposed
to cabbage.

1030
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,240
It's fine.

1031
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,660
On the way is Ksitigarbha.

1032
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,000
Holding on to the 25 yen all this time they've gotten warm.

1033
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,200
It is said that this will double your chance*.

1034
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,200
TN: 20 and 5 yen sounds like doubling your chances.

1035
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,520
She is putting it in
correctly.

1036
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,300
She's great.

1037
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,900
She is.

1038
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,300
She must do this
often with grandmother.

1039
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,080
I love my mother so much.

1040
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,600
What a great child.

1041
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,200
She sure is.

1042
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:59,010
Mama!

1043
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,180
Yes?

1044
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,610
I bought cake and umeboshi.

1045
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,180
That was quick.

1046
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,480
I am surprised.

1047
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,080
She was faster than her mother.

1048
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,020
Perfect.
You got the
right thing.

1049
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,900
This and this.

1050
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,680
Mother, we have one unfortunate announcement.

1051
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,030
Isn't it too small?

1052
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,620
What is this?

1053
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,940
Isn't this Ririi's favorite cake?

1054
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,170
Definitely!!

1055
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,460
Got you good.

1056
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,820
It's fine. I can eat strawberry.

1057
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,260
"My first errand - Never give up - Baby Special"

1058
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,680
It really is amazing to see when children do their best.

1059
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,380
I shouldn't lose to their spirit.

1060
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,100
Oh yeah, the band that sings the theme song "B.B.Queens"

1061
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,500
They are currently in the studio recording a new album.

1062
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,740
We will be the first to bring you
"Never give up, baby" 2011 version.

1063
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:05,310
Never give up, Baby

1064
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,840
Let's give it a listen.

1065
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:13,720
Never give up, baby  go to sleep and feel better

1066
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:21,290
Don't you worry about mother's needs

1067
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:29,170
Never give up, baby   let's go for a walk

1068
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:36,470
Let's look for a flower bouquet and go home

1069
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:49,720
More than dad I know the kindness of mother's eyes

1070
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:57,330
The beauty boasts of me and is my best friend

1071
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:04,800
I only have one request don't throw thunder around me

1072
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:12,040
because both dad and I will be good kids

1073
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:20,980
Never give up, baby let's drink the two of us

1074
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:28,420
half of the milk is left     just don't cry

1075
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:36,800
Don't give up, baby when you grow up

1076
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:43,340
I will definitely present my bride to you, mother

1077
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,300
July the 18th on marine day we will bring you another special

1078
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,300
It's starting. Don't lose to the children!
