00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Traslation: Zurui

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,300
(Aho = Idiot or Idiotic)

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,740
The stars sure are pretty, huh?

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,820
Yeah

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,820
When you grow up, what will you become?

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,700
Probably a housewife...

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,300
Really?

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,140
If your wife.. I mean... groom was in front of your eyes right now, what would you do?

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,940
Huh?

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,020
Close your eyes

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,380
Guess who!

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,940
That voice is...

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,820
Ho Ho alien!

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,900
What are you doing?!

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:51,060
If you want this woman back, give me your father's automobile blueprints

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,940
Don't be stupid!

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,620
If you don't give it to me, this woman gets...

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,820
Watch ya gonna do? Watch ya gonna do?

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,340
I still didn't get to do anything with her!

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,220
Shut up!

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,980
Stop it!

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,220
Stop it!

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,220
I said to stop!

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,460
What ya gonna do? What ya gonna do?

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,460
It can't be helped!

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,780
Aho Aho man, help me!!

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,780
That last move was pretty awesome huh?

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,340
Aho Aho man
- Yeah?

29
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,740
He caught my girlfriend!

30
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,740
Please do something!
- OK!

31
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,460
Aho Aho Wagashi!!

32
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,460
*Wagashi = Japanese sweets

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,500
The Aho Aho Wagashi expires today

34
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,700
That has nothing to do with this!

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,020
What are you doing? Do something!

36
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,460
OK!

37
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,540
Aho Aho Water!!

38
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,420
Where are you aiming?!

39
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,700
The shock to Aho Aho man's head
does something unexpected

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,860
Kentaro-kun

41
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,860
Huh?

42
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,740
I...

43
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,140
I feel like I've been in a long dream

44
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,180
What?

45
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,100
What am I doing in these embarrassing clothes?

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,340
What happened Aho Aho man?

47
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,740
From now on, I will be a true hero!

48
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,140
For your sake

49
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,580
I will fight for this earth!

50
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,100
Aho AHo man!

51
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,140
You punk!

52
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,860
Punk... I'm a Ho Ho alien!

53
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,180
Get out of here now!

54
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,500
Damn it!

55
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,540
Wind 7 meters... North by Northwest... OK... got it!

56
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,300
I didn't see the punch!

57
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,420
He was just here!

58
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,500
Ladies don't belong in a fight

59
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,460
Aho Aho man, you're great!

60
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,180
Sorry it took so long!

61
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,300
Thank you Aho Aho man!
- Yes

62
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,500
Thank goodness

63
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,140
He got a shock to his head again

64
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,740
What are you doing?!

65
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,260
Yuko-chan!
