1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,660
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,600
Jungle Pocket Saito's Shichi-Henge!

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,280
Downtown - Matsumoto Hitoshi & Hamada Masatoshi

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,410
Today is our 48th episode

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,520
That's right, also

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:06:28,930
shionnotsukai.wordpress.com

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,940
This ceiling is so low

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,890
Its echo is amazing, I can still hear you

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,260
They told us to keep it down

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,260
But why?

11
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,650
I don't want to

12
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,920
You would be too noisy

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,920
I won't, I'm just praising them

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
It would bother

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,200
Come on, I don't like this

16
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,730
One more time, please

17
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:34,760
First tim--

18
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,830
Enough!

19
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,430
Alright, let's call them

20
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,800
Jungle Pocket please, come here!

21
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,900
It's a pleasure

22
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,470
Good morning

23
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,710
Thank you, good morning

24
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,260
48th challenger

25
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,260
Jungle Pocket: Oota Hirohisa, Saito Shinji, Otake

26
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,780
You're not doing this as a trio?

27
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,500
No, just Saito

28
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,750
I'll do it on my own

29
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,850
Will it be ok?

30
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,350
It will

31
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,080
I guess when you think of "Saito"

32
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,570
Trendy Angel
Saito

33
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,820
You think of Saito from Trendy Angel

34
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,800
Ohh, I guess so

35
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,570
You should stop being "Saito"

36
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,940
How about "Kinoshita" or such instead?

37
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,940
Come on, I'm Saito

38
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,430
And it's Mr. Saito for you!

39
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,230
That was uncalled for

40
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,630
What a great day, today

41
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,780
I'm pumped!

42
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,040
I'm full of energy, you heard me!

43
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,940
Which position are you aiming for?

44
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, Bob Sapp isn't a comedian, right?

45
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,890
Bob Sapp: 4th on the list

46
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,910
That's right

47
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,280
Then I'm aiming higher than that, for sure

48
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,580
I'm not going to lower your expectations

49
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,220
I won't make any excuse about being nervous

50
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
I see

51
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,790
I'll go full power on this!

52
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,700
Who's the same age as you?

53
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,590
Naomi Watanabe

54
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,490
Naom-- oh, she did this before?

55
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,840
Naomi Watanabe...

56
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,370
She didn't

57
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,400
Yamazaki, are you a senior to them?

58
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,160
Are you asking me if I'm older then them?

59
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,440
Tsukitei Housei

60
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,440
I'm hella older then them!

61
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,330
We're like 20 years old apart

62
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,840
Oh is that so? I thought you were closer

63
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,410
No way, not at all

64
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,520
Planning meeting

65
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,640
Man, you have tons of grey hair

66
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:56,950
Zaki-san

67
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,710
I thought getting a haircut would cover it a bit

68
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,550
It's pretty amazing

69
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,890
The white ones are increasing

70
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,480
Is that so?

71
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:04,820
Hm

72
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:13,100
Shichi-henge: start!

73
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,320
They were great on that episode

74
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,890
Ohh, thank you

75
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,600
Just for once

76
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,760
They felt smooth

77
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
Smooth you say?

78
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,640
If you watch him like that on a 4k tv

79
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,510
You can see how nasty his skin is

80
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,110
How about this?

81
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,070
I mean, you can easily enter there, let's do this

82
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,690
"Our Tanaka ZIP! Live-broadcast, questions & limits challenge!"

83
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,690
_____________________________________________________

84
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,690
Let's take it to ZIP

85
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,550
Our Tanaka

86
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,620
I think if I show there as "Our Tanaka"

87
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,860
note: A gag from another episode | find it @ shionnotsukai.wordpress.com

88
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,860
They won't ever call me again!!

89
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,860
That's not the point

90
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,120
What time is your show?

91
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,630
At 16:00

92
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,730
At 16:00, yes

93
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,320
Let's ask your lover first

94
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,560
What are you talking about-

95
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,630
Excuse me

96
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,860
I'm entering

97
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,860
Oh, sorry, excuse me

98
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,100
Well

99
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,500
I'll be your manager from now on

100
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,540
My name's Saito

101
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,040
Before you I used to be

102
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,240
2016 - New Member: Saito Shinji

103
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,620
The manager from Chidori, the duo

104
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,480
Lots of stuff happened with them

105
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,250
I know it sounds cheeky, but Chidori received

106
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,920
Chidori

107
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,920
A lot of advice from me when they came to Tokyo

108
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,780
At first, when they had shows in Kansai

109
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,460
Whenever there was a filming,
everyone thought they were there

110
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,390
But when they came to Tokyo,
at first they couldn't fit in

111
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,200
Nobu at first was a more playful character

112
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
And that made him kind of famous

113
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,570
But...

114
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,800
I told him that he could easily
become a great tsukkomi

115
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,950
I thought he wasn't being persuasive,
maybe because he was made fun of

116
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,010
But I knew he could do more

117
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,550
And when I told him to do like that,
he did, and started changing

118
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,360
And now they're having great success

119
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,490
So...

120
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,660
So I'd like to have a talk

121
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,090
With your current members,
to make Yoshimoto better

122
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,240
And maybe give you some good advice

123
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,100
First off

124
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,030
Let's talk about Cocorico

125
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes?

126
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,850
Maybe it's not really
something good to say, but...

127
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,140
I don't think there's

128
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,140
Something special in your duo

129
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,740
I mean, as a duo

130
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,450
Of course you have the right spirit,
but your explosive power...

131
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,010
There's nothing special in it, isn't it?

132
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,320
No explosive power

133
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,720
罰金 = fine (1000￥)

134
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,320
That's not something good

135
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,050
I think that's your weakness

136
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,520
I don't even know what to say to you

137
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,790
It's so difficult when it comes to Cocorico!

138
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,390
Like, a lot!

139
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,180
I think you can solve this together

140
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,030
If you start thinking about it

141
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,870
I guess you can move
on to the upper stage

142
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,070
Am I right, Matsumoto-san?

143
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,140
Yes?

144
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,040
Let's change this Cocorico

145
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,240
Alright, we got it
- You got it? Good

146
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,080
Housei-san

147
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,280
I think you are

148
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,790
A really good person

149
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,250
But when you try to make
someone laugh, it backfires

150
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,800
Well, that's because you're
surrounded by such monsters

151
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,160
You're not the type who
can make someone laugh

152
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,430
Face it, Housei-san

153
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,060
Still

154
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,160
The problem here is Downtown

155
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,410
It's actually them

156
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,500
You know

157
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,240
Can I say it loud and clear?

158
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,750
I think you're not funny
when you're in tv shows like this

159
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,170
As much as you act like a duo

160
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,520
I wanted to say that

161
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,960
You're definitely better as a duo

162
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,080
Also, you're not feeling
that greedy, lately

163
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,450
You're not feeling it, right?

164
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,160
You're feeling pretty
satisfied, ain't you?

165
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,420
He's really satisfied!

166
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,890
He's ok with it

167
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,560
But you see

168
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,160
You should aim higher than that

169
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,560
Get one level higher

170
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,070
No, you could aim for two

171
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,640
If something can change now

172
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,000
That's you

173
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,960
Hamada-san

174
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,850
You can change as
a Downtown member

175
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,840
Do your best to become the
comedians I want to you to be

176
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,450
Please

177
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,220
Oh sorry, excuse me...

178
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,370
Yes, hello?

179
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,370
Yes

180
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,290
Your Shinkansen ticket?

181
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,290
Sorry

182
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,660
I'll take it for you, sorry for that

183
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,340
Please, put my advice into practice

184
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,340
Hamada-san

185
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,770
Now it's time to change

186
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,770
Excuse me

187
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,990
That was long!!

188
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,340

189
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,040
Yeah, sorry for that

190
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,220
You know

191
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,930

199
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,570
That Hamada's Cram School...?

200
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,200
What's that "Hamada's Cram School Trip"?

201
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
What is Yoshimoto doing?

202
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
I want to do that

203
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,510
Yeah but that's kind of...

204
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,120
Is there someone on his thirties here...?

205
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,390
Jusme?

206
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,340
Jusme

207
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,260
It's jusme

208
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,700
Someone with short sleeves?

209
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,900
Oh, jusme?!

210
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,720
It's jusme, oh, jusme

211
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Jusme?!

212
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,980

213
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,950
Oh, fromme?

214
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,920
Fromme

215
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,790

216
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,000

Who wants to go next?

224
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,920
Shoudigo?

225
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,390
Amigoin'?

226
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,430
Next one?

227
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,670
Come on, next one?

228
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,670
Isitme?!

229
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,970
Itzzme

230
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,100
Itzme

231
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Shoudigo?

232
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,550
Amigoin'?

233
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,550
Shoudi?

234
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,550
Itzme

235
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,450
Shoudido the last one?

236
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,470
How did this happen?

237
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,940
Wasitme?

238
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,140
Itwazme!

239
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:15,420
note: Atasu = weirdly pronounced "Watashi" ("I", "me")

240
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,030
One by one took so long!!

241
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,350
That was amazing, though

242
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,160
Was it a coincidence?
- It was

243
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,500
Was it?

244
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,970
staff) it was a coincidence

245
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,970
So it wasn't on purpose, huh

246
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,860
The best part was he turned it at the end

247
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,860
Don't you think?

248
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,570
I didn't know what was going on

249
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,900
It was a lucky first-shot

250
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,740
I wonder how it went yesterday

251
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,680
Yesterday was hard

252
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,680
Just thinking about it...

253
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,220
I think I really lost my temper there

254
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,250
I even read the horse name wrong

255
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,520
But still...

256
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,030
So today I started talking about the main race

257
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,360
But you see...

258
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,660
There are lots of match races

259
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,170
I have to take back the
money I've lost yesterday

260
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,600
I'm sure I can do it!

261
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,170
There are tons of em

262
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,810
I'll get some right for sure

263
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,370
Alright

264
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,610
Let's start the bets

265
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,820
You see at this point I think that

266
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,360
You can all go home by now

267
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,260
'Cause I think I can do yours too

268
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,540
But you see, the real problem
here is how will it unfold

269
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,040
I think it's going to change, so
you can't tell anything from the start

270
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,930
Geez... but

271
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,200
If that happens it's bad

272
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,270
'Cause it will be all about chances

273
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,870
But, you see...

274
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,100
Something like that can happen

275
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,510
The main problem is
once the 1,9 km is passed

276
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,450
Just after the 1,9 km distance

277
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,850
There aren't much choices after that

278
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,390
Ugh.. this is...

279
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,690
Here

280
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,550
This is... here

281
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,300
You saw it, right?

282
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,200
The forecast

283
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,160
And you came here 'cause you saw it

284
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,040
But why did you look at it?

285
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,040
Doesn't it ruin it?

286
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,960
Don't underestimate us risk takers

287
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,280
It's not good, really

288
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
Got it?

289
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,220
What's the point on coming
here if so? Think about that

290
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,660
So goddamn persistent

291
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,080
Everyone: safe

292
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,800
All the way to the end

293
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,770
He likes horse races right?
I saw him on a show

294
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,650
He likes them, and plays too

295
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,370
I hope not like that

296
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,380
No but it's true

297
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,420
There are dopesters

298
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,520
Who use seals that quick in Oi Racecourse

299
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,190
I think he was mocking them

300
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:58,760
If so...

301
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,260
I think we have to apologize to them too

302
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,520
I guess it wasn't that clear

303
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,550
Where'd ya go?

304
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,550
Get outta here

305
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,090
Ya gettin' another one, ya punk

306
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,070
What the hell?

307
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,490
Couldn't they leave together before?

308
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,630
It stinks!!

309
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,400
It stinks
- It does stink

310
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,230
It reeks

311
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,700
Can we

312
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,530
Open the windows?

313
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,340
One spit would have been enough

314
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,890
Is there an air freshener?
- That should do it

315
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,940
It stinks!

316
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,910
Spray it over there

317
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,630
Sorry for this

318
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,970
We're sorry

319
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,270
This has to be done

320
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,850
Sorry for the trouble, we didn't know

321
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,420
I must say, this scene

322
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,590
Is making me wanna pay 1000 yen

323
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,410
This view is hilarious

324
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,910
Geez

325
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,260
What a weird way to bother someone

326
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,390
We're sorry!

327
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,390
\

328
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,860
The freshener didn't do much

329
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,710
First off, no need to be that nervous, ok?

330
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,270
I'm here today to give
you guys some advice

331
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,610
And I think it you
will benefit from it

332
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,960
First of all, why

333
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,450
You, why are you in this world?

334
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,650
Well, it's...

335
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,250
Since when I was little

336
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,430
I dreamed about getting on tv

337
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,000
I see

338
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:30,800
Look,

339
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,430
After all

340
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,210
I think that it's quite difficult to succeed

341
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,130
If you don't have the right attitude

342
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,180
To give to this industry
everything you got

343
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,070
Take me for example

344
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,720
I got my debut work

345
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,270
You know?

346
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,640
From an actress, and...

347
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,110
So, my debut work...

348
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,430
Its offer rained down on me

349
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,370
You know what made me have it?

350
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,790
Sleeping with her

351
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,730
The fact I slept with her

352
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,070
This feeling is important

353
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,800
And I know you guys

354
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,040
Haven't *** since ages

355
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,970
But if you do like me

356
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,850
You'll be rich

357
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,010
You'll get em all in your dressing room

358
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,710
And they'll jump towards you

359
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,750
Do you really think
it's not a bad life?

360
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,790
I even had this
bathrobe prepared ahead

361
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,090
That basically means I'm a king, right?

362
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:28,950
Right?

363
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,850
Isn't it so?

364
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,630
Anyway, I've been thinking

365
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,020
Your body is great, huh?

366
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,090
One can tell you worked out

367
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,040
But see, the problem is

368
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,010
Only 20% of nowadays
women likes macho men

369
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,510
The remaining 80% is different

370
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,410
You should know that feel, don't you?

371
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,410
That's why girls don't approach you

372
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:48,910
Really

373
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,470
What girls really like

374
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,840
Are plump guys, like me

375
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,250
This kind of body

376
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,720
It makes em feel protected

377
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,020
Or something like that

378
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,560
Don't you all think so?

379
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,230
Believe me

380
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,690
A woman feels secure with this

381
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,090
So, if you have time to
work out to become a macho

382
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,090
Find some time to
do researches on girls

383
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,940
You won't be able
to move on until you ****

384
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,380
Don't you want to get
in the real marketing worl--

385
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,430
See?

386
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,680
That's a sign

387
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,000
Come on...

388
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,600
Not fair

389
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,570
Seriously, think about that

390
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,180
All these happenings

391
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,260
That...

392
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,790
That was amazing

393
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,530
It felt like a forced termination

394
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,370
＊all the collected money will be devolved by NTV to the Kobato cultural company

395
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,620
I mean, the chime and everything

396
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,540
Even the falling thing over there, all coincidences

397
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,570
Could it be that he knew we had the windows opened?

398
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,100
That's possible, you're right

399
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,330
It could be

400
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,280
Sorry for that

401
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,280
Also, Endo, he asked you that

402
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,470
And you replied with
your honest comedian feelings

403
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,770
That felt weird

404
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,770
How about something more

405
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,100
Abstract?

406
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,350
Well, he asked me "why am I in this world"

407
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,830
coming next: a man who will perform "chicken rice"!

408
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,250
I tought "man, Endo's such an idiot"!

That's all we have

445
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,490
Everyone, get out

446
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,490
Get out, quick

447
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,430
Get away from here

448
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,230
Listen to me

449
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,230
I came from the future

450
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,240
A meteorite is about
to crash right here

451
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,340
You know what it means?

452
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,720
If a meteorite crashes down, Gaki will end

453
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,940
I came from the future
so I know that for sure

454
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,610
The meteorite is about to---
get out, quick!!

455
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,710
Run away, now!

456
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,180
It's not saf--- here comes!

457
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,030
Get away from here, now!

458
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,760
Do you want Gaki to end?!

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,690
Get outta here!

460
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,730
Go away!

00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,630
Matumoto, get away

463
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,870
Why are you not going away?

464
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,270
Just get away!

465
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,810
Cocorico!

466
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,070
Get away from here!

Quickly!

470
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,150
Please, get away now

471
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,360
Hamada...

472
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,390
Matsumoto...

473
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,340
Do you both want Gaki to end?!

474
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,460
Get outta here, it's going to explode

475
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,900
Quick

476
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,410
Just leave this to me

Macchan

478
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,250
Run away

479
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,140
Is it ok to you to let Gaki die?

480
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,610
Are you fine with it?!

481
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,080
Hamada...

482
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,610
What's wrong with you two?

483
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,280
Are you ok with it?

484
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,350
For real?!

485
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,560
Is it ok to you if this show ends?

486
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,760
What are you gonna do, Housei?

487
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,020
Am I right?

488
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,670
Are you ok with it?

489
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,920
Matsumoto...

490
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,660
Get over here

491
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,400
I'm stopping this meteorite for you

492
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,400
See? That's how much I care

493
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,230
But if that explodes

494
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,740
It's the end

495
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,110
Cocorico!!

496
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,350
That's your time to shine

497
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,780
Don't you want to get on stage again?!

498
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,410
Cocorico!

499
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,080
You know what to do, right?

500
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,590
What's with your lack of activity, recently?

501
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,590
Really, guys

502
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,190
This is your chance to show your strength!

503
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,330
Aim higher!

504
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,500
Hamada, you should be more greedy

505
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,110
One like you can go way higher

506
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,470
You guys...

507
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,770
I have to go, whatever happens

508
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,770
Get away from here

509
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,410
You can't let

510
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,810
Gakitsuka die!

511
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,150
It exploded

512
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,890
Hamadaaaaaa!

513
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,660
He wanted to say something at
the end, he shouted your name

514
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,300
I have no idea

515
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,170
Oh? Wait a second

516
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,000
That's a lot

517
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,970
It's 51'000 yen

518
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,340
What?!

519
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,640
51'000 yen

520
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,740
He placed sixth

521
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,770
51'000 yen?

522
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,570
Amazing!

523
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,370
Really, it is

524
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,210
Thank you!

525
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,650
You're sixth with 51'000 yen!

526
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,150
Sixth?!
- Yeah

527
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,180
I'm so happy

528
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,820
Let's ask the freshener about it

529
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,520
