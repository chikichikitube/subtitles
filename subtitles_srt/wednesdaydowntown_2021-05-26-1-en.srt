00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,450
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,790
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,640
Jinnai Tomonori

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,600
Always here

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,740
Okay, so what about this time?

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,680
I've brought a theory about love that's rarely seen on this show

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,610
This is it:

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:34,680
Among the people you know, if you confess in the order of how much you like them, and you'll find someone within 100 people, no matter who you are

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,130
What do you think, Matsumoto?

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,120
What'll happen with this I wonder

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,710
It's not about just finding anyone

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,960
You shouldn't treat love like a game?

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,060
No, definitely not

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,680
Otomo, what do you think of this project?

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,370
I think it is feasible

16
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,220
Isn't there a lot of couples in this world?

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,990
They can't all be each other's number one so...

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,940
Indeed, it must happen

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,750
Is it a male chasing female or female chasing male?

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,690
I think there'll be a big difference

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,070
If it's a woman after a man, I think it's quite feasible

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,160
Indeed, it's entirely possible

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,160
To be honest, this is usually how I do it

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,990
You go in an order?

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:31,040
Among the people you know, if you confess in the order of how much you like them, and you'll find someone within 100 people, no matter who you are

26
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,700
What'll happen?

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,440
This'll make hearts beat

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,270
The person who challenges this project today is

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,340
Who is this?

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,250
papa Hoshino Disco, 31 years old

31
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,620
Don't know him

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,120
Appearing as a finalist in King of Conte and R-1 Powerful artist

33
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,270
King of Conte?
- Really?

34
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,390
Hamada, he was on your show!

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,390
You remember?

36
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,800
Yes, yes, his song is very good

37
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,470
Recently, his single has been gaining attention as well

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,090
This song is indeed very popular

39
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,690
I've gone about six or seven years without a girlfriend

40
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,520
I've had no opportunities to meet anyone recently

41
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,740
So far, he's dated two women

42
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,740
Isn't he cute?

43
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,640
The three years between the ages of 21 and 24 and the second year of middle school, respectively

44
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,050
Dating in the second year of middle school is so early

45
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,500
I was just thinking that if I could use the power of variety shows

46
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,240
When you find a girlfriend, it's good

47
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,320
Wow, it's really a bit like a documentary

48
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,040
At the same time, I received a request from this show

49
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,950
So, he was given a week to think carefully about who he wanted to date

50
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,770
The day of confession has finally arrived

51
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,920
I am fully prepared

52
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,060
Still nervous though

53
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,930
But I'm determined to confess from now until I succeed

54
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,450
So, the women Hoshino wants to date

55
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,100
1st is

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,090
Actress Hinako Sakurai

57
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,980
No, no, no, no. This is not a serious choice, right?

58
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,750
The one he chose was actress Hinako Sakurai

59
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,610
It'd be strange to omit such a choice I guess

60
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,050
We've acted together before

61
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:17,940
We spent about a month together, including practice

62
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,780
No, no, no, no.

63
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,200
I feel we had a good thing going

64
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,110
It'd be weird to not include her, then

65
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,870
Although I also think it is probably impossible

66
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,590
If he likes her then yeah

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,440
But, I guess I still want to use this program to take the chance

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,710
Just give it a go

69
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,340
So, we bypassed the agency and contacted her directly

70
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,850
I'm so nervous

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,350
Straight up?

72
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,220
Hello?
-Hello?

73
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,020
Hello, huh?
-Uh, that...

74
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,290
I am papa's Hoshino Disco

75
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,000
Ah!

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,030
Is it okay to talk on the phone right now? Are you busy?

77
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,660
This is definitely not going to work

78
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,400
Ah, well...that... I'm practicing today too

79
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,210
Definitely can't get this nervous

80
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,670
It's that musical practice

81
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,710
Ah, practicing for the musical...

82
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,740
Yes. What can I do for you?

83
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,280
Ah, that... I'm just now...

84
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,200
How can I put it?

85
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,550
I just kind of wanted to call you

86
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,030
So I'm calling you

87
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,350
A bit scary...

88
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,720
Ah, okay

89
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,090
That, uh, that...

90
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,780
Gonna confess directly?

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,400
We've acted together on the stage, right?

92
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:38,540
I think... I like you a lot

93
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,420
Wow, scary

94
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,200
It's scary to confess to Sakurai

95
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,110
Hm

96
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,390
I think you're a very nice person

97
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,020
So, if possible, uh...

98
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,420
Would you go out with me?

99
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:57,190
Ah, I think you are a very nice person too

100
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:09,370
But how can I say it? I just see you as a friend, Hoshino

101
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,210
In other words...

102
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,610
Yeah, as expected

103
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,540
Well... ah, so that's how it is, huh?

104
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,880
But I'm happy that you confessed your feelings to me.
-Well...

105
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,020
If you don't mind, you can come and see my musical

106
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,590
More?

107
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,420
Ah, indeed

108
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,460
This isn't an announcement!

109
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,640
There will be a show in Tokyo from the 16th, if you can arrange it

110
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,760
I'll be sure to come
-Yes, yes, yes.

111
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,600
A new way to advertise!

112
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,500
It's over

113
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:45,300
When I was rejected, I was more upset than I thought.

114
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,450
I see

115
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,420
Change the mood quickly

116
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,650
Now i'll just focus on the memory of being invited to a musical

117
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,240
Next, the 2nd woman he wants to go out with

118
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,240
Needs to pick up the mood

119
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:01,640
2nd is Tomite Ami

120
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,940
Look, here we go again

121
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,420
What's going on?

122
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,520
Another female actress

123
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,980
Hoshino sets a high difficulty level from the outset

124
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,980
This is not possible

125
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,500
You suddenly say you want to be in a relationship with me

126
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,170
It's so sudden, I don't know you at all
-Yes, I see

127
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,100
If that's all you need to do, it'd be easy!

128
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,200
Third is...

129
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,850
The comedian Miku

130
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,190
A single comedian, Miku

131
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,630
Oh, third place

132
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,720
What are you doing right now?

133
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,740
So disgusting, this kind of question

134
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,570
Ah, I'm at home now
-Ah, you're at home... resting?

135
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,560
Yes
-Oh, I see

136
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,730
Later, can we meet up?

137
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,130
Oh, the method of confession has changed

138
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,770
Eh... is there something wrong?

139
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,710
No its nothing bad

140
00:06:53,290 --> 00:07:00,030
So, for the third, she's asked to meet near TBS to confess in person

141
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,730
That... well...
-What's this?

142
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm recording a show right now. Is that okay?
-It's okay

143
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,690
I asked you to come here today

144
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:22,900
Because... I like you
-Thank you

145
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,740
Will you go out with me?

146
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,230
Ah... eh? Is that how you feel about me?

147
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,750
That type of feeling, yeah

148
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,260
Ah... yeah

149
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,090
I'm sorry.
-Oh, is that the answer?

150
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,410
Ah...

151
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,120
It's hard to continue after being rejected

152
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,990
Then

153
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,970
I only know you as a comedian

154
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,520
It's starting to get serious

155
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,440
So because of that, it's a little bit...

156
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,300
The selection is becoming more realistic

157
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,240
But I really hate men who are weaker than me

158
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,920
I've only worked with you, outside of work, and in the future...

159
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,270
His choices are still a bit far off

160
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,950
It's a bit of an excuse if I tell you that I want to focus on my work right now, but...

161
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,170
A bit detached

162
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,490
Ah... I see

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,410
A writer?

164
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,830
Would you be willing to go out with me?

165
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,260
What crap are you spewing? I'll beat you up

166
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,050
So harsh

167
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,930
"I'll beat you up"...

168
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,770
Do you have a boyfriend now?

169
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,910
Ah...yes...yes

170
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,610
Eh? You have a boyfriend?

171
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,930
She's his senior after all

172
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,220
And so, from his first confession in a decade

173
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,440
Hoshino is rejected by 9 people in 4 hours

174
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,030
I'm a little tired of this project

175
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,130
How many times do I have to be rejected...

176
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,400
So, he's given a little break to adjust his mental state

177
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,320
Yeah, you'd be sad

178
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,110
I'd like to call Nyan's Miyuki

179
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,340
The tenth?

180
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,740
When we drank together, I was impressed by how strong she is

181
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,160
So uncouth!

182
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,750
It was a cute contrast

183
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,920
She's really a "10th person" kind of level

184
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,140
By the tenth person, the difference in quality is pretty big

185
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,730
You do want to go out with her, don't you?
-Yes

186
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,480
Despite being a surprising choice, he seems sincere

187
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,920
So, they agreed to meet

188
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,680
After waiting for 30 minutes

189
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,440
Sorry, you've worked hard.
-Thank you for your hard work

190
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,250
Ah, what's up?
-Although there are cameras..

191
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,930
Is it a big show?
-Does it matter?

192
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,820
He quickly gets to the point

193
00:09:53,130 --> 00:10:00,630
Miyuki... I... like you... yeah

194
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,900
I see...

195
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:12,470
Please go out with me

196
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,340
Sorry, I can't

197
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,520
Eh, you can't?
-No, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry

198
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,100
You're not my type.
-I see

199
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,250
What type of people do you like?

200
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,160
A little more macho, I guess

201
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,330
That type, but you're....

202
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,650
Hoshino, the unmanly man, sinks

203
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,320
So, next is the eleventh

204
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:51,180
An old hometown senpai called Yuka

205
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,900
Yes, a good choice

206
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,020
A normal person?
-Well, yeah

207
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,980
At this stage, the first normal person arrives

208
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,960
She was one year ahead of me in the basketball team in high school

209
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,430
Our families have been close since I was in elementary school, so we were very close

210
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,940
I often visited her home to play

211
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,050
He'll be really sad if this one doesn't go well

212
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,010
I liked her very much at that time

213
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,050
Yeah this'll be a bad one

214
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,110
But I don't think my feelings ever reached her

215
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,330
He's already been rejected 10 times though so that should ease it a bit

216
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,950
Maybe now it'll get through

217
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,160
You say that, but this is the 11th place

218
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,120
Yeah

219
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:41,940
To be honest, I didn't have much hope for the higher ranked people

220
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:49,960
I just wanted to challenge myself

221
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,990
From now on, its more personal

222
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,670
And so, confessions for more realistic candidates begin

223
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,030
An odd sounding statement

224
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,980
Hello
-Hello

225
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,590
Long time no speak
-Long time no speak

226
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,420
I've seen you on TV a lot

227
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,090
Ah, really? You've been watching?

228
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,160
I'm watching, I'm watching
-I'm happy to hear it

229
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,250
A good vibe

230
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,330
How have you been doing?

231
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,050
Maybe...

232
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm married now

233
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,320
Ah!
-Didn't know?

234
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,700
Married already!?

235
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,810
Married already?
-Yes, already married

236
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:32,050
You're already married?
-Yes, I am

237
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,420
Is that your child I can hear?
-Yes

238
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,400
Eh!?

239
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,670
Confess!

240
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,350
That's not good. It's not that kind of project

241
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,390
But she sounds happy. That's great

242
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:52,550
It's 7:00 p.m., and six hours have passed since the first confession

243
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Six hours is more than enough to destroy the nerves

244
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,770
The 12th woman is now arriving at TBS

245
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,870
Tsukakoshi, a junior who he used to work with

246
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,250
Sorry, there are cameras

247
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,230
How have you been?

248
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,790
Not bad, you've been busy, i've been watching you

249
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,690
Thank you. What are you working on now?

250
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,530
Now I am working as a designer

251
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,900
And so, after a little bit of pleasantries

252
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,210
Sometimes I think, it'd be nice to have a girlfriend

253
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,840
Thinking such thoughts

254
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,880
Go for it then

255
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,220
That is true

256
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,840
Seems ok?

257
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,920
Tsukakoshi, what do you think?

258
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,390
Eh, wait a minute, why so suddenly...

259
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,210
No, well, its that...

260
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,290
I'm single currently, i'm not sure about you...

261
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,240
At the moment?

262
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,420
Now, I have someone I'm dating

263
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,270
And so, moving on to 13

264
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,450
Yes, Ito Chinami

265
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,280
She is now working as a professional gamer

266
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:21,120
She's the person I have the best relationship with

267
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,870
Should meet often then

268
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,960
I've maintained a good relationship with her for a long time

269
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,660
Due to not wanting to ruin their friendship, until now

270
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,550
A realistic candidate?

271
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,610
Her name was not even mentioned up until this point

272
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:40,550
I think she's the one that suits me the most

273
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,260
A serious choice at 13

274
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,810
This is what I think

275
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,900
And so, a meeting is organized with the 13th person

276
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,950
The fourth meeting at this spot of the day

277
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:59,020
What are you doing?
-This is a bit weird

278
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,060
Good evening
-Good evening

279
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,480
Sorry about the cameras

280
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,850
Seems like a good relationship

281
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,370
It's been a long time since we've seen each other, so I'm still a little nervous

282
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,840
It's true that we haven't seen each other for a long time, we haven't met up

283
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,110
We often game together

284
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,610
But we haven't chatted much during

285
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:25,120
Yes that's how its been recently

286
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,630
Said to be his best relationship with a woman

287
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,760
The atmosphere is certainly the best so far

288
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,780
What will happen?

289
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:54,280
Yes, yes, recently, we often play games together, right?

290
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:03,430
I really think we are very close friends

291
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,300
But... is it possible...

292
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,970
But I think there's a sense of adoration

293
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,770
Do you mean from me?
-Me

294
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:22,540
We are great friends

295
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:29,180
But actually, I have the feeling of "like"

296
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:38,460
I have been thinking about this very carefully

297
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,410
Is this a bit too direct?

298
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,330
Could it be "like"?

299
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,500
"Could it be like"? Is that a question?

300
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,500
No, I mean, its "like"

301
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,840
So

302
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,550
If you are willing...

303
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:10,560
From now on, can we play games together as lovers?

304
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,140
Eh... dating ...dating is...

305
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,040
When we game together, although we've had a lot of interaction

306
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,940
We haven't switched from communication mode to lover mode

307
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,480
Ah, indeed, indeed.
-The communication...

308
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,010
Just between friends

309
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,200
What about game mode?

310
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,290
So if you take this into consideration

311
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,700
There has been a game mode

312
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:47,460
If you can show more sincerity, it is not impossible...

313
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,470
So it's not hopeless then

314
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,670
Of course

315
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,640
I have a chance?

316
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,570
Its too sudden now

317
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,310
But there are a lot of aspects I like about you

318
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,150
Us being in a serious relationship together

319
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,820
It is not impossible to imagine, but

320
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,990
You haven't even invited me on a date yet

321
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,470
Nor have I been invited to dinner with this in mind

322
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,350
So to suddenly say "let's be together" is kind of suspicious

323
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,100
Like, are you serious?

324
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,810
True

325
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,270
Ah... yeah

326
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,880
Do you get what i'm saying
-Yeah, I get it

327
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,470
I think what you said is completely correct

328
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,140
He's like Kuro-chan

329
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,140
It's impossible to just say yes on the spot

330
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,810
Now its like "if you could..." kind of thing
-It's not there yet

331
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,320
Not  yet, that sorta thing

332
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,230
But a good vibe nonetheless

333
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,990
I get it

334
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,120
As she couldn't give an immediate answer today, so

335
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,000
Here, with the 13th place...

336
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,710
Not a complete success

337
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,660
What are you feeling right now?

338
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,010
Her words are still ringing in my ears

339
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,840
Sure enough, we should date first

340
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,510
If you don't meet a few times before confessing your love, it doesn't make much sense to agree

341
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Didn't Kuro-chan do the same?

342
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,280
Really, I'm speechless

343
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,250
It really happened

344
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,070
It makes me feel even more that she is a wonderful person

345
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,190
A very thoughtful person

346
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,420
So, as Ito only gave him a tentative answer

347
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:37,190
As he still hasn't found a girlfriend, we continue the plan

348
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,080
Still more?

349
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,610
If we can start with friends
-Ah start with being friends, right?

350
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:47,510
It's a bit, well, if you're dating, you're a little too eager, or, how to say, you're a little...

351
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,620
Yeah I see

352
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,940
That's what everyone says

353
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,830
The 16th place female is

354
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,950
pon loop's AMI

355
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,900
The male/female group, pon loop's AMI

356
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,000
We have been doing live shows together for about 3 years

357
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,570
Pretty good relationship

358
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,220
He likes female comedians

359
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,480
She is always full of energy and cheerful

360
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,940
I think being with her would make anyone more energetic

361
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,560
She also works at a ramen shop in Akasaka

362
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,240
Become cheerful

363
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,320
So, he contacts the person he deems to be a suitable match

364
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,760
You're living with Miyuki, right?

365
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,720
Yes, we live together

366
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,360
Has she come back?

367
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,110
Yes, she has come back

368
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,650
This is great

369
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,770
Oh, did she mention anything about me?

370
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,470
Something about Disco?
-Yeah

371
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,140
If she didn't say anything, don't worry about it at all

372
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,680
No, nothing special. I didn't talk to her after she got back

373
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,850
I've been busy doing my taxes

374
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,850
Doing your taxes so you've been too busy too talk

375
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,150
Yes, yes, yes
-Ah OK OK

376
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,290
I'm a bit pressed for time, the day after tomorrow is the deadline

377
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,040
It's 10:00 p.m. and because it's late

378
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,540
This time, we went to where the woman lives to confess

379
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,150
It's very late!

380
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,620
Why is it a shrine?

381
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:14,940
Ah
-Eh?

382
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,640
Ah, Ami.
-Eh?

383
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,310
You're here?

384
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,640
Wha...

385
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,310
What are you holding in your hand?

386
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,910
I just got back from the laundromat

387
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,650
The clothes just finished drying

388
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,600
It was drying
-Ah, sorry

389
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,490
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

390
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,760
There's one thing. It's urgent. I have to talk to you

391
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,160
There's something I wanted to say in person

392
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,570
Disbandment?
-Not a disbandment thing

393
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,430
I guess the opposite of disbandment

394
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,600
Eh!? I see. You wanna form a duo?

395
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,940
Not really, but close I guess

396
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,940
Form a trio?

397
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,780
What's up with this kid?

398
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:07,650
AMI, who is always cheerful, seems like the sun to me

399
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,990
Being together would be like being healed
-Eh? What do you mean?

400
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:18,170
Please, go out with me!
-Eh!?

401
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:28,840
Eh?
-That's pretty much it. That's why I called you out

402
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,790
Feels pretty good

403
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:35,630
Eh, did you hear something, from somewhere?

404
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,020
Eh? What?

405
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,220
Eh, like what?

406
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,690
Did you hear something from Miyuki?

407
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,590
Eh, no, I haven't heard anything, but...

408
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,690
You didn't hear anything, right?

409
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,530
From Miyuki
-No

410
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,370
Eh?
-Eh?

411
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,900
What is going on now, what's happening?

412
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,240
Well, then it doesn't matter, i'll tell you

413
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,110
Oh, please do

414
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,310
That, actually...

415
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:10,230
I once talked to Miyuki about how I like you

416
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,230
Eh!?

417
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,620
That's why she was surprised

418
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,900
Here comes the biggest shock of the day!

419
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,170
Really?

420
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:35,840
Eh, what to do...

421
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,660
What's with this development?

422
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,760
It's inexplicable.
-It's really inexplicable

423
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,850
Really unbelievable...
-Seriously!?

424
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:47,320
So now, although she said she likes him

425
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,240
Hoshino, up until this point, hasn't actually said "please go out with me"

426
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,730
Oh oh, I see...

427
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:58,600
Why? Well, the answer is surely because of the 13th choice, Chinami

428
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,190
Chinami said she wanted to go on a date first.
-It's true

429
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,880
He's so popular all of a sudden, he's got so many choices

430
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,390
However, it's still not a sure thing with her though, right?

431
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,550
It's not a sure thing
-But it is with Ami, right?

432
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,810
Ami likes him, for sure

433
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,950
For Ami of pon loop, Hoshino is his first choice, right?

434
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,760
Indeed, seemingly the highest ranked person

435
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,070
Well, then isn't Ami the best choice?
-AMI is a good choice

436
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,130
So you think its best to choose Ami?

437
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,420
Yes, I think maybe its best

438
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,420
Now we understand Miyuki more as well

439
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,120
Indeed, the reason behind her actions are clear

440
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,500
It's true, there's was sense of deliberate indifference and rejection

441
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,190
When she got home, she probably didn't say anything about it on purpose

442
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,740
Ah, she didn't want Hoshino's rating to go down.
-Ah, I'm so excited

443
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,100
This character relationship chart is impressive

444
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,900
It's already movie-quality, and the trailer for the movie was released this summer

445
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,310
Can we watch it again from the beginning?
-What are you talking about!?

446
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,860
So, a week after the shoot

447
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:08,130
I've thought a lot about it since then

448
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:18,310
I want to go on a date with Chinami and confess again

449
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:25,490
Ami is very important to me as a fellow comedian

450
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,100
Obviously likes her

451
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,110
So Ami has lost

452
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,960
So, Ami is informed of his decision

453
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:35,330
Well, although we're not dating, I think it's good to get everything out in the open

454
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,270
Now I feel a sense of release, it was very exciting

455
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,770
After i've confessed, I feel pretty comfortable

456
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:48,030
So, Hoshino, who wanted to reaffirm his feelings for Chinami

457
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,520
Oh
-Sorry I'm late

458
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,450
You're here
-I kept you waiting

459
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,920
Finding gaps between each other's work commitments

460
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,910
2 weeks later

461
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,410
Finally, it's time to confess again

462
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:21,240
Really... I... Chinami... I like you

463
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:28,700
Please go out with me

464
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:42,700
We went out to dinner a few times to see how things would go

465
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,700
I can't say yes to a relationship

466
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:57,210
I don't feel much of a spark from you

467
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,260
Have to decide after the date

468
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
This is important

469
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:06,550
I'd like to still be friends, in this way i'm sure we'll be happy

470
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:10,120
But I'm really happy to know how you feel, thank you

471
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,820
You already knew, right?

472
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,710
Thank you

473
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:19,550
And so, Hoshino's courtship is over

474
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:24,310
Do you have any plans to confess to Ami again?

475
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,110
Ah, in terms of her I think...

476
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,880
It's best to leave it as it is

477
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,810
But... the one who was rejected by Hoshino...

478
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,820
Poor thing!

479
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,990
She hasn't given up

480
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,320
Disco did not prove or disprove this theory

481
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,630
So can I have a go at it?

482
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,380
I would love to have a boyfriend, really

483
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,470
From the bottom of my heart

484
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,170
So the pon loop's Ami

485
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:00,880
Her 100 man confession battle will be shown in the near future!

486
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,280
Let's welcome the next presenter

487
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,660
Kamaitachi!

488
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,390
Although a bit sudden, do you remember this previous project?

489
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,560
Two people compete in a fake match against each other
-There was such a thing

490
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:30,850
A matchup in which both sides are instructed to lose before the match

491
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,300
This time brings another form of this duel

492
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,010
The theory this time is:

493
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,000
Both sides are extremely angry

494
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,770
What does this mean?

495
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:44,050
The two people involved are told separately that they are the ones pranking the other person

496
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:47,950
They're told to be very angry to the other

497
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,870
I see

498
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,840
But the other person does not know that the other person is also a setter

499
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,110
So they are also trying to make the other person really angry

500
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,610
Both sides
-Yes

501
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,450
The most entertaining two-sided anger

502
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,590
What will happen this way?

503
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:10,120
The initial target is the two people who immediately come to mind when it comes to quarreling: Onigoe Tomahawk

504
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,640
These two have perfected the art of arguing

505
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,360
We want you to do it
-Okay

506
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,900
The "Real Angry Man" setter
-Ok

507
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,640
I don't know how far I'll go if I'm really angry

508
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,670
A bloodbath is possible

509
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,270
Is this okay?

510
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,740
By the way, have you had any real fights lately?

511
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,010
About two months ago

512
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,110
This was a while ago

513
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:34,680
If we really fight, seriously, please come to call it off

514
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,790
Considering those involved

515
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,700
A real fight may develop

516
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,300
These two men are deeply disturbed by this potential result

517
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,930
So this time it is

518
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,800
How many times can you say "kora!" in 30 minutes?

519
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,300
Like Chosho, right?

520
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,140
"What the hell are you looking at?" That sort of "kora!", right?

521
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:03,000
A fake project with a challenge of how many times you can say "kora" in a real fight in 30 minutes

522
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,410
Like there would be such a show
-Yeah

523
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:13,190
Chair Kick

524
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:13,190
Grab

525
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:13,190
Kneel

526
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:13,190
Oi! (Kora)

527
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:13,190
Table Slap

528
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:13,190
Water

529
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:10,600
By the way, the reward point system is as follows

530
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,790
Very game-like

531
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:17,020
So, the two sides who are really angry with each other start

532
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,390
What a ranking system

533
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,760
I've been waiting for you for a long time

534
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,030
I've been waiting for almost 30 minutes.
-Is it that long?

535
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,100
Waited for about 30 minutes

536
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,070
You should have said something!
-No, no, no...

537
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,010
Very good approach

538
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,670
Using a partner's tardiness as a reason to fight

539
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,800
Sakai begins a resourceful battle strategy

540
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,790
What's that, witty?

541
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,080
What is this?

542
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,390
This is how your company does it, right?

543
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,360
I get it
-What do you get!?

544
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,630
This is a prank, right?

545
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,830
What?

546
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:59,100
Unbelievably, he pretends to have realized he is being pranked, although that is actually the case

547
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,400
Very clever approach

548
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:04,490
So, getting too close to the truth

549
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,080
It's gotten complicated

550
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:09,150
Kin who is shaken by the thought of being exposed

551
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,030
Is this going to work?

552
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,880
You went to a meeting before this, didn't you
No, no, I didn't

553
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,220
You surely did, super suspicious

554
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,320
Oi! (Kora!)

555
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,960
What the hell are you doing?

556
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,520
Oi!
-What the hell? Oi! What the hell, you bastard?

557
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,930
What do you think, you're trying to prank me, aren't you!

558
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,730
I've said no!

559
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,550
As expected, the two earn points by fighting

560
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,100
By naturally adding "kora!" into their conversation

561
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,910
You're the one doing it, you bastard!

562
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,870
Don't be ridiculous!

563
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,430
Next

564
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,280
Your angry look is very suspicious!

565
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,240
Splashed!

566
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,050
Your angry look is too suspicious!

567
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,840
Drank it already

568
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,290
Your acting sucks!

569
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,720
It's you!

570
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,740
Can't fight back

571
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,410
Despite starting quickly

572
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,090
As quarrels are a common occurrence

573
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:01,010
Neither side genuinely realizes the other is the setter

574
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,690
It happens too regularly for them

575
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,970
Next

576
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,340
Get down on your knees

577
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,010
Let go of me!

578
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,710
You're the one who should let go of my hand.
-Let go of me!

579
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,810
Then let go together

580
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,080
Ah, are you kidding?

581
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,420
Move your hands!

582
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,720
Seriously stop it!

583
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,050
You're still grabbing me!

584
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,990
Upon finally letting go

585
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,610
Both look on nervously

586
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,880
And so it went on for 15 minutes

587
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,680
Half time

588
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,640
Oi!

589
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,340
Aren't you bored with this?
-You're the one that should be bored!

590
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,840
You're boring!
-Oi!

591
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,740
What are you doing?

592
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,090
What's this for?

593
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,580
Disgusting disgusting disgusting disgusting disgusting

594
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,470
This is so long

595
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:52,180
They've been informed that this will light up when there's 5 minutes left

596
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:57,610
And that the word "octopus" is now activated

597
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,700
So, the "octopus" bonus round begins

598
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:07,300
Oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi!

599
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,630
Octopus, octopus, octopus!

600
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,870
Octopus! Oi!

601
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,690
At this point

602
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,780
Ah, you really

603
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,580
Earned a lot!

604
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,690
What's all this?

605
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,260
With Kin's impressive octopus streak

606
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,600
Finally, the fact that somethings up becomes apparent

607
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,720
What was that just now, octopus?

608
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,330
Octopus! Octopus! Octopus! Octopus! Octopus! Octopus! Octopus! Octopus!

609
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,260
But the situation continues regardless

610
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,270
Octopus! Shut up!

611
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:49,790
So, high-speed declarations of "octopus!" continue until the time is up

612
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,350
It ended up feeling wrong

613
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,010
Octopus octopus octopus
-Shut up, shut up, shut up

614
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,860
Octopus! Octopus! Octopus! Octopus! Octopus! Octopus! Octopus! Octopus! Octopus!

615
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,180
Wait a minute

616
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,390
Wait a minute

617
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,980
What is this?
-It's not right...

618
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:04,890
Who was the setter

619
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:08,390
Me
-No, I was

620
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,630
The point at which this guy kept saying the same words as me

621
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,630
I knew something was off

622
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,230
What do you think this program is?

623
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,170
Chidori's special program, right?

624
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:24,610
It seems like XX and XX
-No.

625
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,610
Uh...

626
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,280
Theory, theory? Theory?
-Correct

627
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:37,920
But generally speaking TBS isn't allowed to lie and say its another channel, right?

628
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,090
Can it pretend to be XX

629
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:42,530
I guess XX wouldn't be so aggressive

630
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,860
Wednesday Downtown

631
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,630
It can pretend to be another station's program without any permission?

632
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,530
This is like illegally downloading porn

633
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,880
Next is FUJIWARA

634
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,810
In the same way, both are called in advance

635
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,760
Haranishi made his head look like that?

636
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,350
And thus, the two-side angry meeting starts

637
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,560
Both sides are white

638
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,280
Your new hair, have you had any comments?

639
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,390
Great reviews!

640
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,170
Good reviews?

641
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,140
Yes, people say I look much younger

642
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,430
Using Haranishi's image change as a pretext

643
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,890
Fujimoto begins

644
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,240
On this point

645
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,470
It'd be better if you paid attention to your appearance

646
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,010
What do you mean by appearance?

647
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,510
It's hard to get hair that people think is good

648
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,280
But do you think its enough?

649
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,350
Take this wrinkle line for example

650
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,750
Don't you care for your skin? Oi!

651
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,550
To not get that thing

652
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,600
That's a strange way to put it, right?

653
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,220
Skin care I definitely won't do it, never will

654
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,790
Don't you care for your skin?

655
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,510
An unexpected skin care "kora!"

656
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,000
Two words that definitely do not go together

657
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,050
Skin care and "kora!"

658
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,720
With a contradictory sense

659
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,060
It's too suspicious

660
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,330
It's gradually starting to heat up

661
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,710
You're the guy who doesn't do anything every day

662
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,580
Oi oi oi oi listen listen listen listen

663
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,110
Let's talk about appearance

664
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,610
Either wrinkly or smooth

665
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,690
What kind of thing do the audience want to see more?

666
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,520
That is, I know more about skin care

667
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,790
Can't you listen to me?

668
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,730
What do you think?

669
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,200
What should I go and buy?

670
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,600
Buy hyaluronic acid

671
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,990
Minor verbal altercations continue

672
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,880
How thoughtful!

673
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,710
Since we're talking about this

674
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,480
As soon as summer comes, you always wear shorts

675
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,740
Wear what?

676
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,910
Don't wear that stuff!

677
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,910
Why not?

678
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,580
Too much leg hair!
-Eh?

679
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,420
Too much leg hair

680
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,910
And so, the venting from boredom continues

681
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,530
While talking on the phone with family

682
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,560
Can you stop using a Tokyo accent?

683
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,030
Seems natural

684
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,400
What the hell?

685
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,500
Don't cut your nails in the break room!

686
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,370
In the lounge you sit like a woman!

687
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,770
So what? Its comfortable

688
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,170
It's disgusting, right in front of us...

689
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,310
Sitting in front of me like that, you are too disgusting

690
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:15,140
I sit like that at home too, what's wrong?
-That's none of my business!

691
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,050
You don't blow your nose when you have a cold!

692
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,450
The snot is just always leaking out

693
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,690
Ordinary people blow their nose

694
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,520
But you're always just sniffing it in

695
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,090
So what!?

696
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,090
Or you just stick your finger in your nostril

697
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,860
What kind of action is that?

698
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,190
What's wrong with not being able to blow your nose

699
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,600
Who the hell can't blow their nose!?

700
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
It's a health problem!

701
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,270
It is not a physical thing, just blow a nose!

702
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,830
Just practice at it

703
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,900
Practice at blowing it!

704
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,640
I'm sick of seeing it

705
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,410
Is that a thing to practice?

706
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,840
Spare me of it!

707
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
I said I can't blow my nose

708
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
Try it now, there's some tissues

709
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,310
What is this argument?

710
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,730
Really can't blow it

711
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,250
You're not doing it right.
-What's wrong?

712
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,390
Press one nostril and blow

713
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,320
There's nothing up there now

714
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,550
Oi oi oi oi!
-What is it?

715
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,060
Try it!
-Oi, what?

716
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,290
What? Oi!
-Oi!

717
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,090
You copying me?
-Oi oi oi oi!

718
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,730
Copying me!

719
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:08,200
And so, "octopus" bonus round begins

720
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,600
Octopus!

721
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,480
Time is up

722
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,180
The truth is revealed

723
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,630
Thank you for your hard work

724
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,110
This is a prank

725
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,180
Eh, what? I'm a little confused confused confused

726
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,110
The setter for the prank was

727
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,550
Me... me, right?

728
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,550
Eh?

729
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,650
What is it? What's going on?

730
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,710
So we explained the project to them

731
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,090
By the middle, i'd forgotten I was the setter

732
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,460
I just didn't want to lose the argument

733
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,730
I definitely won't lose

734
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,860
I also really felt that I could not lose

735
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,320
The final goal is the combination Plus Minus

736
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,570
This is gonna be bad, isn't it
-Yes, it is

737
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,190
You won the Manzai Talent Award, right?

738
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,850
Thank you

739
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,010
The youngest recipient of the award, right?

740
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,730
Downtown also won the award, right?

741
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,250
At a a younger age than us

742
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,080
Well we are better, right?

743
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,280
And so, Plus Minus

744
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,160
And so, the two-side angry Plus Minus meeting starts

745
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,130
We get this close to each other

746
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,900
And say stuff like "die!" to each other

747
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,200
I'm a little scared

748
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,000
We occasionally argue

749
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,370
Fighting each other... its likely it'll happen

750
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,710
Really?

751
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,400
This has nothing to do with the prank

752
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,720
Its excessive today

753
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,800
Doesn't get points for this, right?

754
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,400
What's too much, who are you to judge?

755
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:46,930
So noisy since the morning

756
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,900
What the hell are you talking about? "so noisy since morning"?

757
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,600
What? Oi!

758
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,300
Ugly!

759
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,570
You're the ugly one, right?

760
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,270
How you look is the definition of ugly

761
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,010
Your face looks like its melting

762
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,840
It doesn't look like it's melting

763
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,850
What "it doesn't look like its melting", you just copy and don't even think of anything

764
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,650
What do you ever say thats new?

765
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,880
Your face is sagging

766
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,320
You talk so much crap!

767
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,060
Ah, the water!

768
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,830
Quick progression

769
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,020
It is indeed quite real

770
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,630
43 this year

771
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,230
Stop this, what're you doing?
-You started it!

772
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,100
You're so full of crap

773
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,900
It's baffling

774
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,470
Ah? Oi! What? Oi!

775
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,430
Who are you saying "oi" (kora) to?

776
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,600
I'm saying it, oi!

777
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,200
Who're you looking at and saying that?

778
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,740
You think you're right about everything, don't you?

779
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,440
I don't think so, you do!

780
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,210
That's what you think

781
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,740
No I don't!

782
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,040
You think that way, hey, hey, hey, hey, dumbass!
-What's this nonsense?

783
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,380
You know, you stink

784
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,610
You're the one that stinks!

785
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,280
You do!

786
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,080
It's obviously you who stinks!

787
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,520
Both sides are talking a lot

788
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,290
In this room

789
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,490
Listen to me!

790
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,390
I'm the one talking now. Oi!

791
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,590
I'm letting you!

792
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,430
I'm talking here, why the hell are you interrupting, oi, you bastard!

793
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,010
Look really quite real

794
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,610
I'm telling you to pay attention!

795
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:59,040
What i'm saying to you is important, understand?

796
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,000
Outsiders won't be saying this stuff, get it?

797
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,230
Don't say it then!

798
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,210
What the hell is wrong with you?

799
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,700
As a result, Iwahashi takes his partner down smoothly

800
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,950
Iwahashi's behavior is so scary

801
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:19,760
Stop! Oi!

802
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,090
What are you doing! Oi, idiot!

803
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,950
Never seen such a quarrel

804
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,190
Let go!

805
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,230
Dammit!

806
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,160
43 year olds

807
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,730
Biting!

808
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,890
I can't believe he's biting him

809
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,540
What the hell is going on?

810
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,970
Get out

811
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,440
Get out of here! Oi, get the hell out of here!

812
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,210
Only halfway

813
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,320
At this time

814
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,820
What the hell are you doing?

815
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,750
Give me back my 2000 yen!

816
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,380
Huh?

817
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,450
2000 yen

818
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,020
Huh?

819
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,550
I don't know anything about that

820
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,320
What 2000 yen?

821
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,920
M-1's registration fee of 2000 yen, give it back

822
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,860
2018 and 17

823
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,660
That's a lie!

824
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,190
Give me back both!

825
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,630
And so, they start to bring up old things as an excuse to continue to fight

826
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,800
Give me back my 2000 yen!

827
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,570
I don't have 2000!

828
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,400
Don't say such ridiculous things!

829
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,170
I'll give it to you!

830
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,740
Don't throw money!

831
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,310
Pick it up!

832
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,500
Such a smooth movement

833
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,860
Iwahashi starts attacking with a strange sleeper technique

834
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,220
No points!

835
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,430
Why are you using such techniques?

836
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,090
What the hell are you doing today?

837
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,160
It's you!

838
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,730
Why are you running your mouth so much today?

839
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,530
You're so noisy, i've put up with you long enough!

840
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,370
Oi!

841
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,900
I'm always holding back what I want to say

842
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,400
Baldy, oi!

843
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:42,960
10 minutes to go

844
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:47,510
You're really at fault!

845
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,510
You never do any jokes for me!

846
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,320
How many jokes do you have?

847
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,180
Only me? I'm always giving you jokes!

848
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,590
Only the master and Freiza!

849
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,990
No, you've had loads

850
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,060
"Kill you", just that

851
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,190
You've said loads!

852
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,260
Iwahashi, I'll kill you!

853
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:02,890
You are so irritating

854
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,160
So painful

855
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,430
Look, dumbass

856
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,760
It hurts to watch

857
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,230
I can't talk to you properly

858
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,030
It is impossible to talk to you

859
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,040
Here comes the sleeping technique

860
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,890
Immediately strangled

861
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,480
After fighting they go back to their seats

862
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,490
Ow ow ow ow

863
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,670
You don't get points this way!

864
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,480
No points for biting

865
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,960
"Octopus" bonus round

866
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,280
Since there's cameras they always return to their seats

867
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,420
Octopus, you octopus!

868
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,150
What octopus?

869
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,890
You're an octopus

870
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:30,950
Octopus
-What octopus?

871
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:31,650
Get bangs

872
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,290
Get a handful of curly bangs!

873
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,960
Octopus
-You think you're Choshu?

874
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,590
Oh interesting, no I don't

875
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,560
I don't know

876
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,830
Octopus! Oi!
-Seriously, your face is sagging

877
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,300
You'd score 70 points for your imitation

878
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,830
Getting points!

879
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,140
What the hell are you doing?

880
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,110
Disgusting, so noisy!

881
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,800
Again with this technique

882
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:53,750
What are you doing?

883
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,930
Finally the time is up

884
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,630
The truth is revealed

885
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,170
These two people are idiots, right?

886
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,720
This is a prank

887
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,160
Eh?

888
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,630
That's right. You're surprised

889
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,530
Its a prank

890
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,490
But i'm the setter

891
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,560
Eh, what's going on here?

892
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,400
This is Wednesday Downtown

893
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,540
Great!

894
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,370
Weird to say "great"

895
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:23,470
It's finally here!

896
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,540
This is Wed Down!

897
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,210
Ma-chan, Hama-chan!

898
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,210
They'll be angry

899
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,680
You should be happy too!

900
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:38,660
It's so weird, I'm already confused

901
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,560
In summary, the scores for all are as follows

902
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,650
The winner of the feeder challenge is Sakai of Onigoe Tomahawk

903
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,050
I see

904
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:56,010
Plus Minus really started complaining to each other in the middle

905
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:00,580
Usually, biting occurs

906
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,080
Nothing can be done about it

907
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,050
When I went to the lounge, I once heard Kanemitsu screaming

908
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:09,090
I ran over and saw Iwaashi holding him and biting his head

909
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,640
It can does happen
-Then there's nothing to be done about it

910
00:45:13,220 --> 00:46:14,750
