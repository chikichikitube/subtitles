6
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,220
Ah. So, according to the staff,

7
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,580
Endo opened a safe.

8
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,890
Endo opened a safe.

9
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,890
You three were talking about this.

10
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,990
We talked about that in the taxi.

11
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,790
Yeah, it was the other day.

12
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,830
In the segment where we didn't use phones...

13
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,300
Tanaka didn't hear about this.

14
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,530
I haven't heard anything about this.

15
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,800
Yeah, when we were doing

16
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,930
the "without phones" thing, us three were in the taxi...

17
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,930
That's when we were...

18
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,370
It was you three and Tanaka and me.

19
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,370
Okay.

20
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,870
I don't remember what we were talking about but,

21
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,210
he started talking about his safe.

22
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,440
There's a safe that I've always kept in my house.

23
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,740
There's a safe that I've always kept in my house.

24
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,880
But I forgot the combination

25
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,710
and I lost the key.

26
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,080
So it just sat there for over ten years.

27
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,850
I started getting curious about it so I decided to open it.

28
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,850
So I called a locksmith company

29
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,850
and had them open the safe.

30
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,920
There was actually something inside.

31
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,720
But it wasn't money or anything.

32
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,930
It was a handwritten letter

33
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:57,800
It was a handwritten letter

34
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:57,800
that Tanaka gave me before he came to Tokyo.

35
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,000
That was in the safe?

36
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,000
I must have put it in the safe

37
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,670
because it was important to me, and it had stayed there since.

38
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,380
That sounds like a nice story but,

39
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,380
That's a nice story.

40
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,850
Who would wanna steal that!?

41
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,820
Putting it in a safe...

42
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,880
Seriously...

43
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,590
But really, that was the only thing in there.

44
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,220
And around 20 years later, I read it again.

45
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,290
That's what we were talking about.

46
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,290
Ah... while you were in the car.

47
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,030
The thing is that,

48
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,030
right now.

49
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,900
Endo's wife let us borrow it.

50
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,030
We asked her to

51
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,070
You're kidding, right?

52
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,570
Endo's wife let us borrow it.

53
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,700
Hey, why? Why?

54
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,700
1992...

55
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,500
Do you remember?

56
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,010
I'm getting a really bad feeling about this.

57
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,910
This is something that Tanaka wrote...

58
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,140
Why?

59
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,810
This was just a nice story...

60
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,210
"To Endo Shozo-kun" It says.

61
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,150
"To Endo Shozo-kun" It says.

62
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,090
Not only that. Tanaka.

63
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,490
What's with this handmade envelope?

64
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,120
What's with this handmade envelope?

65
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,660
It's stapled together.

66
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,660
That looks really bad.

67
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,860
What were you doing?

68
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,360
It looks really bad.

69
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,430
It looks like it's from back in the war.

70
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,430
Seriously.

71
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,930
Well, it's from 1992 (24 years ago).

72
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,930
It's from 1992.

73
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,930
It's from back when we came to Tokyo.

74
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,200
You still weren't famous.

75
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,540
It's from around our debut.

76
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,970
Departing to Tokyo "Do Your Best" Edition.

77
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,010
Departing to Tokyo "Do Your Best" Edition.

78
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,840
No, no, the "Do Your Best Edition" is just...

79
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,270
So lame

80
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,510
So lame

81
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,380
So lame

82
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,250
Edition? Now it's some special edition?

83
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,250
"Do Your Best" Edition?

84
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,220
Let's stop this, come on.

85
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm serious.

86
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,120
Departure to...

87
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,390
This was just...

88
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,360
Tokyo, "Do Your Best" Edition.

89
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,430
Departure to Tokyo Do Your Best Edition

90
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
No, this edition thing was...

91
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,360
How many editions were there?

92
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Please don't do this

93
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,360
You know, at the time...

94
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,330
I was serious.

95
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,930
"Do Your Best" Edition.

96
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,930
"Do Your Best" Edition.

97
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,860
Look at the name,

98
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,170
the name on the back was weird.

99
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,500
Tanaka Hidemitsu?

100
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,670
Tanaka Hidemitsu?

101
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,270
What is that?

102
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,800
Okay, this is...

103
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,170
Back then,

104
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,170
when we were in elementary school,

105
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,880
there was this funny, quirky kid.

106
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,050
His name was Hidemitsu,

107
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,810
and that's probably why Tanaka...

108
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,280
Let's just stop this!!

109
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,120
Sit down!

110
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,760
That's not funny at all.

111
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,220
It wasn't about being funny.

112
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,260
This whole "Tanaka Hidemitsu" thing.

113
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,390
Seriously.

114
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,160
Look inside.

115
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Inside.

116
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,160
Look inside, Matsumoto.

117
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,900
It wasn't meant to be funny.

118
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:12,200
*The names in the letter all have the kanji character translation.

119
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,200
Why does his name have the pronunciation written on top?*

120
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,930
That despite being an adult,

121
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,200
maybe he couldn't read the characters...

122
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,770
Uhh...

123
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,770
So it's a joke?

124
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,080
Maybe I thought it would be funny?

125
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,940
That's where it's supposed to be funny.

126
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,680
I don't know.

127
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Making him seem like an adult

128
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,480
Please sit down.

129
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,850
who couldn't read his own name.

130
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,850
The real problem is inside.

131
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,350
There's no way this is gonna funny.

132
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,350
The outside is pretty awful too...

133
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,160
This is all just...

134
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,130
Well, you really got me with this...

135
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,690
Why didn't you buy an envelope?

136
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,130
Actually, at the time, Tanaka was

137
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,130
I think it there was some kind of reason.

138
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,130
going to a vocational school...

139
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,400
For a designer course at the school

140
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,840
So with his handy skills,

141
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,670
he always made a lot of things himself.

142
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,840
Phh...

143
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,670
So it's completely handmade.

144
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,680
So it's not like, um...

145
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,740
Eh, wait...

146
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,450
Do you remember writing this before coming to Tokyo?

147
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,250
Yeah, I remember writing it and giving it to him.

148
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,350
Hey, what are you pulling out?!

149
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,220
Be careful.

150
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,550
They found something in there.

151
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,820
What the hell is that? That's so creepy!!

152
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,190
What the hell is that? That's so creepy!!

153
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,960
That's disgusting, what is that?

154
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,660
Really, what's up with that?

155
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,360
What are you talking about?

156
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,370
What is that?

157
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,370
That isn't a letter...

158
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,370
He drew a portrait of him.

159
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,370
It's making me feel really sick.

160
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,470
Why?

161
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,740
Why?

162
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,170
I don't understand the reason for this.

163
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,170
No, no, this is...

164
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,380
Why? Why this?

165
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,380
Even I'm not entirely sure why this was there.

166
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,350
It must have been some trend at the time.

167
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,350
I don't know but...

168
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,420
He traced it.

169
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,020
He traced it with a pencil.

170
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,960
Next

171
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,960
The shocking letter is revealed

172
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,860
Alright, sit down.

173
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,860
This is not good.

174
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:56,940
This is an advertisement to ride the bus and experience the No Laughing Batsu segment.

175
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,850
Show what's inside.

176
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,680
Wait...

177
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,680
Let's just stop this.

178
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,250
I'm serious.

179
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,880
The writing is really small.

180
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,920
This is...

181
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,620
He couldn't have read this without reading glasses.

182
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,920
We brought in an announcer for this.

183
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,790
Let's have him read it.

184
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,960
Wait...

185
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,960
Hello.

186
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
I'm Sugaya, NTV announcer.

187
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,890
Nippon TV Announcer

188
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,890
Sugaya Daisuke

189
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,630
Well then, with your permission...

190
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,630
Can you read it?

191
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,500
The writing is really small.

192
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,500
Yes, it's fine.

193
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,330
Please excuse me while I read on your behalf.

194
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,800
Please excuse me while I read on your behalf.

195
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,900
Wait, seriously, wait...

196
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,310
Just sit down!

197
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,170
Please wait...

198
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,510
Wait a minute, please! I'm serious!

199
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,370
I'll seriously do anything!

200
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,910
I'll seriously do anything!

201
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,650
I'll do anything so,

202
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,820
Please don't read it.

203
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,580
No, it's better to read it.

204
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,050
Let me just say this,

205
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,820
This isn't gonna be funny or anything.

206
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Right, that's it.

207
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,660
It's just a letter between friends from 24 years ago,

208
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,930
That's right.

209
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,430
when we were together...

210
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,590
You came to Tokyo together?

211
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,900
We did.

212
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,830
We didn't come together.

213
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,830
There was just a little delay.

214
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,700
Endo came first.

215
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,100
I came to Tokyo

216
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,100
and Tanaka came two months later.

217
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,070
An "I'll be waiting for you" sort of thing?

218
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,610
I was like "I'll wait for you" so...

219
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,470
In response to that, Tanaka wrote this letter.

220
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,180
In response to that, Tanaka wrote this letter.

221
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,310
That's the reason for the letter.

222
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,310
That's why he wrote it.

223
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,350
Right.

224
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,850
No, wait, wait...

225
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,680
It's not funny, this won't be funny at all.

226
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,690
This won't be funny, I don't care about that.

227
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,690
It's stuff from 24 years ago, anyway.

228
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,490
But actually,

229
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,060
I think it's gonna be sort of disgusting.

230
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,090
It's not funny, really.

231
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,660
It's obviously not gonna be funny, but that's fine.

232
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,470
I'm actually okay with it not being funny...

233
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,300
But more than that,

234
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,540
I think it's a creepy one

235
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,740
That's what I'm afraid of.

236
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,870
I think I'll actually be very moved by this.

237
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,870
You don't know...

238
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,870
There's no way
you will.

239
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,870
Let's just be quiet and listen together.

240
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
For now, please sit down.

241
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,680
Why did you write a letter if you were gonna follow two months later?

242
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,650
He actually hadn't decided to leave two months later.

243
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,820
He'd just been thinking about it.

244
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,690
But you know, this is...

245
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,690
This is the title.

246
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,120
This isn't something we should be showing everyone.

247
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,060
Let's read it right to the end.

248
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,930
Let's just listen.

249
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,930
Of course...

250
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,790
Better to not stop every few seconds.

251
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,790
Right.

252
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,530
Do it right.

253
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,300
To Endo Shozo-kun,

254
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,870
Departure to Tokyo. "Do Your Best" Edition

255
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,800
Dear Endo Shozo,

256
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,070
At last, it's here. The day of your departure.

257
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,440
Today, Tuesday February 2nd,

258
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,150
Is a very important day for you. Let's remember this day.

259
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,150
For now, please go ahead and keep an eye on the situation for me.

260
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,960
I'll be following you soon.

261
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,030
Let me say this clearly.

262
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,500
What's with this weird writing

263
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:36,200
I, your partner Tanaka Shinichiro, alias

264
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,300
Stop that, we can't read it like this.

265
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,840
Sit down!!

266
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,640
Sit down, Shinichiro!!

267
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,040
Let us listen!

268
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,780
Shinichiro, sit down!!

269
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,210
I'm sorry but this is really...

270
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,210
Sit down, Shinichiro.

271
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,850
Enough... stop this...

272
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,420
Don't do that again.

273
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,650
This was something between friends.

274
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,390
Let me say this clearly.

275
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:01,990
I, your partner Tanaka Shinichiro, alias Tanaka Takuya

276
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,700
That was another joke, I guess.

277
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,700
That was a double joke.

278
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
This is...

279
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,570
Something that only I could understand.

280
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,570
Only I would think, "Hey, who's this Takuya?"

281
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,210
It's fine if only you understand it...

282
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,210
Yeah, it's okay that I could get it.

283
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,140
Okay then.

284
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,140
It's directed at me.

285
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:22,380
I'll be heading there on the 1st of April; I'll be waiting for your retort.

286
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,380
It's something only I could understand.

287
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,720
It's a retort with a time lag.

288
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,020
The retort for the fake names, right?

289
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,020
Yes

290
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,460
In 2 months when I arrive, please retort.

291
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,590
In 2 months when I arrive, please retort.

292
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,830
"Thanks in advance."

293
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,530
Anyways, for now let's light a cigarette and take a puff.

294
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,740
And then, we shall offer a cigarette

295
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,540
to the old man sitting nearby.

296
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,440
What is that?!

297
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Something like that probably happened though, right?

298
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,650
It probably happened.

299
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,650
I don't know

300
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,150
Since we just turned 20, we could finally start smoking

301
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,320
and something like that happened, I think.

302
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,120
Something like that

303
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,990
Parenthesis "By 8000 Kei"

304
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,890
"By 8000 Kei"?

305
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,590
"Parenthesis"?

306
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,660
"Parenthesis 'By 8000 Kei'"

307
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,660
This is, this is just...

308
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,100
The Hankyuu

309
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,100
"B a y"

310
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,800
This is about  The Hankyuu Railway'snew trains

311
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,000
This is about the Hankyuu Railway's new trains.

312
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,570
The ones at the time.

313
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,500
As long as I get it...

314
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,600
Do you get it?

315
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,670
I get all of these...

316
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,640
But still,

317
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,540
Why did trains suddenly come up?

318
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,880
Well, sudden and random

319
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,880
Exactly

320
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,050
Suddenly writing random stuff

321
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,650
Suddenly writing random stuff

322
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,650
can be funny, right?

323
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,750
Who's speaking? No idea

324
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,590
Suddenly...

325
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,290
Random stuff.

326
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,990
Completely random

327
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,990
Changing it up, huh

328
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,160
I can feel the amateurishness

329
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,460
There is one thing I feel I have to apologize for

330
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,030
After coming back from Kagawa,

331
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,970
The precious time we had together before you left Osaka

332
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,470
was spent helping me with my project.

333
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,140
*Aritou is close to arigatou, meaning thanks

334
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,800
Aritou.

335
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,170
➦Former Lotte Mariner, Number 8

336
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,510
Michiyo Aritou

337
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,340
Wait, hold on

338
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,340
As long as I think it's funny, it's alright.

339
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,120
Hey. hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

340
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,580
You're not
even laughing

341
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,120
I am laughing

342
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,980
Hey. hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

343
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,990
Sit down, sit down!

344
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,990
Sit down already.

345
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,990
As long as I get it.

346
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,820
Only I have to get it.

347
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,390
He's really packing the jokes in tight.

348
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,490
He's really packing the jokes in tight.

349
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,130
He really is

350
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,330
In such a short letter...

351
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,260
He's packing the jokes in so tight.

352
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,900
So it's not a serious letter, huh.

353
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,100
He really wants Endo

354
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,100
to think that he's funny.

355
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,300
It was really funny to me.

356
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,300
That's probably what I was doing.

357
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,140
No, no, Aristotle. That's not right!

358
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,210
Really, Sasshūnada Nada. (Izutsu Stable)

359
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,680
...sorry. But really, thank you.

360
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,950
I'll show you once I graduate.

361
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,190
And now, a haiku.

362
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,390
Stop!

363
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,730
"And now, a haiku" can't be good

364
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,230
No wait, seriously please.

365
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,960
Just end the letter there!

366
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,230
Enough, already!

367
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,870
Unbelievable

368
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,870
What's wrong with you

369
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,240
He won't stop with the jokes!

370
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,740
He's really showing off his talents

371
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,740
It's overflowing

372
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,340
This is bad

373
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,340
"And now, a haiku"

374
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,210
This isn't good.

375
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,910
And now, a haiku.

376
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:14,390
At least for today thoroughly and completely $#!&$#!&$#!&.

377
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,560
I'll stop writing pointless sentences now, but

378
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,390
Will you look for a place for me when you have time?

379
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,890
I'm counting on you.

380
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,890
Suddenly so serious.

381
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,970
I know that Endo Shouzou has probably known this for a while,

382
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,930
He used his full name

383
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,700
We'll cause a lot of problems for a lot of people. However

384
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,810
we're going to Tokyo to try and
make our dream a reality, so

385
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,980
Let's go after it as hard as we can

386
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,710
with no regrets, kaykay!?

387
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,050
It's almost over

388
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,050
Isn't he reading it in a bad way?

389
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,690
No, he's not

390
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,690
Really?

391
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,460
That was normal.

392
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,460
Correct

393
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,090
He definitely read it that way on purpose.

394
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,430
As long as we're together, we'll definitely be successful.

395
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,470
I suppose soon, your beloved

396
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,900
eastern Japanese soil (red clay) will be under you.

397
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,740
Or maybe you're still in Kyoto?

398
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,940
Or maybe, you haven't even got on the train yet?

399
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,410
This makes no sense.

400
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,650
To Toshirou, the stupid Japanese giant salamander

401
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,880
I'll be headed there in April,

402
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,390
so tell him to wash his **** and wait for me.

403
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,590
What the hell are you talking about?

404
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,930
He's confused.

405
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,930
That's not normal.

406
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,290
Then, I'll suck it for him.

407
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,130
Did he really write that?

408
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,200
Are you kidding?

409
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,700
It was that kind of...

410
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,800
Something Tanaka would never say.

411
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,870
This is crazy

412
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,140
No more.

413
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,240
This is gross.

414
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,480
I'm so happy.

415
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,580
So, relax and wait a bit.

416
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,920
Sorry for the pointless letter,

417
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,150
but be sure to take care of yourself.

418
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:58,660
Tuesday, February 2, 1992. 9 AM, 32 minutes and 2 seconds.

419
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:05,700
from your partner, Tanaka Naoki (Whale species)

420
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,670
He joked to the very end.

421
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,670
Thank you very much.

422
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,670
Bravo!

423
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,480
There were so many parts that we don't understand.

424
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,680
Parts that only Endo understand...

425
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,110
Wow, that was somethin'.

426
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,980
Wow, that was somethin'.

427
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,250
From twenty something years ago...

428
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,920
That was somethin'.

429
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,390
You even made this?

430
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,890
Here it is.

431
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,890
24 years ago,

432
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,160
When I...

433
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,890
was about to get on the
train at Shin-Osaka station he gave me this.

434
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,690
Oh, I see.

435
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,100
We thought it would be more serious.

436
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,700
Like "Let's do our best"

437
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,100
or something like that.

438
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,470
In April, I'll...

439
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,040
This part is rough.

440
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,140
"I'll head there in April,

441
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,340
so tell him to wash his **** and wait for me.

442
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Then, I'll suck it for him.

443
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,740
I'm so happy."

444
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,310
That's...

445
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,810
He just...

446
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,050
It's a $#!& letter.

447
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,620
That's not true.

448
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,050
That's not what it was.

449
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,420
It's a $#!& love letter.

450
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,430
What the hell is this!!

451
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,860
After that we worked hard and...

452
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,730
It's crazy that you found this.

453
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,130
So now, I think

454
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,930
Next it's time for Endo

455
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:21,570
Next it's time for Endo

456
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,570
to write a letter back to Tanaka.

457
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,740
After all, you really should or it will feel unfinished.

458
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,010
A conclusion, huh.

459
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,780
After all this time...

460
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,010
Hold on

461
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,250
It's too big of a wall to climb for me.

462
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,180
Writing back after 24 years...

463
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,620
I'm really bad with these kinds of things.

464
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,850
It's just a response to this.

465
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
24 years later...

466
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,320
I see.

467
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,720
No no no no no no,

468
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,660
I think you should.

469
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,390
That would be so...

470
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,800
You have to fill it to the brim with jokes.

471
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,100
That would be so hard.

472
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,240
Talk Scene Recording Finished

473
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,730
Following their dreams,

474
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,600
they headed to Tokyo.

483

His feelings that he never expressed...

484
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,580
until now.

485
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,050

To Tanaka Naoki (Whale species),

488
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,390
At the time of receiving this letter 24 years ago,

489
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,390
We never dreamed that it would be read
on Downtown's show that we both admired so much.

490
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,200
It was all possible, because you came to Tokyo with me.

491
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:24,940
I am truly grateful. Ariga Satsuki.

492
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,940

In the future,

00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,210
Let's continue to work hard,

496
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,840
and do our best on the show-n Connery.

497
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,480
and do our best on the show-n Connery.

498
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,240
And now, a haiku.

499
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,250
Eastern Japan is once again today, fertile layered soil.

500
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,750
Eastern Japan is once again today, fertile layered soil.

501
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,180
Eastern Japan is once again today, fertile layered soil.

502
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,320
