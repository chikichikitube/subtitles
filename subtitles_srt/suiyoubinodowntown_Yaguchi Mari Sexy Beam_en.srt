Subbed by: Mei.ka~

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,480
Everyone's Theories as Chosen by Koyabu.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,450
The next one is...

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:16,500
The theory is: after being scolded, it would probably be hard for Yaguchi Mari to let out her "Sexy Beam" when "Koi no Dance Site" is playing during karaoke.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,360
Please no!

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,070
When you think of Yaguchi during her
time as a Morning Musume member...

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,640
You think of her "sexy beam".

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,550
And today, the person who will be scolding Yaguchi is...

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,380
Good morning!

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,710
Oh, that's scary.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,580
Tono Nagiko, who hangs out with Yaguchi in their private time.

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,450
She looks scary here.

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,950
But seems like
they're friends.

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:46,120
Neither Yuguchi nor best friend Yushin knows anything.

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,850
Right.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,630
Without further ado, let's get onto the karaoke.

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,300
TN: They're singing UFO by Pink Lady.

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,100
UFO

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,430
Looks like a good time.

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,900
The time has finally come to scold her.

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,140
Like, you should be talking about current events.

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,040
Like, you should be talking about current events.

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,610
Honestly, I think it'd be better if you noticed
how much you haven't been studying.

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,340
Honestly, I think it'd be better if you noticed
how much you haven't been studying.

25
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,510
Tono-san, you're not telling me about this, right?

26
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,650
Tono-san, you're not telling me about this, right?

27
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,080
Why, do you really have to talk to me about this?

28
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,080
No, I don't know.

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,690
So on the job -

30
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:12,950
Wait, did I do something to bother you?

31
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,690
Wait, did I do something to bother you?

32
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,390
This is what the staff saying, not me.

33
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,790
This is what the staff saying, not me.

34
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,490
This is what the staff saying, not me.

35
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,820
But that...

36
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,820
For some reason,

37
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,930
Wait, this is really scary.

38
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,190
With Yaguchi objectifying,
this has started to turn into a heated argument.

39
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,190
She's going all out.

40
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,400
So, with whatever you're telling me,

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,600
So, with whatever you're telling me,

42
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,570
What am I supposed to do with future jobs?

43
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,500
No, I don't know...

44
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,430
Then I'm turning down the job this time.

45
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,500
Then I'm turning down the job this time.

46
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,170
Alright.

47
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,170
Okay?

48
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,210
With this, they can't even turn their attention towards the TV.

49
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,910
Their serious dispute just continues.

50
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,640
Until finally...

51
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,150
It doesn't mean that I'll do things that I wanna do.

52
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,280
It doesn't mean that I'll do things that I wanna do.

53
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,020
Yaguchi ends up crying.

54
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,950
With that...

55
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,320
Well, never mind then.

56
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,390
Put on "Koi no Dance Site".

57
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,890
Put on "Koi no Dance Site".

58
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,330
No way!

59
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,200
So, with Yaguchi in this state...

60
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,000
Tono-san's amazing.

61
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,830
Why would
she do it?!

62
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,640
Will she still bring out her Sexy Beam?

63
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,070
Tono-san's amazing.

64
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,740
It's the only thing
she can do!

65
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,180
Every time I fall in love, my chest goes Bon Bo Ba Bon

66
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,570
She won't do it.

67
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,910
No, I believe in her.

68
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,740
What?

69
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,280
Will she?!

70
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,080
She has to.

71
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:16,920
That's right, I'm updating

72
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,410
What will happen?!

73
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,180
I feel so bad.

74
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,910
No, she's crying!

75
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,010
She's just been crying!

76
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,820
Life's website with my SEXY beam (SEXY beam)

77
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,990
Go! Let it out!
Do it!

78
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,820
Go! Let it out!
Do it!

79
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,630
There was no way that she'd say it.

80
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,630
There was no way!

81
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,330
She didn't do it!

82
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,330
Well, obviously!

83
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,330
There was no way!

84
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,200
Now it was time to reveal the joke.

85
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,100
Man, I hated this!

86
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,370
Man, I hated this!

87
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,100
I seriously hated this!

88
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,940
I seriously hated this!

89
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,670
They're Friends...
Very good friends.

90
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,380
I'm so, so sorry!

91
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,480
Thank god...

92
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,950
Hold on!

93
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,890
This only made them
better friends!

94
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,420
I can't believe this!

95
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,120
I can't believe this!

96
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,350
I'm sorry, Tono-san!

97
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,050
None of it was true!

98
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,120
None of it was true!

99
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,990
Now they're even closer!

100
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,820
I'm sorry! I really am!

101
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,430
I'm sorry! I really am!

102
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,830
I hated this!

103
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,670
I hated this!

104
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,670
God! Thank god!

105
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,640
Take out that "1 2 3 4"!
