1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,730
Let's rendezvous without using your smartphones!!

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,070
This time, FUJIWARA's Fujimoto was the guest.
What’s the first theme?

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,910
“Historical buildings.”

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,710
This is a very wide range.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,810
- Do you have some options?
- I came up with two.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,180
- I used to go to the driving range at Gaien a lot.
- Picture Gallery?
- Yeah, that’s old.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,290
It's the National Diet Building, isn't it ?

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,160
I like the way it feels.
You still think this is awesome, don't you?

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,030
Don't leave me alone.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,100
It’s Nippon Budoukan.

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:45,240
They struggled a lot with this theme.
So no one could meet someone else.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,110
The next theme was furniture stores.

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,150
How about IKEA?
Where is IKEA?

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,250
The problem is still Tanaka.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,420
How do we get Tanaka out of the regular members?

16
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,290
Is someone coming?

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,730
The three of them met in front of Otsuka Furniture in Shinjuku.

18
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,170
Here is where they are now.

19
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:21,040
Matsumoto, Hosei, and Endo are in Shinjuku.
Hamada is in Shibuya.
Fujimoto is in Nakameguro.
And Tanaka is in Harajuku.

20
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,320
Will all six be able to meet tonight?

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,490
[Subbed by RAIDEN1017]

22
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,830
The next theme will be announced.

23
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,730
Hey, what the hell.

24
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,700
“Kushikatsu Tanaka”

25
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,640
We went to various restaurants on Gaki before, but sorry, I've forgotten everything.

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,150
They used to come to each of Kushikatsu Tanaka's restaurants for the "Kushikatsu Tanaka Marathon" segment.

27
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,660
It was 4 years ago that they went to each restaurant in the 23 wards of Tokyo.

28
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,660
We went there on Gaki.

29
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,770
This is difficult!

30
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,270
Where did we go?

31
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,140
Oh, it’s bad.

32
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,840
I’m in trouble.

33
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,410
Everyone's memory is hazy.

34
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,110
Meanwhile, what about Fujimoto?

35
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,620
I have walked through there.

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,590
Do you remember the place?

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,690
There is one restaurant I know for sure.

38
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,260
- Where is it?
- *****.

39
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,500
Along Setagaya Street.

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,300
He went to the restaurant along Setagaya Street.

41
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,810
And what about Hamada?

42
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,280
There must be a lot of restaurants.

43
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,650
But I know that restaurant in *****.

44
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,450
It's the one near that intersection.

45
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,330
He remembered the restaurant from memory.

46
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,060
I wish at least Fujimon and Tanaka would come there.

47
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,230
I want to make it a 3-on-3.

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,200
-You were told by them about the number of people.
Yeah.

49
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,640
Endo said that in a smug.
So I said, "Don't be so cocky!"

50
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,110
- He said that in a smug?
- Yeah.

51
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,150
He said, "If there are three of us here, then we are right.

52
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,880
So I said, “Hey bitch!!”

53
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,360
Meanwhile, what about three guys who can talk to each other?

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,990
There's one near Tokyo Tower.

55
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,100
- How do you know that?
- There was a wide five-way near there.

56
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,630
Let's go there.

57
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,170
They decided to go to the restaurant near the Tokyo Tower that Matsumoto remembered.

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,380
- Do you have any ideas now?
- Yes.

59
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,380
In Setagaya area.

60
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,990
But what street was that?
Komazawa Street?

61
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:23,460
Also, there is one in Shin-Yokohama station.

62
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,200
But there is no way they would come there.
Even I know that.

63
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,900
Tanaka was deciding between the Setagaya and the Shin-Yokohama Station.

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,010
He should head for the Setagaya considering the distance.

65
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,710
However, there are 10 Kushikatsu Tanaka restaurants in Setagaya Ward.

66
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,150
What is Tanaka's answer?

67
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,220
Please head to ****.

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,790
As I remember, that is on Komazawa Street.

69
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,100
As far as Tanaka remembers, there is the restaurant on the Komazawa Street.

70
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,810
I really need to meet with someone, please.

71
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,170
I'll do my best, please.

72
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,510
Please, I want to meet someone.

73
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,050
Will Tanaka's prayers be answered?

74
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,820
Here is where the six of them are heading.

75
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,560
This is a difficult theme because of the number of restaurants.
What will happen?

76
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,260
Fujimoto was heading for Setagaya via the Old Yamanote Street.

77
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,070
That would be in front of the station or some other convenient location.

78
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,970
Wasn't that just down the street?

79
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,310
A restaurant you found by chance is a no good by the rules.

80
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,140
- Is that so?
- Yes.

81
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,450
- Is that a no good?
- Yes.

82
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,750
Oh, It was there.

83
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,320
I know!
Yes, right there.

84
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,890
It was there.

85
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,320
Is this no good?
It's not no good, right?

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,960
You didn't come up with this restaurant.

87
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,360
But I said, "It could have been down the street."

88
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,730
Can't you do something about it?

89
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,700
No.

90
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,670
- I should have gone to there!
- This is another place where celebrities might pass by.

91
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,170
Come on!

92
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,210
A few minutes later.

93
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,850
Hey, is it serious?

94
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,420
Is it serious?

95
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,320
The restaurant isn't open yet?

96
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,430
The restaurant in Shinsen-cho Fujimoto passed was the one Hamada had chosen.

97
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,960
They regrettably missed each other.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
I was talking about that restaurant.

99
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,800
- Please say, "Go to that restaurant.”
- But, hey...

100
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,210
Isn't that too strict?

101
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:01,280
If only Fujimoto had chosen Kushikatsu Tanaka in Shinsen-cho, he could have met Hamada.

102
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,420
Now we're here.

103
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,920
Which restaurant did he arrive at?

104
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,230
- I think you arrived quite early.
- Okay

105
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,200
Kushikatsu Tanaka in Setagaya.

106
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,510
He waited for the others with slight expectation.

107
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,280
At that time, Tanaka arrived near his destination restaurant.

108
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,710
Thank you.

109
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,280
Now, I arrived at the restaurant in *****.

110
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,890
Would he be able to meet someone?

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,100
Ah, there he is!

112
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,840
Yeah!

113
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,940
Yeah!
Tanaka!

114
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,850
I'm so happy!

115
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,420
Welcome!

116
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,590
- I'm so happy!
- Thank you!

117
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,390
Tanaka came to “Tanaka”.

118
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,760
The street Tanaka thought was the Komazawa Street was the Setagaya Street.

119
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,130
He met Fujimoto with flying colors.

120
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,830
And time was up.

121
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,510
Where is the restaurant where Matsumoto's team arrived?

122
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,080
They confirmed each other's whereabouts over the call.

123
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,910
Did you guys meet someone?

124
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,450
Yeah.

125
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,850
Tanaka and Fujimon?

126
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,090
That's right!

127
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,190
Where are you?

128
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,330
We are in Setagaya.

129
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,100
I didn't know about that restaurant.

130
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,970
I'm amazed you caught a stray dog.

131
00:08:59,170 --> 00:08:59,930
A stray dog?

132
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,970
Please don't call me that.

133
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,740
Anyway, as long as we catch that stray dog, we'll be all right.

134
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,340
Where are you, Hamada-san?

135
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,910
I'm at a restaurant near the intersection of Shinsen.

136
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,780
Where's that?

137
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,850
- Is that the Old Yamanote Street?
- Yes, it is.

138
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,020
How do you know that place?

139
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,660
This is the road from Daikanyama to Ebisu.

140
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,020
And where are the three guys?

141
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,030
We are in front of a pizza shop.

142
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,870
15 minutes ago.

143
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:37,410
They were heading to a restaurant near Tokyo Tower, relying on Matsumoto's memory.

144
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,210
- Kushikatsu...huh?
- Huh?

145
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,480
Frozen pizza?

146
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,950
Frozen pizza?

147
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,280
That closed on November 23, 2020.

148
00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:01,860
This restaurant, which used to be Kushikatsu Tanaka, has become a frozen pizza production and sales store.

149
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:09,800
Apparently the restaurant I remembered is now a pizza shop.

150
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,010
It had turned into a pizza shop, that's a problem!!

151
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,310
This restaurant turned two years ago.

152
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,250
- That's no good.
- If it's changed into a different restaurant two years ago, it's not gonna work!

153
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,020
But the skewers are still on the ground in front of the shop.

154
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,580
No way.

155
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
You guys think it's okay even if there's no restaurant!?

156
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,890
We're meeting next!
See you!

157
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,460
- Hey, the phone went dead.
- They hung up the call.

158
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:41,040
I complained and they hung up.

159
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,040
They should give me more praise for catching Tanaka.

160
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,870
I don't like that way of talking.

161
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,880
Three hours have passed since the start!
Here is where the six of them are now.

162
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,320
They are relatively far apart, so it's important to take someone's thoughts into account when deciding where to meet up.

163
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,260
Next theme announced!

164
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,330
It says something strange again.
[Large Bookstore]

165
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,860
This must be that place.
There is no other place but that place.

166
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,730
In Shinjuku?

167
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,270
1, 2, 3...

168
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,300
Kinokuniya!

169
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,580
Why did only I say it?
The person who said Shinjuku was also silent.

170
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,180
- Is Kinokuniya the big bookstore in Shinjuku?
- Yes!

171
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,520
How about that store in Daikanyama?

172
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,790
- Tsutaya?
- Oh, Is that Tsutaya?

173
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,420
Oh, which one's better?

174
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,920
Why are you even thinking about it?

175
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,330
They headed for the Kinokuniya bookstore in Shinjuku.

176
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,070
Meanwhile, something unexpected happened to Fujimoto and Tanaka.

177
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,840
- What?
- Here we go.

178
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,340
A large bookstore.

179
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,910
Let's meet again in a row!

180
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,880
Does that mean we say where we are going at the same time and match?

181
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,620
I don't know where it will be, but I'll definitely meet you again!

182
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,920
Let's show them our bachelor potential!

183
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,720
Do you understand the rules?

184
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,930
- We move together.
- Oh, sorry.

185
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,630
Are you serious?!

186
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you know this segment?

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,970
Of course, this is a very popular segment!

188
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,040
Fujimoto spoke this way at the beginning.

189
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,710
You said something about us split up again.

190
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,120
- You're not watching Gaki, are you?
- I'm watching it! This is a very popular segment.

191
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,580
You said that at the beginning.

192
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,390
But you didn't understand this at all.
Ouch!

193
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,020
He said, "Let's meet again!”

194
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,560
I didn't understand what you were talking about.

195
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,460
Fujimoto didn't understand the rules at all.

196
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,100
That was not good.

197
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,500
“Let's meet again!!”

198
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,910
How many times do you have to say that?

199
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:05,650
He was teased by Tanaka constantly.
For the time being, they discussed in the taxi which large bookstore they would go to.

200
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,380
- Hamada-san is in Shibuya.
- Yes.

201
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,890
- Right now?
- Yes.

202
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,720
But there aren't any large bookstores in Shibuya, are there?

203
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,790
What came to mind?

204
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:25,470
The one I just came up with is Sanseido in Carrot Tower in Sangenjaya.

205
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,830
Not there.

206
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,570
So, where did you come up with?

207
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,570
After all, it's that place.

208
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,040
It's next to Takashimaya in Shinjuku.

209
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,820
- Is it next to Studio Alta?
- Next to Alta?

210
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,490
No, next to Takashimaya.

211
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,390
I know the Kinokuniya bookstore next to Alta in Shinjuku.

212
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,060
- There is a Kinokuniya bookstore there.
- Yes.

213
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,700
The store Fujimoto is talking about is Kinokuniya's Foreign Book Store.

214
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,130
It is just a few minutes' walk from the main store.

215
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,310
Their fate depends on which one they choose.

216
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,640
Then, please head for Shinjuku.

217
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,710
Either way, it is in Shinjuku.

218
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,720
They headed for Shinjuku for the time being, without giving an answer for now.

219
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,190
Meanwhile, what about this lone man?

220
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,590
A large bookstore.

221
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:34,740
Two old stores come to mind.

222
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,540
But...

223
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,380
But I'm here and I can't ignore *****.

224
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,920
What was Hamada's answer?

225
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:57,120
I should probably go to *****.

226
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,070
I don't think they will go to Kinokuniya in Shinjuku.

227
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,970
He decided that no one would come to the Kinokuniya bookstore that the other members had chosen.

228
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,610
What will be Hamada's fate?

229
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,250
Four hours and five minutes had passed since the start.

230
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,220
This is the chance for Matsumoto, Hosei, and Endo to meet Fujimoto and Tanaka.

231
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,690
Hamada predicted that no one would come to the Kinokuniya in Shinjuku.

232
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,460
What would happen?

233
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,770
Fujimoto and Tanaka headed for Shinjuku, still wondering where to go.

234
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,170
Is there anything else?

235
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,340
Let's consider Hamada-san's location.

236
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,710
Yes, we have to consider Hamada-san.
Wasn't there a Junkudo bookstore somewhere?

237
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,150
- There is also a Kodomo-no-Shiro in Aoyama.
- Yes, there is!

238
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,490
There is.

239
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,360
What is the answer they came up with?

240
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,260
- It is next to Alta, after all.
- Yeah, that Kinokuniya bookstore, right?

241
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,460
Yeah, that is famous.

242
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,040
Their destination was decided to be the Shinjuku main store of Kinokuniya.

243
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,170
And another team was going to Kinokuniya bookstore.

244
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,240
Where is the store they arrived at?

245
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,580
Please.

246
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,720
Really, please.

247
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,690
- This is the only place.
- And it's big.

248
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,520
After all, this is magnificent.

249
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,260
They chose the Kinokuniya Shinjuku main store, as did Fujimoto and Tanaka.

250
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,800
However, Matsumoto had one concern.

251
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,810
But I am not sure if I would have come here if I were alone.

252
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,940
If so, where would you have gone?

253
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,310
I might have gone to the Tsutaya bookstore in Daikanyama for my troubles.

254
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,290
If no one came after all this waiting, it would be impossible this time.

255
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:15,600
Matsumoto's hunch was right on target.
Hamada came to the Tsutaya bookstore in Daikanyama.

256
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,530
Where did they all go?

257
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,900
And...

258
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,170
Nobody's coming.

259
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,680
- Sorry, time is up.
-Really!?

260
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,550
It's so bad!

261
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,350
I waited so long!

262
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,780
Really? I'm so shocked!

263
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,890
Where did Fujimoto and Tanaka really go?

264
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,360
Hi.

265
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,060
They confirmed each other's whereabouts over the call.

266
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,000
We waited so long!

267
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,370
I waited for the three of us!

268
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,740
We met!

269
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,040
Actually...

270
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,680
Fujimoto and Tanaka were on their way to the Kinokuniya main store in Shinjuku.

271
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,350
On the way....

272
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,290
I remembered that.

273
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,360
Just before Tanaka arrived at Shinjuku, he remembered the Tsutaya bookstore in Daikanyama.

274
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,730
Yeah, Tsutaya in Daikanyama!

275
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,530
Let's go there.

276
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,270
Excuse me, please head there.

277
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,670
Tsutaya in Daikanyama.

278
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:41,520
Expecting Hamada to be there, the two of them hastily changed their destination and headed for Daikanyama.

279
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:49,460
Twenty minutes after the change of destination, they arrived at the Tsutaya in Daikanyama.

280
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,590
Let's go!

281
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,630
Thank you.

282
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,490
Thank you!

283
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,140
Seriously?

284
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,540
Here they come.

285
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,910
They met Hamada with flying colors.

286
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,940
What took you guys so long?

287
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,580
Sorry, I've been through a lot.

288
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,520
Were you guys planning to come here all along?
Or did you change here on the way?

289
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,790
We were heading for Kinokuniya in Shinjuku at first.

290
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,490
But on the way I remembered Tsutaya.

291
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,190
FLAAAAASH!

292
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,260
You didn't!

293
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,370
Where did you guys really go?

294
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,370
We are in Kinokuniya in Shinjuku!
This place is venerable!

295
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,910
I see.

296
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,970
- Tanaka.
- Yes?

297
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,240
Where would you have gone if you were alone?

298
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,150
I was headed for the store in the carrot tower in Sangenchaya.

299
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,650
He's nuts, right?

300
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,350
That was close!

301
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,220
You really like Sangenchaya!

302
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,160
You really like Carrot Tower, don't you?

303
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,630
I want to finish with next one.

304
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,300
Let's finish with next one

305
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,630
- Isn't he a bit annoying?
- Yeah!

306
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,670
That's because he met someone earlier.

307
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,870
The next theme was announced.

308
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,210
Make it a very simple theme!

309
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,110
Ta-dah!

310
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,010
Hey, what’s the hell is this!?
[Tree-lined street]

311
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:21,950
This is that place.

312
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,180
There's the only place for this.

313
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,590
A tree-lined street.

314
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,090
- It’s okay.
- This is that place.

315
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,330
Have you come up with yours already?

316
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,190
This is a piece of cake.

317
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,630
That's the only place.

318
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,700
Wait a second.

319
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,430
- I came up with it even before I saw the theme.
- What are you saying?

320
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,430
No way.

321
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,540
That's the only place.

322
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,870
Wait a second.

323
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,710
I know.
I know.
I know.

324
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,480
You don't.

325
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:09,760
Matsumoto, Hosei, and Endo were at the Avenue of Gingko Trees in Meiji Jingu Gaien, one of the most popular sightseeing spots in Tokyo.

326
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,500
Meanwhile, Hamada and the other three arrived near their destination.

327
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,570
They must have come here.

328
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,180
Where did they arrive?

329
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,680
The stupid team doesn't come at all.

330
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,890
The smart team has been waiting for them.

331
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,790
The smart team is always waiting for them.

332
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,060
- They are evil.
- That's right.

333
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,490
- Stupid is evil.
- Yeah.

334
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,460
You agree with me too much, don't you?

335
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,800
I've been quiet.

336
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,670
And...

337
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,270
There is a light over there.

338
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,940
- There's a light coming from over there.
- Really?

339
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,110
There's a light like ours coming this way.

340
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,250
I've seen them before.

341
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,980
Finally, you guys are here!

342
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,250
We did it!!

343
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,420
I met you!!

344
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,530
There's no other place but here, right?

345
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,360
Thanks for your help this time, Fujimon.

346
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,300
You caught this stray dog.

347
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,940
I feel I was very helpful too.

348
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,070
- But...
- Hey, that's enough.

349
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,210
- There is one thing that surprised me.
- You don't have to tell them.

350
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,180
I met him at the Kushikatsu Tanaka in Setagaya.

351
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,820
We were so happy.
Then we had a call with you guys.

352
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,690
The next theme was a large bookstore.

353
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:46,690
After he saw that theme,
he said, “Okay, Tanaka, let's meet next again!”
And he left!

354
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,530
He has never watched this show before!

355
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,370
Hey, that's a big problem.

356
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,370
What do you mean?

357
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,300
This guy thought that all six of us had to be there at once.

358
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,810
If that's the rule, we'll never get it done.

359
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,640
Wouldn't that be more fun?

360
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,010
Wouldn't that be more fun?

361
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,280
We can't do that.

362
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,320
We have a report here, too.

363
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,720
Yamazaki-san called us the smart team and you guys the stupid team.

364
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,260
Thank you.
Really thank you.

365
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,330
It sounded good.

366
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,130
That's not true.
I just agreed with Matsumoto-san.

367
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,800
You are terrible.

368
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,430
I only agreed with him because....

369
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,440
See, he's pissed!

370
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,670
It's no wonder Lamborghini is angry.

371
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,810
Lamborghini is also angry with you.

372
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,420
