1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,620
Chosen by parents! My son is shining in this theory! Special!

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,390
The next guests are...

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,290
Nice to meet you

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,160
Thank you for having us today, thank you very much

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,460
I'm Kurokawa Kaori

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,170
I'm his wife, Kurokawa Miyuki

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,470
I see where this is going

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,570
They are the parents of Kurokawa Akihito, more commonly known as Kurochan

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,800
This is the first time
I saw his parents

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,410
Kurochan, who has participated in 32 theories, up till now

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:37,680
Additionally, involved in various themes such as Monster house and Monster idol

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,350
I've actually been watching all of them

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,220
I've been watching it as well

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:48,190
But my heart somehow feels disgusted sometimes, seriously

15
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,360
He always does weird things, right? Such as lying

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,100
When I see those things, my heart aches

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,440
First of all, let's see which theory does
she thinks her son is shining the most

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,280
I personally like the theory about the race between pigeon and human the most

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,620
Because he didn't say anything strange in that episode

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,360
So that one gave me a good impression

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,360
Kurochan's mother
is an earnest person

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,860
Pigeon and human, starting from a random location

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,130
Who will the one to arrive home first?

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,810
Theory: In terms of homing instinct, humans can do better than pigeons

25
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,110
Since he doesn't have any cash on him, so I thought he will rack his brain to think of a solution

26
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:44,020
But then, he still ends up using some nasty tricks

27
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,590
Exactly. To ensure a fair race with the pigeons, Kurochan's wallet and smartphone have been confiscate, however...

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,090
I'll take this, thank you very much

29
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,490
I'll make good use of the money you gave me

30
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,570
He held a photography event on the spot,
and earned enough money to buy a train ticket

31
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,640
I'm going back home with the help from everyone

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,710
He has always been like this since childhood

33
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,510
Don't know if he is clever or cunning

34
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:19,520
In regard to money, Kurochan has been demonstrating his cunning cleverness since childhood

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,790
When he borrowed money from his younger sister

36
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,490
Although a normal people will pay back

37
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:29,900
However, that kid has been thinking about excuses to not pay back

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,400
And he said "I'll let you be my elder sister, so give me money please"

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,410
So he means that he's now the younger one, and his younger sister is now his elder sister

40
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,540
And because she's now the elder one, she should give him money

41
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,310
I have no idea what he's talking about

42
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:53,620
The story continues, Kurochan's cunning cleverness escalated when he became an university student

43
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,620
-He's pissing me off
-Sure he is

44
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,690
When he's 22 years old?   -Yeah, around 20 years old

45
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,290
He said he want to get a hair transplant   -Yes, yes

46
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:07,400
He said he wants to get a hair transplant, and asked us to give him money

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,970
Around four hundred thousand yen...   -Yeah

48
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,540
Did he really get a hair transplant?

49
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,610
I don't think so   -No idea, he never mentioned it again

50
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,210
All he did was taking money away from us

51
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,210
He's probably good at asking for a favor

52
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,250
But I believe he's not doing these kinds of thing to other people

53
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,650
Hopefully he didn't

54
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,790
I told him not to do these things to other people

55
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,090
Yeah, when it comes to money

56
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,660
So this is Kurochan, someone who is obsessed with money

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,660
He really looks
like a bad guy

58
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,760
Even when he became a comedian, he has been asking for money from his parents until recently

59
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,790
Until very recently

60
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,270
Before he was 30 years old, he asked for $150,000 yen per month

61
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:46,940
He asked for $50,000 yen per month after that,
only until 2 years ago, when he reached 42 years old

62
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,470
Which has been a famous story

63
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:55,150
We told him not to borrow money from other people

64
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,550
When it comes to money, just rely on us

65
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,550
His parents are really kind

66
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,150
Therefore that guy is living an elegant lifestyle

67
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,690
When I was on a business trip in Tokyo, and went to meet him

68
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,530
I asked him "where are you going now?" and he said "I am going to the beauty salon"

69
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,300
And I thought how dare you go to those
places? You don't even have money

70
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,470
Back to today's theme

71
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:20,510
Which theory does Kurochan's father thinks his son is shining the most?

72
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,680
Well, probably the "Future Kurochan"

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,850
I'm able to watch it and laugh the whole way through it

74
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,450
The man's lie and love being trifled with prophetic tweets

75
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:37,990
Being under complete surveillance for 10 days, the documentary "Future Kurochan"

76
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,230
Let's sit down and then talk   -Wait a second...

77
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:48,300
The pitfall is of course in front of the bench

78
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,300
He's got to know
that it's there, right?

79
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,670
From how Rei-chama is positioned, it's clear Kurochan appears to suspect something

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:04,280
I was thinking about how great you really are, and...

81
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,290
This whole week I was thinking about how great you are, and...

82
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:14,190
And I was thinking if I like you, and...

83
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,860
I do

84
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,330
I just wanted to put that out there clearly   -Thank you

85
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,830
Thank you

86
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,830
He means that
"I'm believing you"

87
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:28,040
I really do like you, so...

88
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,040
He's gonna be
double shocked if
there's indeed a trap

89
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,380
So, let's sit down and talk   -Yes, let's sit down

90
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,130
This is heartbreaking   -So heartbreaking

91
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,830
She's running off   -Truly heartbreaking

92
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,400
She's running! She's running!

93
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,500
She's hopping away

94
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
This must be traumatizing...

95
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,840
Yeah, this gonna result in trauma

96
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,080
Isn't he crying already? Come on...

97
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,480
Kurochan, hang in there   -Climb on out

98
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,950
Good things will happen   -Exactly

99
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,520
Kurochan...

100
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,360
I can't watch this, come on...   -This is just...

101
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,260
This is just...too heartbreaking

102
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,400
I can't look at this

103
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,830
Climbing out from there like that

104
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,710
Ah, she's gone, Rei-chama...

105
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,050
Ah, this is Rainy Blue's playing

106
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,490
He's not saying a thing   -Not a word

107
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,390
This is truly heartbreaking

108
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,930
He got on alone   -This really went too far...

109
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,470
He came with another person, but is leaving alone...

110
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,210
Such an epic film   -Even the greatest actor won't be able to make this face

111
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,380
I like that face   -You're good, Kurochan, you're fine

112
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,020
Still filming even when he arrives home

113
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,160
This is really something

114
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,230
Those good memories, look at his happy face

115
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,840
He stored it at his home, huh?   -From the matching pair

116
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,910
He's looking at it

117
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,950
What's he going to do?

118
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,390
What will you do?

119
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,520
What's happening?

120
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,960
Ah, hello, Sae-chan

121
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,170
Sae-chan?

122
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,170
Eh? A different girl?

123
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,240
Do you like meat?

124
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:18,080
And the most memorable scene in Future Kurochan is...

125
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:26,450
Rei-chama's glass

126
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,560
Everything went just as we imagined

127
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,760
I hate it, that's nasty, licking someone else's things

128
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,870
As Kurochan's mother, how do you feel when you see him licking the glass?

129
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,700
I feel like vomiting...

130
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,940
I start to wonder am I really the one who gave birth to this kid, seriously

131
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,410
And I thought "so this kid is doing these kinds of thing"

132
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,980
"No wonder he's not attractive to women"

133
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,550
"Because he's doing these kinds of thing, and being aired on TV"

134
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,720
And in regard to this "glass licking act"

135
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,000
Kurochan's nieces are very disgusted as well

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,430
They say he is no different from a scumbag

137
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,270
And call him "shit" and "bastard"

138
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,770
How did you feel when you hear them call him with those words?

139
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,840
I was really angry

140
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,010
Why should he be scolded by you kids?

141
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,210
Oh, so she's on
Kurochan's side

142
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,950
So I stood on my son's side, and chewed my granddaughters up

143
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,520
Ah, of course, he's
Kurochan's mother

144
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,460
Although he's a scumbag, he's still her son, who she gave birth in pain

145
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,460
Don't call him
a scumbag

146
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,130
She's angry even if the ones who scolded him are their relatives

147
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,600
Furthermore...

148
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,740
Some other comedians call him "baldy"

149
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,640
Whenever others talk bad about him on tv shows, I can't help but feel angry

150
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,450
Thereafter, I will never watch any shows with that comedian

151
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,550
Whenever he appears, I'll change the channel

152
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,320
She definitely dislikes me...

153
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,390
For example, which comedian talked bad about him?

154
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,720
Everyone, right?   -Yeah, everyone

155
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,100
Not much people is treating him nice, so...

156
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,330
What if you have to choose one?

157
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,330
Fujimon?   -Fujimon-san

158
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:28,340
Future Kurochan

159
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:28,340
In terms of homing instinct,
humans can do better than pigeons

160
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:28,570
So in conclusion, these are the two theories that Kurochan's parents think their son shined the most

161
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:35,110
Given this precious chance to meet his parents, we've decided to ask a bunch more questions about Kurochan

162
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,500
Is he a restless sleeper since childhood?

163
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Well, I know he snores very loudly

164
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,940
But I never saw him tossing and turning when he sleeps at home

165
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,780
So I didn't know about this until I saw it on TV, and I thought "that's terrible"

166
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,710
Is his room very untidy since childhood?

167
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,820
No, no, not at all

168
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,650
He has been living with his sister in the same room, so...

169
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,860
So he's probably showing his true color after he left home

170
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,620
No one will come

171
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,160
With complete freedom

172
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,430
When did he start having hairs on his back?

173
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,470
Who cares?

174
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,870
I never saw him naked

175
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,540
So when I saw that on TV

176
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,970
I thought like "Eh?..."

177
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,110
It must be disgusting to sleep with that thing...

178
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,480
To be honest, I know nothing about him

179
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,110
He didn't have hairs before   -On his back?

180
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:49,290
But come on, it couldn't be gene mutation though

181
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,190
By the way, does Kurochan's father have hairs on his back?

182
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,730
I don't have hairs on my back

183
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,670
Including all our relatives, Akihito (Kurochan) is the only one

184
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:07,670
Does he cry a lot since childhood?

185
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,670
That thing cries all the time

186
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,440
He cries every time I scold him

187
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,410
Whenever we say like "Did you do this?" or "That's no good"

188
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,720
Then he will cry and say sorry

189
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,350
Well, he's probably fake crying though...

190
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,350
That thing is malicious

191
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,660
They are so mean

192
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,290
How else is he different from others?

193
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:32,330
He was conspicuous during secondary school

194
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,530
While everyone else is wearing shoes, only Akihito is not wearing

195
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,340
Because he don't like wearing socks

196
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,710
When others told me "What happened, Ms Kurokawa? Your son is barefooted"

197
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,440
I was like "Eh?..."

198
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,480
I was shocked, I'm always getting shocked by him

199
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,250
Young Kurochan showed so many facets to his personality, which even shocked his own parents, furthermore...

200
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:01,530
What was his future career plan when he was a student?

201
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,230
His high school teacher asked him about this

202
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,730
And he said "I want to become a hero", a hero

203
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,500
He said "I want train myself in China, and stay in some remote mountain"

204
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,770
"And I'll soon become a hero"

205
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,070
This guy is unbelievable...   -He's already in high school

206
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:21,680
Then his teacher told him "there's no jobs for hero, there's no such occupation"

207
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
His teacher told him, right?   -Yes

208
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,950
And I thought "is this kid retarded or something?..."

209
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,690
That's all from Kurochan's parents

210
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,860
So that's all from Kurochan's parents

211
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,590
Kurochan's mother seems like a kind and earnest person

212
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,160
Yeah, his mother is really earnest

213
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,070
And she probably loves Kurochan so much

214
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,500
Yeah, she's standing on his side

215
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,840
So she probably hate both of us   -Yeah

216
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,970
No, no worries

217
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,970
They hate Fujimon the most

218
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:55,910
*Kinoshita from TKO is famous for mistreating juniors, and Kurochan once said that Kinoshita made him kneel down and scolded him while stepping on his head

219
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:55,910
Eh? But actually, they should hate Kinoshita from TKO the most, right?

220
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,320
Well, there's no need for Kurochan's mother to change channel then

221
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,590
However, since there's still a lot of mysteries left after interviewing with Kurochan's parents

222
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,720
So, this time, we invited this person to today's show

223
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,660
Please come in

224
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
Oh, so it's him

225
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,130
Here I am, everybody!

226
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,100
Kurochan, you watched it too, right? How do you feel?

227
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,310
Yeah, I watched it, and I'm sure that the staffs are asking those questions with malicious intent

228
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,640
How come?

229
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,580
They were like "Hey, Kurochan's mother, he's licking other's glass, how do you feel?"

230
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,210
Is it necessary to ask those questions?

231
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,550
Well, but it's the fault of the person who licked it though

232
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,590
Yeah well, although it's my fault, but I was actually so drunk, so...

233
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,560
So I don't even remember it, to be honest

234
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,360
You don't remember it?

235
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,230
It's not in my memory*

236
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,000
*The phrase "It's not in my memory (記憶にございません)" is always used as excuse by Japanese politicians

237
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,000
That make things worse

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,860
There's nothing we can say if he put it like that

239
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,670
He's truly a useless person   -Yeah, a useless person

240
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,570
No, I'm not a useless person, listen to me...

241
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,140
Of course you are, you asked for $150,000 yen every month right?

242
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,340
That was unbelievable   -It surely is

243
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,440
And $50,000 yen per month only until 2 years ago

244
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,880
You're already earning, right?

245
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,450
In another perspective, I'm actually being dutiful towards my parents

246
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,350
You two seems to be misunderstanding me

247
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,620
When parents don't need to worry about their children anymore

248
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,820
They'll think "oh, so the kids are fine on their own, they don't need us anymore", and may therefore even die sooner

249
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,430
I'm just trying my best to let them worry about me

250
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,360
And trick them into thinking "this kid won't be able to survive without us", and thus making them live a longer life

251
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,600
I've therefore asked for money on purpose

252
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,000
That's all from Kurokawa suspect?

253
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No, I'm not a suspect

254
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,810
You surely are a suspect   -No, it's not illegal

255
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,340
So that's what you think, Kurokawa member?

256
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,880
*When the suspect is a public figure, Japanese media refer to them as "members"

257
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,380
No, don't use the word member too

258
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,880
They both mean the same thing

259
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,850
Come on, you're earning now, you should be the one to give them money

260
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,990
You're earning a lot, right? You told me your annual income before

261
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,620
I told you, but that's...   -You told me, right?

262
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,730
But I need to pay taxes...   -Let Downtown know your annual income

263
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,330
Eh?

264
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,400
Come on, tell them your annual income

265
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,370
Eh? Did I tell you, Jinnai-san?   -Yes, you did

266
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,000
Eh? Really?   -Yes, you definitely told me

267
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,800
It was even in the news

268
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,670
Oh, really?   -Yes, it was

269
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,870
Tell us about it

270
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,770
$960,000 yen for Kurochan

271
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,180
Sorry, that was a dull moment   -What do you mean?

272
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,310
He probably did a wordplay Boke   -Yeah, 96 and Kuro

273
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,450
Kuro has the same pronunciation with 96

274
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,850
That's not what we're talking about

275
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,420
That was such a gentle Boke

276
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
Just tell us then, Jinnai

277
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,190
30,000,000 yen   -Why did you say it?

278
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,930
It was in the news

279
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,000
Wait a second, that's a dull moment from both of you

280
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,770
No, no, that's not a dull moment...

281
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,570
That conversation was...

282
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,070
I wanna go home

283
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,840
No, no, no way

284
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,340
Come on, Jinnai-san, don't drag me with you

285
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,940
I'm the one who got dragged, dude!

286
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,010
The news said that you're earning 30,000,000 yen

287
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,180
So scary, I wanna go home

288
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,180
This guy is earning 30,000,000 yen

289
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,620
Because there's a CM at the same time...

290
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,590
Anyway, did you buy any present or give any money to your parents?

291
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,550
Good question

292
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,120
No, not yet, but...

293
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,090
That's terrible

294
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,460
No, because we're in the time of Corona, and of course, I thought about doing something for them afterwards

295
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,770
For example, what do you plan to do?   -Tell us

296
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,800
For example?

297
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,140
Make a promise with your parents now

298
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,110
I'll buy them a neckerchief

299
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,280
It has been a while since I last heard that word, you're buying them a neckerchief?

300
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I'll buy them a neckerchief
