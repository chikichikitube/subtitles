00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
Mommy

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
Next up is

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
m -89 -43 l 38 -43 l 38 -43 l 38 28 l 38 28 l -89 28

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:11:14,730
Subbed by: Otviss

5
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,090
Yeah doctor, this hurts as well

6
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,750
It does? I see, I see.

7
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,420
This, ya understand?

8
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,420
That, right?

9
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,120
Ouch ouch ouch...

10
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,490
I wonder how this'll be

11
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,600
You've got quite the physique... It's hard to tell whether it would work on everybody right?

12
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,130
So hang on...

13
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
This hurt?

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Yeah a little bit.

15
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,910
How about this?

16
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,710
Oh this doesn't raise at all. You've got adhesion here.

17
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,440
This is seriously a frozen shoulder..
(50 year old's shoulder)

18
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,440
A frozen shoulder?

19
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,440
How old are you if I may?

20
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,910
55..

21
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,580
So it's a frozen shoulder then...

22
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,250
Despite having muscles...

23
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,590
...you have no strength

24
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,590
Hahaha..

25
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,690
You're right, I don't

26
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,390
Yeah, you have no strength

27
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,230
You do appear to have muscles though

28
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,730
That's because people who train and have bulging muscles like this,

29
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,500
their mood is a little weak...

30
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,540
THAT'S BECAUSE they work out only to show off

31
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,070
Hahahaha! You've been very disrespectful for a while now!

32
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,010
He's dissin' ya!

33
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,010
He sure freaking is!

34
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,610
Heal him.

35
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,610
Just heal me doctor.

36
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,020
Well "Just heal me", when...

37
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,050
...this shoulder hurts here, this hurt before..

38
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,020
In contrary, the ankles right? I'll just put a needle in real quick.

39
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,530
Ouch ouch ouch..

40
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,530
Putting one in...

41
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,530
..makes this shrink right? Your cervical vertebrae.

42
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,130
Kind of becomes like that... And here I'll put a needle in the side of your ankle.

43
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,800
Ugh...

44
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,800
Alright, lift your arm back

45
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,470
Uh...

46
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,940
Feel any pain? What about here?

47
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,710
Oh!

48
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,410
It got better by just doing that right?

49
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,580
Just two needles in the Leg??

50
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,580
It feels better compared to before

51
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,950
I mean, I still have some pain but..

52
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,860
Back of your hand alright?

53
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,860
Here it comes..

54
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,490
There's a pressure point on the hand here ya know

55
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,490
Huh? On there?

56
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,700
Haha, you're putting that fat needle in there?

57
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,970
Oh god I get it, I get what you're saying now..

58
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,240
How should I explain it, It's not like a stab...

59
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,570
It's pounding..

60
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,570
Yeah, it's like a pound

61
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,340
But if it's pounding throughout that means it's healthy right?

62
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,580
Yup yup...

63
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,780
Ohohoh!

64
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,350
Doctor, let me know when you put them in

65
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,050
Ooooh!!!..

66
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,050
Putting one in your neck now

67
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,490
Aaghh!

68
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,490
Oh it's in, it's in!

69
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,360
Hang on, ITS FREAKING IN THERE

70
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,730
It went way too far in!

71
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,930
Waaaaay too far in. Oh god, its hot.

72
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,100
Raise your hand please

73
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,300
Oh wow!

74
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,970
It raises with ease..

75
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,270
So this way doesn't quite raise properly does it?

76
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,740
Before

77
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,270
No, it still hurts.

78
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,740
Is this for real?..

79
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,110
It's scary how far in it is..

80
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,110
Yeah...

81
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,850
If we want more of a therapeutic effect

82
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,620
We need Yaito (Moxibustion)

83
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,490
We probably need a really huge one

84
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,520
How about sitting a little bit more to the side..

85
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,520
Hahaha... He's getting nervous

86
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,230
Huh? We're gonna do Yaito?

87
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,330
Piping hot Yaito

88
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,330
Super Sadistic Acupunture

89
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,330
m -89 -43 l 38 -43 l 38 -43 l 38 28 l 38 28 l -89 28

90
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,330
②

91
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,560
A little bit more on the side please

92
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,200
We're gonna do Yaito?

93
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,430
Let's just all do it...

94
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,430
No one wants to do Yaito

95
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,400
Let's all do it..

96
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,400
Are we done with the needles, Doctor?

97
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,740
Uh no I still..

98
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,310
I have the Tsuuden (Electric current) left to do

99
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,980
So we're not quite on the same level as daddy are we?

100
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,180
It's like currents. Electricity!

101
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,180
You're gonna use electricity?

102
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,380
Yeah, we're moving on to electricity.

103
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,380
I'm getting the full package..

104
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,380
So today...

105
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,380
It's a special course!

106
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,790
It still hurts right?

107
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,790
Does it?

108
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,790
I mean if it fixes it..

109
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,190
..I'd like to try it.

110
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,090
Crap, they're small..

111
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,090
Why are they so small?

112
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,100
Do they do anything?

113
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,270
Of course

114
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,270
He's putting them in where the others were before

115
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,240
Oh really?

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,240
Watch out, it's hot

117
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,810
It's not hot, It's not hot..

118
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,810
It's not?

119
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,340
Only thing that's hot is my heart, not these.

120
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,710
Lamest thing I've heard..

121
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,710
That's okay, that's okay

122
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,620
Let's focus on the arm..

123
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,750
I might be a little frank but my heart is kind

124
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,920
Wow, there's smoke coming out..

125
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,750
Woah!

126
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,750
Huh? You've already started!?

127
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,960
It's already started.

128
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,960
Say something then... Ouch ouch ocuh

129
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,690
If I tell you, you'll just stiff up

130
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,930
Doctor, you've put needles in right?

131
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,930
No no, they're yaito

132
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,900
Yeah, Yaito. It's only fire ya know.

133
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,670
It's like stinging

134
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,670
Yeah, it stings a lil' bit

135
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,070
I'm gonna do Yaito on these just briefly

136
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,070
Oh it's warm..

137
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,100
It's warm!

138
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,880
Oh, OH! Ho- Doctor, that was really HOT!

139
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,710
It's just sudden. It's stimulating

140
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,780
Ouch! Doctor please! I'm saying its hot!

141
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,850
Hahahaha!

142
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,850
I said it was freaking hot didnt i?

143
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,490
It's cause I kept bumping into to you

144
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,730
Hahaha! You hit him with them

145
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,730
Ugh, stop it with that!

146
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,760
It was sooo hot

147
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,460
Okay, whatever I hit you, Anyway

148
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,300
Matsumoto-san.

149
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,870
Try standing up once and shake like this

150
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,110
How is it? Your shoulders?

151
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,110
Considerably better!

152
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,340
We don't have a towel though...

153
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,610
Sit down for a bit. My...

154
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,620
Putting the towel here. This is most certainly a frozen shoulder.

155
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,090
Matsumoto, Frozen shoulder he says.

156
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,090
We should...

157
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,190
...do the Tsuuden on the bed

158
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,890
We going to the bed?

159
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,890
Oooooh!

160
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,690
You've got some Adhesion here

161
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,360
The adhesion hurts...

162
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Aahh!

163
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,100
Here we go!

164
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,100
OUUUCH!

165
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,930
Come on doctor!

166
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,930
Doctor!!

167
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,300
Go for it Doctor!

168
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,300
Ugh that hurts so freaking much!

169
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,610
Doctor Zai, Doctor Zai!

170
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,340
Yup!

171
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,240
Oh Doctor...! OHhh!!

172
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,150
"Oh god"

173
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,480
Alright, raise your arm

174
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,520
Raise your arm

175
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
Where there's adhesion, it hurts like crazy.

176
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,650
It really freaking does

177
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,720
Yeah absolutely.

178
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,720
Much better right?

179
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,460
I'm telling you it FEELS BETTER

180
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,800
Sit sit sit. Well perhaps...

181
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,430
If I wanna cure this, I'd have to do the Tsuuden in the bed

182
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,070
The currents?

183
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,070
Yes.

184
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,770
Alright, let's do the currents. We'll prepare it.

185
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,740
Let's do it!

190
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,080
Your hurting shoulder on the top please

191
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,080
Facing upwards

192
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,750
So like this?

193
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,750
However, your back...

194
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,780
Wow, this is amazing..

195
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,460
So here's the shoulder bone. I'll put one needle in...

196
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,160
Wow, He just puts them in without any hesitation either...

197
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,030
I started getting interested in Acupuncture when I was a kid...

198
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,630
Hahaha, to the very end of the needle..

199
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,700
Sadako! You saying useless things over there...

200
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,470
I.. Agh!

201
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,580
Holy crap, It's so far in

202
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,940
Aaahh!

203
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,950
It's so far in. Don't move so much!

204
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,850
Doctor, You sure are overdoing this...

205
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,490
Haha he's quick.

206
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,490
Doctor please...

207
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,890
Wow he put them in quickly

208
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,890
Oh no the electricity...

209
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,060
Woah, he's gonna connect them to electricity

210
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,060
The electricity is really pleasant!

211
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,890
Oh it's gonna sting!

212
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,060
The needles are short aren't they?

213
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,830
Nowhere near short...

214
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,730
To me they're short

215
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,500
Wow...

216
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Today when I brought these short needles with me

217
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,110
my wife and I had a disagreement

218
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,110
Your wife?

219
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,480
If ya put those needles in Matsumoto, He's gonna get scared and whoops they're gonna give away, she said

220
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,750
Your wife isn't being very polite about me is she...

221
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,750
The wife watches your show regularly you know!

222
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,450
Haha, He said it right here

223
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,090
Be quiet please. I'm gonna put the electricity on.

224
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,260
Wow!

225
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,830
Wow, it's all in there..

226
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,830
Shit it's moving!

227
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,330
It's moving, it's moving!

228
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,330
Does it hurt?

229
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,900
Oo...oo...

230
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,910
It's better to use the electricity is it?

231
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,910
Oh yeah, much better

232
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,550
Oh he's gonna do Yaito?

233
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,550
He brought something out

234
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,550
I'm very worried that Matsumoto isn't healing properly.

235
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,290
Wow, It's burning

236
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,290
Huh?

237
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,950
He's like... really burning something

238
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,420
This is super pleasant ♥

239
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,420
He's like burning a torch or something

240
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,460
Hang on seriously..

241
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,560
Is this a festival?

242
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,560
Seriously, stop it

243
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,730
I can't see what's going on from here

244
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,730
Uh, its a torch!

245
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,840
Oh crap, you're right. Don't freaking show me!

246
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,840
This is really refreshing

247
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,110
So, close your eyes. I'm gonna do some on your eyeballs.

248
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,740
NO! You gotta be joking!

249
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,450
Doctor please, Just wait with that! WAIT WITH THAT!

250
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,380
No no, just here see?

251
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,450
He's just gonna fry your eyeballs

252
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,450
Yeah it's super nice

253
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,120
Super nice right? Hear that? It's nice!

254
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,820
This is really refreshing

255
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,360
So, close your eyes. I'm gonna do some on your eyeballs.

256
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,730
NO! You gotta be joking!

257
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,570
Doctor please, Just wait with that. WAIT WITH THAT!

258
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,240
No no, just here see?

259
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,310
He's just gonna fry your eyeballs

260
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,310
Yeah it's super nice

261
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,640
Super nice right? Hear that? It's nice!

262
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,080
Doctor, are you being completely serious?

263
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,180
Are you serious?

264
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,520
Sizzling Onkyuu

265
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,520

268
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,810
I'm just going to do Onkyuu (Moxa cautery​)*

269
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,220
If you move he's just gonna bump into you

270
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,220
No moving about alright?

271
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,250
Doctor, Where are you looking?

272
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,490
It's not good if you look somewhere else

273
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,860
You touched him with the incense before

274
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,800
So after I do this...

275
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,330
...on the adhesion mass here, his blood circulation will be better

276
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,440
His blood circulation becomes better?

277
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,470
Is it warm?

278
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,280
Ye-ah, It's warm.

279
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,280
That's because

280
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,180
we're feeling the same feeling right now

281
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,310
That electricity stuff is finally over...

282
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,720
But just from that short time ya know.. It's..

283
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,720
Yeah, for sure..

284
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,950
It's sensational...

285
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,390
Wonder how long It's been available. 4000 year history?

286
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,890
4000 Years...

287
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,890
Well actually...

288
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,530
You say 4000 years, but this Yaito actually flourished

289
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,830
1000 years ago in Japan. I'm taking the needles out by the way～

290
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,400
It hurts so much when you take them out.

291
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,170
Whazzat!?

292
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,340
This is just scary

293
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,340
A beautifully high pitched "Whazzat?"

294
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,210
Doesn't hurt anymore does it, Now when he said that.

295
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,710
Stand up please

296
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,020
I wonder, I wonder. If it's a good result.

297
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,020
Aah. Ahh!

298
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,620
Uh, It's considerably easier!

299
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,620
Really?

300
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:05,430
After

301
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:05,430
Before

302
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,690
Wow, he's really able to move about

303
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,330
How will it be tomorrow though Doctor?

304
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,330
It'll be good tomorrow

305
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,260
Today, it went well didnt it?

306
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,730
So now you gotta think "Oh that's good that it went well"

307
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,100
If you think about how tomorrow will be, it'll get worse

308
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,170
Then those anxiety feelings will show up again

309
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,040
So "Tomorrow won't be good" will result in it being bad.

310
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,140
The feeling of "Tomorrow I'll make a mistake" is kind of...

311
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,840
Basically negative feelings aren't good.

312
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,840
Exactly, exactly.

313
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,950
Tomorrow will be better and then "Aa～ that's good"..

314
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,350
Alright, this is it for me today

315
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,350
Thank you very much!

316
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,050
Thank you very much!

317
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,820
This was good.

318
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,760
That was scary...

319
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
I'm sorry, it hurt a little didn't it?

320
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,560
Doctor, the medical fee for today is...?

321
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,030
That'll be 3000 Yen* for 30 minutes.

322
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:51,880
*About $27 or £21

323
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,670
All in all 3000 Yen? That's sooo cheap!

324
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,300
30 minutes??

325
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,300
Yes

326
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,740
I felt longer than 30 minutes though...

327
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,880
Wow, he came prepared with a wallet and all

328
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,510
Quickly putting it inside

329
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,310
I always have my wallet with me

330
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,780
Haha "Always have my wallet with me"

331
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,880
Thank you!

332
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,880
Okay! Bye bye!

333
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,390
Kenji, that was awesome

334
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,390
Good, wasn't it?

335
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,660
What an acquaintance​...

336
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,660
Good, wasn't it?

337
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,200
Yeah it was

338
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,200
I'm amazed

339
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,360
Going to things like this ocassionally can't be bad

340
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,730
Yeah, if you feel a little exhausted he'll fix you up quickly

341
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,570
Alright, that was the first reward. We have more though!
