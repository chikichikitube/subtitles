4
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,990
It's Wednesday Downtown! Hello everyone!

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,690
Okay let's meet our first presenter, come on out!

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,300
It's Viking's Kotoge!

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,540
Who the hell are you?!

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,210
I'm Kotoge damnit!

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,620
No no no, that was the worst one ever

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,890
You've done many weird things alot of times but...

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,920
...this was it.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,830
Okay everyone, this show's popular corner...

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,560
...the "there's someone" series, you might remember.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,770
For example, "There's someone when you open"...

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,270
...is the scariest thing that could happen after all.

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,740
"There's someone in the backseat" is the scariest thing that could happen

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,180
"There's someone when you wake up" is the scariest thing that could happen

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,080
There can't be any left though?

19
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,080
About that...

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,750
...always hearing "no more, no more left" but there were!

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,750
Really?

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,390
Here is the one that I've brought this time

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,490
Theory : "There's someone in the bed" is the scariest thing that could happen

24
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,590
That gotta be scary!

25
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,590
That is...

26
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,600
That's definitely scary

27
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,930
All in all, this is the stuff that Hamada-san loves!

28
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,840
This is a bit that we do just to see Hamada-san laugh his ass off.

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,540
Because he loves others' misfortunes, doesn't he?

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,210
After this, we'll watch the "There's someone in the bed" prank loved by Hamada

31
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,280
Also...

32
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,790
The theory that if one member of a trio leaves and you're left with the dummy...

33
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,660
...you can't go on, with Jungle Pocket.

34
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,460
And then...

35
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:01,600
We'll also search for the "bean tanks" of Japan, who are smaller than 150cm and fatter than 100 kgs.

36
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,890
Theory : "There's someone in the bed" is the scariest thing that could happen

37
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,060
Our first target is...

38
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,060
...Panzer's Ogata

39
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,230
This time, with help from his wife...

40
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,940
...we're testing the theory whilst he's alone in the house

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,440
And we've hidden an unknown gentleman inside his bed

42
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,240
That's scary

43
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,440
Standby is OK

44
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,810
That guy's scary as hell

45
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,380
Ogata who returns home, suddenly...

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,050
Ahh what the..!?

47
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,250
THIS IS BULL...

48
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,570
Ahh what the..!?

49
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,830
THIS IS BULL...

50
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,700
This is fun!

51
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,170
Ahh what the..!?

52
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,240
THIS IS BULL...

53
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,680
He flew out of the room out of fear

54
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,380
This is fun!

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,790
He even ran all the way out outside of his house

56
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,190
Excuse us..

57
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,460
He went outside!

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,330
So he went all the way out

59
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,060
Wai- Hold on

60
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,290
Scary~

61
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,100
This isn't some kind of assault?

62
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,330
It's fine?

63
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,970
He ran outside barefooted into the snow out of fear

64
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,400
He couldn't understand anything

65
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:48,510
Not to have the neighbours worry too much, we head inside.

66
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,310
Wah this is funny

67
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,980
That's scary as hell man!

68
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,510
That guy's act.. he can stop now, its enough!

69
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,580
Say something like "Heyoo"

70
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,090
He's really keeping it straight

71
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,790
Ogata-san, I think you've had alot of pranks pulled on you but...

72
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,290
...ranking those pranks by scariness what rank would this one be?

73
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,830
Of course it's number 1!!

74
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,330
It's number 1, it made me jump and run away

75
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,640
As foreseen, this was clearly the scariest of them all

76
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,280
Our next target is...

77
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,950
Amakou Inter's Seiko

78
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,980
Oh god! Oh damn!

79
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:40,030
She starts to change her clothes, unknowing of the weird man hiding in her house

80
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,960
And then on to the bed...

81
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,360
Nobody wants to see that anyways

82
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,210
She got completely paralysed!!

83
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,250
She got paralysed altogether

84
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,980
Of course that'll happen

85
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,820
Haha she's completely frozen

86
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,770
I can't, this is too much...

87
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,430
Wha-

88
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,140
What?

89
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,610
How was it?

90
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,240
What the hell is this?

91
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,880
What is this??

92
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,710
She can't even stand up

93
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,750
She went like this

94
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,920
My head hurts man

95
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,790
What show do you think this is?

96
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,090
What show?

97
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,090
Yes a show

98
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,160
A show? There are shows like this?

99
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,370
It's Wednesday Downtown

100
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,770
There aren't. you're right

101
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,770
Exactly

102
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,230
Downtown?!

103
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,870
Downtown...

104
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,370
How would you rank this prank by scariness?

105
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,880
It's no.1 of course!

106
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,450
What the hell...

107
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,720
There aren't no damn pranks like this

108
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,390
I hate you Downtown...

109
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,620
Just go somewhere quickly!

110
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,090
That's my beloved bed ya know

111
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,060
I haven't got any men over yet either

112
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,400
Why the hell are you the first man to sleep in my bed?!

113
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,410
Of course, it seems to be the scariest prank ever pulled on her

114
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,210
It's as funny every time

115
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,080
Yeah really

116
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,950
And, our next target

117
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,280
There he is!

118
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,880
Matenrou's Anthony

119
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,090
Shooting in his house is not allowed by his agency...

120
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,130
...so we have called him for a fake show and made him enter this hotel room

121
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:03,070
By the way, the hotel's futon is thin and a person in it would easily be seen...

122
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,740
...we will do the prank burying the man inside the bed itself

123
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,240
The man who has been part of all the "There's someone" series...

124
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,240
...has confirmed all theories "presented" to him...

125
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,980
...as "scariest ever"...

126
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,080
...what will happen...

127
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,120
That (hiding) guy's perseverance is amazing as well

128
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,330
Anthony, who felt something was off about the bed...

129
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,040
WAHH! WHAT THE-

130
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,270
UWOOAH!

131
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,410
WAHH! WHAT THE-

132
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,550
UWOOAH!

133
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,950
Why the hell did you come back?

134
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,790
WAHH! WHAT THE-

135
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,160
UWOOAH!

136
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,100
Why the hell are you going back?

137
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,230
He checked one last time

138
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,170
What are you confirming?

139
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,670
How was it?

140
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,140
There's no "How was it?"...

141
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,140
Do you understand what's going on?

142
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,810
Wednesday Downtown

143
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,180
Wha- what's this bed?

144
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,180
It's special made

145
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,480
By the way, considering all of the "there's someone" pranks...

146
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,490
...how scary was it?

147
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,490
I'm telling you...

148
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,120
I can't put them in ranking

149
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,830
Since "Mr. There's someone" can't put them in ranking, that means...

150
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,170
...next we have this man

151
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,710
Jungle Pocket's Saito

152
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Before, he got the "There's someone when you open it"...

153
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,480
This is probably the scariest

154
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,920
...said Saito, however...

155
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,090
...will this surpass that?

156
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:09,160
He checked in to a hotel before a film shooting

157
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,530
After just a minute in after the entrance

158
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,040
...the following happened

159
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,170
Ooh...

160
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,440
What? that's quick

161
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,920
Wah...

162
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,360
Oh the pillow...

163
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,100
How was it?

164
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,270
How was it?

165
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,640
Do you understand what's going on?

166
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,040
Is it the same thing with that time? With the curtain?

167
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,180
Yes, the "There's someone when you open it" prank

168
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,550
Was it scarier than the previous one?

169
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,520
So scary...

170
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,720
SO scary

171
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
This is no good...

172
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,960
Compared to "Someone being there when you open",

173
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,240
"Someone being in your bed" is way scarier

174
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,680
And thus, it was verified to be the #1 scariest scenario

175
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,080
Theory confirmed

176
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,180
Lastly, we test the theory with that guy, just in case

177
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,740
Him again, huh

178
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,380
After outside sources telling us that the house was empty, we start to set up the room

179
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,940
They can enter so freely!

180
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,800
However, since Kuro-chan carries out most of his activities on the bed, we couldn't hide the guy in his room

181
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:54,120
Just for this time, we made a makeshift mattress with a hole cut out -- reverse massage table style

182
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,860
Meanwhile, Kuro-chan has finished work, and is headed to dinner by himself

183
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,240
"I'm so hungry, it's dinner time!

184
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,660
Mackerel and negitoro bomb! (minced tuna bowl)

185
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,160
Substitute rice with negitoro bomb!

186
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,520
Healthy Dynamite!!"

187
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,940
He's so lying

188
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,220
As always, Kuro-chan appeals his healthy meal. However..

189
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,380
After his appearance on another TV show, Meii no THE Taikoban!*

190
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:41,080
*Meii no THE Taikoban! Is a Japanese medical variety TV show about celebrities' concerning health issues

191
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,780
"Kuro-chan's blood sugar level is:

192
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,470
Immediate hospitalization-level (of seriousness)

193
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,110
You're in a situation where losing consciousness and passing away is only a matter of time

194
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:44,180
His blood work results were serious enough for him to be hospitalized immediately

195
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,060
Currently, he is consuming things that consist of low sugar content

196
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,620
Or he was supposed to be. However..

197
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,620
See? I told you

198
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:59,220
He was actually eating rice, miso soup, quail eggs, and butter-fried enoki mushrooms with his meal

199
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,540
"Within the past 2 weeks, I've drastically changed my eating habits and health awareness.

200
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,080
So, I pulled a fortune slip and got 'Great Blessing'!

201
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,460
I can really tell that God is watching over me.

202
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,460
I'm gonna do my best!"

203
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,420
Yes indeed.. "God" is watching

204
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:26,380
We have taken upon God and the doctor's role, and punished this liar

205
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,480
Eh, eh what?

206
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,550
Eh, what....

207
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,190
Eh, I don't understand

208
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,320
Eh, who are you?

209
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,430
Since abnormal things happening in his own house has become a normal occurrence, (from this show)

210
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,300
his reaction is a little weak

211
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,460
In that regard,

212
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,520
We overdid it

213
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,000
Eh.. what?

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,240
Eh, what the heck happened to my bed?

215
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,960
Putting the bed situation aside, we move on to the diet case

216
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,710
Recently on Taikoban, you got a harsh lecture from the doctor right?

217
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,180
Yeah on Monday

218
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,150
Meii no THE Taikoban is airing every Monday. However,

219
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,160
ever since his last appearance, even the doctors from the show

220
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,900
have been following Kuro-chan's lifestyle habits on Twitter

221
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,670
It seems like you had a very healthy meal today

222
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,710
You didn't eat rice today?

223
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,170
Today.. I haven't eaten rice, yes.

224
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,840
You're not lying, right?

225
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
No, I'm not lying

226
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,640
Are you sure?

227
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,640
Yes, I'm sure

228
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,610
I see...........

229
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,020
Quail eggs..

230
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,250
Rice and miso soup.....

231
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,120
Mackerel..........

232
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,790
Butter-fried enoki mushrooms...............

233
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,000
You haven't eaten those, right?

234
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,860
If it was my misunderstanding, then I apologize

235
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,530
There was a detective again?

236
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,740
Last time we aired, after the show when the cameras weren't rolling

237
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,080
you're really in a dangerous position

238
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,180
It's so bad it's something that shouldn't be managed by you alone

239
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,350
All the doctors (on this show) met up to talk to you

240
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,220
and even then, our words did not go through you

241
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,890
I was extremely shocked

242
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,620
You're not lying, right?

243
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,290
You're keeping your physical health in mind, right?

244
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,900
Wait..hold on a minute

245
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:43,900
You're lying, right?

246
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,300
Wait, hold on hold on hold on

247
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,400
If you're lying, we're going to report to the doctor

248
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,400
No, you can't do thatー

249
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,270
They're so naggy

250
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,440
No seriously

251
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,470
I don't know what kind of specialist they are, but they're so naggy

252
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,340
Our words did not go through you

253
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,010
I was extremely shocked

254
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,310
There's that woman who fake cries too

255
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,380
In conclusion, he should just die

256
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,430
Upon further investigations, we concluded that he should just die

257
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,260
That's what we came to, huh

258
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,260
I guess so

259
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,820
Seiko's bit was crazy!

260
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,320
She was like

261
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,440
Amazing how people can move like that

262
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,440
She pulled her back and fell

263
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,620
She legit pulled her back and couldn't move

264
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,200
You really can't stand up when that happens, huh

265
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,360
That made my head hurt..

266
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,280
from laughing so much

267
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,880
Fujii-san what did you think?

268
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,380
What's scary is that Hamada-san was like, "Those sheets are in the way"

269
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,760
Like an evil mastermind plotting was so scary

270
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,160
He doesn't plan on stopping

271
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,760
His evil thoughts just come out subconsciously

272
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,900
to promote fear even more

273
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,420
Introducing our next presenter, come on out!

274
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,960
It's Kosaka Daimaou

275
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,760
A pretty rare appearance

276
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,760
Yes indeed

277
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,940
This is my first appearance and I'm shaking like a new-born deer

278
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,000
What the heck

279
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,890
This is sudden but,

280
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:26,080
I was originally doing comedy in a trio

281
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,940
I think many people don't know this

282
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,760
Yeah, I didn't know you were in a trio

283
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,440
This time, I wanted to bring up something that relates to us trio comedians

284
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,740
this theory is what I brought

285
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,580
Trio comedians: If one person leaves and one is useless, the duo won't last

286
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,580
Hmm.. I don't have experience with a trio so..

287
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,580
Right, indeed

288
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:58,000
Usually in a trio, one or two are useless

289
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,200
How was it for you guys? Did you guys all decide to break up?

290
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,740
Like 2 people remaining?

291
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,060
It was actually one by one, like Satomi Hakkenden*

292
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:11,180
*Nanso Satomi Hakkenden was a literary novel from the Edo period about 8 samurais that descended from dogs

293
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,460
Oh I see

294
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,720
One by one

295
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,180
Kind of like that, yes

296
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,920
Who are you going to use to verify this theory?

297
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,600
I have a team that is perfect for this theory

298
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,560
Seriously?

299
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,880
Here they are

300
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,260
Jungle Pocket

301
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,520
Otake....It's gonna be Otake

302
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,420
I mean this theory is basically made for Jungle Pocket

303
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,180
If Saito-san were to leave,

304
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,900
Oota and Otake would remain

305
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,270
If Otake can last with Oota

306
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,820
Is what we're trying to prove, yes

307
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,500
I was expecting us to ponder a little more on who's the "useless" one

308
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,280
Everyone was quickly set on who is was so it shocked me

309
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,720
Theory: Trio comedians - If one person leaves and one is useless, the duo won't last

310
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:03,120
First and foremost, we begin by explaining our investigation to the two as facilitators

311
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,860
Oh Otake is gonna be the facilitator

312
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:10,630
'We're going to set up the prank as "Saito-san leaving the group to become a pin-genin"*

313
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:17,740
*Pin-genin is an comedian that goes solo

314
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:17,740
In the scenario, Oota-san would have to go on with Otake-san

315
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,100
In this case, when Saito leaves Jungle Pocket,

316
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,400
What kind of role is Otake supposed to play?

317
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,960
we investigate to see if Oota can continue as a duo with the "useless" Otake

318
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,520
This time he's the facilitator right?

319
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:34,260
To be completely honest, continuing the duo with Otake-san

320
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,530
is pretty rough

321
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,430
Uh..well..

322
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,780
He said it so clearly

323
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,970
Is it me or am I being a little disrespected here?

324
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,630
Uh, well well..

325
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,870
If you ask if it's rough or not...then I guess it is rough, realistically

326
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,800
An uncommon prank setting where the facilitator gets his feelings hurt...

327
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,090
Well actually, there are a lot of times where they're on their own when I'm working alone

328
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,290
Like during live events

329
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,490
There are times where we work just the two of us

330
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,860
Oota did say that it was pretty rough when it's just the two of them

331
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,360
He said "Yeah it's pretty rough when it's us two"

332
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
I've never heard that from Otake but

333
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,300
Oota said it was pretty rough

334
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,630
That's the first time I heard that...

335
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,970
I've never heard that before...

336
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,120
As expected

337
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,510
When something like that were to actually happen,

338
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,910
do you think Oota-san would continue to work with you?

339
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,780
Well how should I know

340
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,350
I don't know. I guess we'll have to see

341
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,390
I think there's a 50/50 chance

342
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,590
I seriously have no idea what he would choose

343
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,460
50/50 huh ....

344
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,800
Well well well well..... 50/50 huh

345
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:12,960
Announce break-up

346
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:12,960
Saito's pin-genin wishes are revealed by other senior comedians

347
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:12,960
Speak with other people that have experienced group break-ups

348
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:12,960
Talk about actor aspirations during public interviews

349
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,450
In order for this prank to be realistic and efficient,

350
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:12,960
Before the break up of the trio is announced, Saito's pin-genin wishes are going to be flaunted as shown:

351
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,460
First, the trio break-up senior comedian -

352
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,630
Taketo from B Course

353
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,700
will start talking to Saito despite being unacquainted with him

354
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,370
talking about break-ups in a sincere, intimate manner

355
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,310
to purposely raise suspicion about Saito leaving the group

356
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,680
Good morning

357
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,380
You had a live recording today?

358
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,050
Yeah, Hiruneta

359
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,420
Oh, Hiruneta

360
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,120
Did we have a meeting?

361
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,120
Yeah, I wanted to meet a little

362
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,860
Oh, thank you very much for the meal last time

363
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,860
Oh no worries at all

364
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,560
Sorry, I'll catch you later

365
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,130
If you want to discuss things again, let me know

366
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,130
Yes, understood

367
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,370
Saito, can I see you real quick?

368
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,370
Yes

369
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,370
Thank you for your hard work

370
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,740
I would wonder what happened

371
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,970
Did he go ask for advice about something?

372
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:03,970
Who?

373
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,510
Well, uhh, a-a-a-advice...

374
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,750
Not used to being a facilitator,

375
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,650
the "useless" genin hardcore stutters

376
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,220
He said, "If you want to discuss something again"

377
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,920
He said, "If you want to discuss something again"

378
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,620
To Saito?

379
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,620
Yeah

380
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,490
Advice?

381
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,460
Advice..I don't think he would

382
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,400
Oota starts to question what happened

383
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,170
Then..

384
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,600
Next step: During a fake magazine interview,

385
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,240
Saito talks about aspiring to become an actor

386
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,880
and how he can't let go of his passion

387
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,580
Who would be someone you aspire to become?

388
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,550
Who is that person for you?

389
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,690
For me, it'd be Tsutsumi Shinichi*

390
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:55,960
*Tsutsumi Shinichi is a very well-known actor that has won many awards

391
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,490
Eh, you want to be an actor?

392
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,790
Well I originally came into this industry to become an actor

393
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,860
As an actor...

394
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,260
My desire to want to progress alone is pretty strong, yes

395
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,800
Well, I suppose

396
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,100
What you want to be and reality is a different story

397
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,310
Third step:

398
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,210
A senior that is close to both Oota and Saito -

399
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,780
Matsuoka from Chocolate Planet

400
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,250
will reveal that Saito's wishes are leaning towards

401
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,120
wanting to be a pin-genin

402
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,420
Hmm, I see

403
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,320
I was drinking with Shinji (Saito) last time

404
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,320
Oh really

405
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,260
He seemed really depressed

406
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,790
He was like,

407
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,700
"If I decided to go on my own, what would you think?"

408
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,060
You mean, like a pin-genin?

409
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,130
Something like that. So I said "what do you mean?"

410
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,240
He was like "If I'm alone, then I can see it" (his future)

411
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,970
"What do you mean, you can see it?" I asked

412
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,970
What is that supposed to mean

413
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,170
What does that mean?

414
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,340
I don't know, but he was really pushing the subject

415
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,980
I was like, really? That sudden?

416
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,550
I mean he's been in a lot of movies and dramas lately

417
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,320
Well he makes it seem like he really wants to do that kind of stuff

418
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,450
The acting stuff right?

419
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,720
Lately, yeah

420
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,660
He was talking about some musical

421
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,290
The Little Mermaid

422
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,830
Nope, he didn't make the cut

423
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,130
If he were to be in that,

424
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,100
he would've been working with them for a year

425
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,530
They would be on tour for a year

426
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,230
Yeah, going around the world for a year or something

427
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,070
He's trying to do something by himself

428
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,570
That's disturbing...

429
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,280
With 3 of these suspicious role-play

430
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,710
Oota begins to take notice

431
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,580
of Saito's sudden odd behavior

432
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,180
At last, the main event:

433
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,920
Announcing the trio's break-up

434
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,890
The set-up (acting) is pretty good

435
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,120
Will Oota decide to continue to be a due with "useless" Otake?

436
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,590
Will Oota decide to continue to be a due with "useless" Otake?

437
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:43,400
This day, Oota was instructed by his manager to meet at Yoshimoto's head office

438
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,610
We have something that needs to be discussed

439
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,340
Saito-san, if you would explain to the 2 of them

440
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,680
It's something that should be discussed in our presence

441
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
It's something that should be discussed in our presence

442
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,480
Eh?

443
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,450
Uhm..

444
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,990
I've been thinking about this for a while

445
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,630
Well, to be frank,

446
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,300
I would like to break-up,

447
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,500
and for myself to go on as a solo

448
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,140
Eh, what do you mean? Then, eh...

449
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,910
Well..

450
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,910
I came to Tokyo because

451
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,450
I wanted to be an actor

452
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,960
I was fortunate to be able to be in dramas and movies

453
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,520
And of course on top of that,

454
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,360
being able to succeed in the Owarai industry

455
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,730
was because of you two

456
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,500
Eh, you mean you're going to be an actor?

457
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,930
I want to continue to work hard as an actor

458
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,640
I think for myself to continue being a pin-genin

459
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,440
is extremely disrespectful to you two

460
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,340
You're serious....

461
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,150
I mean you're already in a bunch of movies and dramas

462
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,020
That's something you can still do while being a comedian

463
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,260
I have a strong desire to work

464
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,690
alone as an actor, not a comedian

465
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,530
That's what I want to do

466
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,600
I'm so sorry. I'm terribly sorry

467
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,500
Dude, that's so tough...

468
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,270
Everything is so sudden

469
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,640
What the hell

470
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,440
Otake you don't need to add in unnecessary commentary

471
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,650
Being thrown into this situation, Oota can't hide his shocked expression

472
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,990
20 minutes after, as the conversation comes to a halt,

473
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,190
Because I want to pursue this seriously,

474
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,330
I want my focus to be solely on this

475
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,900
So, that means you've completely made up your mind on this

476
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,370
I thought it'd be disrespectful to you two

477
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,540
to bring this up while I was still being indecisive

478
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,340
I only wanted to tell you when my mind was set

479
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,310
To put it in another way,

480
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,480
He thought "If I don't put enough thought into this,

481
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,520
then it would be extremely disrespectful for them"

482
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,020
Yeah, I know that. He just said that himself

483
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,660
Yes.. so that's what he means

484
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,090
He already said that!

485
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,690
An unexplained, unnecessary follow-up

486
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,760
Now, we asked Saito to leave the room for brief moment

487
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,970
to pick their brains even more

488
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,100
Do you think they believe this whole thing?

489
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,100
Yes

490
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,550
I think they completely understand that my decisions are pretty solid

491
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,720
What do you think about Otake-san? As a fellow facilitator?

492
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,580
Otake is really a burden

493
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,290
He is so bad at acting

494
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,660
This...

495
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,590
This really is a sudden turning point

496
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,630
Rough.....

497
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,530
So...

498
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,470
So what's going to happen to us then?

499
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,870
From a business stand point, it's going to be a disadvantage

500
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,410
Business is out of the question

501
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,650
Jungle Pocket as an item will no longer exist

502
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,650
That would be correct

503
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,550
Why?

504
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,520
WHY!?

505
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,290
Should we tell him? (Otake to leave)

506
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,790
Yeah we should really tell him soon

507
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,530
What the hell is he saying this whole time?!

508
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,300
Nothing but a burden facilitator #2

509
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,530
was forced to leave the room

510
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,230
Hurry up and get over here!

511
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,170
What the hell are you saying man?!

512
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:42,370
You've been saying irrelevant crap this whole time!

513
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:46,580
He's been saying he wanted to be an actor for a long time...

514
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,690
We don't have the right to be an obstacle in his life

515
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,220
He's that kind of person

516
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,790
Oota's manliness and courage moves Saito

517
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,560
Although unwillingly,

518
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,000
Oota agrees to grant Saito's wishes of breaking up

519
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,440
That being said, now we tackle the real question

520
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,540
Indeed

521
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,140
This is really emotional

522
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:20,440
Will he be willing to continue to work with the "useless"?

523
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,080
We're going to move on with the process as a break-up

524
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,020
and you and Otake-san would continue to work as a duo

525
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,220
Is what we were thinking

526
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,490
You mean continue together with Otake?

527
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,200
He's already laughing at the idea

528
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Oota is laughing!

529
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,840
I don't know.... would people even want to see that?

530
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,670
"Is there even a demand for that?" is too harsh!

531
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,940
That's too much

532
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,180
Tsk, uh...

533
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,110
He just clicked his tongue!

534
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,080
Duo....with Otake...

535
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,490
What the hell? Are you kidding?

536
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,620
Seriously!

537
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,360
Me and Otake?!

538
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,520
Is that even possible?

539
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,230
Yeah yeah, it's possible

540
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,970
It's not that I don't like Otake.. it's just..

541
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:19,070
Otake.. mmm...it's..

542
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,110
It's not that I don't like Ota...ke..

543
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,170
What is concerning him?

544
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,150
It seems like he doesn't like Otake

545
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,420
*Reminder: Pin-genin is a solo comedian

546
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,920
Pin-genin....*

547
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,420
Pin?!

548
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,960
Maybe pin...

549
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Even if I become a pin-genin, there won't be a lot of job offers

550
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,830
That was close

551
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,000
Ughhhh this is so rough

552
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,070
Too rough.....too rough..

553
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,110
For now, your decision to form a duo or not

554
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,020
...is kind of important so I wanted to ask it.

555
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,620
Going pin huh...

556
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,920
Isn't he saying he's going pin?

557
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,590
Is he getting closer to going pin?

558
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,460
But you know...

559
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,570
*NSC is a comedy school

560
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,570
12 years ago, the three that formed a trio at NSC*

561
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,240
They got their break thanks to Saito's personality

562
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:39,920
With their ace gone, can Ota go on to form a duo with Otake?

563
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,290
In all honesty I believe in him

564
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,690
In the end...

565
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,990
...what will his decision be?

566
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:56,670
Will Ota decide to go on as a duo with Otake?

567
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,940
Well I mean, I kind of...

568
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:08,210
Well I mean, I kind of have to do my best with Otake

569
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,380
That means he'll do it right, he definitely just said it.

570
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,460
On second thought...

571
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,460
Don't say it's impossible man

572
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,190
But it'd be impossible to do it alone too...

573
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,700
So that means that you'll be doing it together if I understand correctly.

574
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,800
Yeah with Otake

575
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,510
With Otake...

576
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,510
You don't sound enthusiastic about it...

577
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,880
Can something be done with Otake? With me and him?

578
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,520
This does definitely not feel good

579
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,670
Of course you don't

580
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,720
Uhm I mean...

581
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,890
If that doesn't work out...

582
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,020
...We don't have to go on forever right?

583
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,360
Why the hell, he is already thinking of breaking up?

584
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,000
Again he doesn't sound excited, what's wrong with him?

585
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,470
I mean there's nothing to do but do my best with Otake

586
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,100
He said it

587
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:12,140
Okay then, this means we're moving forward with you and Otake as a duo

588
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,250
Yes

589
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,680
As a duo right? Yes?

590
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,120
Alright!

591
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,520
Thank god...

592
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,320
After nearly worrying himself to death...

593
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,190
Ota has decided to form a duo with the useless Otake

594
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,830
That means

595
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,170
They're revealing the prank

596
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,400
Goddamn man...

597
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,400
Oh Ota~~

598
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,310
You really got worried didn't you?

599
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,310
You really were thinking about it, Ota

600
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:55,150
Wait, hold up. Is being in a duo with me that unappealing?

601
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,390
You were really worried, sorry man

602
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,390
No no no no no

603
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,260
This is freaking bullshit

604
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,690
Ugh this is so strange

605
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,160
That really pisses me off

606
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,900
No no, I'm telling you you're acting weird-

607
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,470
I'm sorry but I'm the one that's gotten hurt the most from this situation

608
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,700
You're not the one that got hurt

609
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,270
NO ONE GIVES A SHIT ABOUT YOU

610
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,170
Am I not the one getting attacked all the time?

611
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,170
What is this?

612
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,210
There's an agenda isn't there. What is it?

613
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,710
This is for Wednesday Downtown...

614
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:24,810
This was to test the theory that if you take one out of a trio and leave the person with the useless member

615
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,780
they won't go on to form a duo

616
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,820
Can we say that you will go on?

617
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,030
Man...that's one weird theory

618
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,800
I'm sorry, but I still haven't agreed to that theory

619
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,970
Like "Can he come together with the junk guy?"

620
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,440
Are you really gonna shine light on that real of a part of human nature?

621
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,570
But I mean, if you think about widening the possibilities from now on...

622
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,950
...we have to think about leaving Otake behind as well.

623
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:03,020
That means, even if it is with a useless person, you form a duo for a bit

624
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,960
He REALLY thought about it

625
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,010
However, it came to continuing together. What do you think about it Nicole?

626
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,150
I kind of got teary eyed at his agony

627
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,380
Thank god there's Saito-san with them

628
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,250
It's good that they're a trio like that

629
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,210
Now let's have them come out please!

630
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,560
Oh they're here

631
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,970
It's Ota and Otake!

632
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,570
That's a preschooler kind of mistake

633
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,160
Hold up, you can't even turn and come out here?

634
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,500
Sorry, I didn't know how it was setup

635
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,790
I didn't know how the footing was set

636
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,460
The step yes, I'm sorry

637
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,150
Ota really went like uhhngh

638
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:00,700
The real worry was that Saito was going away

639
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,050
It's real though, even today...

640
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,830
....Saito isn't here right...

641
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,120
He's at the Budokan*

642
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,520
*Budokan is a big concert hall

643
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,520
...he's gone because of some musical related work he's doing

644
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,420
In that situation when he tells you he wants to become an actor alone...

645
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,890
...isn't it super real?

646
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,830
There was alot of pre setup

647
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,820
Lots of setup

648
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,500
Otake your feelings must've been really weird right?

649
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,280
This segment was really hard on me...

650
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,320
...I'm kind of an accomplice to it but...

651
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,040
...I'm not really fully an accomplice either

652
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,570
It gave me alot of bad info about what Ota thinks of me

653
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,690
Don't talk for so long, I'll end up laughing

654
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,400
Don't talk for too long, it's enough

655
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,240
If he goes on too long, you'll laugh

656
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,360
Please hear me out a bit though

657
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:53,200
Let's do a prank where Otake has to leave the trio

658
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,130
That won't happen probably

659
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:00,670
We've been a trio for about 12 years and 4 times we've thought about kicking him out...

660
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,450
Next we have the corner where we bring you theories from around the world

661
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,030
Viewers' Theory Corner

662
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,540
Tonight's presenters are...

663
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,040
It's Daian

664
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,680
We'll be in your care

665
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,820
It's been about half a year

666
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,820
Your second time right?

667
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,940
Yes it's our second time

668
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,660
Eeh~ I thought it was your first

669
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,870
Didn't we have any impact on you?

670
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,090
Twins?

671
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,100
We would've stated it more if it were the case

672
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,000
We've been told that we look alike but have no blood relation.

673
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,270
Let's move along then, the theory that we've brought you today is this!

674
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,720
Theory: We can find Mame Tanks with a height under 150cm and weight over 100kg...*

675
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:47,980
*Mame tank refers to disproportionate body types with overweight body, and short height

676
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,980
...if we were to look for them.

677
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,260
Mame Tank huh? That's a word I haven't heard in a while...

678
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,010
I think that you can find them...

679
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,310
...while going around the city

680
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,200
Osaka has an image of having these types of people

681
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,040
That means that there are alot of them in Osaka right?

682
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,940
If you go to some downtown shopping street most of the people there are like that

683
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,870
No way

684
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,510
So that means the theory is proven

685
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,470
We don't need it, they're not even rare then

686
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,810
There actually weren't that many

687
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,910
Pick one for god's sake!

688
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,620
In reality there weren't many of them

689
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,990
It feels like..

690
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,990
It feels like they are but actually aren't

691
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:47,870
We're testing the theory that we can find Mame Tanks with a height under 150cm and weight over 100kg if we go out to look for them

692
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,750
With that, let's start our investigation

693
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,750
Immediately

694
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,200
We're with a program called Wednesday Downtown

695
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,300
Yes yes yes yes yes

696
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,590
Do you have some time?

697
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,600
Oh it's ok yeah

698
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,670
Can we shoot your face?

699
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,230
Nobody is looking for me so it's fine

700
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,470
Just behind there

701
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,120
Yeees yes yes yes

702
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:16,770
He accepted the interview with a high-pitched voice but...

703
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:23,500
We weren't allowed to put out numbers concerning his weight and height

704
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,950
Also...

705
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,140
Could you please share you weight?

706
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,600
Oh no- It's kinda difficult

707
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,420
No waay- that's impossible

708
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,620
Maybe it's because of a complex about their physique

709
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,270
We're not finding anyone who would let us show their face, let alone share their measurements

710
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,250
That means

711
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:49,250
Stopping the search in the streets, we go to the net to find them

712
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,620
We try to get our hands on anyone who might be like that..

713
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,150
The first one, working at a maid cafe called "MuchiPocha"

714
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:08,020
Hanashiro Kokoa with a height of 157cm and a weight of 120kg

715
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:16,820
She wasn't under 150cm but she was a complete Mame Tank, when we talk to her...

716
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,770
About when did you start putting on weight?

717
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:24,070
I was only about 47kg in high school but...

718
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:29,350
...after my graduation, I stopped doing sports and in the blink of an eye I became three times my old weight

719
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:35,100
Next we have Ihashi Gouta from DDT Pro Wrestling

720
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:43,300
He has a special body with 158cm in height and 136kg in weight, however...

721
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,070
Isn't this physique a disadvantage for pro wrestling?

722
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:51,070
Uhm, of course being tall is better but...

723
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:56,000
...doing a Moon salto and other similar flip-style moves is easier

724
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,870
There are things that I can only do because I'm small

725
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,450
And there's this person working at this bar

726
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,790
Named "Japan Worldwide Debusu Club"

727
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,100
Looks like a nice place

728
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:13,240
Height 163 cm, weight 120 kg

729
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,490
Louis Vuitton

730
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,760
Even just walking around

731
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,880
I'll receive a whole large pizza

732
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,640
A random person gives it to you?

733
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,640
Yes, a complete stranger

734
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,360
They just give me items that they have on them

735
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,210
Additionally,

736
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,990
With gaining that much weight

737
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,390
does it affect your health in any way?

738
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,150
When I get my physical exam, my blood glucose level is normal

739
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:41,050
A physician once performed an exam on me, and said I'm a miracle

740
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,440
Did you ever get a nickname?

741
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,440
To this day,

742
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,460
I've been called "Mame Tank" or "Fatty than can move"

743
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,500
We found someone that was nicknamed "Mame Tank"

744
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,980
However, didn't fit the criteria of being under 150 cm, and over 100 kg

745
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:00,200
We struggle to find the person that fits the mame tank appearance

746
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,210
However, in that bunch

747
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,980
Would you mind telling us your height and weight?

748
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:13,500
Right now, I'm at 148 cm, 110 kg

749
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,230
There she is; mame tank

750
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,210
However, her weight used to be

751
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,370
90kg about a month ago

752
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:25,620
She says she quickly gained 10 kg within that month

753
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,200
How did you gain so much weight in a span of one month?

754
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,760
Because of rice

755
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,440
Ever since I've been eating 3 cups per meal, I eat at least 10 cups per day

756
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,260
My height is 150 cm

757
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,160
Weight is probably 115 kg or more

758
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,590
Having her 3-size (bust, waist, hip) all be 140 cm,

759
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:51,210
she'll be categorized as the cylindrical body type

760
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:56,050
Height 145 cm, weight 101 kg,

761
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:00,210
she's the super tiny mame tank

762
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,960
This is.....

763
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,720
As suspected, the mame tank body type that fits

764
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,260
our criteria exists here and there

765
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,010
Further more, we found someone that wasn't under 150 cm,

766
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:17,870
but had the highest BMI index

767
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:22,130
During this investigation, we found an extreme mame tank

768
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,060
This is that person

769
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,080
She's injured

770
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,010
She looks really injured

771
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,940
Osaka's chubby Cabaret King

772
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,800
Takenokonosato-body type

773
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,480
Kitty-san

774
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,720
Her weight is...

775
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,160
How many kg?

776
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:53,750
With the same exact height as Watanabe Naomi

777
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,670
But weights 60 kg more

778
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,680
An extreme body

779
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,810
What happened to your wrist?

780
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,890
I fell from the stairs in the store

781
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,740
And I went to the hospital,

782
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,710
and tried to get an MRI

783
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,220
but was told that my body is too big

784
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,950
That means you didn't fit inside?

785
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:19,400
I couldn't fit in the machine so it wouldn't move

786
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,810
because of my weight

787
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,540
On top of that, was unable to fit in a wheelchair

788
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,190
and unable to use crutches as support

789
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,720
She really worries the doctors -- even more than Kuro-chan

790
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,230
I was stopped like this

791
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:38,370
and was like "this is going to be a little difficult.."

792
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:40,350
With that said,

793
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:45,160
People with mame tank bodies, please be careful of your physical health

794
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,620
What did you guys think?

795
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,150
Surprisingly,

796
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,070
there were a few (mame tanks to be found)

797
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,140
Yeah........

798
00:43:57,980 --> 00:47:24,850

801
