1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,140
Comparing to those who have participated multiple times

2
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,310
Are those who are making their first appearance disadvantaged?

3
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,180
Well, I wonder about that too

4
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:39,020
This somehow depends on their length of career and even their employer

5
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:48,960
But personally, I think those who are making their first appearance as the most junior person can get along well

6
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,030
I see, it's you!

7
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,700
I know you, you lost the R-1 competition, right? -Wait...why?

8
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,070
Just say I'm the one who won the M-1 competition

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,110
Well, to be honest, of course I didn't choose every contestant, like "this guy, and this guy"

10
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,180
The staffs show me 10 carefully selected contestants, and I make the final decision

11
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,020
Come on... -No, no, no way

12
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,520
Why did you come, dude

13
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,960
Why can't I come, dude!

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,960
You idiot! -No I'm not, you're an idiot!

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,060
However, well, how should I put this...

16
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,100
The audiences really hate Fujimon, so...

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,200
I think there:s no chance for him to join again

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,740
And I'll ignore him even if I meet him somewhere else

19
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,710
What happened to you?

20
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,780
It's full of blemishes

21
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,480
I don't like seniors with blemishes... -So cold!

22
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,180
Yeah, my body gets cold easily

23
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,150
Because I had stomach cancer

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,720
Huh?

25
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,460
He let out a "ku" sound -Yeah, I heard that

26
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,260
It's normal to say "ku"

27
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,560
He bursted out laughing -Hooray!

28
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,200
No! No way! I don't want this!

29
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,070
Anyway, yellow, yellow...

30
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,540
won't do Ciao anymore

31
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,240
No one will laugh at it

32
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,140
Even I won't laugh at it, of course no one else will!

33
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,210
Eh? Just now?

34
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,850
I have to give you this -Ahh, I screwed up

35
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,850
That was too easy

36
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,770
So it started -Started

37
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,900
Just look at Kato's face...

38
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,570
I can't hold back my laughters already

39
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,770
Yeah, don't try to look at him in the eyes

40
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,140
(Kato's face...well, yeah, that's true)

41
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,210
(Kato himself is hilarious too) Jelly, there's a jelly here

42
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,750
Nice, there's a jelly -Eat it then

43
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,680
Nah, who likes jelly?

44
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,850
No one will want to eat jelly now though

45
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,020
Well, if I have to choose between like and dislike, then yes, I like it

46
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,060
I'm really good at feeding others jelly

47
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,860
No, I"m good, no thank you

48
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,060
No thank you, don't let me do this

49
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,460
Seriously

50
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,600
But Nobu you said you like it, so... -Exactly

51
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,370
We don't eat jelly at all, right? -Yeah, I rarely eat it

52
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,370
But Nobu you like it, right?

53
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,770
Stop it! I don't need jelly now

54
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,240
But you said you like it, so...

55
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,580
Wh-wh-what are you going to do?

56
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,080
Bite it with your mouth

57
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
And purse your lips

58
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,620
Are you ready?

59
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,820
It got in my eye

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,490
"Got in my eye" killed him

61
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,260
So fast (What was that?)

62
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,400
(What was that just now?)

63
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,770
It's me, right? It's my point, right?

64
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,370
"It got in my eye"

65
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,970
It's him, he laughed

66
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,570
No, I didn't laugh

67
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,740
All I said is "it got in my eye" -No! It's you!

68
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,740
All I said is "it got in my eye"

69
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,080
It's Nobu-san

70
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,010
I didn't laugh at all

71
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,280
What is this low quality comedy?

72
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,720
Such a lame joke

73
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,690
Did that make you laugh?

74
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,920
You guys are professional!

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,990
Because he said "it got in my eye" at a perfect timing

76
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,160
It should be my turn to get angry and say something -Exactly

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,330
It was chaotic so let's watch it again

78
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,500
Seiya's point?

79
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,300
Bite it with your mouth

80
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,340
And purse your lips

81
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,040
Are you ready?

82
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,410
It got in my eye

83
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,310
"Got in my eye" killed him

84
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,150
No one cares!

85
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,350
No one freaking cares!

86
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,750
No need to say it -Of course I need to! It got in my eye!

87
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,220
So this is Nobu -Hooray!

88
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,520
Really? This is awful

89
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,360
Well, for the points...

90
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,830
Although not intended, maybe the point belongs to Seiya? -Thank you very much

91
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,330
Very lucky -It indeed got in his eye

92
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,170
Yes, it got in my eye

93
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,800
When Nobu was about to say something...

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,200
"It got in my eye"

95
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,670
That's an unexpected accident

96
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,170
Everything is becoming funny to you now

97
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,910
Keep yourself nervous

98
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,780
Let's start

99
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,850
Started

100
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,420
Definitely won't laugh

101
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,920
You guys are so sticky already

102
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,060
Koyabu-san gave me this. What the heck is this?

103
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,660
I don't think it's a handkerchief

104
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,460
It's that thing used to cover dead body

105
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:23,760
What is it?

106
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,270
It's the bandage used in field hospitals

107
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,400
Why did you bring this with you?

108
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,770
Let's calm down guys

109
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,500
That's true

110
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,870
It's still half past five

111
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,140
Yeah

112
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,140
That's not half past five

113
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,080
I meant 5 hours 30 minutes, but I said half past five

114
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,710
That's not half past five -Never mind, Tamuken-san

115
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,580
He said it's half past five?

116
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,080
It's indeed half past five now

117
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,620
It's half past five? -It's indeed half past five now

118
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,920
It's really half past five now! -They're the same

119
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,690
They are the same -By chance?

120
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,290
Is he kind of laughing? -Yeah, he's laughing!

121
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,360
We all agreed to calm down! That's teamwork! Stop being destructive!

122
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,530
Okay, okay, wbat about doing an exaggerated Sakai Masaaki?

123
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,500
No thank you, I'm good

124
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,270
Take a look

125
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,400
Firstly, this is the normal Sakai Masaaki

126
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,270
That's two stars!

127
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,940
However... -It's already exaggerated

128
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,240
For the exaggerated Sakai Masaaki

129
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,320
Do you need to practice that?

130
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,820
Of course I need to practice

131
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,120
Why didn't you say three stars?

132
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,160
Why two stars?

133
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,590
You're right -Yeah

134
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,700
Three stars are more understandable...

135
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,560
He scared me..

136
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,430
What?

137
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,430
Huh?

138
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,470
Eh? I found a pair of boobs here!

139
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,470
Eh? Can I touch those boobs?

140
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,140
Whose boobs are. those?

141
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,440
Better not touch them -Yeah, cut it out

142
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,780
But those boobs don't belong to anyone

143
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,780
That's why, that's exactly why you shouldn't touch them

144
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,180
Who will scold me for touching them?

145
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,150
If you don't know whose boobs are those, then you definitely shouldn't touch them

146
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,950
-No, no, but those don't belong to anyone

147
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,190
It probably belongs to the person who owns that cap

148
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,090
No, but no one is here

149
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,590
It should be fine to touch it. Just a little

150
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,930
We tried to stop you though -Exactly

151
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,630
Anyway, I'll touch it, just a little

152
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,500
Whoa! It's super soft!

153
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,500
It's super soft!

154
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,070
I can't hold back!

155
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,510
You know? It's super soft!

156
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,110
Look!

157
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,710
It's super soft!

158
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,780
Why is it so soft?

159
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,550
Why is it so soft?

160
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,020
Because these are boobs

161
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,390
That's how God made it

162
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,990
Do you want to touch it too?

163
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,060
No, I'm good -No thank you

164
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,260
Seiya, go touch it

165
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,360
That's good for you -No, I'm good...

166
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,400
You need to experience more now

167
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,500
Look, they're so soft!

168
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,470
These are so soft! And she never complains

169
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,440
She won't get angry at all!

170
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,440
She won't get angry even if you touch them

171
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,510
It's all-you-can-touch

172
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,280
Seiya you're young -Yeah, go for it Seiya

173
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,550
Is it really fine?

174
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,850
Isn't it scary to touch boobs for free?

175
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,250
May I?

176
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,220
Excuse me

177
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,830
You're going too far, dude!

178
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,730
Those are my boobs!

179
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,900
You're going too far!

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,570
I'm the first one to touch them, so they are my boobs!

181
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,240
Stop it, stop it -Too dangerous

182
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,940
Why the heck did you lick them! You're definitely going too far!

183
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,310
Those boobs don't belong to anyone!

184
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,150
But I touched them first so they're mine!

185
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,150
You're gonna hurt his ears

186
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,850
Surely, that's true!

187
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,050
That's how you hold people in the army

188
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,550
Hey! Did I say anything wrong?!

189
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,090
That's how you hold people in French army

190
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,320
I'm talking to you! -Yes, sir!

191
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
He became a French soldier

192
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,400
Even his shirt looks like France

193
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,330
Don't lick them, dude

194
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,470
Ahh, he's aiming someone

195
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,700
Why the heck did you lick them!

196
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Hey!

197
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,310
That's ridiculous

198
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,140
Don't even think about licking them

199
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,040
He's still in the army

200
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,810
Don't lick them
(How did they hold back on that? That's impossible for me)

201
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,310
Don't lick them

202
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,280
(It's getting chaotic) Don't lick them

203
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,220
Seriously

204
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,580
Why did you lick them?

205
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,820
No...

206
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,050
You licked them just now, dude! -No, no, I didn't

207
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,620
You definitely licked them just now! -No, I didn't

208
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,390
How dare you look into my eyes and lie like this?

209
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,560
Hey, wait...

210
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,030
My boobs are being...

211
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,600
They're popped!

212
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,910
I actually bought this bucket recently

213
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,010
Eh? Finished?

214
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,650
How much do you think this costs?

215
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,950
Can you first explain to us, what was that farce just now?

216
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,650
What was your plan? What should we laugh at?

217
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,420
Don't bother with those boobs anymore

218
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,620
I bought this bucket

219
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
How much do you think this costs?

220
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,390
Eh? Done with those boobs already?

221
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,900
How much do you think this costs?

222
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,930
Well, it does look expensive though

223
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,930
How much do you think this costs?

224
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,700
This is not an ordinary bucket

225
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,370
The shape is quite unique -Yes

226
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,770
Probably about 300 yen -Yeah, that makes sense

227
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,770
Eh? Are buckets that cheap now?

228
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,640
even has a spout

229
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,010
A spout! -Why do you think it's expensive to have a spout?

230
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,910
He keeps emphasizing that spout

231
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,350
Because although you can make those normal ones with machine

232
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,950
But for this, you have to pull here

233
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,750
This uses a different machine with a different mould

234
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,690
Machines can only make round-shaped buckets

235
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,520
So the craftsman needs to pull here at the end

236
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,660
Just add the spout to the mould, and it will be shaped like this

237
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,330
No one will pull it at the end

238
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,700
Of course the craftsman will pull it at the end, just like this...

239
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,430
Then each bucket will be different

240
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,270
So how much did it cost?

241
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,170
Yeah, exactly

242
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,540
300 yen

243
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,010
He got it right then

244
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,510
And then, this is not an ordinary bucket

245
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,710
Not "and then", dude

246
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,680
What was your plan if we got it right? What's the right answer?

247
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
What's the right answer? 300 yen the right answer

248
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,720
No, after we said 300 yen, what should happen and how will you make people laugh?

249
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,920
No, it's not about making people laugh, 300 yen is the correct answer

250
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,590
Are you in a bad mood today?

251
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,730
No, but you're pissing me off

252
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,060
Let's stop this, so scary

253
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,970
It's 300 yen, so what?

254
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,200
This is not an ordinary basket...bucket

255
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,700
Basket? -Did he say basket?

256
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,670
This is neither a basket nor a bucket

257
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,670
It's a bucket

258
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,840
Why are you full of sweat?

259
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
It's not a basket

260
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,780
I know, it's a bucket

261
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,780
Please look at him, look at his special basket

262
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,190
This is not an ordinary basket

263
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,220
Basket?

264
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,620
Nobu, it's a basket

265
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,220
Shut up, shut up...

266
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,460
Shut up!

267
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,860
You can't just close your eyes -Look at his special basket

268
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,860
Are you looking at him then, Goto-san?

269
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,660
Yes, I am

270
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,630
What are you looking afr?

271
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,900
Basket -Basket

272
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,770
Basket?

273
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,870
I'm looking at his special basket

274
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,170
A special...?

275
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,740
Basket -Basket

276
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,780
Basket -Basket

277
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,650
Look at the basket -Galm down, ealm down...

278
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,750
(Calm down, calm down, he's very close)

279
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,490
Basket

280
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,560
(It spread to him)

281
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,760
(It spread to Miyasako)

282
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,800
He endured it?

283
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,700
Basket, basket

284
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Enough with basket, so annoying

285
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,170
Basket won't get me anymore

286
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,170
This was not funny at all

287
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,240
I was so close with that basket

288
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,610
I was so close, and that basket almost got me, but then I saw this

289
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,620
This was not funny at all

290
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,890
Anyway, what's about that bucket?

291
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,120
It's 300 yen, and then what?

292
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,190
Everyone, please look carefully at this basket

293
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,820
What the heck?

294
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,790
This is not an ordinary basket -It's a bucket

295
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,960
Even if you say basket, you're just pissing us off, no one will laugh so please stop

296
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,160
So harsh, he's being so harsh!

297
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,530
Believe it or not...

298
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,000
This is’a weird face basket

299
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,500
Change it back to bucket!

300
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,200
Whoever put this on will have a weird face

301
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,040
Sounds good

302
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Who wants to give it a try?

303
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,840
You do it first -Yeah, demonstrate it to us

304
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
The weird face basket

305
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,310
Yes -It's not a basket, it's a bucket

306
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,510
My face will change instantly

307
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,580
You're ready?

308
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,430
It changed, right? Isn't it amazing?

309
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,400
Seiya? -You used up your frustrated faces

310
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,900
It's already out of stock

311
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,540
Can I give it a try too?

312
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,170
Yeah, sure -Do it, Michio

313
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,440
Don't do it Michio

314
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,910
Don't do it Michio!

315
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,910
Nobu, go watch it in the front row

316
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,680
Hello, I'm Michio

317
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,980
Don't do it Michio

318
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,080
Take off your hat first

319
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,320
You hat -Michio, better take off your hat first

320
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,890
Eh? What happened? -What happened to your head?

321
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,890
This is actually, a maze

322
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,260
A maze? -Yes

323
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,500
Start from here

324
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,830
Please try it out

325
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,800
Whoa, it really is a maze!

326
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,700
Amazing! -What the heck is that?!

327
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,470
So you asked them to shave it like that?

328
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,510
If you can reach the goal, I'll give you a prize

329
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,140
Eh? This looks quite easy though

330
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,440
Yes, go that way

331
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,210
Almost there, this way

332
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,110
Yes, almost there! -This way, goal!

333
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,650
Well done, congratulations

334
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,680
Congratulations

335
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,920
I'll give you the prize, Goto-san

336
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,920
You'll give me a prize? -Yes

337
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,190
What is this?

338
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,060
Adamo-chan?

339
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,800
Why did you take the photo of Adamo-chan in transit?

340
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,830
Not during a show?

341
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,900
Is he your senior?

342
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,800
He's his senior?

343
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,940
Photo of him in transit?

344
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,040
Why in transit? -It's definitely better to take a photo of him in shows

345
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,910
He put on this makeup for one show

346
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,310
And the next show also needs him to be in this makeup, right?

347
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,950
(Who's point is that?)

348
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,050
It surprised me!

349
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,760
He legitly laughed

350
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,690
That's a self-destruction, he should receive a red card for this, right?

351
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,960
That was a loud laughter!

352
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,460
He should receive two cards

353
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,930
It's probably not just a yellow card, huh?

354
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,930
No, no, no...

355
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,970
That's definitely not just a yellow card

356
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,440
He completely laughed -Bursted into laughters

357
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,970
"Ta-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha"

358
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,940
It's still the first half, so please...

359
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,110
It's indeed quite funny to know Adamo-chan is in the same makeup in transit for the next show

360
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,980
What's that photo, seriously?

361
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,150
He even has his own seat belt

362
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,720
Let's watch it again and decide the color of the card

363
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,960
Photo of him in transit?

364
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,730
Why in transit? -It's definitely better to take a photo of him in shows

365
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,230
He put on this makeup for one show

366
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,000
And the next show also needs him to be in this makeup, right?

367
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,200
He laughed out loud!

368
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,570
He bursted into laughters!

369
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,540
He completely cracked up

370
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,940
You legitly laughed

371
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,010
I'll give you an orange card for this

372
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,010
Yeah, that's fair

373
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,480
I have to give you an orange card to be fair

374
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,190
That was disturbing even as a sound effect

375
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,020
This photo is awful

376
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,190
It's probably even funnier to him, because they are in the same company

377
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,660
Goto's verbal attack is fearful

378
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
Let's start

379
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,210
Can I put on the basket as well?

380
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,740
Eh? -You mean the one just now?

381
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,080
But my head is really big

382
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,650
You don't know whether it will fit or not? -Yes

383
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,050
I'll ask "Are you ready?", so please reply "Yes, we're ready" -Okay, got it

384
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,220
He's diligent

385
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,490
Yeah, surprisingly, he takes it seriously

386
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,890
Are you ready?

387
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,930
Please come in -Yes, we're ready

388
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,100
Where's the basket?

389
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,640
Eh? The basket became this shape?

390
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,340
It's broken? -It broke into pieces?

391
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,340
That's very artistic

392
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,710
It's finely carved

393
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,510
That's so cool -Yeah, so cool

394
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,080
You can't talk anymore?

395
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,050
So he can't talk with that on..

396
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,090
There's more? -The basket is gone

397
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,590
You guys probably didn't saw this...

398
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,360
He came out like fury from the curtain

399
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,630
He went in like fury too

400
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,100
Yeah, you're right

401
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,070
Is that still the same basket?

402
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,310
It became even smaller

403
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,140
You mean you reshaped it just now?

404
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,980
No way, it's impossible to add those colors

405
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,480
The basket is already broken

406
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,320
Only the front part covering the face is left

407
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,120
The back part is already gone

408
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,990
Come on, it costed me 300 yen

409
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,120
300 yen is nothing

410
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
300 yen is really cheap

411
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,530
It looks completely different

412
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,530
So freaking scary!

413
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,930
Darth Maul -That's Darth Maul

414
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,170
That dude is life-threatening

415
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,870
Maybe this is his face mask series?

416
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,570
Who would even buy that? -You're right

417
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,140
Who would be happy to buy that?

418
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,740
Oh, you mean that face mask as a product?

419
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,110
Yes, who are the buyers?

420
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,050
It became wider

421
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,850
Huh? It’s bigger, isn't it?

422
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,120
It's different from the previous one

423
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Yeah, it became bigger, right?

424
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,160
And the’color changed too

425
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,400
Why is he smoking like a gay?

426
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,170
Does he always smoke like a gay?

427
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,540
It changed dramatically

428
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,480
He's that guy who protects the forest

429
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,850
That's not the tag, that's the hook

430
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,120
So that thing is being banged in some kind of shop?

431
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,890
It's probably piled up and hanged for sale

432
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,890
He's so tender

433
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,860
He's Tenzan (wrestler)

434
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,830
Why did he came out in this order?

435
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,170
Tenzan always open his mouth, huh?

436
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,330
You guys know about Tenzan?

437
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,600
Oh, he's talking

438
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,070
When Tenzan left the Tokyo Dome, he kept saying something like this, right?

439
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,840
I asked him about this in person

440
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,210
I asked him "what were you saying?

441
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,110
And he said he was just moving his mouth

442
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,180
Moving his mouth? -Eh?

443
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,180
That's what he told me

444
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,180
"I'm gonna beat you up," not something like that?

445
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,950
He didn't say a word

446
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,220
This is a disaster -What happened?

447
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,760
This is a true disaster

448
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,120
You're angry at so many things

449
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,590
No, this is the worst

450
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,090
What happened? -Just say it, dude

451
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,860
Well, you guys probably don't know him, but Kitamura-san is very angry now

452
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,600
Kitamura-san? -Yes

453
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,800
Who's Kitamura-san?

454
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,500
Yeah, you don't know him, right?

455
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,070
I don't -He's a real pain in the neck

456
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,070
Whoa, maybe Kitamura-san is going to call me

457
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,840
Whoa, that's absolutely terrible

458
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,510
Do you need to be so upset because of someone else?

459
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,110
Because he's furious with me -You're right

460
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,120
Because you don't know the fearfulness of Kitamura-san

461
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,980
We don't know - I've never met him before

462
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,250
Is he going to call you?

463
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,090
Yeah, maybe he'll call me. Come on, we're still recording now

464
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,090
He never cares about otheYs

465
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,260
Well, he probably don't know you're recording now

466
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,860
Oh gee

467
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,530
Will he break in the studio?

468
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,030
Nah, he probably won't go that far

469
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,000
Well, then that's fine

470
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,270
But he's really angry now. He's really annoying.

471
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,340
Come on, give me a break, Kitamura-san!

472
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,310
When is he going to call you?

473
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,510
No, no...maybe he won't call me

474
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,280
How dare you ask us to gather around then?

475
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,950
Huh?

476
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,550
If he's not going to call you

477
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,320
We all gathered around and waiting for you

478
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,530
What the heck is wrong with you?

479
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,060
Can you make it clear, dude? -Honestly, what's going on now?

480
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,530
So you don't know about Kitamura-san, right?

481
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,470
Do you know him?

482
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,070
Eh? What are you talking about?

483
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,770
You don't know about Kitamura-san, right?

484
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,910
Why are you frustrated? -No, no, no...

485
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,040
Why are you already frustrated?

486
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,510
I don't understand your plan

487
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,010
You guys don't even know him

488
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,450
Of course we don't know, you're the one who said it, and that's why we all gathered around

489
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,520
You guys don't even know about Kitamura-san, you guys have no idea

490
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,290
(This dude is quite interesting)

491
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,060
You guys know nothing about Kitamura-san, so stop being sarcastic

492
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,730
Oh, you mean Masa-san? -That actor?

493
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,700
Kitamura Masahide, right?

494
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,700
Eh? Masa-san?

495
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,500
Not Masa-san!

496
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,210
If it's Masa-san, then I'll just say it's Masa-san, right?

497
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,140
Why would I take the trouble to say Kitamura-san?

498
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,310
Stop making fun of Kitamura-san!

499
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,780
What's wrong with you guys?

500
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,650
You guys are idiots, honestly!

501
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,750
Absolutely no idea.what's going on

502
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,920
I definitely don't want to laugh at this and receive a card

503
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,460
(Yeah, it’s not concise, I can’t give out cards neatly too)

504
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,900
(Someone's coming)

505
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,030
(That's awful, something awful is coming)

506
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,640
(Something awful is coming...)

507
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,350
(Something awful is coming)

508
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,820
(That was awful)

509
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,360
(That was awful, and it's cunning if you don't look at him)

510
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,330
(That was unexpected)

511
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,000
Something is making a "ji-ji-ji" sound

512
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,700
Something is hapj5eningtover there

513
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,600
Something wth a motor?

514
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,840
Is that a mouse?

515
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,110
What's that?

516
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,510
Whoa, that's a cat

517
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,020
(He laughed?)

518
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,290
(No, he didn't laugh)

519
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,350
How come?

520
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:55,040
*Around the time of the show, while Tamuken was eating at a ramen shop, one of hte staff took a photo with him and posted it on the official Twitter, saying that "Tamuken is a boring person without mic and camera." The shop was criticized by many comedy fans.

521
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,460
Ramen...

522
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,500
Ramen? -He said Ramen

523
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:55,070
So that cat is probably raised by one of the staffs in that Ramen shop

524
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,010
Eh? So this cat is on that Ramen shop's side?

525
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:03,680
Well, yeah, this cat is probably living in that Ramen shop

526
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,450
He was furious with me only, he was so friendly to everyone else

527
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,530
(There's a traffic jam)

528
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,700
You're shaving a lot of hair

529
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,500
You're shaving your hair? -Yes

530
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,770
You have to look in the mirror and shave it carefully

531
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,540
Whoa! -No, stop it, that's too dangerous

532
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,980
I'll do it for you, so stop it. I'll do it for you

533
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,180
I'll do it for you (Yeah, that's scary)

534
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,080
You're gonna hurt yourself -Too dangerous!

535
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,850
Don't move it up and down, that's insane!

536
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,650
What the heck are you doing?

537
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,720
Too dangerous...

538
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
I told you not to move it up and down!

539
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,960
Stop it, that's too dangerous

540
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,060
No way, no!

541
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,260
No, no, no way! That's insane!

542
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,230
That's ridiculous! -So scary

543
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Ridiculous -I told you to stop it

544
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,930
Too dangerous

545
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,570
Cut it out -Is my head shaved?

546
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,670
Of course it is shaved, Michio

547
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,870
And he's uninjured

548
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,280
You don't need that maze anymore?

549
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,780
Yeah, I'm done with that maze, or else I'll be scolded

550
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,110
Who will scold you?

551
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,380
My parents

552
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,720
Please stop it, seriously -Then can you...?

553
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,420
Please do it for him

554
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,220
Do it tenderly

555
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,390
Is it fine?

556
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,460
Can I really shave it?

557
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,860
You don't have other jobs? -It's okay

558
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,030
Do you need to look the same on shows? -No worries

559
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,900
I'll just be scolded by my parents

560
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,200
You're not starred in any drama shows?

561
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,470
Your maze is gone, is that fine? Do you need that maze on other shows?

562
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,470
Of course he won't need that maze on other shows

563
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,340
What happened to Tamura-san and that cat?

564
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,480
Thank you very much -Looking good now

565
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,180
I've only shaved the front part of your head

566
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,980
Excuse me, thank you very much

567
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,620
What the heck is this gauze in field hospitals?

568
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,920
Your metaphors are all about battlefield

569
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,320
Because I've just watch Private Ryan

570
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,590
(That was fast)

571
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,160
(That was fast)

572
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,260
(That response was fast)

573
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,530
Hey, dude! -Yes?

574
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:04,400
Your jokes are always bothering others, that jelly as well

575
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,970
Well, yeah, that's tru e

576
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,370
Others need to tidy things up for you

577
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,140
I'm sorry

578
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,640
Your seniors are tidying things up for you

579
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,810
What kind of education did you receive?

580
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,210
Well, nothing special...

581
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,750
I'm sorry, please forgive me

582
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,580
What's wrong with your parents?

583
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,550
My mom is dead

584
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,550
This has nothing to do with his parents

585
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,620
My mom is dead

586
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,390
So you're from a single-father family?

587
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,190
Well, yeah, part way through

588
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,490
Part way through? -Yes

589
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,460
I'm from a single-father family

590
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,330
Work hard and do you best, dude -Yes

591
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,330
You got me? Don't lose to anyone

592
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,500
No, no, this is terrible -Stop it, cut it out

593
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,040
Dude...you finally did this to me, huh?

594
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,640
That's seriously inappropriate

595
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,410
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. I'll pay him back double

596
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,510
No, no more, cut it out

597
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,380
I'm gonna pull his hair out

598
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,650
Miyasako-san said that already

599
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,820
I said it already, sorry

600
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,820
He already said "there's no hair to pull"

601
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,610
"I can't grab it"

602
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,250
Ah Kato-san, behind you

603
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,310
Watch out

604
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,150
Good morning

605
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,680
He got that on so quick

606
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,460
-Good morning
-He can prepare something like that so quickly

607
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,990
Good morning

608
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,360
So quick

609
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,430
He's a school principal with an iron wig

610
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,300
That’s not the principal
It’s "Tokudane!" (Editor's note: Morning News Show)

611
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,400
-“Tokudane!”
-Oh that one

612
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,540
-Good morning
-It’s Ogura-san

613
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,740
Don't say that

614
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,640
He will get angry

615
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,440
Good morning

616
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,850
He can’t take it off?

617
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,080
-He can’t take it off
-He did his best

618
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,520
-I wonder if Kitamura-san will call

619
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,720
-Is he still attempting that?

620
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,830
You, really, really need to stop it

621
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,130
He’s very angry

622
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,500
Did the call come?
Why don’t you know? Look at your phone

623
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
Did something arrive through LINE? (EN: "LINE" is a Messaging App)

624
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,100
Is something wrong with the plan?

625
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,240
-Can you see it on my phone?
-He's on LINE

626
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,970
He does have LINE, then

627
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,810
Koyabu-san is already laughing

628
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,510
-That's how it is... Soon…
-Koyabu-san is already laughing

629
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,880
Say it to Koyabu-san

630
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,440
What is this!

631
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,480
Do you know anything about Kitamura-san?

632
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,250
What are you saying?

633
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,520
Do you know...
About Kitamura-san?

634
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,620
You don’t know, right?

635
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,690
I already told you many times
that I don't know

636
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,020
From that annoying Kitamura-san

637
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,930
I may get a call from that annoying Kitamura-san

638
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,590
He's crying

639
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,170
Wait… I’ll wipe my tears

640
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,270
This is bad, this is really bad

641
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,000
-This guy is dangerous
-Koyabu-san is laughing all the time

642
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,010
-Wait a second
-Yes

643
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,940
"Kitamura-san", what's up with that?

644
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,780
Seriously, you’re right

645
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,710
What is he saying?

646
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,720
He attempted the joke twice, and couldn't land it twice

647
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,990
He was really worried about something

648
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,320
Hey, I recently got into a hobby

649
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,560
A hobby, or rather a "special skill"

650
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,060
I, myself...

651
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,630
I thought that I couldn't be hypnotized
If you think I can't hypnotize you, I can

652
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,200
By the way, like...

653
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,870
I’m starting to get a little interested myself

654
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,600
You're very susceptible, aren't you?

655
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,310
I’m very susceptible
I'm not sure if you know this, but...

656
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,810
Hypnosis?

657
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,950
If I get hypnotized
I can do things that I normally couldn't

658
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,650
It’s easy to do

659
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,350
Ah Tamura-san
You can do hypnosis?

660
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,680
Who? Who wants to go first?

661
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,750
What… what is this?

662
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,750
This is an example, but-

663
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,490
When there are noodles in ponzu, I can't slurp it

664
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,060
I just spit it out

665
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,760
That's how it is
But if I’m hypnotized...

666
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,930
I can quickly eat it

667
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,130
Amazing!

668
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,400
Then... Goto

669
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,400
Alright

670
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,770
First you eat it normally

671
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,140
Slurping it all at once

672
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,910
It's so acidic

673
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,140
Is there only ponzu in here?

674
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,080
Yeah, only ponzu
No, wait a second, wait a second

675
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,810
There are quite a lot of noodles

676
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,980
- Add a lot more
-How much is this??

677
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,050
Come on already

678
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,190
What?

679
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,660
He said "Fun fun" now
He completely just went "fun fun"

680
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,460
I didn't say "foo foo"
I said "ha ha"

681
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,130
You said…
You said it yourself...

682
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,600
You're enjoying this

683
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,630
Because that's what I thought he said

684
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,300
Did he laugh just now?

685
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,370
I’m not laughing

686
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,470
It’s exactly what I expected

687
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,370
-Stop looking in a different direction…
-You’re laughing, see...

688
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,370
-This is disgusting
-That much?

689
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,080
No, this is harsh

690
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,480
This is bad

691
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,350
Now let's try it with hypnosis

692
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,080
Seriously?

693
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,580
Wait, I want some time beforehand

694
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,620
That's a special skill, right?

695
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,960
Close your eyes, Goto

696
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,360
Relax relax

697
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,160
Feels good Feels good
It feels good

698
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,530
Feels good Feels good
It feels good

699
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,000
Yes, Goto
Now it feels good

700
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,770
You're in Documental
but forget it for now

701
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,530
What? It feels good

702
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,910
Are you good? Then I’ll count down 5 seconds

703
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,610
This ponzu, which was sour until now, is going to be nothing

704
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,610
So I...

705
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,320
After I count “5 4 3 2 1”
Raise your head

706
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,520
And open your eyes

707
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,850
5 4 3 2 1 ...
-Aren’t you laughing?

708
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Yes, open your eyes

709
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,920
Goto, hey...
Did you just laugh?

710
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,460
Huh?

711
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,530
Do you want to eat it?
-Eat it!

712
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,370
Why did you laugh?

713
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,700
-Go for it
-It would be amazing if you could eat it

714
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,210
He laughed so hard

715
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,040
Two people

716
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,890
-What’s this?
-Two people just completely lost

717
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,560
I was about to laugh... I was about to laugh

718
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,560
No, I didn't laugh!

719
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,090
So much was going on

720
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,630
No, I didn't laugh!!

721
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,260
Tamuken was completely laughing

722
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,170
No, I laughed after the alarm

723
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,970
It wasn’t ringing yet

724
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,140
Goto was about to laugh when he was hypnotized

725
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,570
No, you're wrong, you're wrong

726
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,380
He said "raise your head"

727
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,910
My head was already raised, though

728
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,910
I don’t get it

729
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,580
If he made a mistake, it shouldn't affect you

730
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,090
So I...

731
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,620
After I count “５ ４ ３ ２ １”
Raise your head

732
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,890
And open your eyes

733
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,190
He’s laughing!

734
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,430
This was really interesting

735
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,000
He’s already laughing…

736
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,200
This…this…

737
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,340
I wonder what to do about this

738
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,100
I was holding in the laugh!

739
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,570
Well this is, Tamuken…

740
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,110
It would be amazing if you could eat it

741
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,610
-You just laughed a lot
-See!

742
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,550
Two people

743
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,090
That's Tamuken, right?

744
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,420
That said, it’s my point, right?

745
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,390
Well, that’s right Tamuken…

746
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,660
He already had yellow, right?

747
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,500
Alright, let’s continue

748
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,170
Was that really hypnosis?

749
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,230
You can’t do it. It's impossible

750
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,800
If we can’t do it
eventually we’ll vomit and spit it out

751
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,570
Don't say that!

752
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,970
Everyone knows

753
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,980
Start!

754
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,750
Let's get on with it

755
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,350
So many cigarettes

756
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,990
With this body shape... I'm a little fat

757
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,660
Wait Nobu
This guy is funny

758
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,400
I can't take this, I'm laughing way too much

759
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,100
Thank you for waiting

760
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,940
Um, are you guys a group?

761
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,670
-What?
-Are you Kitamura-san?

762
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,140
No I’m not

763
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,640
Eh, Kitamura-san?

764
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,440
-Group?
-Group members

765
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,410
Well then
Please sit down

766
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,650
In that case, we're a group

767
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,680
This guy is interesting

768
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,020
Minako-chan can go right away

769
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,560
Mai-chan?
Yukari-chan

770
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,060
They... can go right away

771
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,090
-She's a little chubby
-It’s a chubby service, right

772
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,100
-No no no
-Is this your speciality?

773
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,800
Eh no
Waist 57 58…

774
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:07,870
No no no no
That's wrong

775
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,770
Waist 57

776
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,510
This waist is around 100 (EN: He might've meant the hips)

777
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,070
-Is that so?
-Everyone is so fat

778
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,980
Around 30 minutes...
If you have time...

779
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,680
-Aiko-chan
-I don't want to wait

780
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,050
Wow wow wow

781
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,810
-This is Ichigo-chan
-Who will be waiting for this?

782
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,080
-I won’t wait
-It's the same, right?

783
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,050
Do you specialize in chubby women?

784
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,590
No no
Do you like slender women?

785
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,650
Ah, yes

786
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,420
When it comes to Miruku-chan

787
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,460
She’s still chubby

788
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,690
Akari-chan

789
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,660
-Still chubby…
-The same?

790
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,970
It's the same person
She’s just changing wigs

791
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,640
Akari-chan
Miruku-chan

792
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,610
No, if it were 3 separate women, the 3 sizes (B, W, H) would change

793
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,110
And now, the most talented

794
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,380
-Amazing
-The best one

795
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,810
Yuu-chan

796
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,480
Why are you doing this?

797
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,650
What do you mean?

798
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,850
7000 yen for 40 minutes

799
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,450
-Expensive
-Eh cheap

800
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,650
-Is it cheap?
-It’s cheap, it’s cheap

801
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,820
The market's amazing

802
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,060
What are you on about?

803
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,990
Do you usually have it done secretly? (EN: Not 100% sure about this line)

804
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,200
Watanabe?
She’s a female entertainer called TOY

805
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,770
She's an entertainer?

806
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
-Ah, so is everyone an entertainer?
-Ah, everyone?

807
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,740
Do you make female entertainers
do these kinds of things?

808
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,410
Ah, is that so

809
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,810
-She’s a married woman
That's not good

810
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,920
If you'd like,
Our store manager has published a book

811
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,390
If you want, I can give this as a service

812
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,750
What?

813
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,920
This person's the store manager?

814
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,760
Yes
Do you know him?

815
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,560
No, sorry

816
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,190
I'm sure the manager will be pleased

817
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,000
-I don’t need this...
Are you sitting down?

818
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,800
Yes? Together

819
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,970
-You’re from the store, right?
-Soon...

820
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,510
He almost laughed

821
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,540
He’s holding back his laugh

822
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,640
I'm not holding back my laugh

823
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,480
He's holding back
It’s frustrating, isn’t it?

824
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,640
That's how it is

825
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,280
Do you want to sit together?!

826
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,650
That’s how it'll be very soon…

827
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,820
I'll tell you that soon

828
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,220
What am I supposed to do...

829
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,290
Do you like Goto-san?

830
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,160
What should I do?

831
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,730
-Goto-san
-Are you crying?

832
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,700
It's really messed up!

833
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,830
What is this?!

834
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,330
But you...

835
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,040
What I want to know is
what you're doing right now

836
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,640
Too. Bad!

837
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,580
Koyabu-san too...

838
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,320
Just reading the book like that

839
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,990
Please read it out loud,
any sentence is fine

840
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,190
I’m Kazuki Enari
A student of Hana-College

841
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,960
I want to enjoy campus life

842
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,390
Which social circle should I join?

843
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,830
Didn't you say?

844
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,130
But you, you're not allowed to join

845
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,800
I’m sorry it's because you don't belong

846
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,770
The world is full of old ladies

847
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,570
You see!

848
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,310
Goto-san… Goto-san too
Go ahead and laugh at me!

849
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,180
You don't have to read it

850
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,450
It's fine

851
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,750
What should I read?

852
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,350
Anything is fine

853
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,060
I stayed at my boyfriend’s house yesterday

854
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,920
I went to work today

855
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,460
Oh no!
There's a kiss mark on the back of my neck

856
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,260
When did he do that?

857
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,100
Didn't you say?

858
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,970
Didn't you say?

859
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,570
He's doing it properly

860
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,710
-Really by the book
-Very skilled

861
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,680
But you!

862
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:40,450
This is because of the ticks that were on the futon at my boyfriend's house! (EN: Not 100% sure)

863
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,280
Too bad!

864
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,680
This is messed up...

865
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,690
The person who I fell in love with disinfected the place (EN: Not 100% sure)

866
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,900
This is dangerous

867
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,360
Can I read it?

868
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,170
This is dangerous

869
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,540
Why you crying?
Can you tell us?

870
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,870
For real

871
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,970
That's how you do it, Goto-san, and so soon...

872
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,310
This face is unfair
It’s so sly

873
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,880
That’s how Goto-san did it!

874
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,750
You’re already laughing

875
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,980
Aren't you laughing this whole time?

876
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,820
What are you doing?
Do you have something against me?

877
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,880
You're spitting on me

878
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,950
When I look at my nail art

879
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,950
That's the rhythm

880
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,420
It’s the latest pattern

881
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,130
It’s so colorful
It stands out, right~

882
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,400
Let me see your fingertips more

883
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,270
Didn't you say?

884
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,970
That's so embarrassing...

885
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,570
But you!

886
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,740
The most noticeable thing is
the hangnail!

887
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:43,840
-He's laughing
-What a shame!

888
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,090
I heard the sound of your runny nose
-Really, Seiya?

889
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,530
It can’t be helped

890
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,500
It’s really bad, but...

891
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,700
This was Kato's point

892
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,400
Ehh, but Kato, wait...

893
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,370
-Isn’t he cheating?
-Kato, that's right

894
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,840
This needs to be judged

895
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,180
When I was first reading
this guy was already laughing

896
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,810
No, I was crying because I was sad

897
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,280
Whenever you think you're about to laugh
You make that face

898
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,520
No, no, it's because I’m sad

899
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,490
I have to be careful about this

900
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,760
But this is dangerous

901
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,690
This is dangerous
You can see the joke

902
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,390
The pages are also dangerous

903
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,630
I can’t see the end

904
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,100
Let's watch Seiya

905
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,300
Looking at my nail art

906
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,310
That's the rhythm

907
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,740
It’s the latest pattern

908
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:53,480
It’s so colorful
It stands out, right~

909
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,920
Let me see your fingertips more

910
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,620
Didn't you say?

911
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,890
That's so embarrassing

912
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,490
It was already out of control here

913
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,890
But you!

914
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,090
The most noticeable thing is
the hangnail!

915
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,200
-He's laughing
-What a shame!

916
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,940
At the time of “Didn't you say”

917
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,270
You were really getting into the rhythm

918
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,740
That's hilarious

919
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,180
-Um, is it the first time for Seiya?
-It’s my first time

920
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,950
-He was full-on laughing
-No, no, no, no, no

921
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,680
But at least I did it to myself

922
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,920
Pile it on

923
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,480
No, Matsumoto-san this is…

924
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,190
-Well, well, yellow
-That’s a relief

925
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,320
-I'll give you Yellow
-Thank you very much

926
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,760
And hey,
Kato you need to stop

927
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,390
I'm suspicious that you're running away with it

928
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,160
-Yeah, that's enough
-That's not fair

929
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,460
It's been unfair until now

930
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,600
Please wait a moment
Does that mean that I'm not allowed to cry?

931
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,930
No, no, it’s fine to cry but...

932
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,400
The “Frustrated” face

933
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,900
I'm genuinely sad (when I make that face)

934
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,370
When you’re about to laugh
Don't do that anymore

935
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,540
But when I'm about to laugh

936
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,070
And I suddenly feel sad
What am I supposed to do then?

937
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,410
What the hell does that mean?!

938
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,540
That doesn't happen

939
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,380
He’s laughing so hard

940
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,380
If anyone laughs with that face

941
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,620
-That's the worst
-It’s the worst

942
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,920
What is this handicap

943
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,860
Handicap? Handicap

944
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,900
Start!

945
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:25,440
Kato-san
Your teeth are amazing, too

946
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,740
Is it for sale?

947
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,440
-What’s this?
-Would you like to wear it?

948
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,740
No
Obviously you can't wear it

949
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,650
How much was it?
How much was it?

950
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,450
How much do you think?

951
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,080
What a trivial question...

952
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,480
300 yen

953
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,720
How much do you think? Koyabu-san

954
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,220
Goto did say it...
300 yen

955
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,760
-You're giving the same answer?
-Yeah

956
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,820
Aren't you adventurous?

957
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,190
No, it's around 300 yen

958
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,960
-You're okay with giving the same answer?
-Yes

959
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,630
Eh, you're not adventurous?

960
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,830
No, it’s not an adventure
I just think so

961
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,770
Eh, it’s odd

962
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,840
It really smells

963
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,240
-Huh?
-It smells, really

964
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,570
Please smell it

965
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,640
Would you like to wear it?

966
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,240
There's no way to wear it
It stinks

967
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:02,940
It stinks!

968
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,680
smell, smell, smell, smell

969
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,310
Smell it

970
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,250
Uwa it stinks!

971
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,720
-Disgusting!
-It smells!

972
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,720
I don’t want to
I don’t want to

973
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,790
It stinks

974
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,260
I don't want to do this anymore...

975
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,160
I don't want to wear it

976
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,960
I'll just smell it

977
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,430
It stinks

978
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,470
Why is everyone smelling it?

979
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,910
-That’s enough enough
-Really

980
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,740
-Are you guys done?
-That's enough

981
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,810
So how much was it?

982
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,610
The price was 350 yen

983
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,710
Or 450 yen, I think

984
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,950
I don't care which

985
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,180
Don't chop off 50 yen

986
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,280
For something like that

987
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,190
Eh, who put this together again?

988
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,190
What is this, round 2?

989
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,090
Oh, right
I saw that someone put the boobs in again when I was there

990
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,190
What? Whose boobs are these?

991
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,730
-His turn has been going on for a long time
-Eh, that's enough...

992
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,330
-It’s been a really long time
-They're soft!

993
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,300
-His turn is so long
-I've had enough of this

994
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,070
It’s soft!

995
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,240
I wonder why is it so soft?

996
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,740
Koyabu-san, you had better check it out

997
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,880
Koyabu-san it’s soft
I’m so happy

998
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,020
Boobs like these

999
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,450
This guy who was supposed to be the salesperson before

1000
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,420
If he’s the salesperson
I’m pretty sure he’ll touch them

1001
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,490
I don’t know, but...

1002
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,060
Ugh, Kitamura-san is coming

1003
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,070
-I laughed
-Really?

1004
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,140
-What, why?
-I didn’t notice at all

1005
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,880
Don't switch gags in the middle

1006
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,680
From boobs to Kitamura-san

1007
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:47,410
There are 2 suspects

1008
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,480
Was it Nobu?

1009
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,120
No, no, no…

1010
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,720
Koyabu and Nobu…

1011
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,060
No, Matsumoto-san

1012
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,190
-I think Nobu is suspicious
-I’m not suspicious at all

1013
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,530
I’m not so sure either

1014
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:01,860
Can I take a look?

1015
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,400
Koyabu-san it’s soft
I’m so happy

1016
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,570
This guy who was supposed to be the salesperson before

1017
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,870
If he’s the salesperson
I’m pretty sure he’ll touch them

1018
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,010
I don’t know, but...

1019
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,110
Ugh, Kitamura-san is coming

1020
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,310
Ah, Nobu-san

1021
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,850
-It’s Nobu?
-I’m safe

1022
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,990
It’s definitely Nobu

1023
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,460
I already have one

1024
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,230
Nobu

1025
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,430
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

1026
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,960
For Koyabu, let's say he was safe

1027
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,430
Really??
Thank you very much

1028
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,870
Wow, amazing

1029
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,970
With that Kitamura-san crap

1030
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,300
-What's the point?
-Oh man, this is dangerous

1031
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,440
That's dangerous

1032
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,440
Everyone is following Kato's pace

1033
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,970
-You're right
It’s dangerous it’s dangerous…

1034
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,170
You're so persistent, Kato

1035
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,480
-Kato's persistent
Very persistent!

1036
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:51,510
Persistent, persistent

1037
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,210
Oh my God
This is really bad

1038
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,750
-Tamura-san
-I have an orange card

1039
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,080
-I have an orange card too
-Who else has an orange card?

1040
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,620
-Ahh, three people
-Orange card?

1041
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,060
-Orange card. There are 3 of us.
-I'm out of here

1042
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,760
Wow, so fast

1043
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,490
Seiya has a yellow card?

1044
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,790
-I also have a yellow card
-Oh, yellow?

1045
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,430
-I have 0 cards
-Zero, zero, zero

1046
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:10,660
The people who have 0 cards are dangerous

1047
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,570
Koyabu-san was laughing too

1048
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,930
No, that was close
Nobu was first

1049
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,570
I’m sorry, that’s right

1050
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,000
Nobu, don't you feel that way?

1051
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,110
It’s dangerous

1052
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,410
Start!

1053
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,210
Okay, well...
Are you hungry?

1054
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,280
I’m hungry

1055
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,120
I heard there's something on the way

1056
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,990
-Yes, it is
-Something's coming

1057
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,550
May I?

1058
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,660
Hmm…It's still early in the game

1059
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,890
100% Akira exaggerated

1060
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,290
Easy type

1061
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,730
-Yes, yes, yes
-Easy type

1062
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,630
Hiya hiya
Did it get chilly? (EN: might be "Did it get lame?")

1063
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,400
Hiya hiya
Did it get chilly?

1064
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:53,340
Hiya Hiya Hiya Hiya

1065
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,280
This one that doesn’t have a mosaic

1066
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,210
Hiya Hiya
Did it get chilly?

1067
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,310
Hiya Hiya
Did it get chilly?

1068
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,080
-It's so insanely erected
-Hiya Hiya

1069
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,250
-Bin bin
-His balls are so huge

1070
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,320
Bin bin

1071
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:12,930
Hiya Hiya
Did it get chilly?

1072
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,660
It’s hitting his navel/belly button

1073
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:15,860
It’s a penis

1074
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,260
What are you talking about?

1075
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,200
-Penis
-That's how people from the country say it

1076
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,640
The lid hitting the floor is loud

1077
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,270
-Yeah, it’s surprising, isn't it?
-The lid hitting the floor is loud

1078
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,110
Did it get chilly?
Hiya Hiya

1079
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,540
The sound scares me

1080
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:30,780
Dangerous

1081
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:33,650
Do you want to eat something?

1082
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:34,910
-Delivery
-What’s the deal with delivery?

1083
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,320
What?

1084
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:42,720
Goto Kazutoyo Jiro
Miyasako Zakoshi are untouched

1085
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,330
Surprisingly, Goto is doing well

1086
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,900
-What’s the matter?
-What’s wrong?

1087
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,160
The menu?

1088
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,300
What’s wrong?

1089
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:54,600
It came?

1090
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,200
Goto-san, what happened

1091
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,700
Goto-san, did it come?

1092
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,000
-Nobu, check it out
-Nobu

1093
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,370
-No, no…
I’m hungry

1094
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,940
No, I’m fine
I’m serious

1095
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,780
I’m serious. I’m serious. I'm serious

1096
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,180
Seriously!
Wait a moment

1097
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,350
-Wait a second!
-What the hell is that?!

1098
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,550
What's with that face?

1099
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,090
Wait a second

1100
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,450
You shouldn't make that face

1101
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,120
There are so many kinds of paella

1102
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,090
Look here

1103
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,760
You can't be serious
Opening this...

1104
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,230
Paella has so many types

1105
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,200
I'd like to try some paella

1106
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,830
Tamura
Want to see it together?

1107
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:29,340
Why?! Why?

1108
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,370
You can see it alone!
Why?!

1109
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,440
-Please
-Why?

1110
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:35,240
I saw it
There were quite a lot of options

1111
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:36,880
Because you’re in the restaurant industry

1112
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,380
I want you to see it with your own eyes

1113
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,080
In that case, Michio has to come too

1114
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,150
-Alright, Michio too
-Alright

1115
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,720
Let's see it as the Orange-Army

1116
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,590
Come on
We can take it

1117
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,320
-Let's see what it is
-Yes

1118
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,390
Ready go!

1119
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:52,730
Ahh, the menu

1120
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,610
This topping

1121
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,710
Something's there

1122
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,450
The delivery came?

1123
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:14,750
-The meal?
-Yes

1124
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,880
Did anyone ask for this?

1125
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,720
If my memory is right...

1126
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:22,420
Today’s special is!

1127
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,360
This

1128
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:38,970
-Great, but
-Oh…

1129
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,570
We've got a new delivery!

1130
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,910
If my memory is right...

1131
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,810
Today’s special is!

1132
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,180
This... on a penis

1133
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,500
-Yeah, okay, okay…
-It didn’t have any hair before

1134
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,800
-Nobu Nobu Nobu Nobu Nobu
-I heard “Kuk”

1135
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,030
-Nobu

1136
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,840
It didn’t have hair before

1137
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,750
In between all of this

1138
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,520
In the last little while, the hair grew back

1139
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,450
A-Damo-chan

1140
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,790
What would you like

1141
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,060
No, really
I’m a little hungry

1142
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,790
Maybe a croissant or something

1143
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,300
Ahh, bread

1144
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,560
But something like that

1145
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,270
I can make an omelet

1146
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,500
Eh, I don't like anything from Michio-san

1147
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,900
Your omelet,
I really don't want to eat it

1148
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:44,340
That’s right

1149
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,310
Here comes a new one

1150
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,440
That’s enough

1151
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,570
Today’s special is!

1152
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,080
Just a penis here

1153
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,590
He totally just laughed

1154
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,390
Give me a break, this is crazy

1155
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,260
He laughed completely

1156
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:12,000
Oh my God, how can you laugh so beautifully?

1157
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:15,400
But, already...
It was bound to happen, wasn't it?

1158
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,040
You've seen it so many times

1159
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,410
Isn’t it funny?
It’s funny

1160
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,640
When he was saying "choo choo"
he was already holding his laugh

1161
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,580
Here comes a new one

1162
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:26,750
That’s enough

1163
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:27,880
Today’s special is!

1164
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,750
Just a penis here

1165
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,490
-There is no Adamo
-He shattered

1166
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,000
This is completely Zakoshi's point

1167
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:45,800
-So quick
-Eh Nobu...

1168
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,270
OUT!

1169
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:49,470
Eh, he's out?!

1170
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,640
This is funny, right?

1171
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,950
That is dangerous

1172
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:03,520
What the hell were you thinking
when you made that

1173
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,120
Come on, Nobu

1174
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,820
I didn't put out anything

1175
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,220
Yeah

1176
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,020
First, again

1177
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,790
-You didn't get to do anything
-I didn't get to do anything

1178
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,760
-We still have zombies
-Zombies, yeah

1179
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:19,330
-I’ll be back
-Yes, as a zombie

1180
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,730
-Let’s go Nobu
-Yes

1181
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,740
-Try your best
-Good luck

1182
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:25,870
Shit

1183
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,810
I did it again...

1184
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,980
I was first again...

1185
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:35,380
That's it
I don’t understand

1186
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,820
Kato-san

1187
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:41,120
Koyabu-san it’s soft
I’m so happy

1188
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,990
Boobs like these

1189
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,690
Normally, if you're talking about boobs...

1190
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,860
That's where the joke stays

1191
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,600
Suddenly the topic changed to Kitamura-san

1192
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:54,370
Ugh, Kitamura-san is coming

1193
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,510
He's funny

1194
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:03,580
There's a possibility that he might win
