00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,200
THIS PROGRAM WAS PRODUCED
UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MEDICAL EXPERTS,

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,900
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HEALTH
AND SAFETY OF THE STAFF AND CONTESTANTS.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,670
Gather round,

00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,030
elite warriors!

00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,500
THE YEAR 1986

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,570
Charge!

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,170
In 1986, a colossal battle broke loose.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,270
THE IMPENETRABLE CASTLE

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,670
A castle so impenetrable,

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,270
only eight out of 127 battles
have ever seen its halls.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,200
8 WINS, 118 LOSSES, 1 DRAW
WIN RATE 0.06%

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,370
That dreadful castle has reemerged
in the Land of the Rising Sun.

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,470
JAPAN

14
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,770
RESURRECTION

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,870
THE YEAR 2023

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,000
Charge!

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,930
Takeshi's Castle is back!
Fortified with extravagance and fortitude,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,870
packed with new games,
it's the palace of your dreams!

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,070
WHO WILL EMERGE
AS THE BOLDEST WARRIOR?

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,630
NO TIME FOR FEAR

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,330
I'll bring justice upon you numbskulls!

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,430
Have a look and see for yourself.

23
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,070
TAKE NO PRISONERS

24
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,000
Victory is ours!

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,100
I'm gutted.

26
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,630
Tear it down

27
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,570
to take home...

28
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,000
ONE MILLION YEN

29
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,830
I will destroy you!

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,400
I made it!

31
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,630
Here we go!

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Fall, fall till you can fall no further.

33
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,670
Struggle as you may,
he has you in the palm of his hand.

34
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,030
DANCE...

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,430
The man of the hour
that you've all waited for...

36
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,230
IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND

37
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,800
ARMY VS TAKESHI

38
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,270
Takeshi's Castle!

39
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,900
TAKESHI'S CASTLE

40
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,900
In the first monumental battle
in 34 years, 100 brave warriors

41
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,430
have been tasked with the mission
to tear down

42
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,030
three fortresses
that protect Takeshi's Castle.

43
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,300
The army's numbers dwindled
at the first fortress, Ueda Castle.

44
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,100
THE FIRST FORTRESS
UEDA CASTLE

45
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,130
In the end, they were left
with a frustrating defeat.

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,130
Victory is ours! We did it.

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,800
FAILED TO BEAT TAKESHI'S ARMY

48
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,930
CAPTAIN KIMURA DISAPPEARS

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,900
On top of that, Takeshi's army
has kidnapped Captain Kimura.

50
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,530
However, the army's fighting spirit
cannot be extinguished.

51
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,730
They've rounded up once again
and ready to conquer the second fortress.

52
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,670
THE BATTLES OF THE SECOND FORTRESS

53
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,270
Battles at the second fortress now begin
with the sound of the conch shell.

54
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,630
We opened auditions to the public,
out of which,

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,370
we chose 100 of the best.

56
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,730
Taking in the lessons learned
at Ueda Castle,

57
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,570
we gather participants
who are especially fit, from competitors

58
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,400
of the world renown Sasuke race
to pro wrestlers and Spartan racers.

59
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,230
What will become of them?

60
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,470
Meanwhile, Takeshi's Castle

61
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,670
has been moved closer
to the second fortress.

62
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,770
The formation for battle is now in place.

63
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,330
THE SECOND FORTRESS
NAOMI CASTLE

64
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,670
Here we are at the second fortress.

65
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,070
Let's greet the princess.
Sorry to keep you waiting, your highness.

66
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,330
LADY OF THE SECOND FORTRESS
NAOMI WATANABE

67
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,730
Come and get it.

68
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,800
-No, no.
-You're being reckless.

69
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,630
Princess, that's dangerous.

70
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,530
-I'm sure I was hit five or six times.
-My apologies.

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,430
The enemy is approaching.

72
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,130
-Are they close?
-Yes.

73
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,800
-An army of about 100 warriors.
-That's right.

74
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,730
-About 100? Not 100 exactly?
-That's correct.

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,100
We wanted exactly 100,
but people have lives.

76
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,300
NAOMI CASTLE
SEVEN FORTRESSES

77
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,000
Sometimes other things come up
and they have to cancel.

78
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,070
-What a real-life reason.
-So the numbers fluctuate.

79
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,030
I see.

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,330
So in conclusion, there is an army
of about 100 warriors approaching!

81
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,230
By the way, speaking of the count,

82
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,170
he's gone missing.

83
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,530
Missing?

84
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,970
-Yes.
-Oh, dear.

85
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,070
But we have an AI count
to help protect us.

86
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,300
-Shall we greet him?
-Yes, please.

87
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,200
Push.

88
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:40,130
Hey, what's up. So why did you reveal
that the army is an arbitrary number?

89
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,800
Well...

90
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,670
-Wow.
-It's better to be frank.

91
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,570
-Nowadays, people will fact-check us.
-True.

92
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,030
Since this is an AI, it can project
people other than the count, too.

93
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,570
-What's that?
-The AI is multifunctional?

94
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,370
-It can do many things.
-Is there someone you'd like to meet?

95
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,730
Really. Since this is a global broadcast,
I'd like to meet a foreign celebrity.

96
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,630
-Hi, Justin Bieber.
-Don't be silly. It's me, Justin.

97
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,430
-That sounds like Bobby Ologun.
-What's up, guys?

98
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,530
-No, it's me, Justin.
-No, you're Bobby.

99
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,070
-Let's turn him off.
-That's scary.

100
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,800
-How terrifying.
-Bobby must be his default character.

101
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,570
-Shall we get started?
-Yes, let's.

102
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,100
Could we have a word from you?

103
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,270
Listen up, army... I'll eviscerate you!

104
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,770
-This is great.
-What's with the face?

105
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,570
You look like a gritty hip-hop princess.

106
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,130
Princess of hip-hop.

107
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,900
What's this?

108
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,030
Hey, that's...

109
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,330
To Kimura
How dare you abandon your duties.

110
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,300
Could it be?

111
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,100
-He left me on read?
-That mouth.

112
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,900
I have no choice.
I guess it's my turn to take charge.

113
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,900
That voice.

114
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,530
Get back to basics.

115
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,700
The crowd is going wild.

116
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,570
Thank you for gathering,
my fearless warriors.

117
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,800
-I'm your captain, Hayato Tani.
-Captain!

118
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,800
Wow, it's him.

119
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,330
-It's Mr. Tani.
-Everyone used to imitate his "Charge!"

120
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,900
-He hasn't changed.
-Thank you.

121
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,900
Allow me to explain
for the younger Takeshi's Castle fans.

122
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,300
THE CAPTAIN
HAYATO TANI

123
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,130
This the legend who led the warriors
in the original broadcast.

124
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,100
Hayato Tani himself.

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,270
He's arrived today, fully prepared
to lead in Captain Kimura's absence.

126
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,270
The dreadful Count Takeshi
has currently gone missing.

127
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,800
Let's use that to settle this
34-year-old grudge.

128
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,870
-Look at them.
-I hope you all do your best.

129
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,770
-All of them look strong.
-Understood?

130
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,400
Our current mission
is to overthrow Naomi Castle,

131
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,500
that sits in front of Takeshi's Castle.

132
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,900
-You think they'll do it?
-I'm sure it won't be easy.

133
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,230
There will be challenges.

134
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,470
I hope you'll keep your wits about you.
Are you with me?

135
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,500
-Wow.
-It's Chiitan.

136
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,300
I'd like to take a moment
for introductions.

137
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,530
-I heard there's a Sasuke Jr. here?
-I'm here!

138
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
-Sasuke?
-Hi, I'm Sasuke Jr.

139
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,200
-There you are.
-Wow.

140
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,530
SASUKE CONQUEROR
YUSUKE MORIMOTO (30)

141
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,870
Yusuke Morimoto aka Sasuke Jr,
has won the race twice.

142
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,770
-He's so strong.
-What's your record?

143
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,300
-I've competed 15 times.
-And won every time?

144
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,170
I've won twice.

145
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,800
As the youngest person
to complete the course,

146
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,230
he earned his title of Sasuke Jr.
and is still an active competitor.

147
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,130
His name is Yusuke Morimoto.

148
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,930
Victory is ours!

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,170
Having been defeated
at the battle of Ueda Castle,

150
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:02,230
this time the army has gathered
superior warriors from Sasuke competitors.

151
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,230
The army even has competitors
from Spartan, the toughest race on earth,

152
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,730
as well as professional wrestlers
and exceptional athletes,

153
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,870
who are hell-bent
on avenging the previous army.

154
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,100
-That many athletes?
-They aren't playing around for this one.

155
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,100
I'd like to mark this 34 year gap

156
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,870
with the downfall of Takeshi's Castle
and we'll need all your help.

157
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,970
Our first challenge is The Border Wall.

158
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,830
THE BORDER WALL
DIFFICULTY RATING: 15%

159

COMIC DUO KITSUNE
HIROTSUGU OTSU &amp; KOSEI AWAJI

160
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,900
-It's the Kitsune duo.
-No one will get past us.

161
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,770
They're doing the fox dance.

162
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,170
Do your best, everyone.

163
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,300
-Charge!
-It's the OG "Charge!"

164
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,570
-Wow.
-Nice. It's lively.

165
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,070
The battle to conquer
the second fortress has begun.

166
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,830
Go, go, go!

167
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,500
COMIC DUO TOKYO HOTEISON
TAKERU &amp; SYOGO

168
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,900
-That speed.
-Look at how quick they are.

169
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,900
SPARTAN RACER
RYOTARO AIHARA (27)

170
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,470
-You're the first to arrive.
-Thank you.

171
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,470
-I wanted to beat the Sasuke champions.
-I see.

172
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,600
-I did it.
-Thank you.

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
SPARTAN RACERS TEAM

174
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,770
So this is the whole team?
You did great. Congrats.

175
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,930
REPORTERS - SANSHIRO
HIRONOBU KOMIYA &amp; SHUJI AIDA

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,830
-How was it?
-Cold-- I mean, warm.

177
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,670
FUTTSU POST OFFICE TEAM
SHUNSUKE KANEKO (40)

178
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,100
Proving their athletic capabilities,
the army clears the wall in no time.

179
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,030
DECATHLON RUNNER
HIROYOSHI USHIRO (27)

180
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,400
I didn't need the rope.

181
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,600
-They're spraying from that close?
-Everyone is determined

182
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,800
whether they're a prime athlete or not.

183
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,300
You get targeted with the hose
the longer it takes you to climb.

184
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,370
-Got it.
-And it becomes harder to climb.

185
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,830
-What a mess.
-The Samba guy that fell.

186
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,430
THREE MINUTES REMAINING

187
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,400
Help each other.

188
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,600
Those with an abundance of energy
help the others get over the wall.

189
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,230
With this momentum,
everyone might make it over the wall.

190
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,500
TEAM SASUKE

191
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,900
This was way easier than Sasuke.

192
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,800
IAIDO FIGHTER &amp; SPARTAN COACH
SHIHOMI SUEOKA &amp; MICHIKO SATO

193
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,130
-Piece of cake?
-Easy.

194
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,700
Determine to make them work for it,
Takeshi's army reveals another obstacle.

195
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,230
POWDER ATTACK

196
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,900
A new weapon, billowing clouds of powder
block the view ahead.

197
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,900
Powder Attack.

198
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,800
-It's such a simple name.
-Nothing clever about it.

199
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,730
TWO MINUTES REMAINING

200
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,630
This is relentless. What's happening?

201
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,430
The army doesn't give up easily.

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,730
They muster all their strength
and try to get everyone over the wall.

203
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,900
-Nice, you got this.
-This is sapping their energy.

204
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,870
-She went for it.
-She's soaking wet.

205
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,230
Amazing. I'm impressed.

206
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,030
MOM FRIENDS GROUP
KAMEZU

207
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,370
Everyone's happy
that their teammates made it.

208
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,800
TEAM YOUNG CEOS

209
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,700
TEAM SHOCHIKU GEINO TALENT AGENCY

210
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,830
We did it!

211
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,030
TEAM PRO WRESTLERS

212
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,300
TEAM EX CHEERLEADERS

213
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,400
TEAM OSAKA DRINKING BUDDIES

214
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,570
-I'm drenched.
-I'm pooped.

215
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,330
40 SECONDS LEFT
TWO WARRIORS REMAIN

216
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,870
With less than a minute left,

217
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,030
some warriors struggle to keep up
with the athletes of the group.

218
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,500
Oh, no, what are you going to do?

219
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,970
AIKIDO 2 DAN &amp; ENTREPRENEUR
KAZUNORI TAKISHIMA (46)

220
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,600
This is relentless!

221
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,370
-That looks rough.
-Climb-- I mean, make him fall.

222
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,800
-We should be rooting for him to fall.
-There's no time left.

223
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,070
20 SECONDS REMAINING

224
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,370
EGA-CHANNEL STAFF
THE BRIEF TROUPE L

225
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,430
-The Brief Troupe?
-He's on the staff at Ega-Channel.

226
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,730
-The Brief Troupe, okay.
-You got this.

227
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,030
That would be me, too.

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,900
10 SECONDS REMAINING

229
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,800
Go, keep going!

230
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,370
END OF BATTLE

231
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,170
They didn't make it.

232
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,600
TWO DROPOUTS

233
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,930
Unfortunately,
two warriors are out of the race.

234
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,030
-Only two? Most of them made it.
-Sadly, the army couldn't save everyone.

235
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,870
-You do judo?
-Aikido.

236
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,230
I'll throw them over my shoulder
on my way out.

237
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,930
-Could you just imagine that you did?
-I have, about five times.

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,330
Yes!

239
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Hurrah!

240
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,570
And 111 warriors made it
over The Border Wall.

241
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,570
The road up ahead forks
towards future battles.

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,730
Time to head to the next fortress,
fearless army!

243
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,570
-Wow, awesome.
-What do you think so far, Princess?

244
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,100
-I got so excited.
-Me, too.

245
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,330
Seeing all of them trying their best.

246
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,370
-But only two people failed?
-We apologize for that.

247
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,970
-Most people are able to beat this level.
-I see.

248
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,130
-They tend to help each other as well.
-So it's a team event.

249
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,400
Right, so if you fail this event,
it might mean that no one likes you.

250
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,800
Those two are unpopular?

251
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,330
Shall we get to know
some of the most promising warriors?

252
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,830
We need to keep an eye
on this Sasuke Jr. fellow.

253
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,130
He's incredible.

254
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,100
The show, Sasuke, is as popular
as Takeshi's Castle worldwide.

255
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,370
And Sasuke Jr. has made a name
for himself as a legend.

256
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,900
-And now he's after Takeshi's Castle.
-Will we be okay?

257
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,730
-He's not to be underestimated.
-He's dangerous.

258
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,970
-Let's see what the AI count has to say.
-Okay.

259
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,730
What a great battle.

260
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,870
I feel that too many of them
have made it through this first battle.

261
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,870
But as you mentioned earlier,

262
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,470
comics that are unpopular here
don't make it in showbiz either.

263
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,070
Comedy is the business of serving people,

264
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,300
and the same can be said
for entrepreneurship.

265
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,830
It might be presumptuous to say this,

266
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,770
but people really show you
who they are in these situations.

267
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,270
-What wise words.
-We're in the business of people.

268
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,630
No one actually hates those two.

269
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,600
-Thank you, let's chat again soon.
-I look forward to it.

270
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,870
We do too.

271
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,370
-Today's Count Takeshi is kind.
-He is.

272
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,430
This episode, we have a new game
called Block Block.

273
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,670
WALK OVER ROTATING SHAPES
TO MAKE IT TO THE OTHER SIDE

274
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,670
What kind of game?

275
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,600
Apparently, we had to have

276
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,700
a custom motor made overseas
for this game.

277
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,500
-What?
-It's a motor that doesn't exist

278
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,670
in Japan and it had to be
custom ordered for this game.

279
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,230
We went overseas to make that happen.

280
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,670
That was the only way?

281
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,230
-It must be enormous.
-I guess.

282
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,400
Well then, let's have a look
at Block Block.

283
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,400
A completely new game that required
a special order of gigantic motors.

284
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,200
Not even Captain Tani could imagine
a game like this. What will happen?

285
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,770
Army, wonderful job making it over
The Border Wall.

286
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,100
You did it.

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,500
-"You did it."
-The battle ahead will be merciless.

288
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,270
This next game is called Block Block.

289
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,700
-That's huge. What's the scale?
-It's like nothing we've seen before.

290
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,330
I don't know anything about this.

291
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,570
Because Block Block is a new game
that was recently developed.

292
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,000
-I've never seen it.
-Well, it's brand new.

293
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,770
So I can't tell you much about it.

294
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,070
-They seem like they're having fun.
-But I have faith in you.

295
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,900
You're my most trustworthy warriors
and I hope

296
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,130
-you'll win and keep advancing.
-There are lots of women.

297
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,130
Understood?

298
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,630
BLOCK BLOCK
DIFFICULTY RATING: 89%

299
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,400
This will be interesting.

300
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:54,270
Hello, we, Tokyo Hoteison,
will be reporting on Block Block.

301
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,530
It's the same microphone
as Nobuaki Kakuda.

303
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,270

304
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,970
IDOL CAFE ATTENDANT
YOYO

305
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,000
Here I go. This is scary!

306
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,400
That's huge.

307
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,000
-That's how big they are?
-So huge.

308
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,070
-It looks like a video game.
-I see why we needed special motors.

309
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,700
JUMP ACROSS ROTATING BLOCKS
AND GET TO THE OTHER SIDE

310
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,130
I'm scared!

311
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,670
-Impossible.
-It's too difficult.

312
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,570
It rotates toward you,
so you have to use momentum.

313
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,670
-That timing was off.
-You're right.

314
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,170
No, wrong timing.

315
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,770
-Totally wrong timing.
-Shouldn't have jumped then.

316
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,770
SHIMANE MOM FRIENDS GROUP
YOKO FUNAKOSHI (47)

317
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,930
-I'll do my best.
-The Moms Friends Group.

318
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,300
No, not there.

319
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,070
-You'll fall there.
-Totally wrong again.

320
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,730
-You're doing great.
-It's huge.

321
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,870
It must be hard to gauge from up there.

322
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,770
SILVER JEWELRY DESIGNER
HITOSHI KANNO (37)

323
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,930
Here I go.

324
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,030
Good luck.

325
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,970
-He makes silver jewelry.
-You got this. The timing is crucial.

326
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,630
-Timing-- wow.
-Wow. Run, run.

327
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,800
This is too hard.

328
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,970
-This is tough.
-He hit his head.

329
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,730
The warrior is here to get revenge.

330
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,200
HERE TO AVENGE HIS FATHER
KENGO EZAKI (40)

331
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,570
My father, Tatsunori, failed
the Strait of Gibraltar 34 years ago.

332
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,300
-Your father competed? He did?
-Yes, that's correct.

333
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,100
-I've come to avenge my father.
-I see.

334
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,900
-What a story.
-Ezaki's father competed

335
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,870
-at Takeshi's Castle 34 years ago.
-They look like twins.

336
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,100
Sadly, he was disqualified
at the Strait of Gibraltar.

337
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,100
So he fell in the net.

338
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,800
He'll compete wearing
the same festival robe

339
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,600
-that his father wore back then.
-Amazing.

340
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,030
We're the best. Ezaki family is on fire.

341
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,930
-You got this!
-Go, Dad!

342
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,130
-Be careful.
-Nice.

343
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,070
-Not so soon...
-But he's holding on.

344
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,730
-This is too complex.
-That's the trickiest part of it.

345
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,930
It's not a matter
of lack of determination.

346
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,730
Ezaki daringly faced the challenge
to avenge his father.

347
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,270
He was met with a frustrating fall
without making it to Strait of Gibraltar.

348
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,030
-Father and son alike.
-Next up...

349
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,670
OTTER FAIRY
CHIITAN

350
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,830
Chiitan, who fought valiantly
at Ueda Castle, is back for another round.

351
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,730
OTTER FAIRY
CHIITAN (ETERNALLY 0 YEARS OLD)

352
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,330
-You got this.
-Good luck, Chiitan. Go.

353
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,370
-Go, fairy Chiitan!
-No, pull them out.

354
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,870
-That's unsafe. This is dire.
-She's rushing. Pull her out quickly.

355
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,870
We will rescue Chiitan within seconds.

356
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,200
-You got this, keep going. They had that.
-Our next challenger is...

357
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,900
I don't think anyone will make it.

358
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,930
EX OLYMPIAN FIGURE SKATER
NARUMI TAKAHASHI

359
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,370
Narumi is a bona fide athlete
and doubles skater,

360
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,900
who represented Japan
in the 2014 Winter Olympics.

361
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:53,170
With friends from the same talent agency
in tow, she's stepping up to battle.

362
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,430
-Good luck. Make us proud.
-Sure. See you.

363
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,700
-Takahashi is such a bubbly personality.
-You're right, she's lively.

364
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,970
An Olympian is here to grace
the Takeshi's Castle stage. Yay!

365
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,900
-That's Sunshine Ikezaki's bit.
-You're right.

366
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,500
Charge!

367
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,130
-She looks so tiny.
-She's very calm.

368
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,230
-She must have strong legs. Go, go!
-I agree.

369
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,800
-You got it, stay calm. She's got this.
-That's how you do it.

370
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,830
-She waits for the moment.
-She's calm.

371
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,830
-Nice.
-She's got it. Go on, climb up!

372
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,770
-That was close.
-That block is impossible.

373
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,770
-That's really difficult.
-You can't beat it.

374
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,430
-An Olympian can't even do it.
-There's no way.

375
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,030
She was amazingly calm though.

376
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,930
Leave it to an Olympian to jump
gracefully onto the blocks.

377
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,970
But, even she struggled to get her leg
over this block and failed.

378
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,470
Takahashi could not beat the game.

379
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,770
Well, I didn't make it...

380
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,100
SOCHI OLYMPIC PAIR SKATER
NARUMI TAKAHASHI (30)

381
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,700
But, how did I do?

382
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,970
-Her eyes look wild.
-Well, what can I say...

383
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,700
The next group brought their whole gang.

384
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,670
-Nice to meet you.
-They're from Ega-Channel.

385
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,270
STAFF FROM A YOUTUBE FAVORITE
EGA-CHANNEL

386
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,930

387
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000

388

BRIEF TROUPE M

390
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,200
You can do it!

391
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,970
The Brief Troupe are accustomed to putting

392
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,470
their bodies to the test
on their YouTube channel.

393
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,730
Hook your leg. Close but no cigar.

394
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,370
They displayed
surprisingly high physical abilities,

395
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,500
but were unable to get over the hurdle
of the blue plus sign.

396
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,830
You can't get a leg over it.

397
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,030
The following group is also a team act.

398
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,430
-What's that?
-This is a postal mark.

399
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,130
These five colleagues are best buds

400
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,730
-from the postal service in Futtsu, Chiba.
-They're close.

401
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,570
We're the most concerned about this guy.

402
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,300
FUTTSU POST OFFICE TEAM
TAKAO UCHIYAMA (42)

403
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,200
Look at this chubby, indulgent body.

404
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,770
Turn to the right and show them.

405
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,430
-He's sucking in his stomach.
-Stop trying to look good.

406
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,930
-Here I go.
-Good luck!

407
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,330
Get it, Ucchi. Come on, Takao Uchiyama!

408
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,030
-Here's comes Uchiyama.
-He's a big guy.

409
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,070
-No, Uchiyama...
-He's got bad knees.

410
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,800
-Too soon.
-I think he's got bad knees.

411
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,470
If you lose balance there,
you're done for.

412
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,130
-That's the wrong timing.
-They're having so much fun.

413
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,430
Dummy. What are you good for?

414
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,970
-He swallowed some water.
-He's in a rut.

415
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,130
He drank from the spring
of Mt. Midoriyama.

FUTTSU POST OFFICE TEAM
SHUNSUKE KANEKO (40)

417
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,470
-Good luck, Kaneko.
-Stay calm.

418
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,430
-Go, go, go.
-Run.

419
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,970
-Great!
-But he won't make it from there.

420
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,170
Oh no, oh no...

421
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,970
This is a difficult game.

422
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,000
-No one can get over the plus sign.
-It's an impossible task.

423
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,600
What's the best tactic?

424
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,970
They're correct,
the toughest challenge of Block Block

425
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,330
is trying to get over this blue plus sign.

426
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,430
Warriors fail one after the other,

427
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,770
unable to figure out how to conquer
this blue plus sign.

439
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,600
It was cool, bro.

440
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,870
Your Japanese is so colloquial.

441
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,670
As the warriors continue to struggle,
here comes our next hero.

442
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,300
Jordan used to watch
Takeshi's Castle while in America.

443
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,000
He's hoping to win this game with legs
that were strengthened from surfing.

00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,330
-What did he say? Kawa Burger?
-I'm not sure.

446
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,700
Don't do it that way.

447
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,670
Whoa, he did it.

448
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,570
-That requires strength.
-Wow.

449
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,500
-He might make it.
-Amazing.

450
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,370
-He made it.
-Wow!

451
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,970
-He might make he passed the plus sign.
-He's got this.

452
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,400
Wow.

453
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,430
-What happened?
-He didn't make it.

454
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,130
-He fell slowly. So slow.
-Impressive though.

455
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,730
He conquered the plus sign.
They end up figuring it out eventually.

456
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Slowly but surely.

457
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,670
He's still hanging on.

458
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,500
-I failed.
-But you were close.

459
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,000
Though he couldn't complete the challenge,

460
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,830
Jordan made it past the blue plus sign
that was giving everyone problems.

461
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,000
It's an accomplishment
to make it that far.

462
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,670
-From the blue shape to the star...
-Some promising faces step up to the task.

463
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:09,170
Coming to test their astounding
physical abilities at Takeshi's Castle...

464
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,000
-Look at that endurance.
-...are the competitors from Sasuke,

465
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,300
hoping to make their mark
as the toughest army

466
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,530
-at Takeshi's Castle.
-They're so cool.

467
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,470
Here's the first challenger from Sasuke.

468
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,600
In Sasuke, we're able to do prior research
and face the challenge with a plan,

469
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,630
but that's not an option here
and we only have one shot.

470
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,670
So I'm a bit nervous.

471
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,570
CAR DESIGNER
NAOYUKI ARAKI (29)

472
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,070
First up is Naoyuki Araki,
who is a car designer

473
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,170
and has competed in Sasuke seven times.

474
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,870
As a car designer,
I've already pictured the path to victory.

475
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,570
Araki, we're counting on you!

476
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,070
Nice. You got it.

477
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,230
-Okay, nice.
-Keep it going.

478
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,130
-A car designer?
-Great jump.

479
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,470
-He's doing great.
-Good job.

480
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,270
-Has he figured it out?
-He's really fast.

481
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,330
-Look at him go.
-Wow, Araki.

482
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,400
-He keeps rolling.
-You got this.

483
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,430
-Come on, you got this.
-Oh, no, he's lagging.

484
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,070
-Oh, no...
-There he goes.

485
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,000
-That was amazing.
-He really tried.

486
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,670
-He was persistent.
-That's Sasuke.

487
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,030
-Seriously?
-The Sasuke team does good work.

488
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,800
For taking on this challenge
and giving it his all,

489
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,130
Araki will receive
the Fighting Spirit Award

490
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,430
and move onto the next stage.

491
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,030
We have the Fighting Spirit Award,

492
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,000
and it allows you to move onto

493
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,070
-the next stage even if you fail.
-I see.

494

KITAGAWA ELECTRONICS MANAGER
MASASHI HIOKI (41)

495
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,200
Our next challenger is...

496
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,500
-If I can do it, you can definitely do it.
-Okay.

497
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,670
You can count on Masashi Hioki to show you
how things are done in Sasuke.

498
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,130
He works as an electrician,

499
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,000
and as a father of three,
he is one of the best dads in Sasuke.

500
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,000
-Ready? Let's go!
-Once one person succeeds, it gets easier.

501
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,230
-How cute, he brought his family.
-They're always at his contests.

502
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,370
-So cute.
-That's a big family.

503
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,570
Charge!

504
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,200
-The cheerleaders are loud.
-You got this.

505
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,330
Those are soft like a sponge.

506
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,100
Nice, he might make it.

507
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,530
-He's got the touch. He's so calm.
-Hioki is great.

508
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,930
-He doesn't waste any energy.
-Right.

509
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,500
-Yamada seemed rushed.
-There he goes. He's got it.

510
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,670
He made it past the plus sign hurdle
in a breeze.

511
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,800
All that's left is to get over the star.

512
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,330
-Go! He can do it!
-Oh, no. Will he make it?

513
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,670
He made it! He did it!

514
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,500
He did it, awesome.

515
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,400
Great job, Hioki.

516
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,430
-He's a beast.
-He lives up to his reputation.

517
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,170
-Team Sasuke is impressive.
-They aren't your average Joes.

518
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,670
I did it. I'm ecstatic!

519
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,870
After calmly jumping past
the toughest shape in the lot,

520
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,970
he stayed grounded and raced
to the finish line in one fell swoop.

521
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,530
-Incredible.
-Hioki from Team Sasuke

522
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
is officially the first warrior
to beat Block Block.

523
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,170
-I did it.
-Yay!

524
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,230
-Wasn't that cool?
-It's was totally wild.

525
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,100
Congratulations, you did it!

526
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,800
-So cute.
-But then they wiped it off.

527
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:38,830
Following this success,
Team Sasuke continued to conquer.

528
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:44,000
Tada, a civil officer in Yamagata,
finished the course in the shortest time.

529
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,900
Wow.

530
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,070
Sato, the president of
the Japan Parkour Association followed.

531
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,830
The parkour guys would do it.

532
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,700
Kawaguchi from Team Sasuke
also completed the course,

533
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,930
-to add up to the team's multiple wins.
-Amazing.

534
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,800
Can they keep up this momentum?
Here's our last competitor.

535
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,530
I've beat Sasuke and now
I've come for Takeshi's Castle.

536
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,500
-Here he comes.
-It's that guy.

537
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,070
The man who conquered Sasuke twice,

538
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,300
it's Yusuke Morimoto aka Sasuke Jr.

539
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,930
He'll close out this event and hopefully
bring Team Sasuke closer to victory.

540
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,800
Beginning now, I, Shinya Sugiyama,
will be reporting on this event.

541
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,430
-He's dangerous.
-These blocks

542
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,270
appeared at the castle
as if came out from a video game.

543
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,430
Here to conquer it
is two-time Sasuke champion,

544
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,870
and an active competitor,
30-year-old, Yusuke Morimoto.

545
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,000
Here I go.

546
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,070
All right, you got this.

547
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,200
His teammates are voicing their support.

548
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,100
The event has begun for Sasuke Jr,
the undefeated champion.

549
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,130
From the red circle to the green triangle.

550
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,330
-He's unperturbed.
-Over the peak and onto the next.

551
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,600
And he jumps onto the blue plus sign.

552
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,170
It's no big deal for him.

553
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,330
He remains calm.
And next, he'll go for the yellow star.

554
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,370
-Taking no time to rest.
-Look at that speed.

555
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:11,370
Finishing like an action hero.
Conquering it in no time.

556
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,530
He completed Block Block in 22.08 seconds.

557
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,700
He barely broke a sweat.

558
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:20,470
Will Yusuke Morimoto be able
to conquer all of Takeshi's Castle?

559
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,330
Wow.

560
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,130
Including the award winner,
six warriors make it past this stage,

561
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,270
marking an overwhelming victory
for Team Sasuke.

562
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,870
Let's ride this momentum
and take down Naomi Castle.

563
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,800
So five players completed the task
and one received an award.

564
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,830
Team Sasuke are tough opponents,
aren't they, Princess?

565
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,630
You're right.

566
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,830
Hioki created a winning streak
by completing it first.

567
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,730
Once one person makes it, they all start
to figure out how to beat the game.

568
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Everyone seems to be having so much fun.

569
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,070
-I liked that, too.
-They all seem to be.

570
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,770
They just seem elated to be there.

571
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:04,300
The Postal Service Team was so excited,
I barely understood what they said.

572
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:09,030
That guy was great.
I wish I knew how he got so confident.

573
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,330
-His energy was--
-He was on high octane.

574
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,100
The next game is called
The Daruma Falls Down.

575
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,970
MAKE IT THROUGH A MAZE WHILE
WEARING A DARUMA SUIT

576
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,170
A little birdie told me
that this game might be problematic.

577
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,670
-Problematic? In what way?
-How do you mean?

578
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,300
We have a warrior
that's a bit of a handful?

579
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,370
-How bad?
-Sounds scary. What do you mean?

580
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,630
We'll now catch up with the army
that went down the other fork in the road.

581
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,630
A fan favorite at Takeshi's Castle,
The Daruma Falls Down.

582
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,670
YOSHICHI SHIMADA

583
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,330
Back in the day, Shimada would play
the playground bully in this event.

584
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,370
But who will be our antagonist this time?

585
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,300
And what do they mean by "problematic"?

586
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,000
The Daruma fell down.

587
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,900
THE DARUMA FALLS DOWN
DIFFICULTY RATING: 90%

588
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,400
COMIC DUO SANSHIRO
HIRONOBU KOMIYA &amp; SHUJI AIDA

589
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,500
Let's now hear from some of our warriors.

590
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,630
-How does the costume feel?
-It's heavier than I thought.

591
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,270
-It's heavy.
-How are you with the heat?

592
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,530
-It's hot in here.
-Are you ready to get going?

593
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,200
-So you're telling us to hurry up.
-Seems like it.

594
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,100
-How do you think you'll do?
-I think I'll do well.

595
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:28,000
-Who did you bring with you today?
-My old cheerleading buddies.

596
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,470
-Hey, everyone. Are you ready?
-They seem tenacious.

597
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,370
FILMED IN AUGUST

598
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,300
It seems like you want me to move on.

599
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,630
-Those outfits seem uncomfortable.
-Let's see

600
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,200
what awaits in the battle ahead.

601
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,600
-Stay tuned.
-We're Sanshiro, the reporters.

602
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,000
Why did he wait to say that?

603
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,030
Let's see who in Takeshi's army
will be leading the defensive team.

604
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,200
Who will it be?

605
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,330
EX FREESTYLE WRESTLER
KYOKO HAMAGUCHI

606
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,470
It's Kyoko Hamaguchi.

607
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,600
-Kyoko!
-Are you ready?

608
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,930
Is she playing a deranged character
or is that how she actually is?

609
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,570
Fighting spirit, fighting spirit!

610
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,730
Fighting spirit, fighting spirit!

611
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Fighting spirit!

612
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,630
-What is she doing?
-Let's go!

613
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,730
-Is this her usual shtick?
-I believe so.

614
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,100
THE FIRST ROUND

615
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,800
The first teams to take on the daruma are,

616
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,330
ex-cheerleaders from
Ritsumeikan University,

617
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,070
and the Mom Friends Group, Kamezu,
for a total of 10 warriors.

618
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,730
-Let's begin.
-Okay.

619
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,730
Try to get to the other side
without tripping.

620
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,000
Players can move when the target
has their back turned.

621
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,870
The daruma...

622
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,400
-fell down.
-Everyone looks so cute.

623
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,330
Oh, no...

624
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,270
FAILED

625
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,570
-Number one, you're out.
-It's the girl they interviewed.

626
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,300
The army lost one warrior,
but continues their steady pace.

627
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,870
They're getting pretty close.

628
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,830
There are still so many daruma left.

629
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,370
-Let's keep going. The daruma...
-What is happening?

630
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,800
-Has fall...
-Look, there are obstacles, too.

631
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,030
-You're right.
-Oh, I see them now.

632
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,370
-Fallen down.
-Oh, no.

633
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,730
-You can't step there. She moved.
-You're out!

634
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,400
-She's out?
-You fail if the target sees you moving.

635
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,270
-The daruma has...
-This is pretty demanding.

636
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,200
-It must be quite hard.
-I think so.

637
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,930
-This takes endurance.
-Fallen... down!

638
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,330
They're in each other's way.

639
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,100
FAILED

640
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,800
-No, there she goes.
-She can't stop.

641
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,970
So cute.

642
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,230
-You can't help yourself up.
-Look how far she went.

643
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,200
The daruma has fallen down.

644
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,900
FAILED

645
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,870
MOM FRIENDS GROUP
ROCCO

646
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,830
Oh, no.

647
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,300
-The daruma has...
-Are those rubber balls on the ground?

648
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,530
FAILED

649
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,800
-There she goes.
-She didn't see the obstacle.

650
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,000
Fallen down!

651
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,430
MOM FRIENDS GROUP
NICCO

652
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,700
-Nicco is out.
-How many people are left?

653
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,430
-The daruma has...
-The obstacles must be really challenging.

654
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,270
-Number two is pretty close. You got this.
-Fallen down.

655
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,430
-Nice.
-Well done.

656
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,730
-What's this?
-Are we having a stare down?

657
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,770
-What's happening?
-Let's see if I can make you laugh.

658
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,270
Hi! All right.

659
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,430
-I'm tickled.
-That isn't in the rule book.

660
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,370
-The daruma...
-Will our warriors

661
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:39,630
be able to withstand
Hamaguchi's stare downs?

662
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,700
Fallen down.

663
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,300
-She's so close.
-Can she resist laughing?

664
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,270
-That's unfair.
-Look away.

665
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,730
Somehow, Fujitaka resists laughing.

666
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
The daruma has fallen down!

667
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,270
Daruma number two wins!

668
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,900
FORMER RITSUMEIKAN CHEERLEADER
HARUNA FUJITAKA (24)

669
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,770
FORMER RITSUMEIKAN CHEERLEADER
DAISUKE HIRANO (31)

670
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,300
Three warriors win the game
following the first win.

671
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,630
MOM FRIENDS GROUP
ITSUKO &amp; IKKO

672
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,030
This is absolutely a win.

673
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,930
-There's no denying it.
-Wasn't she moving?

674
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,230
We're on a roll with the first round,
four warriors have won.

675
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,470
Meanwhile, dark storms were brewing

676
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,830
-in Takeshi's Castle.
-What's at the castle?

677
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,070
Hey, Hamaguchi.

678
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,770
Why are you being so easy on the army?

679
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,130
You better crack down on them.

680
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,530
TAKESHI'S CASTLE IS FUMING!

681
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,830
The Castle is displeased and ready
to bring turmoil upon the battlefield.

682
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,300
The second round.

683
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,470
SON-IN-LAW OF A FORMER PRODUCER
KAZUSHI KATAKURA (40)

684
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,870
Katakura's father-in-law
is a former producer of Takeshi's Castle.

685
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,600
TAKESHI'S CASTLE MUSEUM ADMINISTRATOR
SATOSHI MAEJIMA (35)

686
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,600
And Maejima, the administrator
of Takeshi's Castle museum.

687
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,930
We also have
the Nakamise Barbaros Samba Team,

688
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,300
who is the reigning champion for
the most wins at Asakusa Samba Carnival.

689
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,300
How sexy.

690
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:57,430
Will their samba toned legs
carry them to victory?

691
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,800
The daruma has...

692
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,970
-Look at their cute head ornaments.
-Fallen down.

693
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,800
Number nine and four, you're out.

694
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,900
FAILED

695
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,030
-What? So strict.
-It's so sudden, too.

696
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,500
-Only the head ornament moved.
-What moved?

697
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,330
Following Takeshi's orders,
Hamaguchi makes the rules stricter.

698
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,000
But perhaps her barometer is too harsh.

699
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,630
Any slight movement will now
leave you disqualified.

700
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,400
-Are you serious? They bumped into me.
-This is too strict.

701
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,570
NAKAMISE BARBAROS SAMBA TEAM
TARO TSURUMI (43) &amp; NOBUE NASHIRO (53)

702
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:34,300
The daruma has... fallen... down.

703
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,130
-Number one, you're out.
-What? That's too harsh.

704
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
-This is all too sudden.
-Did they move?

705
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,400
NAKAMISE BARBAROS SAMBA TEAM
SATOMI HIRANO (45)

706
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,430
The warriors start dropping like flies

707
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,270
due to Hamaguchi's unreasonable ruling.

708
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,570
NAKAMISE BARBAROS SAMBA TEAM
NAOKO MINE (36)

709
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,670
She's strict.

710
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,200
This is so frustrating.

711
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,730
When finally,
Hamaguchi starts to run out of control.

712
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,930
What's happening?

713
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,670
-It's a samba rhythm.
-She's trying to get them to dance.

714
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:10,470
-Samba!
-Oh, no, they're moving.

715
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,570
-Don't move.
-Don't do it.

716
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,800
No. She's coming for you!

717
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:21,170
Samba! Sanshiro, you hear me? He's out.

718
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,170
FAILED

719
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,430
-Is this really happening?
-This is chaos.

720
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,200
-What? Can a battle be this dumb?
-Where is the logic?

721
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,600
NAKAMISE BARBAROS SAMBA TEAM
TAKE KAMIJO (43)

722
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,870
Using the rhythm of samba
to get people to move,

723
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,200
-Hamaguchi has become reckless.
-She's gone rogue.

724
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,800
THE SECOND ROUND
EVERYONE FAILED

725
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,330
-I'm happy.
-Thanks to Hamaguchi,

726
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,200
not a single warrior
made it through the round.

727
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,830
What were you thinking?

728
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,130
-I couldn't resist dancing.
-You couldn't resist?

729
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,830
Have you no self-control?

730
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,330
Well, Kyoko has good rhythm.

731
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,630
THE ARMY THAT PRIDES ITSELF
ON PHYSICAL STRENGTH

732
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,430
Hamaguchi didn't stop there.

733
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,300
One after another, these shining athletes
were caught in her schemes.

734
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,670
Off you go.

735
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,600
ADVENTURE RACER
JUNKO TOKUMOTO (34)

736
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,800
2022 WORLD KARATE CHAMPION
HOTAKA YOSHIZAWA (23)

737
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,200
SPARTAN RACER
RYUTARO AIHARA (27)

738
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,430
Even Aihara, who cleared the Border Wall
at top speed, was no match for her.

739
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,770
-And at last, the final round.
-They have their work cut out for them.

740
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,970
Coming up, we have the Pro Wrestlers Team

741
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,830
and the Young CEOs Team,
making a total of ten warriors.

742
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,070
They're the "young" CEOs?

743
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,830
The daruma has fallen down.

744
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,100
-In the back. That was obvious.
-Number eight, you're out.

745
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,300
As expected.

746
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,670
RECRUITING COMPANY CEO
RYOHEI SAKURAGI (44)

747
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,900
There you go.

748
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,370
Number five, you're out.

749
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,600
FAILED

750
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,600
This is very strict.

751
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,270
PRO WRESTLER
TOMOKI HATANO (24)

752
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,000
Are you out if you get bumped into?

753
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,030
-He can't stay?
-What?

754
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,600
-He's trying to resist.
-Number six.

755
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,030
IT COMPANY CEO
YASUYUKI HATTORI (46)

756
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,170
He can't be out yet.

757
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,970
FAILED

758
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,970
-No way!
-This isn't good.

759
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,530
Hang on. That's unfair.

760
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,000
-It's too strict.
-The daruma...

761
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,430
Is the army destined
for a merciless fate again?

762
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,000
One man decides to go out on a limb
with an idea.

763
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,330
...has fallen.

764
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,700
Something is fishy.
If you're plotting something,

765
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
I won't let anything slide
in this next round.

766
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,400
CONSULTING COMPANY CEO
RYOTA TSUJIMURA (41)

767
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:27,870
-I saw you wink at me.
-Did he?

768
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,670
-I see.
-You know what my Achilles' heel is.

769
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,870
-What's that?
-That's your weakness?

770
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,830
You're saying you can't resist a wink?

771
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,570
-Of course, I can't.
-Of course? Look at her.

772
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,600
Oh, dear.

773
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,730
-Look, she's becoming bashful.
-Oh, God.

774
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,730
Please do that again.

775
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,830
Look at her fidget.

776
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,130
-Focus, Hamaguchi.
-So cute.

777
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,530
She is a woman after all.

778
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,470
Her expression is so cute.

779
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,730
The daruma has... fallen down.

780
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Number seven...

781
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,500
-Wait a second.
-He blew a kiss.

782
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,530
I'll let it slide.

783
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,270
-She's suddenly so girly.
-Only this time, okay?

784
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,630
-What's happening?
-The samba team will be mad.

785
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,570
-His flirtation trick worked like a charm.
-Daruma...

786
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,400
Now is the time to attack.

787
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,100
...has fallen down.

788
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:29,230
Here we go.
The daruma has... fallen down.

789
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,900
-He moved.
-He definitely did.

790
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,630
-Go! You got this.
-What's the verdict?

791
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,200
Congratulations.

792
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,370
You made it.

793
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,970
-Congrats?
-He moved though.

794
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,230
What's happening?

795
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,630
Tsujimura has clearly moving
when Hamaguchi turned around...

796
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,700
He would've been disqualified
in previous rounds.

797
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,300
But he receives special treatment
and wins.

798
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:57,070
I'm frustrated but that was a great round.

799
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,970
-What was that?
-Congratulations!

800
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,670
-Okay, boss.
-That wink saved you.

801
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,400
No need to charm the cameras now.

802
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,700
Hamaguchi did seem lonely
as you made it closer to the finish line.

803
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,530
-I felt lonely too.
-Shut up.

804
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,570
SEVEN WARRIORS REMAIN

805
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:21,430
Including the Fighting Spirit Award
recipients, seven warriors made the cut.

806
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,170
Finally, it's time
to bring down Naomi Castle!

807
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,930
Princess, what did you think?

808
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,970
-Hamaguchi was completely off the rails.
-I agree.

809
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,500
When she was strict, it was unreasonable.

810
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,330
When she wasn't, it was child's play.

811
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,900
Are we fine with how this game went?

812
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,000
I think this is the flavor
of Takeshi's Castle.

813
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,230
Okay, I see.

814
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,800
-Now, Princess.
-Yes.

815
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,700
-You've eliminated many warriors so far.
-You're right.

816
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,530
We feel bad for the army.

817
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,400
And we'd like to make up
for Hamaguchi's behavior.

818
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,700
We feel bad, so we're going
to host consolation games.

819
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,900
-I see.
-Would that be all right with you?

820
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,270
Of course. The more enemies, the merrier.

821
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,130
-I agree,
-At this stage,

822
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,770
we should help them out a little.

823
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,530
Let's take a look
at the consolation games.

824
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:16,100
Warriors who failed in battle
are randomly divided into three groups.

825
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:21,130
If they can complete a consolation game,
they get to return to the main battle.

826
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,070
-Yamamoto...
-Yes, Shingo Yamamoto, from Block Block.

827
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,600
You'll be competing in
You can't save the ball from 4 p.m.

828
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,430
-Un-ball-livable?
-Yes.

829
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,670
THE CONSOLATION GAMES

830
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,430
Un-ball-livable?

831
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,930
-Hope you're watching, Egashira.
-It's the Brief Troupe. Go.

832
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,370
EGA-CHANNEL STAFF
THE BRIEF TROUPE L

833
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,870
-You got this. Hurry, hurry.
-You won't make it at that speed.

834
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,870
He's running behind.

835
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,230
The ball is right there. He might make it.

836
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,600
-That was pointless.
-He's dived on his own will.

837
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,430
He was too slow on the steps.

838
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,530
SLIP-AND-SLIDE QUIZ

839
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,770
Then there's this game.

840
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,930
SAMURAI ROCK ORCHESTRA
YUME MASUDA (27)

841
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,230
I'll dodge the pond
and join my team in battle.

842
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,100
What kind of kiss is a "French kiss"?

843
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,570
-You got this.
-A, a light kiss.

844
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,770
That was the question?

845
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:16,570
-B, a passionate kiss.
-She's walking. I thought she might slide.

846
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:20,470
-That seems dangerous.
-Isn't it easier to slide down?

847
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,730
-She's agile.
-So flexible.

848
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,600
-Go.
-Oh no.

849
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,170
CORRECT ANSWER
B: A PASSIONATE KISS

850
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,470
-B is correct.
-Really?

851
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:33,770
-I thought it meant a light kiss.
-That was a tricky quiz.

852
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,470
EX NADESHIKO LEAGUE PLAYER
RAIMU SENGOKU (25)

853
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,100
Sengoku, who is an ex pro football player,
had to face a sumo wrestler.

854
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,800
-I don't like this.
-You got this.

855
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:46,700
Ready, start!

856
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,930
Takeshi's army wins.

857
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,470
She flew into the pond making
a dynamic arc. And for her bravery,

858
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,530
she earns the Fighting Spirit Award.

859
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,370
Right, this way.

860
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,330
Go right. To the right.

861
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,000
Nice teamwork.

862
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,470
Go right.

863
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,700
She's got this.

864
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,930
-Too bad.
-The ball has to stay in. It bounced.

865
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,130
-Wasn't that really close though?
-What a great shot.

866
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,670
I'll win this Slip-and-Slide Quiz.

867
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:22,600
SPARTAN RACER
MEGUMI TAKAGI (41)

868
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:26,170
Which object's name
originates from English?

869
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,370
A, Loofah. B, Okra.

870
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,730
Is it loofah? That's dangerous.

871
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:38,000
-How silly, she hit the middle pole.
-And her answer is wrong.

872
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,170
CORRECT ANSWER
B: OKRA

873
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:43,270
Don't they kind of look like trash
coming through a garbage chute?

874
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,200
That spout at the very end? Yeah.

875
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,170
I'll make it back to battle,
no matter what.

876
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,100
POSTAL WORKER THAT DRANK THE POND WATER
TAKAO UCHIYAMA (42)

877
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,070
-It's coming down the center.
-The center!

878
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,570
Now to the left. The left!

879
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,370
You dummy. What a dummy.

880
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,300

IDOL CAFE ATTENDANT
YOYO

891
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,070
RETURN TO THE FRONT

892
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,000
-I pulled C.
-He's from the postal team.

893
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,700
TAKESHI'S ARMY - PRO WRESTLER
TOMOAKI HONMA

894
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,870
Never fear. You got this.

895
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,200
Ready, go!

896
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,100
-Honma is pretty strong.
-Oh, no.

897
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,130
-Oh, no, he slipped. Honma!
-This is unexpected.

898
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,570
-Resist the fall.
-Honma. No way!

899
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,770
The army wins!

900
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,930
-Why did we hire you for?
-He slipped.

901
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,770
RETURN TO THE FRONT

902
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,200
-Honma!
-He was so cute.

903
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,970
A pro wrestler shouldn't lose
in a straightforward battle like that.

904
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,130
-He totally slipped.
-He's not very loud,

905
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,530
so I had no clue what he was saying
as he fell into the pond.

906
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,330
WALK THE TIGHTROPE TO REACH THE OTHER SIDE

907
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,100
The next game is another fan favorite.

908
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,800
It's called the Strait of Gibraltar.

909
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:25,670
-This game is very famous.
-Is it?

910
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,770
OTTER FAIRY
CHIITAN (ETERNALLY 0 YEARS OLD)

911
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,930
Chiitan is in beast mode.

912
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,930
Chiitan!

913
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,130
Everyone is cheering for Chiitan.

914
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,700
Here we go.

915
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,900
-Well done, nice! Stay calm.
-You got this.

916
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,970
-Take this!
-Hang in there, Chiitan.

917
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
The water is aimed right at their face.

918
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,100
Slowly but surely, they're-- No!

919
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,100
Slowly but surely, she's-- No!

920
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,470
Chiitan!

921
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:11,570
-Chiitan, are you okay?
-Chiitan, thank you!

922
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,330
NEXT EPISODE,
THE FINAL BATTLE AT NAOMI CASTLE

923
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,170
Next episode,
the Strait of Gibraltar is back.

924
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,670
Can the army keep up their energy
and reach the final battle?

925
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,900
I feel bad for them.

926
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:30,400
Also...

927
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:34,800
Charge! I cheered on the army
with all my might,

928
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,400
but we lost so many warriors.

929
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,500
I've failed them.

930
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,100
Hi, Mr. Tani.

931
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:43,930
Come here.

932
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,100
Oh, it's you.
Spirit, spirit, spirit! Right?

933
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,600
You remembered me?

934
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,400
-You must stop.
-I've got you.

935
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:57,800
-What?
-I prefer this daddy.

936
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,300
CAPTAIN TANI HAS ALSO BEEN KIDNAPPED
CAN THE ARMY PREVAIL?

937
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,530
Wait! What's going on?

938
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:11,300
THE SECOND CASTLE, NAOMI CASTLE
BEHIND THE SCENES

939
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:18,830
THREE DAYS OF SHOOTING
WITH ABOUT 100 PEOPLE

940
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,530
I shaved my head
to look like Strong Kongo.

941
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,230
Here we go!

942
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,300
I'll solve this puzzle!

943
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:34,200
THE WARRIORS BECAME FAST FRIENDS

944
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,630
WITH FOLKS THEY'D JUST MET

945
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:41,030
STRENGTHENING THEIR BONDS
WHILE HELPING EACH OTHER OUT

946
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,370
I can't see it anymore.

947
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:57,230
This brings back memories.
Everything is built so well.

948
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,600
-Is it different from before?
-It's mostly the same.

949
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,470
THE CAPTAIN CONSULTED WITH THE ARMY

950
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:07,730
You have to jump on
before it straightens out again.

951
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,370
The last one was moving like this.

952
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,370
-So I think that's the trick.
-Can you even do that?

953
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,170
AND IN BETWEEN BATTLES,
THERE WAS REST AND RELAXATION

954
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,000
You're a Spartan racer?

955
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,630
It's the longest and toughest
obstacle course in the world.

956
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,600
What's an Adventure Race?

957
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:35,170
It's the toughest race in the world.

958
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,600
But the Spartan guys
said theirs was the toughest.

959
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:40,030
Adventure Racing is equally tough.

960
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,370
THE WARRIORS PERFORMED FOR EACH OTHER

961
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:54,730
AND SHARED THEIR COURAGE AND SPIRIT

962
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:59,030
AND THE BATTLES CONTINUE

963
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,070
Everyone gave it their all.

964
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:06,130
I saw the passion in your eyes
and I was touched.

965
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:11,830
Thank you.
Takeshi's Castle is the best!

966
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:13,370
Thank you!
