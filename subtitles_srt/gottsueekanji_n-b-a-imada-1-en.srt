1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,520
If I make this shot

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,600
I'll Give YOU(Ehara Yukiko) a 5 second kiss

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,000
If I don't make it...

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,000
I'll kiss Matsumoto-san

5
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,040
No way! Give me a break!

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,040
That's enough already!

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,410
That's really enough already!

8
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,860
First chew this gum, then give it to Matsumoto

9
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,320
Give it to him with your mouth.

10
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,160
Matsumoto, when you get the gum, chew it.

11
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,300
Give me a break

12
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,060
Wait! If I take a shot and make it, can this be canceled?

13
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,820
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,410
Ok, I'll do it quickly

15
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,440
During this, I can chew this gum a lot

16
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,000
Good luck with your shot!

17
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,920
Why does it go in this time?
