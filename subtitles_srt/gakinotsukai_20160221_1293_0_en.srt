Jimmy's Elementary School Days

15
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,780
I wasn't able to speak at first...

16
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,600
In elementary school there was a girl I really liked.

17
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,220
So the first word I spoke was "like".

18
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,820
And from there I began to slowly learn how to speak Japanese.

19
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,570
Don't say that like a kid returning to Japan!!

20
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,400
And about his best friend back then...

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,540
Well, he taught me how to masturbate so...

22
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,850
He's my lewd benefactor.

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,880
I've masturbated without missing a single day since the 5th grade.

24
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,130
This must be scary for the interviewer.

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,600
We also saw a different side of him while eating...

26
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,300
What kind of Western-style food do you like?

27
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,280
Food like...

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,730
Salisbury steak...

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,600
Those are some bad table manners.

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,570
What's with those manners?

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,450
You're not my mom to be lecturing me!!

32
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,890
The first half was filled with indecent answers,
how will tonight's conclusion fare!?

33
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:36,440

36
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,770
Tonight is the conclusion!!

37
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,360
Time: 8 hours 3 minutes

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,260
Jimmy Onishi's 24 Hour Long Interview

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,890
Tonight we'll start with his popular performer days.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,800
Starting as a stagehand,
Jimmy was able to begin
his life as a performer.

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,810
After high school, Jimmy started working at a Yoshimoto theater.

42
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,840
Starting at 19, he spent two years as Bonchi Osamu's apprentice.

43
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,640
What happened after you finished your apprenticeship?

44
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,460
At the time, Sanma-san was asking "Any drivers here?"

45
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,530
He wanted to hire one.

46
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,040
It just so happened I didn't have a job anymore,

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,180
so I thought, "Alright, I'll become a driver."

48
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,410
He was 22 at the time.

49
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,780
To work as Sanma's driver, he headed to Tokyo.

50
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,880
How much did you get paid back then?

51
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,520
Between 200,000 and 300,000 yen.

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,480
And how did you spend that money?

53
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,940
Mostly on sex services.

54
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,890
There he goes.

55
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,520
Well, if I had 300,000, I'd spend 280,000 yen on sex services.

56
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,240
Just spend all 300,000 yen then!!

57
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,200
By being part of "Hyokin zoku" and then "Yatteru Yatteru"

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,200
Q. How did you get your big break?

59
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:13,700
Q. At the time, what was the harshest show?

60
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,420
Owarai Ultra Quiz was the harshest.

61
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,660
Getting tossed into the ocean
from a ferry was pretty intense.

62
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,700
From how many meters?

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,700
I'd say about 2.30 meters.

64
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,440
Q. Who is your favorite Gaki member?

65
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,890
Hamada-kun.

66
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,400
He's the most normal person.

67
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,900
What the hell?

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:29,200
Q. Any memorable moments with Hosei?

69
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,000
The showdown where we hit each other.

70
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,250
Halfway into it I actually started disliking him.

71
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:40,540
Q. Would you be willing to do a Jimmy vs Hosei again?

72
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,640
Sure, I'd do it.

73
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,420
If I did it now, I wouldn't...

74
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,540
I don't think I'd get angry at him.

75
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,700
Time: 11 hours 6 minutes

76
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,660
And so, it's been 11 hours since the beginning.

77
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,440
To change the mood, we go outside for dinner.

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,300
Of course, while they're on their way...

79
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,250
What do you like to eat when you go out?

80
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,210
I like to eat sushi.

81
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,300
Do you like ramen?

82
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,320
Yeah, I like ramen.

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,420
What flavor do you prefer?

84
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,660
Soy sauce or salt flavor.

85
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,730
So you dislike miso flavor?

86
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,730
Miso flavor is...

87
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,090
It's not that I dislike it, I just don't eat it.

88
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,520
You're getting a bit angry.

89
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,260
You really don't like that interviewer.

90
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,160
We've arrived to dine on one of Jimmy's favorite meals, yakiniku.

91
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,290
The interview is going to continue.

92
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,980
Right now, I refuse to answer any more questions.

93
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,010
Really, it's been enough.

94
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,170
Here, we will delve into Jimmy's enigmatic painter days.

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,410
I want to hear this.

96
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,460
It was 1996 and Jimmy was one of the most popular comedians, but...

97
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,920
he suddenly decided to become a painter.

98
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,200
For what reason did he do it?

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,420
At the height of your popularity, why did you become a painter?

100
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,290
A painting I did for a "TV Personalities" auction

101
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,410
sold at a surprisingly high price.

102
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,340
I thought, "Was my painting alright? Wasn't it too weird?"

103
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,400
Jimmy's first masterpiece was sold for 330,000 yen.

104
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,210
His work caught the attention of a certain artist.

105
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,970
I received a letter from Okamoto Taro.

106
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,890
What did the letter say?

107
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,240
"Go beyond the canvas."

108
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,620
That was all.

109
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,660
Seriously?

110
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:41,730
So those words became a strong motivation to become a painter.

111
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,400
That's amazing.

112
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,520
It's really amazing.

113
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,720
That's right.

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,140
Was it not possible to do it along with comedy?

115
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,980
I tried doing that but...

116
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,960
I started struggling with both of them.

117
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,210
Comedy and painting could not coexist...

118
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,160
and so, when choosing which one to go for...

119
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,450
I decided to take a break from show business.

120
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,620
What did Sanma-san tell you after you made your decision?

121
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,410
"Don't listen to anyone."

122
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,660
How did you interpret Sanma-san's advice?

123
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,410
That if I listened to what others said, my individuality would die out.

124
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,770
That I shouldn't let go of the good things in me.

125
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,500
Around the time you became a painter...

126
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,060
you immigrated to Barcelona, right?

127
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,650
Why did you choose to go there?

128
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,530
You moved to Barcelona?

129
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,450
I visited an art museum in Ueno and fell in love with Picasso...

130
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,090
so I thought about visiting Picasso's birthplace, Spain.

131
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,960
And I ended up going to Barcelona.

132
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,210
That's amazing, I knew there was more
to him than just perverted stories.

133
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,340
Was it hard to adapt to the differences with Tokyo?

134
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,840
Yeah, being far from Tokyo made me feel lonely.

135
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,800
But thankfully, despite being in Spain, in Barcelona...

136
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,250
I was able to quickly find some sex services.

137
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
I knew this phrase would be back.

138
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,340
What the hell?!

139
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,800
What kind of paintings did you work on (in Barcelona)?

140
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,020
There was a nudist beach in front of where I lived so...

141
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,700
I went to the beach every day but

142
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,060
every painting would end up becoming a naked woman...

143
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,140
Even when painting animals, breasts would pop up here and there.

144
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,140
"Paradise"

145
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,140
Painted in Barcelona

146
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, that's pretty nice.

147
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,530
They would end up being really weird paintings.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,280
Nonetheless, it was a solitary life overseas.

149
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,220
The devoted person who supported him was his female manager.

150
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,580
Eventually, the two got married.

151
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,570
Jimmy chose this young woman as his lifelong partner.

152
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,600
When did you develop feelings for your manager?

153
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,480
It was when I couldn't hold it in anymore, because I couldn't go.

154
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,740
You couldn't get sex services?

155
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,960
Yes, it was too much.

156
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,700
I couldn't just tell her, "I'm going out for sex services."

157
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,660
Stop.

158
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,090
How did you romance your manager?

159
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,730
This guy is wild.

160
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,760
I pinned her down.

161
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,770
He's saying this with his mouth full.

162
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,300
I pinned her down.

163
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,380
Afterwards, while traveling all over the word,

164
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,450
Jimmy immersed himself into the world of art.

165
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,410
Going beyond the canvas, he created all kinds of highly valued works,

166
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,450
which brimmed with his individuality.

167
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,900
How much do your paintings sell for?

168
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,600
Something around this size would sell for about 2,000,000 yen.

169
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,200
How long does it take (to paint them)?

170
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,180
At least 3 months.

171
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,820
There's times when I go too frequently for sex services,

172
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,680
and I struggle to progress on the paintings so...

173
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,690
I just end up spending all my money.

174
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,730
Would you say that the reason you returned to Japan was...

175
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,540
because you couldn't earn enough money as an artist?

176
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,440
Yeah, well... I didn't keep any of my paintings for too long...

177
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,800
I couldn't do one-man exhibitions frequently.

178
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,210
If I had done more, I could have earned more money.

179
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,930
But for someone like me who...

180
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,360
spends too much in sex services,

181
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,250
it's hard to keep my paintings around.

182
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,050
You're really unbelievable!!

183
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,480
Debt Repayment

184
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,460
The reason he returned to show business was surprisingly simple.

185
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,540
Time: 12 hours 58 minutes

186
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,530
It's 11 PM and we're back at the hotel.

187
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,970
Now, we will talk about his return to show business.

188
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,930
After a long break, what did you think about your return?

189
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,330
It's very harsh.

190
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,880
You're laughing a bit.

191
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,900
Out of every job I've ever done, today is probably the worst.

192
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,930
Today's middle school and high school students...

193
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,440
probably don't know about the things you've done before.

194
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,560
Yes, they don't know anything, but...

195
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,210
It's thanks to the annual "No-Laughing series" that...

196
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,530
I haven't been forgotten yet.

197
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,210
I always feel relieved that I accepted to appear...

198
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,180
I see.

199
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm very thankful.

200
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,860
He's so annoying.

201
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,770
Taking advantage of your return...

202
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,490
is there any show you want to appear in?

203
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,650
Hodo Station

204
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,570
Doing what?

205
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,860
A discussion with a politician.

206
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,220
You already did that in a
"No-Laughing" batsu.

207
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,290
What would you talk about with a politician?

208
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,210
I'd tell him that instead of ending all sex services at 12:00 AM,

209
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,720
please let them stay open for 24 hours.

210
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,690
After a rigorous job like this one...

211
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,460
I always get a tired boner.

212
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,940
I always get a tired boner.

213
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,180
It's around dawn when I get more tired boners.

214
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,980
This is the first time I
hear that word on TV.

215
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,320
It's around dawn when I get more tired boners.

216
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,080
If they canceled the adult entertainment regulations, I could go get sex services.

217
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,720
If they canceled them?

218
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,340
I'm pretty sure that sexual crimes would also decrease even more.

219
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,850
That had more meaning than I though.

220
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,530
You think it would reduce sex crimes?

221
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,490
That's right.

222
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,260
You returned to show business last year around autumn, right?

223
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,220
Yes, around that time.

224
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,680
How much of your debt were you able to pay back?

225
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,370
It got bigger.

226
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,290
It got bigger?!

227
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,530
What made it grow even more?

228
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,260
I overdid it with the sex services.

229
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
Sex services again...

230
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,440
Time: 14 hours 8 minutes

231
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,450
The interview has gone over the 14 hour mark and it's taking its toll on Jimmy.

232
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,180
It's too long...

233
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,370
This is where it gets hard.

234
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,570
I'm getting sleepy...

235
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,120
Sudden drowsiness, in that case...

236
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,290
Let's wake him up.

237
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,940
Roof terrace

238
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,920
What's your favorite TV show?

239
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,920
It must be cold.

240
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,900
Definitely Sazae-san.

241
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,540
It's not Hodo Station?

242
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,210
Hodo Station is the show I want to be in.

243
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,210
But you don't like it.

244
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,280
It's a regular program so it would help me pay back my debt.

245
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,420
So that's what you're aiming for...

246
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,580
He hadn't smiled like that in a while.

247
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,810
Don't you want to appear in the show

248
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,570
"Wide na Show" with Matsumoto and Higashino?

249
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,520
I'd like to.

250
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,090
Do you watch the show?

251
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,480
No, because it's (broadcasted) very late in Osaka and I get sleepy...

252
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,840
Very late at night in Osaka...

253
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,160
Time: 15 hours 10 minutes

254
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,160
His drowsiness has gone away so we go back to the room.

255
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,000
We approach Jimmy with serious questions about his true essence.

256
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,570
His face looks different.

257
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,740
I'd like to hear about your personal philosophy of comedy.

258
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,930
Comedy is basically...

259
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,940
A certain feeling of tension that makes you laugh.

260
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
A certain feeling of tension that makes you laugh.

261
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,340
Maybe showing your butt at the pool isn't funny...

262
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,900
But at a funeral it would be funny, because there's that tension,

263
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,760
and it makes you laugh.

264
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,610
Comedy is tension and sympathy.

265
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,290
Comedy is tension and sympathy.

266
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,020
Erm, empathy.

267
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,080
Comedy is tension and empathy.

268
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,640
One usually talks about things everyone else is thinking.

269
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,700
If they're able to relate to that, then it becomes comedy.

270
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,690
So if there's empathy and tension, it becomes funnier.

271
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,600
So if there's empathy and tension, it becomes funnier.

272
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,530
Anything current comedians should be doing?

273
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,500
Organized drinking parties.

274
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,800
In the old days, there was no need to be careful...

275
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,040
so we had our fair share of fun.

276
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,340
Nowadays, you can get criticized or flamed...

277
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,130
on sites like Twitter and the like.

278
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,370
Are you also being more careful?

279
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,090
Um...

280
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,530
I have a driver come pick me up...

281
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,680
when I go out for sex services.

282
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,450
Another indecent answer

283
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,330
Let's digress from this.

284
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:07,500
As a comedian, what is the one principle that you will never break?

285
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,100
To never sleep with a transvestite.

286
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,540
To never sleep with a transvestite.

287
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,080
Somehow another indecent answer

288
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,900
The question said "as a comedian".

289
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,890
The answers are mostly dirty jokes...

290
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,860
Of course, we can't have him continue answering like this.

291
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,560
Your answers have been mostly indecent
things, we'd prefer if you didn't...

292
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,840
They got angry at you.

293
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,840
Motion to ban indecent answers

294
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,810
The staff decided to ban these answers.

295
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,890
Now we looked forward to a proper interview.

296
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,260
However

297
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,770
Excuse me.

298
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,760
Good evening, I'm here
for the massage...

299
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,250
The massage...

300
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,010
Thank you...

301
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Ah, this timing...

302
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
This won't be good...

303
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,440
We'll refresh and heal his tired body with a massage.

304
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,500
The director just told me to stop with all the dirty talk...

305
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,330
How am I supposed to do that with this?

306
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,450
You're really looking forward to it, huh?

307
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,520
What are you making me do?

308
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,520
A radiant smile

309
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,540
What the hell?

310
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,320
And so, he puts on disposable underwear and the massage begins.

311
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,500
Seriously, what the hell?

312
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,780
You're thinking too much.

313
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
How does it feel, Jimmy?

314
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,000
It feels so good. It's the best.

315
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,800
While you're relaxed like this, let's go over some things from before.

316
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,640
What are you most grateful to Sanma-san?

317
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,660
I'd say... um...

318
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,420
That it's thanks to him that I can have food on my table.

319
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,050
What is the most memorable story you had with Bonchi Osamu?

320
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,640
Erm... one day...

321
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,320
he told me, "Come to my place, let's drink tonight."

322
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,610
But something held him up that day so...

323
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:04,450
he called his wife and told her, "Let Onishi sleep there."

324
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,480
And then... uh... his wife...

325
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,540
she said, "I just got a call from him."

326
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:18,360
"He said it was fine for the two of us to sleep before he comes back."

327
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,220
So I took her up on her offer and...

328
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,840
I took off my pants and said, "Let's get started then."

329
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,200
I misunderstood her.

330
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,250
That's the most memorable...

331
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,060
Ah, that was another dirty story...

332
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,040
That's right, they're banned.

333
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,650
Time: 18 hours 6 minutes

334
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,620
It's been 18 hours since the start.

335
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,540
We've arrived at the period of time that is hardest on the body.

336
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,850
How will Jimmy overcome it!?

337
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:57,890
Q. How long do you plan to continue as a comedian?

338
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,600
Until I'm 65.

339
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,740
Why is that?

340
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,860
Because then I'll be able to live off my pension.

341
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:13,180
Q. What do you want to do after you retire?

342
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,600
Look for coffee beans.

343
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,970
In retirement, I want to drink good coffee and...

344
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,170
eat castella cake in the afternoons.

345
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:31,400
Q. What would you buy for yourself as a reward for your retirement?

346
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,060
This guy is just unbelievable.

347
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,220
A walking stick.

348
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:26,170
My knees have started to hurt when I go up and down stairs.

349
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,420
I'm starting to feel my age.

350
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,610
A few years ago you had plastic surgery, right?

351
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:46,720
Q. A few years ago, what did you change with plastic surgery?

352
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,570
Yes.

353
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,530
What did you change?

354
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,260
His chin.

355
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,080
My chin, it sticked out too much so I pushed it in.

356
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:57,060
Q. At this point, why have a plastic surgery?

357
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:57,040
At just over 45 years, I thought it was the perfect time.

358
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,020
The perfect time?

359
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:13,520
Q. If you were reincarnated, what would you like to become?

360
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,980
A dog, something like a bulldog.

361
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,740
Someone else will take care of me...

362
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,530
and they will fawn over me.

363
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,010
Tape change.

364
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,610
Can I take a quick break?

365
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,560
Just a bit.

366
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,560
Does everyone really do 24 hours straight?

367
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,060
They do... they do...

368
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,050
Seriously?

369
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,400
They don't just record enough and call it a night?

370
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,500
You're the only one who has complained.

371
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,010
It never ends...

372
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,200
All these questions... they're really...

373
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,250
Well then, let's go to the next question.

374
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:50,860
Naturally, the 24 hour long interview continues without breaks...

375
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,820
Along with the sunrise, comes trouble!!

376
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,450
Time: 20 hours 32 minutes

377
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,460
Dawn has come at last and it's time for breakfast.

378
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,850
Jimmy is good at cooking, so earlier in the interview we had a request for him.

379
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,570
Since you're good at cooking, could you make our breakfast?

380
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,040
Sure thing.

381
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,980
How about rice balls?

382
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,780
Sure, I'll make kombu rice balls... yeah...

383
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:24,210
So now, Jimmy will prepare rice balls with piping hot rice.

384
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,980
Hot!

385
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,280
Hot! Hot!

386
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,000
Hot! Hot! Hot!

387
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,770
They just made it,
he needs to let it
cool down.

388
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,020
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

389
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,700
He's so irritating.

390
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,260
Why is it so hot?

391
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,620
It's still hot.

392
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,940
Hot!

393
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,650
Why?

394
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,380
He really makes
me angry.

395
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,660
He didn't put any
kombu inside!

396
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,450
It looks like he just
mixed them up.

397
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,890
With his best effort, Jimmy finished making the rice balls.

398
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,860
There are my famous "Square Rice Balls"

399
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,100
They're neither triangular nor circular, they're square rice balls.

400
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,600
Thanks for the food.

401
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,930
It looks bad, but what about its taste?

402
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:41,560
They're really good, if I may say so myself.

403
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,760
They probably don't
want to eat them.

404
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,200
What do you think Kojima-san?

405
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,780
It's a ball of goo.

406
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,260
He used too much water.

407
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,320
Well, at least it's light on the stomach...

408
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,460
when it feels gooey like this.

409
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,720
Time: 23 hours

410
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,700
It's a little over 9 AM and there's only one hour left.

411
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,000
Time: 23 hours

412
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,000
It's a little over 9 AM and there's only one hour left.

413
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,610
Alright, this is the last spurt.

414
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,760
Please tell us about the angriest moment in your life.

415
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,000
Um... I had a wound back here and it became a bald spot.

416
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,370
I was in the bullet train when this old guy...

417
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:33,280
started poking my bald spot with a toothpick, so I got angry.

418
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,000
In what way did you lose your temper?

419
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,690
I told him, "Hey! I'll tell the conductor and have him change my seat!!"

420
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,050
I told him, "Hey! I'll tell the conductor and have him change my seat!!"

421
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,240
And I did so they changed my seat.

422
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,650
Which animal would you compare yourself to?

423
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,330
An animal...

424
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,330
an orangutan.

425
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,250
In what way?

426
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,810
Fear of extinction.

427
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,120
Fear?

428
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,400
Yes, about being on the edge of extinction.

429
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,000
What have these last 24 hours made you realize?

430
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,810
I think I said too many perverted things.

431
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,220
Ah, he's aware.

432
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,740
I became aware that I'm pretty much masturbation-man.

433
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,200
What the hell?

434
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,740
In 24 hours, Jimmy answered 4086 questions.

435
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,120
Is there anything else you want to say?

436
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,490
No, there's nothing left.

437
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,890
Nothing left to do or say.

438
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,600
I got everything out.

439
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,060
Time: 23 hours 57 minutes

440
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,050
And finally, the time came.

441
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,460
Well then, this is finally the last question.

442
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,850
After talking about it for 24 hours, what can you say about your life?

443
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,760
I think it's been an absurdly unbelievable life.

444
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,800
It's over.

445
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,650
Yes.

446
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,820
Thanks for the hard work.

447
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,820
Thanks, is it over?

448
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,620
It's been 24 hours.

449
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,640
Thank you.

450
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:13,820
24 Hour Long Interview Completed

451
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,250
I'm going home.

452
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,080
Are you staying here in Tokyo today?

453
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,520
No, I'm taking the bullet train to Osaka.

454
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,890
I'm going to masturbate in the train's toilet.

455
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,100
I'm going to masturbate in the train's toilet.

456
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,980
24 Hour Long Interview

457
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,980
FIN

458
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,570
Why do you have to say that at the end?

459
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,610
Look, I have no explanation for this but...

460
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,960
Don't you guys get aroused by being on TV?

461
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,400
Don't you guys get aroused by being on TV?

462
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,410
What do you mean?

463
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,100
That feeling you get when you see all these people.

464
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,890
Like you get really excited?

465
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,580
Like when you see female performers.

466
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,600
Yes, like that.

467
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,520
And after you're done, you want to go to sleep but you can't...

468
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,180
What's this?

469
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,140
This.

470
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,770
I'm making a phone call.

471
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:04,620
You know, if this interview had been for an educational channel instead, could they have even shown it?
