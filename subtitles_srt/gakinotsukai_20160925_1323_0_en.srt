1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,640
Are their hearts connected? Meet up without smartphones

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:12,580
The rule; go to a place based on the hint. The challenge ends if they all meet up

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,960
Last time, the first hint was: A store you can line up outside

4
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,110
Nobody was able to meet up

5
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,120
I thought you guys would understand this

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,500
You guys are clueless

7
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,460
The second hint, was a hotel

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,250
Everyone but Tanaka relied on their memories

9
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,940
Thank god

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,910
Only Matsumoto & Hosei were able to meet

11
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,830
Hamada is scary isn't he

12
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,510
Will they be able to meet up?

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,400
1, 2, Dogenzaka
There's no answer but Nikotama

14
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,570
There's someone, there's someone, there, there!

15
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,570
subbed by senor_wristband

16
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,370
1 hour and 34 minutes since the start,

17
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,140
Time for the 3rd hint

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,970
Here I go

19
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,600
That's difficult

20
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,570
UNIQLO

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,770
You know, I just thought of one,

22
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,030
I actually have no idea,

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,200
On 3,
1, 2, Dogenzaka

24
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,200
Shinjiku

25
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,570
I think either one

26
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,340
The [Shibuya] 109 place right?

27
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,500
I think either one,

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,930
I think the one in Bic Camera, they call it BICQLO or something,

29
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,250
On Shinjiku-dori in front of Kinokuniya [Department Store]

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,950
We were just there
We were there, now we have to go back?

31
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,500
That is a big one though

32
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,450
But I thought of either Shibuya or Shinjiku first

33
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,850
Shibuya right? There's one in Ginza too

34
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,200
But Ginza is out right?

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,450
The Shinjiku one is a BICQLO though

36
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,600
It's the collab with Bic Camera

37
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,250
Oh yeah Tanaka would say something weird about that

38
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,300
So that means, Shinjiku?

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,450
No, Shibuya

40
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,400
Right, Shibuya

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,900
I just, spaced out. You're right.

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,840
That's the BICQLO right

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,800
The two head towards the UNIQLO in Shibuya

44
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,050
Yamasaki is usually close by, like the billboard from last time

45
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,500
I don't really wanna say this, cause I could go on forever,

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,100
To put it simply, this is a problem of IQ

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,000
That's true, their IQ is too low

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,760
It's a question of their IQ

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,100
But maybe we just don't know, there might be a huge UNIQLO somewhere

50
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,600
That's what made me think Ginza

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
Really?

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,300
The one's in Ginza show up on TV a lot

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,550
But Cocorico and Hamada in Ginza...

54
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,300
I think Hamada is probably banned from Ginza

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,300
That's not true of course

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,150
I have no idea

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:34,900
For example, there was that huge UNIQLO in Ginza that was on TV

58
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,100
But will those guys think of that one?

59
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,350
Where else is there?

60
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,550
Is there one in Shibuya?

61
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,850
There's one in Shibuya

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,860
There is right

63
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,800
I don't think Shinjuku. Maybe Shibuya...

64
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,500
Let's go to #!$!@@$#!

65
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Which UNIQLO is Hamada heading to?

66
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,550
They're gonna administer justice on me,

67
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,250
If I go to the wrong place

68
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:22,000
There's 2 things that Hamada doesn't use, that normal people would use,

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,950
The first, is the word "delicious"

70
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,350
He will never exclaim "Tasty!"

71
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,750
His taste is garbage

72
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,290
"Delicious!" He will never say that

73
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,800
Normal people would say that for sure, but not him

74
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,700
And the other thing,

75
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,550
"Nostalgic!"

76
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,900
I've never heard him say that

77
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,600
NO right?

78
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,050
I've never heard him use the phrase "So nostalgic"

79
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,360
Never heard it before

80
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,480
His blood isn't liquid

81
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
Hamada-san's?

82
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,640
It's in powder form

83
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,560
He's never seen blood before

84
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,570
Yeah he hasn't. That's why his is powdered

85
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
I want to meet nice people

86
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,800
Because then I can be justified

87
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,200
Cause those two are together

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,720
They think they decide the right answer

89
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,340
But still, Hamada is like the pus of this show

90
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,640
C'mon, that's not true at all

91
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,600
All the problems stem from him right?

92
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,580
It's all messed up, everything about him

93
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,530
His fortune?

94
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,160
His fortune

95
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,330
Nah nah that's not...

96
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,060
Tanaka has still not chosen a location

97
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,270
UNIQLO... where else can I find one besides Nikotama?

98
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,020
The answer he came up with?

99
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,440
In !$!@#$,

100
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,840
Was there one?

101
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,160
Let's go to !@$!@

102
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,380
Is that alright?

103
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,160
What UNIQLO did Tanaka choose?

104
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,390
Keshigomu (staff), is there a store you can think of?

105
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,390
Keshigomu = Eraser

106
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,840
I would say the one in Ginza

107
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,090
There's a big one in Ginza

108
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,580
I don't know the big UNIQLO in Ginza...

109
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,640
A big UNIQLO in Ginza?

110
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,080
There's ones in Shibuya and stuff,

111
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,080
I don't know the location though

112
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,760
Let's go to $%@!$

113
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,290
Matsumoto's car hurries towards Shibuya

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,990
Will there be anyone else that will be able to meet?!

115
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,240
If they hand me a phone again I'm gonna flip

116
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,340
There gonna tell us some different place they're at

117
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,400
It makes you start to hate them

118
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,070
It makes you go "Why? Just why?"

119
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,200
"Woah, we don't know each other at all"

120
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,710
"Are we speaking the same language?"

121
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,910
The 2 reach Shibuya Dogenzaka

122
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't see any other staff

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,400
The UNIQLO itself,

124
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,730
Hmm? Matsumoto-san

125
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,000
Look

126
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,470
Isn't that someone there?

127
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,220
Isn't that someone there?!

128
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,530
It's Keshigomu!

129
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,560
It's him right?

130
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,820
Is that Keshigomu? Oh there's someone there!

131
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,580
yes yes yes who is it who who

132
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,600
OOOHHH TANAKA!!!

133
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,440
See!

134
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,870
Right?

135
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,070
This is the answer

136
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,200
Right?

137
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,710
Thank god!

138
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,400
Cause it's huge right?

139
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,850
Oh thank god

140
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,550
Thank god!

141
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:14,480
This is the only answer
Either here or Shinjiku

142
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,700
But the one in Shinjiku is a BIQLO,

143
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,250
And we thought "Tanaka would have some problem with that" so we came here instead

144
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,600
Ah I see

145
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,400
It's just Hamada, we gotta aim for him

146
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,350
You're right

147
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,550
That's true, he's the weird one

148
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,750
He's the problem

149
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,250
My bad, I thought Tanaka was the problem,

150
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,370
But the whole time in the Taxi we were talking about Hamada

151
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,000
The whole ride

152
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,480
The fact that he didn't come to Hotel Yoko really hurt

153
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,000
Ahh, there

154
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,750
Why Westin?

155
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,950
My parents stayed in that place

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,450
Westin?

157
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,700
There's no way we would know that

158
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,030
There's no way

159
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:08,030
"Oh yeah Tanaka's parents stayed there!!!" - did you think we'd say that?

160
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,100
Did you think that?

161
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:14,600
And then Endo and Hamada show up
"Of course right?! Tanaka's parents stayed here after all!!"

162
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,400
"See you next week!"
would that happen?

163
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:24,000
But Endo shocked me at the first hint,

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,490
We were talking about the line up place right?
We even mentioned Hirunandesu

165
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,790
So he would have rememberd the pancake store

166
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,620
Right? The pancake place

167
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,160
Actually I wouldn't think of a pancake place either,

168
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,380
But Hirunandesu was men-

169
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,980
Your fly is totally open

170
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,730
Your fly is so open

171
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,640
He is that age after all

172
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,130
And I don't think you closed it properly right now either

173
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,130
Are you trying to make us laugh?

174
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,120
Just where are Hamada and Endo?

175
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,020
First, Endo

176
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:11,800
I went to the UNIQLO in Shinjiku

177
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,070
Like we said,

178
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,000
That's not it

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,670
That's a BICQLO

180
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,940
It does say BICQLO, but it says UNIQLO properly next to it

181
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,960
There it is

182
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm never gonna forgive you

183
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,930
I will never forigive you, no matter what happens

184
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:42,570
Over here, Me, Yamasaki and Tanaka all three have met!

185
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,960
We've met up

186
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,980
Tanaka is there?

187
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,230
We're at the Dogenzaka UNIQLO

188
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,970
Dogenzaka UNIQLO?

189
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,400
It's the most obvious one!

190
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,810
It totally stands out

191
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,900
Hamada

192
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,570
What are you doing?

193
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,100
What do you mean "What are you doing"

194
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,630
UNIQLO ... You're at one in Japan right?

195
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,370
Yes, I'm at a UNIQLO

196
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,630
In Ginza

197
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,490
There it is

198
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,030
He said it, Ginza

199
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,230
There's one in Ginza?

200
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,400
Of course, it has 12 floors!

201
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,530
It's the biggest one in the city

202
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,300
Nah, you gotta think of the flow,

203
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,600
You guys are just using the power of numbers to decide what's right

204
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,570
Is quantity what decides?

205
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,770
I think that's wrong

206
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,370
The point of this episode is to get the most people

207
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,930
Even if you say that,

208
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,000
It's a "meet up" episode

209
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,450
That's the point of this challenge

210
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,770
Whatever, enough. We'll talk later, alright, alright

211
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,270
They hung up?

212
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,100
Even Tanaka is there

213
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,670
Enough of this crap

214
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,170
2 hours and 2 minutes since starting

215
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,170
Time for the 4th hint

216
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,270
C'mon!

217
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,110
A location to interview people on the street

218
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,000
There, we already know it's there

219
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,930
A location to interview people on the street

220
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,690
I actually got this

221
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,230
I do too

222
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,310
You get it right?

223
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,440
What's with that stupid face of yours?

224
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,160
I'm definitley thinking of the same place as Yamasaki

225
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,180
The same

226
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,290
What's with that expression?

227
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,690
Okay yeah, say the answer together,

228
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,940
1, 2, Shinbashi!

229
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,940
Center Gai!

230
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,940
Shinbashi!

231
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,430
It's Shinbashi, no question!

232
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,570
It's gotta be SL Plaza WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING?!?!

233
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,860
There's probably interviews there now!

234
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,340
But isn't Center Gai the centre of Shibuya?

235
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,460
They interview people there all the time

236
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,460
Those are interviews on niche topics

237
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,460
It shouldn't be about just fashion or topics like that,

238
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,430
But like, what you see on Japanese news shows

239
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,710
So it's definitely that place right?

240
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,860
It's SL Plaza!

241
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,690
This whole time I was like what is that "GACHA GACHA"

242
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,260
YOU'RE THE ONE MAKING THIS CHAIN HIT THE THING!!!

243
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,090
STEP FORWARD A STEP!!

244
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,710
Makes my blood boil

245
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,570
This was the noise?

246
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,490
For the entire phone call this stupid GACHA GACHA

247
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,110
That was you?!

248
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,910
I thought it was some noise from the phone

249
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,660
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

250
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,670
It's infuriating, infuriating right?

251
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,310
Thank god we met him, imagine if we didn't

252
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,430
Yeah thank god. I guess me and Yamasaki think the same huh?

253
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,460
Matsumoto-san we got this, we'll finish with this one

254
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,940
Ginza! Hamada's there, that's his location

255
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,740
That's close by,

256
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,260
If he's a decent person, he'll come to Shinbashi

257
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,970
They head to SL Plaza in Shinbashi

258
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,850
Will they all meet up?

259
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,510
And Endo?

260
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:58,190
There's only 2 answers,
SL Plaza, or Shibuya?

261
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,430
In front of Hachiko, you often see them there with the mic

262
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,370
He considers SL Plaza, and Hachiko's statue in Shibuya

263
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,460
Which will he pick?

264
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,630
Meanwhile, Hamada,

265
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,230
I know this one

266
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,570
This is that place, !@%!%^

267
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,710
It's gotta be that one, there's no question

268
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,770
Let's go. That's the only place.

269
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:29,570
They're full of confidence this time, but will they meet Matsumoto's group?

270
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,540
I do have confidence in this choice,

271
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,000
If they tell me I'm wrong, this will have become a political issue

272
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,490
They have the numbers on their side

273
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,890
From now on, Tanaka films Matsumoto's group

274
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:53,940
If this was "Journey to the West", Tanaka would be the priestess

275
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,910
What do you mean?

276
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,800
He meets each of us 1 by 1

277
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,690
So he's the priestess?

278
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,630
And I'm Son Goku of course

279
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:10,000
He's the priestess, and you're Son Goku
Who am I then?

280
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,110
You're Sagojo right?

281
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,490
So then, Hamada-san...

282
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,230
Hamada is Chohakai yeah?

283
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,800
And Endo?

284
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,600
What would Endo be?

285
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,110
He's Gautama Buddha

286
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,000
Amazing
Endo is amazing

287
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,140
That's amazing

288
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:36,230
But you know, I'm just saying, but we basically just watch NHK, right?

289
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,630
And on NHK news, they usually film at SL Plaza, whatever it is,

290
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,600
Oh really?

291
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,510
It's just an association in my head

292
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,400
"SL Plaza - Shinbashi"

293
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,970
Then the sound of the train going by

294
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,490
So it's gotta be, SM....

295
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,890
It's an SM club usually

296
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,510
The course right?
You wonder what SM course they'll choose

297
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,200
What are you saying?

298
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,510
SM...

299
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,090
... the course ...

300
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,800
That was dangerous, I almost spit it out

301
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,170
He stuttered!

302
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,860
He got confused between SL and SM

303
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,510
No no that's not true

304
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,570
Then he tried to cover it with the SM club

305
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,570
Damn I almost spit this out

306
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,630
He was talking about SL at first

307
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,690
He stuttered the L into an M

308
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,690
No I just thought I'd end my story there, I changed the topic

309
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,230
Matsumoto's group head towards SL Plaza in Shinbashi

310
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,030
Will Hamada and Endo be able to meet them?

311
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,490
Tanaka, what's the first Olympic sport you can think of?

312
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,630
An Olympic sport?

313
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,660
I got it

314
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,600
Shall we say it together?

315
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,460
Oh yeah let's do that

316
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,310
100 metre dash

317
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,310
100 metre dash

318
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,310
Gymnastics

319
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,340
It's gotta be the 100 meter dash

320
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,340
This is gotta be that one

321
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,260
That's the association with the Olympics

322
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,170
It's the first one that comes to mind

323
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,410
The headline

324
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:12,770
But the people in the 100m dash, they do some gymnastics first

325
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,750
Is that how you think it works?

326
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,910
First they compete in gymnastics

327
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,540
They prepare by doing gymnastics?

328
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,400
That's not an Olympic sport then

329
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,400
There's Judo and Wrestling and what not,

330
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,860
They all prepare with gymnastics

331
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,940
All of them?

332
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,490
We're close right?

333
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,430
Shinbashi is on Hamada's way, he's in Ginza

334
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:42,170
They arrive at SL Plaza
Will the challenge end here?

335
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,660
Anyone here?

336
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,460
There isn't

337
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,540
Nobody huh?

338
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, OH!

339
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,230
There is there there there there!

340
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,510
You're right!

341
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,400
Who? Who's that?

342
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,710
Over there

343
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,710
Who, who is it?

344
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,630
Of course, right?

345
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,060
I'm glad

346
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,540
This is it right?

347
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,260
You were in Ginza, closest to here

348
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:18,800
There a lot of interviews in Ginza,

349
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,280
But it's gotta be here

350
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,480
Wait, where's Endo?

351
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,120
Not here

352
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,400
But, where was he coming from?

353
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,390
Shinjiku

354
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,880
Let's wait a little longer

355
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,520
He's probably almost done, I think he just hasn't reached yet

356
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,800
They haven't given us the phones yet

357
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,760
Yeah there's no call to be made

358
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,360
There's a chance he's on his way

359
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,400
Will Endo appear at SL Plaza?

360
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,490
He could be in Shibuya, at Center Gai,

361
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,440
It's like-

362
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,240
Good work today!

363
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,240
This is it right?

364
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,490
Thank god!

365
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,720
I really thought you wouldn't come!

366
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:17,360
I thought this was the only place
But you guys were already at Shibuya,

367
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,360
I was thinking that too

368
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,560
But I bet on this place

369
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,400
This was pretty tiring

370
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,400
It really was

371
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,520
But man you guys suck!

372
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,640
The BIQLO
The pancakes

373
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,960
The Hyatt!

374
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,760
The Grand Hyatt

375
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,640
only IDIOTS here

376
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,640
But of course Yamasaki and I, the viewers already knew-

377
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,200
You guys are just using your numbers to decide the answer

378
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,200
You've stayed at Yoko so many times!

379
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,920
I have, but the hint was "A Hotel"

380
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,680
Yoko has nothing do with that, it's irrelevant

381
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,420
That giant hotel in the middle of the city

382
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,840
Did you really think we'd all go "yayyy!!" and meet up there?

383
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,880
Yes, that's why I was there

384
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,800
Tanaka consults with the members;
A story that happened while shooting a drama

385
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,050
I wanted to hear your thoughts on this,

386
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,450
I was going to be in a drama,

387
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,240
At the studio-

388
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,240
You want to work there instead right?

389
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,490
You totally want to work there

390
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,490
No, that's not it,

391
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,870
Take me with you dude

392
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,690
Yeah it's risky for you now

393
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,420
Take me with you

394
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,330
There's always Busjack 2

395
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,310
There's no news about that at all

396
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,310
They could make a series

397
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,020
Not a peep. Even though it's been such a popular topic online.

398
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,980
They should just make it

399
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,220
We all said we'll appear in it

400
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,420
Right? DownTown in a movie together,

401
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,020
Yeah, yeah we'll do it

402
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,120
We said we'll do it, they should start making 2

403
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,820
It's such an ocassion to see these two on screen together

404
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,310
All of us, we can all do it

405
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,690
Exactly, exactly,

406
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,690
Busjack is one thing,

407
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,290
There's always gifts right?

408
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,290
Yeah, on dramas there are

409
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,510
They always give them out right?

410
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,530
So on that drama I was on, I was with Yoshimoto's team

411
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,780
I was talking to them about bringing in gifts,

412
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,040
I was wondering what sort of gifts I could give out, and what time to do it

413
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,090
So on that day I told them to bring in the gifts,

414
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,910
I was waiting for someone to say "Tanaka-san brought these in for you guys"
But nobody said that,

415
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:57,910
But at 10-11pm, after the last cut of the last scene, exactly after the work ended,

416
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,470
Someone said; "Tanaka-san brought some cherries in for you guys"

417
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,560
I get what you mean

418
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,960
At 10, 11pm, after the shooting wraps up,
who would want to eat cherries?

419
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,270
They wanna go home

420
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,300
They wanna go home

421
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:16,580
There were these paper cups with 5-6 cherries lined up on a table,

422
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,290
So the staff would grab the cherries on their way out

423
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,630
Who? Like who would appreciate this?

424
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,630
-Is what I'm thinking
Like is this alright?

425
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,580
It's bad timing

426
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,380
Is this a claim against Yoshimoto?

427
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,670
This is a claim against Yoshimoto

428
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,130
So Yoshimoto's drama team did all that,

429
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,670
But sometimes you get these gifts that are like, the hell is this?

430
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,530
Yeah, there are
They do make you go "The hell is this?"

431
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,640
That drama staff that brought in the gifts,

432
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:57,160
They had no idea what it was, so they said
"Tanaka-san brought some jelly looking snacks for you guys"

433
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,840
They just didn't know

434
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,040
So stuff like that happens,

435
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,470
They try to be a little fancy

436
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,180
Cliche gifts are just fine, right?

437
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,820
Like last time,

438
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,780
Like that tofu

439
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,270
A normal gift is fine

440
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,200
For "Ashita Ga Aru Sa", they had that Coca-Cola the sponsors provided

441
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:22,050
"Ashita Ga Aru Sa" is an NTV drama that all Gaki members except Yamasaki appeared on

442
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,180
There was like a mountain of drinks

443
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,360
Sorry, can we stop this
Hosei-san's face has become gloomy

444
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,980
If we keep talking about this,

445
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,010
Re:Japan

446
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,980
TN: Re:Japan is the musical group for the drama ... that Hosei wasn't in

447
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,490
His face becomes like that when we talk about that

448
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,100
What is "Ashita Ga Aru Sa?"

449
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,420
We were in it remember?

450
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,890
It was a long time ago

451
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,910
I've never heard of it, I don't know what that is

452
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,490
I don't know a thing about it, I don't know it!

453
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,810
We were on Kouhaku too

454
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:51,050
TN: Kouhaku is a New Year's Eve music special that competes with No Laughing Batsu

455
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,870
Nope, doesn't ring a bell

456
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,050
On Kouhaku Uta Gassen

457
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,480
We were on Kohaku

458
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,780
I was watching Gaki on New Year's Eve

459
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,760
You don't remember that happened?

460
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,260
I even show up in Gaki No Tsukaiiiiii

461
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,360
What an annoying way to talk
