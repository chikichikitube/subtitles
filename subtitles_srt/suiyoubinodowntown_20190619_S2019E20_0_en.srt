00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,470
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,810
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,450
Savannah's Takahashi

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,050
Today I bring a theory about IKKO

5
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,770
When it comes to IKKO

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:36,700
She has phrases like "what the hell?" (don da ke) and "like a dream!"

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,140
So this time we bring a theory about IKKO's catchphrases

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,200
IKKO catchphrase contest

9
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:53,650
This involves getting IKKO to use her catchphrases without her noticing

10
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:59,160
A contest on naturally leading her to say certain phrases

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,520
Like setting up IKKO, right
-Yes

12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,050
So for instance, what would you do to get her to say "what the hell?"

13
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,160
Honestly, I'm always on location

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,280
IKKO will say "what the hell" even if I just turn to her like 'uh-uh-uh'

15
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,050
Is it that simple?
-Amazing

16
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,210
If I go "uh-uh-uh"...
-That's too easy.

17
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,690
That does not need any preparation

18
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,570
You don't have to say anything at all, you just have to go, "Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh..."

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,510
This'll definitely get a "what the hell?"

20
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,320
So, three groups of comedians will attempt to get IKKO to say certain words

21
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:42,050
Who can make the most amount of noise without being called noisy

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,560
The Daily Life Loudness Competition

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,600
Also, is it possible to teach a woman a figure four leg lock hold over the phone?

24
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,040
IKKO Catchphrase Contest

25
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,950
This time, these three groups are participating

26
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,270
And are invited to a fake shopping show with IKKO

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,130
First, they draw lots to determine the IKKO catchphrase for each group

28
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:40,670
Like a dream~

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:40,670
Shoulder drop~

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:40,670
What the hell?

31
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,670
I am a beginner

32
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,140
"Shoulder drop~" is so hard

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,080
If you create a certain situation, it should be doable

34
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,010
"Shoulder drop~" would only occur when something rude has been said

35
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,580
Its the same as something like "I'll beat you up"

36
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,610
Then, IKKO, who knows nothing about it, enters the scene

37
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,440
And so, the contest begins

38
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,540
Let's give IKKO a warm welcome!

39
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,910
Hospitality~

40
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,840
Really beautiful!

41
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,110
No, no, no, no. Really? You guys!

42
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,710
Very moist and shiny

43
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,720
What are you laughing at?
-You're laughing too much

44
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,590
Your eyeballs are so prominent

45
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,730
Looking from the side

46
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,630
Medaka fish～

47
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,630
※Medaka: a fish with huge eyes high on its head

48
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,870
Medaka fish?
-Medaka fish

49
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,930
Never heard of medaka fish?

50
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,670
This is your first time meeting us, right?

51
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,640
Do you know us? Do you know us?

52
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,580
Ah, you are Morita

53
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,880
Hey, what about me?

54
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,920
Suddenly sounds obscene

55
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,480
Let me take a look in your pockets

56
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,560
Like a dream~

57
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,330
Fujimoto accidentally invokes Goodbye Light of Youth's phrase and starts the game with a mistake

58
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,530
Let's go~

59
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,030
Here we go, here we go

60
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,870
Eh…？

61
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,240
We're here at Odaiba shopping street

62
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,250
The first store is the Shooting Gallery, commonly known as the airsoft store

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,650
Please

64
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,720
So happy~

65
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,930
This is a store where you can experience the airsoft stores of the Showa 30s

66
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,030
You were born in Showa 30, right?
-I was born

67
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,030
※Showa 30：1955

68
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,970
Were you born around Showa 12?
-No

69
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,970
※Showa 12: 1937

70
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,540
Showa 20 years?
-No

71
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,540
※Showa 20 years: 1945

72
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,940
Taisho 5 years?
-I said no~

73
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,940
※Taisho 5 years: 1916

74
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,880
Jomon...?

75
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,810
※Jomon period: 16,000 years ago to 2300 years ago, Named after the rope pattern printed on the excavated pottery

76
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,810
Jomon era?

77
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,010
Who?
-IKKO

78
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,110
It's not that long ago. It's not that long ago, is it?

79
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,450
Like a dream~

80
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,600
As Morita takes over Fujimoto's joke, he grabs a "Like a dream~"

81
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,890
I hit the...

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,300
What are you up to?

83
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,100
What the hell~

84
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,040
IKKO, this is not your level!

85
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,810
You knocked down something you shouldn't

86
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,880
You can't do this, seriously!

87
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,380
Really, if you do it again, you'll...

88
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,550
What's the matter with this guy?

89
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,660
You'll get it next time!

90
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,290
He'll get it?

91
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,330
You do it again and i'll really take you out

92
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,300
Hand that over now! Hand it over!

93
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,840
Konsang Amida~

94
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,840
※"Kongsang Amida" Japanese pronunciation of Korean for "thank you"

95
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,300
What're you talking about?

96
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,670
What the heck!?

97
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,440
How can you let her say "Kongsang Amida"? It's too rude to IKKO!

98
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,280
Why is there a "Konsang Amida"?

99
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,080
Sorry. Excuse me

100
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,280
Look, Ikko, you should try and stretch forward as much as possible

101
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,560
What the hell~

102
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,360
Well done, IKKO

103
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,220
Fujimoto unwittingly gives points to another team again

104
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Watch me

105
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,150
Shoulder Drop~

106
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,130
It appeared!

107
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,560
Shoulder Drop~

108
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,440
What the hell~

109
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,810
Kongsang Amida~

110
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,680
Why? Why?

111
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,310
Hey, what's with the "Konsang Amida~" again?

112
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,950
Don't bring out the "Konsang Amida" Oi! So rude!

113
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,150
Hey, what's up?

114
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,560
I thought this was a target. Sorry

115
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,060
You're too dangerous, right?

116
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,470
Shoulder Drop~

117
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,310
What are you doing here?

118
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,010
I'm trying to do this again!

119
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,450
Shoulder Drop~

120
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,520
Eh?

121
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,720
A fully automatic over-the-shoulder machine

122
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,860
At the end of the first stage, the scores obtained by each team are as follows

123
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,440
FUJIWARA is one step ahead

124
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,740
Here outside of the first half, IKKO is isolated

125
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,730
At the other end

126
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,770
This is simply a game of "You tell me, I guess"

127
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,880
If you queue her up, she'll say it

128
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,580
I set them up well

129
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,410
It's not a long game

130
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,850
By the way, what the hell is that "Konsang Amida"?

131
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,050
How should I respond to that statement?

132
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,220
I don't really get how that started

133
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,300
A mini-review session

134
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,000
The next stage is a snack store

135
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,210
And the phrases are changed

136
00:08:46,370 --> 00:09:08,390
Penniless~

137
00:08:46,370 --> 00:09:08,390
Super cheap~

138
00:08:46,370 --> 00:09:08,390
Theft~

139
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,350
Why is this in red?

140
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,050
The red words are IKKO's usual phrases

141
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,690
Yeah it is

142
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,620
You didn't hear her say it?

143
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,390
Not even once!

144
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,160
Next is this store

145
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,070
So happy~

146
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,000
So retro~

147
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,040
I like snack stores the most

148
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,710
These are just 100 yen!

149
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,910
This 100 is so casually stated!

150
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,680
Can it be bought?

151
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,950
Can I buy it?
-Yes, you can.

152
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,820
Buy buy buy

153
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,490
How much is 100g?

154
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,220
400 yen

155
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,160
It's a bargain!

156
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,960
This is only 200 yen!

157
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,660
200 yen, from 450 to 200 yen

158
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,370
It's a bargain!

159
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,660
Instead of the selected phrase, Ikko surprisingly uses "It's a bargain" instead

160
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,150
So Morita attemps to change the situation

161
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,680
IKKO, this is only 5 yen, you can buy loads!

162
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,690
But

163
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,390
Hey, is it really 5 yen?

164
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,690
Oh its not

165
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,260
They said its not. No

166
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,500
Fujimoto immediately blocks his play

167
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,800
Let Haranishi pay for it

168
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
This is for IKKO-san, get the money ready

169
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,100
100 yen

170
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,400
I don't have 100

171
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,740
Not even 100? So stingy~

172
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,880
Ah... what the hell~

173
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,250
So stingy, wont even give 100 yen, stingy, right?

174
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,080
Stingy~

175
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Stingy~

176
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,850
Seriously stingy!

177
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,160
You only have 20 yen?

178
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,490
I just brought 20

179
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,260
Stingy!

180
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,160
Reality~

181
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,710
Although they try to elicit a "penniless~" by saying stingy, it doesn't work

182
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,980
You have a lot of money in your pocket

183
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,930
It can't be helped

184
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,020
Next, Diane attempt to setup a play

185
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,840
This way

186
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,060
IKKO, this seems to be 20 yen

187
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,550
IKKO you are leaving the store!

188
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,050
You people are so annoying~

189
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,610
Wait a minute

190
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,520
You're just going to walk away, are you?

191
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,290
No, wait a minute

192
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,790
You're just going to leave?

193
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,590
Go back. Go back

194
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,060
We're going back~

195
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,490
But this play is also prevented by Fujimoto

196
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,330
Konsang Amida~

197
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,390
This sentence has been said so many times

198
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,040
What does that mean exactly?

199
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,000
What are you saying?

200
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,080
What are you doing?

201
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,950
What are you thinking?

202
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,460
This is no good, this is stealing!

203
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,290
Yeah

204
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,930
I'll pay for it. Give it to me

205
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,300
Fujimoto used an iron wall defense

206
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,940
Haranishi, Haranishi, come and pay

207
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,610
He really is Hara-stingy

208
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,910
I just don't have the money!

209
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,440
Really Hara-stingy

210
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,550
Penniless~

211
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,350
Said it!

212
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,170
Finally a "Penniless~" is obtained

213
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,350
IKKO bring that here

214
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,120
Over here!

215
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
No~

216
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,920
Over here!

217
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,620
This end, this end, this end...

218
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,700
Here, over here

219
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,770
This, this and this, i've bought~

220
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,360
At the end of this second stage

221
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,950
The scores for each team are as follows

222
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,720
Adult's purchase~

223
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,720
※Adults purchase: things you can't afford when you're a kid, so when you grow up, you buy a whole box

224
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,040
Next is the third stage

225
00:12:49,750 --> 00:13:04,030
Condolences~

226
00:12:49,750 --> 00:13:04,030
Everest~

227
00:12:49,750 --> 00:13:04,030
Photoshoot~

228
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,260
The words were changed again

229
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,500
Shoulder drop～

230
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,290
But none of the groups were able to get even a single point

231
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,530
Finally, the last stage

232
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,740
It's the same~

233
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,740
Reality~

234
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:57,880
Delicious~

235
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,850
The respective IKKO phrases are as follows

236
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,710
I want to go on a date with IKKO!

237
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,750
I really want to date together, but that's just a dream

238
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,340
Like a dream~

239
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,080
Reality～

240
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,360
It's a dream come true!
-Great!

241
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,990
Ah, it's a mirror.
-This way

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,630
Is it?

243
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,930
Special effect~

244
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,140
What to do...

245
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,370
Please tell me it's a dream~

246
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,340
Reality~

247
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,260
And thus, the contest ends

248
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,430
The results are revealed

249
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,120
What is this?

250
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,200
What what?

251
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,520
We FUJIWARA win!

252
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,800
Wait, wait a sec, hang on

253
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,530
Wait a minute.
-What?

254
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,360
What is this?

255
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,940
Thus we explain the project to IKKO

256
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,510
Does IKKO know what this program is?

257
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,880
What comes to mind? The program name

258
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,260
That one, right? The one with Matsumoto and Hamada.
-Yes

259
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,250
Wednesday Downtown~

260
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,720
Fooled~

261
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,460
Penniless~

262
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,060
This is a mess!
-No rules

263
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,360
For Downtown...

264
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,830
Konsang Amida~

265
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:54,130
In summary
IKKO's most frequently used phrase on the day was "Kongsang Amida" at 16 times

266
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,610
Interesting~
-Funny

267
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,000
What do you think, Matsumoto?

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,450
What the hell is with "Konsang Amida"?

269
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,710
"Thank you."
-It means "thank you"

270
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,600
This is the most used phrase, right?

271
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,850
I have no clue what the rules were for that

272
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,240
She shouts constantly, right?

273
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,960
I think her voice is probably even stronger than B'z's Inaba

274
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,860
Let's welcome the next presenter

275
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,620
Audrey's Kasuga!

276
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,830
Twoos

277
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,110
Thank you Thank you

278
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,770
Are you allowed to be on TV?

279
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:46,660
※Kasuga proposed to his girlfriend of 11 years on April 18 on the variety show "Human Watch" and was later revealed to have met a blonde 10 days before the proposal

280
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,660
It's okay, it's not a crime.

281
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,760
So its ok...

282
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,300
You can't do that.
-I didn't commit a crime!

283
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,180
But it might be on the same level as a crime though

284
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,920
I'm sorry for causing a crime level disturbance

285
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,640
This time is the loudness tournament

286
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,700
But if it is just an ordinary voice then its not interesting

287
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,360
So another element has been added

288
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,430
This is what was decided

289
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,750
Daily Life Loudness Tournament

290
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,910
Daily life?

291
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,980
When drinking with other artists in your daily life

292
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,450
How loud can junior comedians be

293
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,340
With seniors right in front of them

294
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:29,250
If the seniors say "You're so noisy" or something like that, they are disqualified

295
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,780
And they'll lose their points

296
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,280
I see

297
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,740
The seniors do not know this thing
-Of course

298
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,620
It depends on how they control the situation

299
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,070
Gradually increase the volume.
-Yes

300
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,080
Does this show not do theories anymore?

301
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,800
That's true

302
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,780
That was a contest, this is a tournament

303
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,960
Daily Life Loudness Tournament

304
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:16,530
This time, comedians known for being loud invited their seniors, who are usually on good terms, to dinner

305
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,870
Juniors and seniors

306
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,500
At the meal, they will attempt to speak up without getting called out for it

307
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,250
And will compete to see who can reach the highest volume

308
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,500
The first challenger is

309
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,540
Mikkity！

310
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,320
Shoji Tomohara

311
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,730
Confident?
-Yes

312
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,140
Don't I have the loudest voice?

313
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:47,650
It would be nice to use a loud voice subtly in conversation

314
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,260
The target is...

315
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,470
Penalty's Wakki

316
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,980
My wife said the landlord is coming today

317
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,860
What is this hairstyle

318
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,170
So find a good one...

319
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,200
Isn't that a clock?

320
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,620
Behind the targets is...

321
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,730
This is to measure the volume

322
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,250
A special volume meter with radio microphone is installed

323
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,840
That, to begin with, will appear simply to be a clock

324
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,880
It will be used to record and show the volume

325
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,900
So that challengers can confirm the decibels they are producing

326
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,430
And so, the tournament begins

327
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,930
And quickly...

328
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,900
What are you doing?

329
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,110
Peak Volume

330
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,880
Drinking

331
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,090
Seriously, that...

332
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,790
By making the "drinking a beer breath", the volume went up to 95.9 decibels

333
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,140
Impressive

334
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,280
This is the same noise level as a barking dog

335
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,270
Pretty loud

336
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,750
It is ignored by Wakki

337
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,330
My instagram followers are gradually becoming less and less

338
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,140
It can get lower?

339
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,940
I've always had very little, only 42,000

340
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,900
Always

341
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,110
And the number of likes is also really small

342
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,680
Damn it

343
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:38,820
I always upload photos from manzai shows, right?

344
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,290
Only 350 likes!

345
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,260
Damn it

346
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,000
Damn it

347
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,570
Lamenting the number of instagram followers hits 99 decibels

348
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,990
In addition, the challenge will end when the special call button is pressed

349
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,230
The highest decibel value up to that point will represent challenger's performance

350
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,740
Right at this moment

351
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,820
This is soup noodles
-Soup noodles?

352
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,190
I might like that

353
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,060
What is this sense of sophistication?

354
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,220
Here Shoji fights to win

355
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,440
It looks like I'd like it

356
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,240
Please can we have some more soup noodles

357
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,810
Another serving please

358
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,370
So powerful, over 100

359
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,420
Your voice is too loud, right?

360
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,000
Shoji is disqualified

361
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,310
Thus, the project is revealed

362
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,460
Seriously?

363
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,700
You're out because he pointed it out

364
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,300
Eh?

365
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,000
Really?

366
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,210
The sound was too big, too big!

367
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,040
What is this?

368
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,480
I thought I was doing pretty good...

369
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,480
He figured it out?
-Yes

370
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,720
And what is this?

371
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,760
The next challenger is

372
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,660
Miki's Kosei

373
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,880
Ah, he's noisy!

374
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,210
The target is

375
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,140
Nichokenju's Shuji

376
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,980
Are you starring in Jimbocho today?

377
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,750
No, how do I put it?

378
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,450
It's more of a special guest kind of thing

379
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,880
Invited by whom?

380
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,820
Hurrica~nes' Arai and the like

381
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,870
So loud, so loud

382
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,690
After the event there...

383
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,050
The sound is so loud

384
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,800
Slightly annoying

385
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,880
Kosei starts by exceeding 103

386
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,070
Which NSC class were you in?
-Osaka 12

387
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,070
※NSC is a comprehensive arts academy founded by Yoshimoto, called "New Star Creation"

388
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,940
You're 12?

389
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,970
I'm 30
-You went to NSC?

390
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,740
I didn't go, but i'm in that age group

391
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,250
You were 12! We're 18 years apart!

392
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,120
Why does he have to say this loudly?

393
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,720
You were just a kid when I started out, right?

394
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,750
It was '93.
-93?

395
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,920
9…93？

396
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,720
This is how you win high scores in a row, by overreacting

397
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,820
Next

398
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,400
Is this it? Is this whale meat?

399
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,810
It's not the same at all

400
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,170
I'll try it

401
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,270
Super delicious!

402
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,820
It's super tasty. Try it too.
-Really?

403
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,970
In this way, Kosei continuously hits 100 decibels

404
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,300
So strong, so normal as well

405
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,080
Eat it, please

406
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,130
This is delicious!

407
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,130
Yes!

408
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:10,790
This bewildering "yes!" reaches a record high of 106.5 decibels

409
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,400
Next

410
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,600
Is it good?
-Super delicious

411
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,620
Eh? What?

412
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,060
Here the button is pressed to end the game

413
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,010
I made it

414
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:40,240
With a record of 108.5 decibels, Miki's Kosei is temporarily in first place

415
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,460
Impressive to reach 108

416
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,700
The next big voice artist to challenge is

417
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,520
Sunshine Ikesaki

418
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,140
He's usually pretty quiet

419
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,320
The target is

420
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,290
CoolPoko.'s Ono Majime

421
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,630
A good choice

422
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,760
What do you want to eat?

423
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,360
Well, how about... tempura

424
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,600
Don't make so much noise!

425
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,300
Don't be so loud

426
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,670
Sunshine Ikesaki is disqualified

427
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,570
Too fast!

428
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,850
The next loudmouth challenger is

429
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,100
Jungle Pocket's Saito

430
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,320
The target is

431
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,590
Captain Watanabe

432
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,790
I'll start with a draft beer

433
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,460
It's not just about winning at Oaks, you can't afford not to win anywhere

434
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,900
But Oaks and Derby these two weeks

435
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,900
※Derby refers to the Tokyo Yusen horse race, which is held by the Japan Central Horse Racing Association at Tokyo Race Course.

436
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,100
It's hard to win in Tokyo, but last time it was at the high-speed track, wasn't it?

437
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,100
※High-speed racecourse: A track where horses can enter the line quickly.

438
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,510
The horse farm, right?

439
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,810
So it won't work at the high-speed track.
-This can't be helped

440
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:04,100
The conversation turns to the topic of horse racing, a common hobby of the two men

441
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,920
Aren't there Kawasaki Milers today?

442
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,920
※Kawasaki Milers is a prize horse race held at Kawasaki Racecourse by the Kawasaki Horse Racing Group in Kanagawa Prefecture.

443
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,820
I haven't seen it yet.
-You haven't seen it yet

444
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,920
I watched the game and the last one

445
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,490
But the last one I didn't win any

446
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,030
I already know the results.
-You do?

447
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,410
You better not say, please Cap

448
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:24,100
Don't say it, really. Don't say it, really

449
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,300
Don't say anything? I just wanted to give you a little hint

450
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,840
No hints, don't say anything

451
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,570
No tips either!

452
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,710
Seriously, don't say it!

453
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:38,230
The tug-of-war between betting on the outcome of a horse race horse is constantly interspersed with jabbing attacks

454
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,280
Wait wait

455
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,120
Was your horse in the top three?

456
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,450
Are you gonna look?

457
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,960
Shall we look together?

458
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,760
They watch the video to confirm the results of the match that Saito doesn't know yet

459
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,540
It's started!

460
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,640
Ah, we're up and running

461
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,110
The start is good

462
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,840
After

463
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,390
It's coming!

464
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,420
Charge, charge, charge!

465
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,390
Can't you? Can't you?

466
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,790
Charge, charge, charge, charge!

467
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,590
Charge-

468
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,830
Charge, charge, charge, charge!

469
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,800
Charge-

470
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,400
Charge! Charge-ah-rush!

471
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,400
While pretending to fully support the horse he bet on

472
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,520
In fact, he is staring at the decibel meter while sending out loud and continuous noises

473
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,630
Next

474
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:49,150
Can you hear the song of the combatants?

475
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:54,090
Drumming is that what~ you know that song?

476
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:03,330
Hot blooded life is about to start anew♪

477
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,000
Not at all

478
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,840
The direction is changed to musical style singing

479
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,560
Next

480
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,980
Can you hear the song of the combatants?

481
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,220
At this point he is just one step away from the reigning champion

482
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,020
A record of 107.9 decibels

483
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,390
You love to sing too much, right?

484
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,890
Although picked up on his behavior

485
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,430
Since this is not a volume alert, it is considered safe

486
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,530
However

487
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,600
I'd like to order a cup of oolong tea with sake
-OK

488
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,270
I'll have an oolong tea

489
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,880
This is delicious.
-Yummy

490
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,410
It's really delicious.
-Thanks

491
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,880
Combatants~

492
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,280
You're so noisy!

493
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,690
Don't do such things to the workers

494
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,030
As he couldn't resist in front of the staff

495
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,810
He is warned without hesitation

496
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,170
Thus, Saito is disqualified

497
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,770
The last big voice artist is

498
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,770
Good choice

499
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,650
Hollywood Zakoshi

500
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,860
The final stage of the competition involves...

501
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,210
Hollywood Zakoshi

502
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,760
Certainly loud

503
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,550
The target is

504
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,690
Nadani Takeshi

505
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,840
With only Hollywood Zakoshi left

506
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,040
Wow, only one person succeeded!

507
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,610
Will he be able to take the top spot?

508
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,360
So

509
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,480
What's that?
-Bearded Baron

510
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,950
I don't see it, its too exaggerated

511
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,590
A usual exaggerated imitation hits just a little over 100 decibels

512
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,660
I don't see it, its too exaggerated

513
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,410
Despite commenting on the imitation, the loudness is ignored

514
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,230
And

515
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:22,140
The show just now
-Club?

516
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,470
The club in Shibuya

517
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,040
There was someone exactly like my act
-Who?

518
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,500
The person in charge, he wasn't funny at all and got angry

519
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,180
What was he like?

520
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,790
I can't thank you enough!

521
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,960
The sound is so loud and strong

522
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,850
I really thank you for coming.

523
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,380
Wow ah ah ah ah so strong

524
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,250
Through a succession of exaggerated imitations

525
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:52,050
He is just 0.2 decibels away from matching the current reigning record

526
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,660
108.3 decibels

527
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,310
Next

528
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,980
The unfunny guy?
-That's the guy who invited you to participate in the unfunny bit

529
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,920
Tani reacted like "It's a cold day..." in the lounge

530
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,750
How about I pretend to be in charge and say this to you?

531
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,590
Ok i'll do a bit

532
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,260
A few days ago I was condescendingly criticized

533
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,860
Really, it wasn't by a friend either

534
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,660
Well, they could be considered a friend, thank you very much

535
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,330
Then the scene changes

536
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:28,370
Thank you for your hard work.
-Thank you so much

537
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,290
I'm so thankful you're here

538
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,750
That's pretty much it, right?

539
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,690
Eh, what is this?

540
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:49,380
In summary
Hollywood Zakoshi is invincible in this type of project

541
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,670
Impressive

542
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,310
I see

543
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,830
Unsurprisingly, Zakoshi was good at it

544
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,930
It was wonderful, the whole process

545
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,060
As a musician, what do you think?

546
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,240
For typical drinking sessions, the style etc

547
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,160
I do have the impression that there are a lot of people who can make a scene

548
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:10,840
But in terms of comedians or other people from the entertainment industry drinking

549
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,940
I think teams are probably more over the top

550
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,940
Bands?
-Well, musicians

551
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,610
It's not a band, it's a team?

552
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,660
Because you said "team"

553
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,600
In Saitama everyone says "team"

554
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,350
I've kept it going

555
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,730
Zakoshi's throat is really resitant to so much sound

556
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,220
It's really as resistant as B'z's Inaba

557
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,220
※B'z is a Japanese rock group formed by guitarist Takahiro Matsumoto and vocalist Hiroshi Inaba. Inaba-san is known for his unique voice and singing ability.

558
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,270
We've heard enough of that!

559
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,820
Why enough? I'm trying to salvage a previous conversation

560
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:47,080
Next is everybody's theories

561
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,700
Tonight's presenter is

562
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,330
Super Sasadango Machine

563
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,300
Hello everyone

564
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,850
It's been a long time.
-It's been a long time indeed

565
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,890
Yes, that...

566
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,830
Sorry, your mouth is a bit crooked tonight

567
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,880
Ah, really?

568
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,400
The mask is still new...

569
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,540
There you go

570
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,070
Most of your face is visible

571
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,810
Basically, you can see...

572
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,640
Is it okay to continue shooting like this?

573
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,170
It's fine it's fine

574
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,050
That, because it's been three years

575
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,660
I want to start over again with self-introductions

576
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:27,450
Excuse me, my name is Super Sasadango Machine and I'm a wrestler

577
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,080
Live in Niigata-shi, Niigata, Higashi-ku, Yuraku 2-chome

578
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,690
Now 41 years old, father of two.
-Your whole life story

579
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,500
It's Dad!

580
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,690
Normally a member of Tokyo DDT, a wrestling group

581
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,410
It belongs to Matsutake Arts

582
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,180
Ah, it's Matsutake Arts

583
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,810
Yes, activities are carried out under Matsuzake Arts

584
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,810
I have two surefire techniques

585
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,220
One of them is the "Vertical Drop Rayman Impact" wrestling technique

586
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,380
The other is ppt presentation

587
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,920
In a nutshell, violence and the power of presentation

588
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,780
With these two powers

589
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,420
I can solve most of the world's tasks

590
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,210
I think so

591
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,570
Violence is included

592
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,150
Roughly these two can solve everything

593
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,440
Is that so?
-Yes

594
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,490
The topic we want to solve today is this

595
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,470
The general public's thoughts

596
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,010
Are that wrestling moves can be easily done

597
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,320
Most people think this way

598
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,360
I want to erase this impression completely

599
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,690
For example

600
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,280
Muto Keiji-san's unbeatable technique figure four leg lock

601
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:39,310
It's a joint technique that holds your opponent's leg in the shape of a 4 and tightens it

602
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,360
How powerful is this move?

603
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,010
The memory should still be fresh in your mind

604
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,120
October 9, 1995, a long time ago

605
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,250
New Japan vs. UWF Inter Total Matchup

606
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,760
Exactly two months before I was born

607
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,140
Two months before your birth?
-Yes

608
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,560
Muto Keiji made Heisei's fighting king Takada Yoshihiko surrender by using the move

609
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,150
Although it is such an intense move

610
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,670
You may still think

611
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:06,120
"It's easy to do?", possibly

612
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,230
So, the theory I bring today is this:

613
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:16,050
It is impossible to teach women the figure four leg lock over the telephone

614
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,850
What the hell is this?

615
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,880
It is impossible to teach women the figure four leg lock over the telephone

616
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,410
So, with haste

617
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,090
We hand a phone to the Asagaya sisters who know nothing

618
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,790
Instructions will come through the phone that was just given to you

619
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,090
Eh? Instructions?

620
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,130
Someone will call?

621
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:48,000
Yes, you will then follow the instructions

622
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,600
Eh? Eh?

623
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,580
The instructions are...

624
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,830
How to perform the figure four leg lock

625
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,180
This is the way to decide the winner. This is my...

626
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,610
Figure four leg lock

627
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,200
It involves fixing the opponent's leg in the shape of a number 4 and tightening it

628
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,690
It is one of the most famous wrestling moves

629
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,420
To teach this move by phone is this man

630
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,670
Keiji Muto

631
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,100
Are you confident?

632
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,500
I call myself "Japan's No. 1 figure four leg locker"

633
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,590
So, the verification begins quickly

634
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,780
Ah its here

635
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,810
Hello, this is Kimura

636
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:41,250
Hello, I'm the wrestler Muto

637
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,890
Oh, hello

638
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,920
Is it Miho of the Asagaya sisters?
-Yes

639
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,230
There's no time so i'll start

640
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:57,930
Who is it?
-I'm going to teach you a wrestling move

641
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,930
Rule 1 Restricted Time 5 minutes

642
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,200
Be sure to do as I say

643
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,850
You have a partner, right?

644
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,170
Yes, I do

645
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,280
First, let the partner lie down on her back

646
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,750
We're starting now?

647
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,860
Let's start now... because there's not much time left

648
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,750
Okay, so I can do it?

649
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,490
What? What "can I do it"?

650
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,420
That... fall down on your back... fall down...

651
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:18,890
Fall down fall down

652
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,690
What? What's going on?

653
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,260
Fall down quickly

654
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,890
Ok ok, get down quickly
-What?

655
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,860
Shoes... its better to take off

656
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,900
Shoes are best taken off

657
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,400
Have your partner take off her shoes.
-Okay

658
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:34,270
Rule 2        Only give clues

659
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:34,270
And then... on your partner's crotch

660
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,840
Crotch, okay.
-Crotch?

661
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,480
Put your right foot at the base of your hips
-Good

662
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,450
Can you say anything other than "yes", Miho?

663
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,390
What do you want?
-The crotch... ah...

664
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,320
Is that so?

665
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,160
Put your right foot in the crotch area

666
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:57,790
What do you want?

667
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:59,230
Left foot on the outside of the opponent's right foot

668
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,220
You're too noisy!

669
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,900
The right foot is under the hips, right?

670
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,670
The crotch... stand by yourself...

671
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,240
Stand on your own, stand on your own

672
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:15,480
Then bend from the waist down

673
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,820
Can you grab the opponent's left heel?

674
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,350
Eh?

675
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,820
Left foot, eh?

676
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,120
Bend down, after bending down, how to put it...

677
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,890
Put the head... the head...

678
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,330
Extend your foot a little bit, this foot

679
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,230
Like this? Is it like this?

680
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,040
Twister?

681
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,730
It's kind of...

682
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,170
I just grabbed the heel from the crotch

683
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,240
Then grab it while landing on your buttocks

684
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,750
From here, this way?

685
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,980
Ah, it feels like a trick of some kind

686
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,880
Then the opponent's left foot is like the shape of a V

687
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,820
A V on its side

688
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,060
The V is slightly more medial than the heel

689
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,300
Put your left foot on it

690
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,100
Hey? Like this?

691
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,370
The left foot put on top

692
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,810
So like this, the other person is in pain, right?

693
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,080
Not at all. Even a little sleepy

694
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
Very sleepy

695
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,750
It doesn't seem to hurt at all

696
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,690
What's more

697
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,580
Done?

698
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,220
It shouldn't be like this

699
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,090
Really?

700
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,990
What do you think, referee?

701
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,930
Is the move complete?

702
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:38,960
Rule 3  the judge decides

703
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,960
No! Fight!

704
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,530
Fight? Fight?

705
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,300
Eh? No?

706
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,900
It's tough

707
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,610
What the hell?

708
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,710
I'm obviously trying super hard to explain

709
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,710
Sure enough, it's impossible

710
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,490
The next challengers are

711
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,050
Ganbare Luya

712
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,900
This time we switch the figure four leg lock

713
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,520
Do the swastika hold

714
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,840
A telephone explanation by its creator, Genichiro Tenryu

715
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,170
It's impossible to hear anything he says

716
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,300
The meaning wont come through at all

717
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,540
No problem, don't worry

718
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,530
Have you ever been put in a figure four leg lock?
-No

719
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,320
But i've been licked

720
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,770
Licked? What do you  mean licked? Licked what?

721
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,310
So... knees

722
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,310
What the hell are you talking about?

723
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:47,320
Now, Tenryu explains the swastika hold to Ganbare Luya by phone

724
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,080
The point of this has changed

725
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,930
Hello

726
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,900
Yoshiko

727
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,340
That... I'm Tenryu

728
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:02,810
Now, can you move around like I say?

729
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,500
Quite frightening

730
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,150
Sounds like a kidnapper...

731
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,820
Where is Mahiru?

732
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,590
Hey... how to say, can she get on all fours?

733
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,160
Mahiru on all fours

734
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,890
Ok

735
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:18,730
Then Yoshiko
- I'll do it

736
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:23,970
Can you go around to the left side of Mahiru?

737
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,400
Mahiru's left side

738
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,740
Go around to the left

739
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:37,510
Can you use your right foot to hook Mahiru's left foot?

740
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,690
It hurts. What's wrong?

741
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,850
It hurts...

742
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,710
Good kick

743
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:50,960
Yoshiko mishears "hook" as "kick"

744
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,140
Probably doesn't know hook

745
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,530
Start all over again!

746
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,030
I don't understand, can you please speak a little louder?

747
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,670
If Mahiru doesn't stand right its not possible

748
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,210
If Mahiru doesn't stand we can't do it?

749
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,170
Bending a little is better

750
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,340
Mahiru needs to bend a little better

751
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,550
Focus your strength on the lower body

752
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,320
@#$%*&...the pose

753
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:17,090
I'm sorry, could you be a little more clear? I'm sorry...

754
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,860
Mahiru's body bends forward

755
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:28,560
Wrap your right foot around Mahiru's left ankle

756
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,300
My right foot is wrapped around Mahiru's left foot, right?

757
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,870
So is my right foot in front of or behind Mahiru's left foot...
-The front

758
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,640
Wrap from the front

759
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,260
Good question

760
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:47,120
Go through the front and stop right at Mahiru's ankle

761
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,020
Ah, I see. Okay, okay

762
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,790
It's hooked, right?
-Yes, yes, yes

763
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,560
Mahiru is bent forward

764
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,960
Mahiru bends forward

765
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:01,260
You'll be under Ma's right armpit

766
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,540
Use your left hand to pass through to the neck area

767
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,600
What kind of posture is Mahiru in at this time?

768
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,310
Just stay bent forward

769
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,640
Then you bend down a little more

770
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,670
Hands should not touch the ground

771
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,280
Pretty good?

772
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,010
Cannot touch the ground

773
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,020
Concentrate power on the abdomen

774
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,650
Concentration of force on the abdomen

775
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,580
Ah, I got it. I did it

776
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,410
@#$%*&...and it's okay, right?

777
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,590
Huh? What did you say?

778
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,820
You are wearing good quality clothes so you should be fine

779
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,760
What?

780
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,290
Ah, forget it. Nothing.
-Sorry

781
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,990
Don't say irrelevant things

782
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:39,540
Then put your left foot on Mahiru's head

783
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,070
Put it on Mahiru's head

784
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,770
Prepare then hitch it up

785
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,880
OK？

786
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,050
Referee

787
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,010
OK

788
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,680
OK

789
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:01,790
The Tenryu and Ganbare Luya Team complete swastika hold in 4 minutes and 12 seconds

790
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:08,000
Therefore, the next step is to raise the difficulty of the move to another level

791
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,570
Winners and losers are yet to be determined...

792
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,910
Bow and Arrow

793
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:19,200
Fixed head and foot lift

794
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,980
Lifting the opponent with the knee

795
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,540
A rather complex trick

796
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,540
Looks so painful

797
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,840
Challenging this trick are these two

798
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,820
The same persona

799
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,200
The caller is this old acquaintance

800
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,410
The plan is explained

801
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,670
Ah, no problem at all. It will be done immediately

802
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:44,470
"Bow and arrow hold", right?

803
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,700
Well, well, well. "Bow and Arrow" is a sure win!

804
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,890
Really?

805
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:51,180
So the validation begins

806
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,360
I am the beast god, Liger

807
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,480
Then I'm counting on you

808
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,280
What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

809
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:02,350
Let Nishino lie prostrate on the mat

810
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,820
Lie on your stomach here

811
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:14,460
Suzuki, standing right at the waist.
-I see

812
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,530
Stand well

813
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:20,540
Suzuki's toes
-Yes

814
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:26,080
Slightly tense both toes
-Tighten up, ok, tightening up

815
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,840
A state like this

816
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,180
Put your toes tucked in under her stomach

817
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,380
Is that so?
-Terrible, terrible

818
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:39,790
Tuck your toes under the belly
-Tucked in

819
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:46,430
Hold this position and slightly seat yourself on Nishino's waist

820
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,930
Okay, I'm in position
-It hurts

821
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,070
So painful, so painful, so painful

822
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:56,380
Then bend Nishino's left foot up

823
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:03,850
After that, the difficult "Bow and Arrow" hold is taught with precise instructions

824
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,850
Then

825
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:10,250
Then, Suzuki, hold the chin position and flip backwards.
-Ok

826
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,860
Nishino's waist is just above your calf in the posture

827
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,660
Can I put the phone down for a while?
-Yes

828
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,330
Then i'll do it
-My jaw is about to burst

829
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,300
Say "one, two"!

830
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,770
Okay, I'll start

831
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:24,730
Ah, scary

832
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,870
One, two

833
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:33,840
Great!

834
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,080
Thank you very much

835
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,580
Relying on Liger's mind and Suzuki Nana's physical ability

836
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,600
Outstandingly, the "Bow and Arrow" hold was successfully completed

837
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,660
In summary
Depending on the number of moves some can be taught successfully

838
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,410
Only the four figure leg lock did not work
-Yes

839
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,090
Awesome

840
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,100
Ikoma, is it doable?

841
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,210
Remember?

842
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,280
Remember?

843
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,210
Most people who watched it should be able to complete the four figure leg lock now

844
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,050
The four figure leg lock?
-Yes

845
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,870
Yes, I would like to try it

846
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:05,690
Please do!

847
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,830
With whom?

848
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,990
With my mom, like this

849
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,970
To your mother? You can't do that to your mom!

850
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,430
Mom's knees would break

851
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:17,010
A late Mother's Day gift

852
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,630
A Mother's Day gift?

853
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,750
Sounds good

854
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,900
What the hell?

855
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,110
What is this, what's going on?

856
00:46:24,260 --> 00:47:09,940
