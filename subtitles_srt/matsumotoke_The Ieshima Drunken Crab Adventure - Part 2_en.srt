1
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,220
This is the first time

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,630
I've felt this bad for the staff

3
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,420
Drunken crab pursuit!

4
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,020
Right now, we're going to a place called "Ieshima"

5
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,420
We can only go by ship

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,700
Wow! There's so many people!

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,900
Wait there's so many

8
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,900
What the heck

9
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,740
What a sight!

10
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,440
We're currently here at Maurakou

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,440
Oh, it's here

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,610
So, the place we're headed to right now

13
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,810
is called  "Shimizu no Hama"

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,880
Well, you don't wanna walk right?

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,780
They have stuff like this?

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,780
Oo what's that?

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,750
That's perfect!

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,660
But the maximum weight capacity is 200kg

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,960
And we don't have the budget for 2 cars

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Should we ask someone to give us a ride?

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,460
You're looking for a driver?

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,460
Of course

23
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,200
Won't we eventually get there if we just keep walking?

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,040
No we're going the opposite direction.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,870
Ya idiot

26
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,480
O-Over there (SADAKO)

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,650
There's a car

28
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,320
A car is coming

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,550
Finding someone in a car...

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,550
Yeah, might be better

31
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,060
Yeah, let's go with that. Hello

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,060
Maybe he's working?

33
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,560
What are you up to?

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,160
Ah, I see.. can we fit?

35
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,930
Can we ride with you?

36
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,700
Where are you headed? (DRIVER)

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,240
Can the 4 of us go?

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,540
To Shimizu

39
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,540
Ah, Shimizu-san (DRIVER)

40
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,210
Is that okay?

41
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,210
Sure, that's okay (DRIVER)

42
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,880
You can all fit (DRIVER)

43
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,880
Are you serious?

44
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,510
Wait you would really lift us?

45
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,510
Yeah, sure why not (DRIVER)

46
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,010
Are you sure? We have 4 people

47
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,450
It doesn't seem like all 4 of us can go.

48
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,450
You think?

49
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,450
軽か

50
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
So we gotta split up

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,060
Shall we rent one car and have this car go with us?

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,230
Oh, that rent-a-car

53
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,560
So then...

54
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,560
Me alone... (SADAKO)

55
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,430
In the rented car?

56
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,430
Ya (SADAKO)

57
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,630
Well, alright

58
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,330
You three go ahead (SADAKO)

59
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,370
Let's do that. Okay, we'll go.

60
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,170
Sorry about that

61
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,070
See you later then, Sadako.

62
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,790
The road is so narrow

63
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,320
Only compacts can go through here

64
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,260
Just barely enough space

65
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,260
Wow, cars are amazing

66
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,260
Right?

67
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,670
Is Shimizu-san pretty popular?

68
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,330
Very popular (DRIVER)

69
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,330
Oh is that so?

70
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,310
You've never had drunken crab have you mommy?

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,340
Never had it

72
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,710
I thought so

73
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,640
Honestly, what if it was really bad?

74
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,950
There's no way. Man, you're SO DUMB.

75
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,810
SO. DUMB.

76
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,020
You. You...You're..

77
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,120
SO DUMB!

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,250
How many times are you gonna say that

79
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,120
Really. Wait! ...

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,760
You're SO. DUMB.

81
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,560
You just wanted to say that

82
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,830
The scenery changed a little

83
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,740
You can shoot a movie here...

84
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,110
It's a very nice atmosphere

85
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,640
Please, come film over here (DRIVER)

86
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Yes, seems like a perfect place to film

87
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,020
Wow this is really nice. Oh, the beach is coming up.

88
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,880
We're almost there maybe

89
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,450
It's there, no?

90
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,450
Where where where?

91
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,590
No, this right-hand side

92
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,630
See, right here

93
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,930
Ahh we're here

94
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,930
We're here?

95
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,260
It's this

96
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,260
This this this

97
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,200
Shimizu-san～

98
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,470
We've arrived

99
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,170
Let's go in here. Is that okay?

100
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,340
This helped us tremendously

101
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,340
We're thankful

102
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,210
We're so thankful

103
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,210
Seriously, sir

104
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,440
Thank you so much

105
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,450
Thank you very much

106
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,450
Sorry to trouble you (DRIVER)

107
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,620
Please, enjoy your time! (DRIVER)

108
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,620
Thank you, good bye!

109
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,260
Mannn

110
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,260
We were saved thanks to him

111
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,260
I wonder if Sadako is here yet

112
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,870
Seems pretty nice

113
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,870
Right? It's very nice

114
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,880
Wahh, I like it

115
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,450
What is this place?! It's SO nice

116
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,560
Hello!

117
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,590
Mama saw this place

118
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,590
We're finally here~

119
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,930
and she truly wanted to try

120
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,930
I saw it on TV and

121
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,100
I thought "I must have this"

122
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,100
Thank you very much (OWNER)

123
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,230
Dreams really do come true

124
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,230
I'm very glad (OWNER)

125
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,900
Very nice

126
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,460
Sadako hasn't arrived yet...

127
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,460
That's fine

128
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,590
That's totally fine

129
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,590
That's ok right?

130
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,560
Master, go ahead and just lock the entrance

131
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,470
Shall we start?

132
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,470
Let's

133
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,700
I feel like having some drinks

134
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,700
Actually,

135
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,940
here at Shimizu-san,

136
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,640
they are very passionate about their sake

137
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,510
They've got 50 varieties!

138
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,910
Sparkling sake piques my interest

139
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,910
Bucu?

140
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,480
Bucu's rosé (OWNER)

141
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,480
Yeah, this one caught my attention

142
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,190
It's sake, but rosé

143
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,820
I've never had anything like that

144
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,820
Let's do it!

145
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,490
Let's drink

146
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,490
Let's

147
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,160
We'll do it

148
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,160
Certainly (OWNER)

149
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,990
Yeah the money...

150
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,990
Plenty!

151
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,230
We have a butt-ton

152
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,230
We're completely covered

153
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,330
So we'll have that, please

154
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,570
I'm SO excited

155
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,570
He seems very passionate

156
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,940
Ugh my fingers smell like octopus!

157
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,240
You were like clenching onto it

158
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,510
What was that all about?

159
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,780
Why all of a sudden...

160
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,780
After you guys left

161
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,680
The person at the shop- ...

162
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,150
Now now.. (OWNER)

163
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,150
Almost like the drunken crab...

164
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,290
This is just a little complimentary dish (OWNER)

165
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,290
What is it?

166
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,230
Oyster marinated in olive oil (OWNER)

167
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,900
Olive oil marinade?

168
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,900
This is beyond freebie level

169
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,670
And then this would be... (OWNER)

170
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,800
It almost makes you want to close one eye. B U C U Bu- (OWNER)

171
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,340
Um, please serve it up immediately

172
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,580
As you wish! Here we go (OWNER)

173
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,180
Nice color! (ONSCREEN)

174
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,480
Rosé. It's really pink

175
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,480
Whaaat is this?

176
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,080
Milky white...

177
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,860
Women would love this kind of color

178
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,690
Ahh it's so good

179
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,690
So good.... wut

180
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,870
First time tasting this flavor

181
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,870
I've never tasted anything like this... wut

182
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,600
Kind of like a cocktail?

183
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,470
I wonder? It's very light

184
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,470
Little bit (thick, viscous, gooey, syrupy.. it's hard to come up with English words describing food without sounding gross)

185
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,670
It's very strange. SO good!

186
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,040
HUUH!?

187
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,040
HUUH!?

188
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,950
We're drinking something very special

189
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,950
This would be so popular with the ladies

190
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,790
Thisthisthisthis!

191
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,790
SO DELICIOUS!

192
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,160
For this, I sautéed garlic and chili flakes (OWNER)

193
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,360
Ajillo style. Then after that, I steamed it with some white wine.

194
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,660
Then I marinated that in olive oil and let that sit for about 2 weeks. (OWNER)

195
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,330
There's no bad in any of this

196
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,670
I'M HERE (sadako) ON SCREEN

197
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,670
Right, I am. (OWNER)

198
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,670
You're an otaku, huh?

199
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,270
That's how it is (OWNER)

200
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,510
I just heard something...

201
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,510
What?

202
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,840
Like "nyahsnyaaaaaahnh"

203
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,410
No one...

204
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,410
He's here he's here

205
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,210
He's here! haha

206
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,780
He's already there. Look at him!

207
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,420
It took him SO long

208
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,120
The hell is he doing?

209
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,120
Those kids-

210
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,490
Since they can't shake hands with Matsumoto-san they're settling with Sadako

211
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,000
Master, this sake was so delicious

212
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,000
Thank you very much (OWNER)

213
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,330
I was taken aback

214
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,330
It was heavenly

215
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,970
The prefecture here has a lot of good sake (OWNER)

216
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,970
The sake is amazing too but...

217
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,970
Master, this would be really

218
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,280
good for pasta, no?

219
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,280
Yes, very good with pasta. (OWNER)

220
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,880
Just mixing it in would be good (OWNER)

221
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,880
Just perfect

222
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,050
So start with sake and for the full-course, what would be up first?

223
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,050
Today I would really love for you to have fish (Owner)

224
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,490
So first I think I would like to start with sashimi. (OWNER)

225
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Please, thank you very much

226
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,030
Well we have a stupid amount of money

227
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,130
Seriously, I really don't want him to die...

228
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,530
Just for right now

229
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,530
Just right now

230
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,200
Ahh I'm starving (SADAKO)

231
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,340
Your entrance is like a comedy theater

232
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,740
You come in out of no where "Ahh I'm starviinng!"

233
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,350
You're super late!

234
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,350
No you see, I rented the car right? (SADAKO)

235
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,380
And I rushed over here by myself right? (SADAKO)

236
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,350
Let's cheers first (SADAKO)

237
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,350
We already freaking did it, it's fine

238
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,060
We finished already

239
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,060
Aw man (SADAKO)

240
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,020
We're waiting for the master's next item

241
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,960
Ah. Itadakimasu (SADAKO)

242
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,400
Oh so-rry to keep you waaaaaiting～　(OWNER)

243
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,330
Okay to put it in the front? (OWNER)

244
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,330
Front is good

245
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,840
Please excuse me! (OWNER)

246
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,640
Wwwooww

247
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,310
Master, this is fish from Ieshima?

248
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,310
100% Ieshima local (OWNER)

249
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,910
Wow it's mantis shrimp!!

250
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,610
I've never seen raw mantis shrimp before

251
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,220
Super first experience

252
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,050
Have you had raw mantis shrimp before?

253
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,050
First time. Never had it

254
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,750
First time seeing it with the head (SADAKO)

255
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,830
Ahh, it's completely different from shrimp! Like in-between shrimp and crab.

256
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,130
Like shrimpcrab right?

257
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,130
Yes, absolutely (OWNER)

258
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,200
Shrimpcrab

259
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,270
When there's a good amount, this'll be delicious to do shabu shabu with. (OWNER)

260
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,340
It's super rare

261
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,340
Yes, exactly (OWNER)

262
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,180
This is so good. I've never had something like this.

263
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,850
Yeah what in the world?

264
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,420
What the heck are you thinking about normally?

265
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,420
Just imagining things all day (OWNER)

266
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,620
Imagination

267
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,620
Be careful

268
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,620
The sauce is so good too

269
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,360
I'm still super mesmerized

270
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,230
Yeah I'm still wowed

271
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,230
We haven't even had the main dish yet

272
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,270
Well then, I'll get the next dish ready! (OWNER)

273
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,840
Please, take your time. Excuse me! (Owner)

274
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,610
That blew me away

275
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,440
Didn't think I'd enjoy it this much before getting to the main event.

276
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,140
Right?

277
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,310
Let's play the crab game before the crab comes (SADAKO)

278
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,450
What's the crab game?

279
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,450

282
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,660
and get another 2-letter food item and fill it in. (SADAKO)

283
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,260
Isn't that too easy?

284
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,930
It has to be 2 letters?

285
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,930
2 letter food item (SADAKO)

286
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,100
Then "cuisine~" (SADAKO)

287
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,170
So I'll start first (SADAKO)

288
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,000

But.. Daddy's verse about peach cuisine was so wrong (SADAKO)

301
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,010
What the heck is peach cuisine? (sadako)

302
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,010
Well what's wrong with that

303
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,450
True, peach cuisine is... questionable

304
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,450
Yeah that...

305
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,990
caught me off guard too but, it fits so it'll go on.

306
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,890
What even was that?

307

311
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,770
This is really just a filler between the main dish (OWNER)

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,770
Hahahaha!

313
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,410

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,010
Very strong heart

00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,010
That's amazing

316
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,520
Your mentality is insane

317
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,520
Oh, what's this?

318
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,720
Sea cucumber?

319
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,350
Please have this with the shredded daikon dish

320
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,690
And please stretch the time with this until the crab is ready (OWNER)

321
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,660

323
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,800
Yeah you can do that, too

324
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,800

What is this?

329
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,510
What could this be

330
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,640
It has a Western taste but, it feels traditionally Japanese as well

331
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,850
Everything here is something I've never tasted before

332
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,750

If he'd act a little more normal this place would be so popular

335
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,900
Oh! It's here!

336
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,560

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,890
I can already smell it

347
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,030
It's like steam-grilled

348
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,240
The juices haven't escaped at all (OWNER)

349
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,740
So for this, I'll have them bring out some white rice (OWNER)

350
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,440
Then you get these eggs and put it on top of the rice (OWNER)

351
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,310

352
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,280

355

IT'S SO GOOD

361
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,160
It's completely different from something like Gejang

362
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,690
It's not so raw like gejang

363
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,300
Wait what, it's so delicious. There's a flavor explosion in my mouth.

367
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,570
It's amazing. This is like shocking

368
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,080
This is the first time I've had blue crab this delicious

369
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
The crab juice is completely trapped in (OWNER - screen)

370
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,580
Yeah, that's what it is huh

371
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,620
Then, in this cute lil' rice...

372
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,990
The eggs, yes (OWNER)

373
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,990
This right?

374
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,290
Then pour the juice on top of it (OWNER)

375
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,900
Just drench it directly from above, it's ok (OWNER)

376
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,230
It's egg over rice

377
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,080
And then over here, there's more eggs on the side here

378
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,450
Ooh, you're right. I'll have that in a bit

379
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,450
I'm gonna go jump off that thing

380
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,260
Risotto, risotto

381
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,600
Whaaat?! Ohh my

382
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,160
Delish isn't it!? (OWNER)

383
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,600
Master, this is crazy

384
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,600
I've never had anything like this

385
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,700
What the heck

386
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,970
Your mom has tried amazing food everywhere from filming TV shows

387
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,710
This is the first time I've felt this bad for the staff

388
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:47,080
I'm sorry... I want to let everyone try this

389
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,660
I'm completely at a loss

390
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,660
At a loss, yeah

391
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,800
While you guys are enjoying the pasta is getting ready right now (OWNER)

392
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,160
Aaaand I'll go ahead and FINISH IT UP FOR YA! (OWNER)

393
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,530
Please go ahead and relax. Just make sure to take your time. (OWNER)

394
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,540
Understood. We know the drill by now

395
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,110
I still can't get into liking him

396
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,510
Even after all he's done for us

397
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,010
He's very funny

398
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,010
I'm super satisfied now

399
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,650
Then we get to have the pasta right?

400
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,820
I wanna come here again

401
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,160
Yes, one more time

402
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,160
Yeah, a 2nd time

403
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,260
Like, for TV work?

404
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,960
Yep

405
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,100
Next week

406
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,470
But we have to say the same exact things we said today

407
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,300
Like to see if we can?

408
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,010
If we can do the same thing?

409
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,010
I need to memorize everything.

410
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,750
Heere it issssss～　(OWNER)

411
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,220
This is the one!?

412
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,220
Are you serious?

413
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,990
Lastly, let me just sear it a little more. (OWNER)

414
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,660
for finishing touches (OWNER)

415
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,390
This pasta takes 2 days to make. (OWNER)

416
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:06,430
I sautéed onions and garlic for 2 hours, then made a broth with (OWNER)

417
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,870
dried flatfish and mantis shrimp for 5 hours. (Owner)

418
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,710
Because of the searing the juice and the eggs just pour out from the bottom nicely

419
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,850
He's really thinking about Instagram aesthetics

420
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,850
Amazing

421
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,210
You're something else, master

422
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,250
And the innards around this too... (OWNER)

423
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,890
Go for it go for it

424
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,890
Please, go for it

425
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,650
Gogogogoogo

426
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,650
Is that fine? It's okay? (OWNER)

427
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,360
Yes, go right ahead

428
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,070
Now now. Excuse me, there you have it (OWNER)

429
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,770
If you can plate it nicely for us...

430
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,310
It's not nice at all, but alright

431
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,310
Hehehe! (OWNER)

432
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,080
This is just great～

433
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,580
It's just salt and pepper really (OWNER)

434
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,580
Huh?

435
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,280
The rest is from the broth (OWNER)

436
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,890
And in the end I zested some yuzu and myoga

437
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,790
Mmm!!

438
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,930
I want 3 thumbs

439
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,470
3 thumbs?

440
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,070
I don't have enough

441
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,070
Thumbs up isn't enough

442
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,550
It has a sweetness, huh?

443
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,550
Yes, yes, sweet (OWNER)

444
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,390
It's absolutely delicious! Never had this before.

445
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,790
And it's not minced meat

446
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,790
So good!!

447
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,260
Ohhh, it's like this!

448
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,330
Extremely different from what I was imagining.

449
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,770
What was I thinking going on a diet

450
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,500
Delliiicciouss!

451
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,310
Ahh, I'm so glad (OWNER)

452
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,610
to hear that you enjoy it (OWNER)

453
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,610
Very true, isn't it

454
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,110
It's very empowering to see people enjoy your cooking

455
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,320
Yes, my number one source of happiness (OWNER)

456
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,720
Master, thank you so much for entering the culinary industry

457
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,460
I'm really just an amateur with hair (OWNER)

458
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,790
I'm truly thankful

459
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:17,260
That joke with the hairy crab term is confusing me

460
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,360
Oh no, that's no good (OWNER)

461
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,880
確カニ… わざとやったらすごい

462
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,310
So is this the finale of the full-course?

463
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:40,480
Actually, normally this would be the end (OWNER)

464
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,650
But I have one more dish for ya! (OWNER)

465
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,860
Special for us?

466
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,860
Just for you all (OWNER)

467
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,760
I don't do this anywhere else. Only today.

468
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,590
Please relax, and enjoy!

469
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,600
It's crab, right?

470
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,600
Crab of some sort

471
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,400
Crab something...

472
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,400
A dessert?

473
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,070
But what could come after this?

474
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,740
I'm feeling a little bashful to show you all this.

475
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,010
First person to discover this place is? (OWNER)

476
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,010
Me

477
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,010
Mommy

478
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:53,680
And then the one who worked hard to bring us all here? (OWNER)

479
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,680
Daddy

480
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,480
And Dad's favorite dish would be?? (OWNER)

481
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,850
I have a lot. Crab omelet over rice?

482
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,850
Correccctt! (OWNER)

483
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,520
Here, in front of Dad. (OWNER)

484
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,720
Made with blue crab: crab omelette over rice! (OWNER)

485
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,400
I did not think of this

486
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,730
It is thanks to dad after all (OWNER)

487
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,440
It's not really fully chinese, but (OWNER)

488
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,240
it's in the broth.

489
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,180
Go ahead, Mommy

490
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,180
What in the world are you doing?

491
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,320
You should've told usss

492
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,150
Like this?

493
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,650
and like this right?

494
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,450
There's no price on this. Priceless.

495
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,200
Do you like it? (OWNER)

496
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,200
Very delicious

497
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,530
I'm so relieved. Thank you very much (OWNER)

498
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,270
It's delicious you bastard!

499
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,270
Hihihi～ thank you very much...

500
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,710
This especially, I won't make it even if someone asks for it. (OWNER)

501
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,810
It's today's original dish (owner)

502
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,380
You don't make this for other TV shows either right?

503
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,920
No, not at all. I don't make it anywhere. (OWNER)

504
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,350
We'll start a killing match right now

505
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,760
Too good!

506
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,030
Just with crab and eggs...

507
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,030
This is way too scary

508
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,030
I'm scared after eating this

509
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,470
That was fantastic. I'm glad we came to Ieshima.

510
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,300
What a performance

511
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,240
Okay, let's go over the bill

512
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,840
Yes

513
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,840
I forgot about that

514
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,650
Very generous!

515
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,650
Wait no discount

516
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,290
No discount,

517
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,290
and it's still this affordable?

518
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,490
and I totally charged you

519
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,490
for that last one

520
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,930
15,000 per person

521
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,930
15,000 per person

522
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,930
That's so..

523
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,600
3.....4....

524
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,600
Very affordable

525
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,530
5.. ok thank you so much

526
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,640
Thank you for the meal

527
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,640
1..2..3..4..5-

528
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,640
So glad we have enough

529
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,310
(笑い)

530
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,010
Was trying to figure out how I should interject

531
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,610
I thought I should probably

532
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,610
go alongfor the counting part
