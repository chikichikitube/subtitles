1
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,090
Within "Documental",

2
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,760
What have been your favorite funny moments so far, Mastumoto-san?

3
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,130
For example, something that someone did

4
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,600
Well...

5
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,570
I think those would be the parts
that weren't intended to be funny.

6
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,540
The moments they tried to do something fun

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,510
but it didn't really work out, and then they panicked.

8
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,980
Those weren't planned at all.

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,600
I think unintended disasters like that
end up being pretty funny.

10
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,650
It got in my eyes! It got in my eyes!

11
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,020
It got in my eyes! It got in my eyes!

12
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,420
But if you don't do anything,
then nothing will happen.

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,900
So I think that in the end

14
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,200
we have to try to make a disaster happen.

15
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,900
But if you deliberately attempt to create chaos
from the very beginning,

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,440
it's going to look fake.

17
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,610
You don't know, Kitamura-san!

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,880
So we try to face the situations up front,

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,850
and laugh along with them.

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,680
I think that's what's really funny.

21
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,090
It got in my eye! It got in my eye!

22
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,890
He put on this makeup for one show

23
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,360
And the next show also needs him to be in this makeup, right?

24
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,630
We're going with orange, then!

25
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,940
It would be amazing if you could eat it

26
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,410
He laughed!

27
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,680
Come on!

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,380
Didn't you say?

29
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,650
That's so embarrassing

30
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,620
But you!

31
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,860
The most noticeable thing is
the hangnail!

32
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,230
What a shame!

33
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,240
Ugh, Kitamura-san is coming

34
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,910
He's totally coming here

35
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,480
Nobu!

36
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,010
Today's special is!

37
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,380
Just a penis here

38
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,450
You're out!!

39
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,750
Eh, he's out?!

40
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,700
Nobu went and did it,
it was pretty insane.

41
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,600
Everyone was like that.
The four of us who went to watch.

42
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,740
Will this still work?

43
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,870
Drop it.
Let's give up already.

44
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm taking it back.

45
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,110
Here we go!

46
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,110
Alright, what should we order?

47
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,650
The curry looks pretty good.

48
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,420
What do you want to eat?

49
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,150
What about a Katsudon or something?

50
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,220
Katsudon?
Yeah.

51
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,290
No!

52
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,630
Why not?

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,630
They don't have any Katsudon?

54
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,900
Then what about some squid?

55
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,200
Squid?
Yeah.

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,410
No!

57
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,980
No. This isn't working.

58
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,580
What do we do, then?

59
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,180
So they only have pizza?

60
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,790
Pizza and...
There's some stuff here.

61
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,850
Paella.

62
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,320
Let's just decide something...

63
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,120
Anything you want to eat is fine.

64
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,460
You can't eat any meat, Koyabu,
so you choose.

65
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,560
Paella sounds good.

66
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,630
We can go with paella.

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,360
Let's order some great steak with the paella.

68
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,730
No, we can't do that.
It has too much meat.

69
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,130
It sounds good, though.

70
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,800
What about...
You can't eat it, right?

71
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,270
Chorizo grilled in foil?

72
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,440
No way.

73
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,970
Boneless fried chicken.

74
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,410
Just eat around the bones.

75
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,510
What about the caesar salad?

76
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,580
Sounds good.

77
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,940
Katsudon?

78
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,410
No way.
Inarizushi?

79
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
That's good.

80
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,380
Caesar salad?

81
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,450
Okay.

82
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,420
A caesar salad with inari topping?

83
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Okay.

84
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,830
A caesar salad with inari topping?!

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,670
A large paella with plenty of seafood,
a pizza, regular round shape...

86
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,270
Something like that?

87
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,770
Anything else?

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,970
Pizza and paella.

89
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Is that enough?

90
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,440
-Then, that's our order
-This is a real phone, right?

91
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,180
I've never ordered any deliveries, though.
Is that okay?

92
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,850
You've never ordered any deliveries?

93
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,610
Yeah, I used to leave all that to my mom.

94
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,150
Wanna give it a try?

95
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,820
The number's...

96
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,520
You're far-sighted?

97
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,020
I can still see it, though.

98
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,330
Why are you looking so far away, then?

99
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,160
Because it gets all trippy when I'm this close.

100
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,030
No, I can't see it.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Too close!

102
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,340
I can't see it.

103
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,510
Too close!

104
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,890
There it is, there it is!

105
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,020
I'm going to order this for real, Goto-san.

106
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,790
Yeah that's fine, that's our order.

107
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,060
Wanna go take a look while the food comes?

108
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,430
Whose? Yours?

109
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,230
Just to kill time, though.

110
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,660
Hello, thanks for calling us.

111
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,200
I'm Ando from Ariake Pizzeria
and I'm in charge of your order.

112
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,600
Thank you very much.
I'd like to make a regular order...

113
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,040
Okay. Thank you very much.

114
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,210
Our orders are taking about 40 to 50 minutes
to arrive right now.

115
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
40 minutes?

116
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,350
Why don't you try asking him

117
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,710
to make it a little bit quicker?

118
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,250
I'm sorry, that's just a bit too long.

119
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,720
I wish we could get it a bit quicker,

120
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,020
if that's possible at all.

121
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,020
We're going to make our best effort

122
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,690
to have it get there as fast as possible.

123
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,630
Try asking how many minutes quicker they can make it.

124
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,330
I'm sure they have their own schedule.

125
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,030
But it won't hurt just to confirm.

126
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Don't ask, don't ask.

127
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,340
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,640
Hello?

129
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,310
Sorry if this is an inconvenience
as a first time caller...

130
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Yes?

131
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,550
Could you give me a number of minutes?

132
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,280
I'm sorry, but we have other customers.

133
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,450
And we've already confirmed delivery times
to them, so...

134
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,100
No, we're talking about the pizza right now.

135
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
You left the fridge wide open.

136
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,360
I want a round M size pizza.

137
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,430
Go with an L!

138
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,130
Change that M to L, please.

139
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,300
Large size, right?

140
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,370
Yes, thank you very much.

141
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Understood.

142
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,770
We have three types of pizza.

143
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,480
Soft crust, bread-style dough,

144
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,950
cheese crust, Italian bread-style,

145
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,020
Hey, I'm telling you the fridge's open!

146
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,790
and thin and crunchy crispy-style.

147
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,190
Please choose one type.

148
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,960
Bread-style or crispy?

149
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,260
I prefer crispy.

150
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,330
Let's go with crispy.

151
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,430
The fridge's open.

152
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,360
Is that okay, Kato-san?
Crispy?

153
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,330
What other options are there aside from crispy?

154
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,070
Let's go with the soft crust.

155
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,970
No, leave it.

156
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,440
Yeah, soft crust.

157
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,240
No, it was crispy!

158
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,080
They're gonna get mad, for real.

159
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,150
Change it to crispy, please.

160
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,180
Take this more seriously!

161
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,250
Hey, it's still open.

162
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,250
We might be recording at the studio, though.

163
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,090
What are you doing?

164
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,630
Do you want your crispy dough type

165
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,370
extra crispy?

166
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,400
Alright then.
Thank you very much!

167
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
This one next.

168
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,810
Why don't you close it?
Alright.

169
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,250
What are you doing?

170
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,320
What are you doing?

171
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,120
I'm getting pissed off...

172
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,190
Stop that.

173
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,660
Give me a break already.

174
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,260
It's all warm now...

175
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,230
It's hot! So hot!

176
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,530
And you're so close to it, too.

177
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Who are you calling?

178
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,540
I'm ordering the paella.

179
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,710
Why is that sticking out of your nose?!

180
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,780
That's because you're rushing me!
I have to wait and stand by here!

181
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
We're not close to you right now.

182
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,180
What do you mean?

183
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,210
Please call back later.

184
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,520
Why did she say close to me?

185
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,280
Come on, Goto!

186
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,350
It's Goto-san!

187
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,090
Goto-san!

188
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,430
What did they mean during a delivery?!

189
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,170
To be honest, I was thinking
it was going to be Goto

190
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,610
Let's take a look, then

191
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,340
Who are you calling?

192
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,640
I'm ordering the paella

193
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,610
Why is that sticking out of your nose?!

194
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,750
That's because you're rushing me!
I have to wait and stand by here!

195
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,020
We're not close to you right now.

196
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,090
What do you mean?

197
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,150
Please call back later.

198
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,420
Why did she say close to me?

199
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,830
This one's spicy!

200
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,630
You're safe just this once, Goto!

201
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,800
Next time, it doesn't matter who it is,
just a tiny smile and you're out!

202
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,970
Alright then, thank you very much.

203
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,240
That was very close.

204
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,510
I had never heard that before!

205
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,610
Saying "close to you" during a delivery call?!

206
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,980
Were they talking about their physical store?

207
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,690
Here we go!

208
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,800
Can I show you something until the delivery gets here?

209
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,100
I was taking a look at this sign book I had
that pissed me off back in the day.

210
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,700
I think the system of making boring kids write

211
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,040
was pretty annoying to begin with.

212
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,780
There are third year sign books?

213
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,080
Sure there are, we had them at my school.

214
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,580
There's a lot of nonsense here.

215
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,650
The guys from the previous year
really got on my nerves.

216
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,880
Brings back memories.

217
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,590
Can I show it to you guys?

218
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,690
Look at this.

219
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,160
This guy is from my same class.

220
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,360
"I am god."

221
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,230
"One trio, please."

222
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,230
I don't think you can figure out their meaning now.

223
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,900
"Boy, embrace ambition."
That's not something you'd say.

224
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,700
I don't even see you saying "boy."

225
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,470
Well, this is pretty much it.

226
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,080
I don't think he was thinking about anything
when he wrote this.

227
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,350
There's also some in English.

228
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,610
"Take a chance."

229
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,550
And then a sideways "get a chance."
You got along pretty well, huh?

230
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,920
I really don't see the point.

231
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,250
Well, you were in high school.

232
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,390
This one really annoyed me.
"Men don't lose a duel until the very end."

233
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,600
No, you're definitely going to lose at some point.

234
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,000
What about you?

235
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,840
Where are you?

236
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,940
Koyabu-san?

237
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,310
What's written on mine?

238
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,540
Which one is it?

239
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,710
There it is!

240
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,810
This one here.

241
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,720
The one after the "Sail your ship into the windy sea."

242
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,750
Everyone called me one by one
to ask me what I was thinking.

243
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,320
Why don't you read it?

244
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,990
Koyabu, Koyabu.
Read this.

245
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,660
We'll I'm a performer, you see.

246
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,190
"I ain't gon' die" (Editor's Note: Quote from "101st Marriage Proposal". Hamada explains the plot in "Shocking Confessions 2" GnT ep 698)

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,360
Well, that's basically it.

248
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,560
"Move forward."

249
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:48,800
"Move forward."
"Move forward."

250
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,700
"Move forward."

251
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,830
Everyone was moving forward.

252
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,470
Everyone was moving forward.

253
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,710
That's the most likely scenario.

254
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,740
This is pretty bad.

255
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,440
I don't know if they still have a sign system

256
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,950
like these sign books nowadays,

257
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,310
but I think they should just drop it.

258
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,250
It would be better for you if they did, of course.

259
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,990
Things are becoming pretty fun, Koyabu-san.

260
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,160
His was the funniest.

261
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,020
Pretty shocking, right?
Don't go to alumni meetings!

262
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,790
I never thought you were that kind of guy.

263
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,400
What's with him?

264
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,930
With whom?
Michio.

265
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,470
What are you doing, Michio?

266
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,330
I was thinking of preparing an omelet
until the delivery gets here.

267
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
I really don't want your omelets.

268
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,140
We don't need omelets now that the delivery's on its way.

269
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,710
I'm concerned about your hygiene.

270
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,770
That's right.

271
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,680
Let's play a game until its here.

272
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,010
Let's do that!

273
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,810
-It's really simple.
-That's a good idea!

274
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,680
Zakoshi-san knows it, too.
You see, I really like mimicking stuff.

275
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,150
So I was giving it my all to imitate a cat earlier.

276
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,920
I think giving it your all is better.

277
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,130
It doesn't matter what you do,
as long as it's simple.

278
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,860
So if I write "airplane", for example...

279
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,200
You have to mimic an airplane.
-Right.

280
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,800
-So everyone...
-Everyone has to do it?

281
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,370
Take one, one by one.

282
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,670
So we have to give it...

283
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,140
-We have to give it our all, right?
-If possible, yeah.

284
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,400
Oh, that's a "frog", huh?

285
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,470
Anything's fine, though.

286
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,170
Anything's fine?
Okay.

287
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,980
What if someone writes something like "sugar"?

288
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,440
Do that.

289
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,010
Then write sugar!

290
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,220
"Sugar" is impossible.

291
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,880
Who asked you for your opinion?

292
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,590
I'd like to write any requests, too.

293
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,660
Tits.

294
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,620
What do you do with tits?

295
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,070
That's a sweet smell!

296
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,240
Is he vaping?

297
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,370
Is that water tobacco?

298
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,610
No, it's just regular vaping.

299
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,540
Give it a try.
You don't inhale it?

300
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,810
Should I inhale it?

301
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,110
It's making a weird noise.

302
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,810
It's going to explode...

303
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,060
This is pretty strong.

304
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,160
Did you inhale it to your lungs?
You can't do that?

305
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
Anyone smokes here?

306
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
What do we do?

307
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,600
-Push here.
-Push it.

308
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:16,540
Here?

309
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,310
Isn't this pretty hot?!

310
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,150
I've never smoked regular cigarettes before.

311
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,790
So this is pretty scary.

312
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,530
That's hot!

313
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,430
-That's hot.
-Yeah, that's hot.

314
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,970
It's worse than I imagined.

315
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,230
Pretty hot, huh?
That's really hot.

316
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,200
That's because you don't smoke, obviously.

317
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,270
So what about the mimic?

318
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,340
It's done.

319
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,570
Alright. Ready?

320
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,510
Then... Who is going to start?

321
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,050
This is weird.

322
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,750
What was that?!

323
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,090
For real?!

324
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,830
Sorry.

325
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
That was real?

326
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,940
Do you only get buggers on your right nostril?

327
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,040
Yes.

328
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Why?

329
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,180
They've only been coming out from your right.

330
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,380
All the way from my nose?

331
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,780
Why does that happen?
That's insane.

332
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,850
They're all gooey.

333
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,420
I have like four different nose conditions.

334
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,390
You have... four conditions?

335
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,350
I'm allergic to polen,

336
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,460
I also have sinusitis,

337
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,890
and rhinitis, too.

338
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,100
That's just three, though?

339
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,770
Okay, are we doing this?

340
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,770
Sorry, sorry.
Let's do this.

341
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,240
I don't really get what we're doing,
so just once...

342
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,470
Okay, so let's play something fun

343
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
until the delivery gets here!

344
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
Goat!

345
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,750
Are you taking that long?

346
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,560
He's not there yet.
Not without some sound.

347
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,660
What kind of door is that?
He opened a door.

348
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,530
That's the farm thing...

349
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,570
A fence?
Yeah, a fence.

350
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,930
One of those with a door.

351
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,980
Alright.

352
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,150
That's all?

353
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Huh? What just happened?

354
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,520
What the hell is this game?

355
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,080
You just have to do it.

356
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,420
Once you do it, you have to stay
in character for the next turn.

357
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,730
You have to stay in character?

358
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,260
That's a bother!

359
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,900
So he's still the goat?

360
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,170
Me?

361
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,270
I guess this is our fate.

362
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,540
Please do it.

363
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,110
You've been doing it wrong all this time.

364
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,210
It says "Guitar Samurai"

365
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
You're doing it wrong.

366
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,450
I don't know what to do.

367
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,050
That's true.

368
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,720
So I'm the guitar samurai, didn't you say?

369
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,790
Yousui-san?

370
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,790
Didn't you say?

371
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,300
Too bad. Are you doing okay?

372
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,830
Come on Yousui-san.

373
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,900
Too bad, too bad, too bad!

374
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,370
Too bad, too bad, too bad!

375
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,840
I'm the guitar samurai!

376
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,310
Too bad, too bad, too bad!

377
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,580
Too bad, too bad, too bad!

378
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,450
Too bad, too bad, too bad!

379
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,420
Too bad, too bad, too bad!

380
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,550
This is annoying.

381
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,650
Didn't you say?

382
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,620
Didn't you say?

383
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,820
Didn't you say?

384
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,390
Didn't you say?

385
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,690
Didn't you say?

386
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,260
What the hell is going on?!

387
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,630
Didn't you say?

388
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
What?

389
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,240
It's sugar! Damn it!

390
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,870
What are you doing?

391
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,120
He came out? From where?

392
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,360
What kind of sugar is that?

393
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,370
Is that rice?

394
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,570
It's dissolving in water.

395
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
Are you dissolving in water?

396
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,710
He dissolved, but the water's cold
so he's now frozen?

397
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,140
That's sugar?

398
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,310
Stand back up.

399
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,650
Didn't you say?

400
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,710
Didn't you say?

401
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,720
Didn't you say?

402
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,190
"Panda"

403
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,160
-That's a panda?
-A panda?

404
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,200
A panda's tits!

405
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,640
Who the hell are you?

406
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,810
That's delicious.

407
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,870
Do the damned panda!

408
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,110
Hey, you.

409
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,080
Everyone's doing it, so take it seriously.

410
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,910
I'm doing it.

411
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
What are you talking about?

412
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,750
I'm doing it!

413
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,950
Why don't you cut it out?!
I'm a panda

414
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,860
that's touching a panda's tits.

415
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,690
That doesn't make sense.
You're insane.

416
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
If you're not doing the panda

417
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,830
You have to act like a panda.

418
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,890
That can't be called a panda.

419
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,630
No, no, no, I was doing it.
I was a panda cub.

420
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,330
Pandas don't say "panda tits."

421
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,270
Okay, I'll do it all over again.

422
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,000
Why do you get your next turn right away?

423
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,640
-Then what do you want me to do?
-You saw what you have to do!

424
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,740
Why doesn't Kato get another one?

425
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,810
Just Kato-san.

426
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,340
Pick one more.

427
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,410
Do it, do it.

428
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,410
Goto is doing sugar right now.
I'm sugar, yeah.

429
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,550
Sea.
Do it.

430
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,620
Go, sea.

431
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,280
Oh yeah.

432
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,160
You're soaking wet!

433
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,060
Oh yeah!

434
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,640
Tenryuu Genichiro? (EN: Professional Wrestler with a "unique" way of speaking)

435
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,710
Tenryuu...

436
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,340
Tenryuu!

437
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,580
Tenryuu!

438
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,950
Tenryuu wouldn't say Tenryuu.

439
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,880
Tenryuu!

440
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,820
Tenryuu!

441
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,350
No. I'm not Tenryuu.

442
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,990
Tenryuu?

443
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,390
You're supposed to be Tenryuuu!

444
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,460
Is he smiling?

445
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,960
Tenryuu?

446
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,930
He's smiling.

447
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,000
He smiled!

448
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,900
You're smiling!
For sure!

449
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,970
Well I have to make a face.

450
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,140
No, no, no!

451
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,210
I had to hold back a couple times.

452
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,640
Yeah, for sure.

453
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,340
You were definitely smiling.

454
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,280
You fooled me.
Is he safe?

455
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,350
He's out, out!

456
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,250
This is hell.

457
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,520
I didn't quite catch that.
I didn't see.

458
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,820
Was Katou smiling?

459
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,790
I was imitating Tenryuu.

460
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,360
That's not Tenryuu at all.

461
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,620
That's just... well...

462
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,090
We're telling you that face is out!

463
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,330
That's right.

464
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,900
Tenryuu...

465
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,270
Tenryuu!

466
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,570
No. I'm not Tenryuu.

467
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,240
Tenryuu?

468
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,800
You're supposed to be Tenryuu.

469
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,870
Is he smiling?

470
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,070
Tenryuu?

471
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,840
He's definitely smiling.

472
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,480
You're smiling.

473
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,190
Smiling, for sure.

474
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,920
Does that count at all?

475
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,220
You might have been smiling.

476
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,760
Damn!
That's close!

477
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,060
Second one.

478
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,030
Even Katou has gathered some points, though.

479
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,230
You're under attack.

480
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,170
Tenryuu?

481
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,630
That's definitely not Tenryuu.

482
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,640
You smiled,
so take this as an opportunity to stop that face.

483
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,940
For real!

484
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,110
We agree.

485
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,010
-It's horrifying.
-It is.

486
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Sorry.

487
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,790
Alright, let's try again.

488
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,190
Yeah!

489
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,520
One more.

490
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,990
Here we go!

491
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,330
Can I do Nakao Akira to clean the palate? (EN: Japanese Actor)

492
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,730
To clean the palate, yeah.
Do it if you feel like it.

493
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,170
Clean the palate?
Can I do it?

494
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,240
Nakao Akira is normally like:

495
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,640
"That's Shino, right?"

496
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,980
"And Shino is that, right?"

497
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,580
Or something like that.
But my Nakao Akira is...

498
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,750
"That's Shino, right?"

499
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,920
"And Shino is that, right?"

500
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,560
Is your hand meant to be speaking?

501
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,360
"That's Shino, right?"

502
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,300
I want to mimic something else.
Can I do it?

503
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,970
Mimic?
Yeah, but I need to get ready.

504
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,140
Are you taking long?

505
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,040
No, not really.
One more?

506
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,210
While we wait.

507
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,780
Here's a very exaggerated Miyagawa Daisuke-san. (EN: Comedian. He was in previous seasons of Documental)

508
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,480
Miyagawa Daisuke-san is normally like:

509
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,720
"That's no good!" or something like that.

510
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,150
But my exaggerated Miyagawa Daisuke is...

511
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,020
"That's no good!!"

512
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,530
That's no good!!

513
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,470
That's no good!!

514
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,050
It's no good.

515
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,220
Alright.
I survived.

516
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,480
Don't do that.

517
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,120
-It was an exaggeration.
-Really exaggerated.

518
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,920
Yeah, an exaggeration.

519
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,590
-Ready?
-We're ready!

520
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,920
Can't wait.

521
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,290
I'm Kim Jong-nam. (EN: Kim Jong-un's older half-brother)

522
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,270
I'm Kim Jong-nam.

523
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,970
He looks the exact same.

524
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,070
He's identical.
Basically the same person.

525
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,340
You might have gotten killed
if you were at that airport. (EN: Kim Jong-nam was assassinated at an airport in 2017)

526
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,710
Masao would've.

527
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,110
Yeah, I know.

528
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,810
You're basically the same person.

529
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Sorry.

530
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,610
May I?

531
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,980
-Sure.
-Just once...

532
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,890
Just look straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

533
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,300
I want to go to Disneyland. (EN: Kim Jong-nam was arrested in Japan when he was using forged documents to visit Disneyland)

534
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,610
I didn't see that.

535
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,080
Sorry for using other people's passports.

536
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,790
You're out, you're out!

537
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,820
Did it!

538
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,670
That was rough!

539
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,000
Zakoshi-san in front of the mirror.

540
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,440
That was amazing.

541
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,770
It's time!

542
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
That was rough.

543
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,980
I didn't have a good shot.

544
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,550
I didn't get a clear shot of Zakoshi smiling.

545
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,720
But it was perfectly clear at the end.

546
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,550
The camera got it at the end.

547
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,990
That's your first time.

548
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,720
It's not my first time, though.

549
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,090
Alright, let's take another look.

550
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
I want to go to Disneyland.

551
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,110
I didn't see that.

552
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,680
Sorry for using other people's passports.

553
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,320
So that's a point for Jirou,
and since it's Zakoshi's first time...

554
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,390
Let's go with... yellow.

555
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,060
It was Matsumoto-san who told me that initially.

556
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,860
That I would've been killed if I went there.

557
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
To the airport.

558
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,840
Here we go.

559
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,270
The delivery's not coming, huh?

560
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,340
Yeah?
Sorry for the wait.

561
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,880
This is the pizzeria.
That's right, I forgot about it.

562
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,150
Sorry.

563
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,650
Sorry for the wait.
So sorry.

564
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,150
Sorry for everything on the phone.

565
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,250
That's okay.
I'm sorry.

566
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,050
Sorry.
Thank you very much.

567
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
How much is it?

568
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
We've already received payment.

569
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,620
That's right.
Thank you very much.

570
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,130
Kitahara-san?
I'm Kitahara.

571
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,190
He's Kitahara-san.

572
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,830
Kitahara-san.
That's the delivery guy.

573
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,270
Kitahara-san, would you like some jelly?

574
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,500
He's not eating jelly.
You can't give him any jelly.

575
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,770
-You can't do it.
-Can't do.

576
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,070
He's going to ruin his uniform.

577
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,470
Not at all.

578
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,140
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

579
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
If you'll excuse me.

580
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,980
How polite.

581
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,910
The pizza's here.

582
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,850
-Who's hungry?
-What was it?

583
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,490
I can't remember.
Yeah, I know.

584
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,420
-That would be pretty bad.
-If it happened.

585
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,360
Things would've gotten lively.
Yeah... Hey.

586
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,290
Just like when you took that hat.
Really?

587
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,390
Really?

588
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,330
Though it's really different from that time, I guess.

589
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,660
How's it looking?

590
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,730
It comes off pretty neatly.

591
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,840
-That's huge!
-Sorry!

592
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,040
I'm taking one slice.

593
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
I'm taking one too, then.

594
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,080
That's good.

595
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,180
It's really good!
Thanks for the food.

596
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,250
That's almost half of it!

597
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,780
Is anyone not eating?

598
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,790
What about Katou?
No way am I eating!

599
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,890
Why are you like that?

600
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,390
Think about the time!

601
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,390
The time?
What are you talking about?

602
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,930
Why?
Time?

603
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,630
We're almost halfway there.

604
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,130
I can't eat this late at night!

605
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,700
It's almost midnight.
Are you stupid?

606
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,570
You're stuffing yourselves at night.

607
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,100
You can't lower your guard
with your eating schedule!

608
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,140
You don't know that?!

609
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,780
Lowering our guard?

610
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,010
You're lowering your guard!

611
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,610
When you're eating...

612
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,380
...it's over for you guys.

613
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,620
What? What?

614
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,790
You were too careless, so it's over.

615
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,620
What are you doing?
That's fine.

616
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,820
All because you're stuffing yourselves like idiots.

617
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:24,890
What?

618
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
I'm going to shoot.

619
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,030
Why? Stop it.
I'm going to shoot this.

620
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,330
But I like that!

621
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,330
I don't care.
If you like it, then say so!

622
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,630
That's what we've been doing all along.

623
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,270
I'm shooting.
I'm shooting.

624
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:38,440
Ouch!

625
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,080
It didn't make a sound.

626
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,010
I'm going to shoot again.
He's popping the balloons.

627
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,780
I'm going to shoot again.

628
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:46,910
He's pulling them.

629
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,350
He's pulling them.
He's pulling them.

630
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,820
It really doesn't make a sound at all.
It's a miracle.

631
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,190
So this wasn't broken?

632
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,160
Changing the subject, huh?

633
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,630
Time for the weird-face bucket.

634
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,060
Wanna do it?

635
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,830
I did it earlier.
Koyabu-san, wanna do it?

636
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,670
The weird-face bucket.

637
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,970
I don't mind, but I don't think
anyone's going to laguh.

638
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Since it's just making weird faces.

639
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,650
Look at this.
How many times are you going to do it?

640
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,210
How many times is normal?

641
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,320
Three times is the standard.

642
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,120
Koyabu-san is going to do it three times.

643
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,950
What's with this?

644
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,720
-If I'm covering my face then...
-It'll work out, it'll work out.

645
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,510
Your scores have been getting lower, huh?

646
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,650
Was that too bad?

647
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,950
-You're grading him?
-Yes.

648
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,550
He can get a high score?

649
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,220
You can't change that.
It got better.

650
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,450
Better?
Yeah.

651
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,760
So should I emphasize them more?
Yeah.

652
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,630
It's not changing.

653
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,700
That's the same.

654
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,100
They're all the same.
That was the same.

655
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
In the same order.

656
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,570
You lowered your guard.

657
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,770
-What?
-By doing that,

658
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,270
You absolutely lowered your guard.

659
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,010
What do you mean?
It doesn't matter anymore.

660
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,510
Any last words?

661
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,910
Are you going to kill him?
I'm going to die?

662
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,680
Do you have any last words?

663
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,280
Tell my family that I'm sorry.

664
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,920
Pretty good, huh?
Yeah.

665
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,960
Huh? It's our turn?

666
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,230
Everyone's looking this way.

667
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,000
Everyone's looking this way.

668
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,140
Sorry about that.

669
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,740
Sometimes I get like that.

670
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
I'm really sorry.

671
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,150
No, it's fine.

672
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,980
It's fine, but we were all wondering
what the hell you were doing.

673
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,350
I thought it was fun.

674
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,820
I've been like this for a long time.

675
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,890
I'm sorry.
Okay, Miyasako-san...

676
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,950
-I'm really sorry about that.
-It's okay.

677
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,590
I've always been the type to get like that.

678
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,290
-Don't touch me.
-No, really...

679
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,430
Are you angry?

680
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,530
-I'm not, I'm not.
-You really are!

681
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,830
I'm really sorry.
I really regret it.

682
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,640
Please forgive me.

683
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,970
Please forgive me for real.

684
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
He said he's not angry.

685
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,140
I'm not angry.

686
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
He said he's not angry.

687
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,840
You are!

688
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,240
You're angry, Goto-san.

689
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,250
If you did it for a good reason,
then that's good enough!

690
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,910
See?! You're angry!

691
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,120
You just got angry!

692
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,950
I'm not angry!

693
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,260
You are, you are!
You definitely are!

694
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,260
He just got annoyed.
Are you angry at that?

695
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,860
See? See?

696
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,960
He's angry.

697
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,760
He's not angry.
I'm really not.

698
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,830
You're angry.

699
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,730
That's scary...
You know I have aichmophobia?

700
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,800
See?

701
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,600
-Aichmophobia?
-Fear of pointy/sharp objects?

702
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,910
What's aichmophobia?

703
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,970
And both were pointy?

704
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,380
Aichmophobia, yes.

705
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
And both things were pointy?

706
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,250
Don't you mean acrophobia
instead of aichmophobia?

707
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,080
-What's aichmophobia?
-That's aichmophobia, right?

708
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,120
Chains!

709
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,790
That's scary.

710
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,890
Don't show up
just to bring stuff like that.

711
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,990
That's pretty crude.

712
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,600
Are we really okay with giving him a weapon?

713
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,330
You lowered your guard.
Don't hold onto that!

714
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,530
That's enough.
What are you doing?

715
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,030
You definitely lowered your guard.

716
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,970
Is that your end goal?

717
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,340
See? You're angry!

718
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,240
I'm not angry.
I'm speaking calmly.

719
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,540
You're angry.

720
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,770
Is that Doraemon?

721
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,580
Doraemon!
That's right.

722
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,850
They're angry,
so go and get them!

723
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,850
-Are you limping?
-Are you angry?

724
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,850
I'm annoyed by a few things,
yeah.

725
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,720
Your skin is pretty unkempt.

726
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,090
Unkempt? Me?

727
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,750
I brought a beautifying face roller.

728
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,460
A mini 4x4?

729
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,030
Watch out, watch out....

730
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,430
This is not a beautifying face roller.
It's a mini 4x4.

731
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,600
Fly away!

732
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,100
Watch out!

733
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,140
-Hey, watch out!
-Are you okay?

734
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,740
I think he's okay.

735
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,270
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

736
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,910
-Are you okay?
-That was scary.

737
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,480
-Are you okay?
-"Are you okay?"

738
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,980
Stop it, you!

739
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,150
-Are you okay?
-Hey, wait a second.

740
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,280
Hey wait. What are you doing?

741
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,590
Something's here.

742
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
When you do something like that....

743
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,820
That's amazing, but Kato....

744
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,760
Look behind you.

745
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,990
I'm Sugishita!

746
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,060
Sugishita?

747
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,300
—Is he your partner?
—I'm the special agent.

748
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,160
My name is Sugishita Ukyo. (EN: Detective from "Doraemon")

749
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,400
Do you have a moment?
Just a moment.

750
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,710
I'm worried about the details.

751
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,410
I'm glad there are so many of you here.

752
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,310
So let's start from here.
You're a beauty, huh?

753
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,380
And you're a beauty, huh? A beauty,
A beauty, a beauty

754
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,620
I'm skipping this one.
You're a beauty, huh?

755
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,780
You...

756
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,620
You know why I skipped you?

757
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,690
No.

758
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,460
That's because...

759
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,290
You're ugly as fuck!

760
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,490
Chief Secretary!

761
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,900
Let's go.

762
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,210
Ukyo-san...

763
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,880
Was he this kind of person?

764
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,750
Not at all.
This is just an exaggeration.

765
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,480
And did his hair look like that?

766
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,350
I want a smoke so bad.

767
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,090
-Hey, Goto...
-Yeah?

768
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,660
Think about how I feel.

769
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,260
What?

770
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,100
You're always hosting on TV and stuff...

771
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,830
-Isn't that right, Gotou?
-Yeah.

772
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,570
But I'm your senpai.
And yet I'm here...

773
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,940
-...with this piece of cloth.
-Yeah...

774
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,110
I just want you to know how I feel.

775
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,910
But that's your own choice, bro.

776
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,680
-Just once, though.
-That's what you chose.

777
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,780
Just once.
Try to understand how I feel.

778
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,520
-Well...
-You can do it over your clothes.

779
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,490
-Over them?
-Sure.

780
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,690
How do you think I feel when I do this?

781
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,420
What's going on?
Over them?

782
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,460
I don't get how you wrap this around you.

783
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,500
That's right.
I do this myself, so...

784
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,300
-You do it yourself?
-That's right.

785
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,000
That's pretty deep, huh?

786
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,870
You get it? Make sure it's sturdy.

787
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,410
Make sure it's sturdy.
Okay!

788
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,280
You're lifting him up!

789
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,810
-Watch out!
-You're lifting him up.

790
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,250
I'm flying, I'm flying!

791
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,590
I'm flying!

792
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,490
I've seen an octopus do that before.

793
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,890
That's scary.

794
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,400
Miyasako-san.
Remember what's happened before.

795
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,630
This isn't really fun at all.

796
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,170
It's going deep in here, too.

797
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,270
More than here.

798
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,540
Watch out, you're going to end up coughing blood.

799
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,410
Only Miyasako-san can stop it, though.

800
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,310
Here's worse than here.

801
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,110
It's pretty tight!

802
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,310
Are you okay?

803
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,780
Poor guy.
You can't do that.

804
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,890
I'm sorry.
Thank you very much.

805
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,890
-I told you you can't do it.
-You're right.

806
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Gotou can't take stuff like that.

807
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,590
No, it's fine, really.

808
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,830
I was up in the air!

809
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,190
How do you tie this properly?

810
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,030
This cloth.

811
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,730
I know how to do it.

812
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Do you really, though?

813
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:22,970
I don't think so.

814
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,640
—I can do it myself.
—Show us.

815
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,380
Miyasako-san, you look kind of...

816
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,010
I want to see how tight you do it.

817
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,480
That's no good.
Because in the future

818
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,880
I'd like to do it, too.

819
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:36,950
This is bad.

820
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,520
That's a look you only see once every nine months.

821
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,650
This is bad.

822
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,420
You do this right here...

823
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,030
Are you learning how to do it?

824
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,790
You tie it around here.

825
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,360
I've seen this before.

826
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,630
And you raise it over here.

827
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,730
—Over there?
—Yeah.

828
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,700
I know this.

829
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,230
Up?
Yeah.

830
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,380
You know it, Miyasako-san.

831
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
You know it, Miyasako-san.

832
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,080
You know it.

833
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,150
That's the worst thing to do right now.
They're not stopping until somebody gets hurt.

834
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,350
Miyasako-san... it hurts!
It hurts!

835
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,390
Sacrifice... sacrifice... sacrifice...

836
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,220
He loves to do it on the neck, huh?

837
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,730
He loves it there.

838
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
Let's stop this.

839
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,260
I think I've seen this somewhere before.

840
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,730
The only ones having fun are you two
and Miyagawa-san.

841
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,340
We've just been here.

842
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,570
Right?
For a while.

843
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,440
Hey, it hurt me too.

844
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,280
You sure swung it around.

845
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,280
You're a damned gorilla.

846
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,450
That hurts!

847
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,950
Who's going to do it?

848
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,090
Who are you?

849
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Hello there.

850
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,460
I'm Sakurai from Mr. Children. (EN: Japanese Pop-Rock Band)

851
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,700
What?!

852
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,770
Hello there.

853
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,170
I'm Sakurai

854
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,410
from Mr. Children!

855
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,460
Hello there, hello there!

856
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,630
I'm Sakurai from Mr. Children.

857
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,140
And so we've ended up in a loop.

858
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,770
This is pretty bad.

859
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,260
I'm Sakurai.

860
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,810
You idiot!

861
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,110
Koyabu was in trouble too!

862
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,460
For real!
I was about to burst.

863
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,390
Right, he was doing it all over the place!

864
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,300
-And Koyabu was in trouble!
-Yeah, Koyabu was close!

865
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,230
We don't get to see your face like that often.

866
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,240
I thought that it was Matsuyama Chiharu for sure.
Maybe a freestyle version. (EN: Japanese Folk Singer)

867
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,470
But it was Mr. Children!

868
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,940
It was a complete mess!

869
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,180
Hello there!

870
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,020
I'm Sakurai from Mr. Children!

871
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,120
This is really bad.

872
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
You idiot!

873
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,050
It was really funny, though.

874
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,860
This is clearly a point to Zakoshiyoh.

875
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,090
Wait, if he's that far ahead...

876
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
Then you get a yellow.

877
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,400
-Thank you very much.
-A yellow...

878
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,460
A yellow?

879
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,130
-It's just your first time.
-Still a yellow.

880
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,900
-A yellow, huh?
-It's the first time.

881
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,070
Come to think of it, we're past the halfway point.

882
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,300
Half there already!

883
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,570
Half!

884
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,540
Finally!

885
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,540
Here we go!

886
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:08,120
So when it comes to points...
Kato and Zakoshi are ahead.

887
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:12,160
But Kato's almost out, so...

888
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,560
And Miyasako gets that one point.

889
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,030
Zakoshi and Miyasako are looking pretty good.

890
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,370
I saw something on TV the other day...

891
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,640
What?

892
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,670
I caught a cold,

893
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,840
so I decided to make a cup of noodles.
I poured the water and got ready to take a bath,

894
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:33,110
but I ended up pouring the hot water on the guy
sitting on the sofa.

895
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,480
I tripped.

896
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,950
It was Yamada Gorou-san.

897
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,350
So he was like "What the hell are you doing, you idiot?!"

898
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,930
He was insanely mad.
But I'm smart and I liked him, so...

899
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,090
I was there wiping his neck.

900
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,630
I'm sure it was hot, though!

901
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,370
I couldn't say no.

902
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,800
In any case, can anyone give this back to him?

903
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,310
I took a strand of his hair.

904
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
From Yamada Goro-san.

905
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,210
Did you tear it off?

906
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,110
You have some hair there?

907
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,710
-Did you tear all that off him?
-I was pretty shocked when I saw this in my hand.

908
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,250
He didn't notice?

909
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,120
-You took all that at once?
-All that just by pulling?

910
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,220
And it came off like that?

911
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,460
I started stumbling because I couldn't walk straight,

912
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,520
I ended up bumping into a wall.

913
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,790
You felt it?

914
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,260
Last time I saw an ad with him on it,
he still had it, though.

915
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,730
Can someone give it back to him?

916
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,400
Someone that knows Yamada Gorou.

917
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,300
I'm sure he's going to get pretty mad.

918
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,230
It would be better if you gave it back himself.

919
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,940
I just felt that if I did that, he'd say...

920
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,870
"Give it back you idiot!"
Or something like that.

921
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,540
He's that kind of person?

922
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,640
I didn't think so.

923
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,780
He's like that?
He speaks like that?

924
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,210
Wanna watch a video?

925
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,980
Wanna watch a video?

926
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,280
-Wanna watch it?
-Let's do a screening session!

927
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,920
-Some pictures before the video, though.
-Sure.

928
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,320
I'm curious about these pictures.

929
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,660
I had to check it wasn't just a photoshop.

930
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:52,760
This is a wrestler.

931
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,090
A wrestler?

932
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,660
-Yeah, yeah.
—So what?

933
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:56,860
At first I mistook him...

934
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,400
...for Yoshiko from Ganbareruya.

935
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,200
I mistook that guy.

936
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,800
The wrestler?

937
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:03,970
Yeah, yeah.

938
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,470
The wrestler...

939
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,210
...and Yoshiko from Ganbareruya.

940
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,680
I mistook them at first.

941
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,210
Is it showing yet?

942
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,910
They look the same!

943
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,710
-Is it a photoshop?
-It's not.

944
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,320
-It has to be.
-Isn't it her?

945
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,880
They look the same.

946
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,490
She's just like that.

947
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:22,060
They really look almost the same.

948
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,090
-Yeah.
-And this is a guy?

949
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,030
He is.

950
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,560
So he hides his tits like that?

951
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,560
Just like Ayumi.

952
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,130
Yeah, for sure.

953
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,170
So I checked on Yoshiko.

954
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,570
But she was in the hospital.

955
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,740
But when I went there, she looked like this.

956
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,510
This is Yoshiko.

957
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,740
-You can't tell them apart.
-That's not the wrestler?

958
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,050
Oh no...

959
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,520
That's a terrible picture.

960
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,590
Looking at her like this,
she looks the same as always.

961
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,820
-Isn't this the wrestler?
-That's Yoshiko.

962
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,290
That's freaky!

963
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:58,490
It moves?

964
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,930
-That's a video?
-This is Yoshiko.

965
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,330
That's weird.

966
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,100
Well, I'm sure it was rough for her.

967
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,470
Yeah, yeah.
Alright, got it.

968
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,400
That's what I was curious about.

969
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,470
-Time for the video?
-Is it okay?

970
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,540
-Sure.
-Let's do this.

971
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,810
Can I show mine?

972
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:17,710
I used this for a solo show I was doing the other day.

973
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,150
Can I show you guys some of it?

974
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,450
Really? Okay, let's go.

975
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,750
Hello there. Good day.

976
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,220
I'm Sean Ben-man. (EN: Not 100% sure about this, might be "Sean Bean-man" or "Shonben-man")

977
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,850
It's a pleasure to meet you.

978
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,260
Sean Ben-man. Ben-man.

979
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,420
Ben-man, Ben-man.

980
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,960
I'm Sean Ben-man.

981
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,860
Nice to meetcha!

982
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,600
That was a lie,
so I'm going to go all out.

983
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,770
You see, today I had to wait and wait.

984
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:29,150
Seiya, Seiya, wait!
Seiya lost!

985
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,850
He's at it again!

986
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,120
—That was bad!
—That was too much.

987
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,420
Gotou-san was laughing too!

988
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,520
I wasn't!
I managed to hold it in.

989
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:37,760
What was with that video?

990
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,500
You're really insane!

991
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,930
You were laughing, Seiya.

992
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,140
Seiya was definitely laughing.

993
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,010
—Let's take a look.
—He even laughed out loud.

994
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:56,910
—He definitely did.
—That was hilarious.

995
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,550
I'm Sean Ben-man.

996
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:04,650
He's too into it.

997
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,250
I'm just exaggerating.

998
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,360
Now he looks like a reactor!

999
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,130
The reactor's going too fast...

1000
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,690
It's hilarious.

1001
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,830
That was too much.

1002
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,640
You sure can hold back with this, huh?!

1003
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:26,810
This is just insane.

1004
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,410
It's insane!

1005
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,380
He's making the same face for like 60% of it!

1006
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,580
Alright, orange for Seiya.

1007
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,750
That's bad.

1008
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,820
—You're almost out.
—It's the second one.

1009
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,880
Zakoshiyoh-san is too much.

1010
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:39,790
Zakoshi is messing everyone up.

1011
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,990
That was too much right now.

1012
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,790
We have to change our strategy.

1013
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,230
I can do anything on video, right?

1014
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,660
Yeah, videos are free.

1015
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,260
—There's still some left?
—There is.

1016
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,700
Are we going to watch more of the video?

1017
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,770
Do it. It's only halfway done.

1018
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,800
I'll leave that to you.
Here we go!

1019
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,270
It's not done...
So that... is resuming?

1020
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,440
Resume, resume!

1021
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,040
There's still some left!

1022
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,710
I'm going to do it till you don't laugh anymore.

1023
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:03,880
It was some kind of subliminal attack.

1024
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,910
I didn't think that guy could pull off something like that.

1025
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,980
Here we go!

1026
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,250
There are still three hours left.

1027
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:09,620
Still three hours, huh?

1028
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,320
And three hours is still half of it.

1029
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,390
Alright, you ready?
We're not done yet.

1030
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:16,690
Go on.

1031
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,290
Are we going to be okay?

1032
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,790
This is our eight season after eight years.

1033
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,400
What's that "South Sea Hoax" in the background all about?

1034
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,470
The title was great.

1035
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,630
The title wasn't so good this time around.

1036
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,300
"Zakoshi's stinking movie..."

1037
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:32,870
It was all nonsense...

1038
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,610
But it was much better than before.
Much much better.

1039
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,810
This is getting really dark.

1040
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,880
And the venue was weird, too. The Zakou temple.

1041
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,820
I used to do performance art in Nakano a long time ago.

1042
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:53,290
This is too much.

1043
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:57,800
We can't go back after this.

1044
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,940
We can't go back after this.

1045
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,110
This is the main attraction.

1046
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:12,650
What did the people at the venue say?

1047
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,010
A subliminal effect.

1048
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,650
See? Subliminal.

1049
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,530
You laughed? Seiya, you laughed?

1050
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,560
Seiya.

1051
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,160
I was about to explode.

1052
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
All this time.

1053
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:34,800
All this time.

1054
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,770
Why weren't you laughing?!

1055
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,770
All you had to do was look away.

1056
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,840
Alright!

1057
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,340
I see!

1058
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,150
-I guess it's over!
-It's over.

1059
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,680
Its over, huh?

1060
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,220
-It can't be helped.
-No!

1061
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,750
Let's take a look.

1062
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,050
The Zakou temple.

1063
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,560
I used to do performance art in Nakano a long time ago.

1064
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,400
This is too much.

1065
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,900
We can't go back after this.

1066
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,140
We can't go back after this.

1067
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,510
This is the main attraction.

1068
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,850
What did the people at the venue say?

1069
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,650
A subliminal effect.

1070
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,690
See? Subliminal.

1071
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,460
I see, watching it again...

1072
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:35,600
No way, no way, no way!

1073
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,200
It's impossible.

1074
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,830
Well, that's right.

1075
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,200
It's impossible!

1076
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,470
Seiya...

1077
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,340
You're out!

1078
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,880
Another point for Zakoshi!

1079
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,450
Amazing.

1080
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,580
Zakoshi-san is too strong!

1081
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,750
It's impossible not to laugh at this video!

1082
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,490
He's going to win again.

1083
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,260
I still have more.
Like five more.

1084
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,420
No way, no way!

1085
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,490
One more.

1086
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,360
No, no way.
Leave them for next time!

1087
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:08,460
-Just one more!
-One more?

1088
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,100
Wanna watch one more?

1089
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,330
That's too hard.

1090
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,330
I'm sure it's just like watching porn.

1091
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,840
Can I say something first?

1092
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,610
I think the main problem is just that

1093
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,310
I probably like Zakoshi too much.

1094
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,510
As a comedy act in general.

1095
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,780
Hello there.

1096
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,220
I'm Sakurai from Mr. Children

1097
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,690
When jelly got in my eyes,

1098
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,620
I thought that I might make it today.

1099
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,930
But Zakoshi's videos were probably

1100
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:41,530
enough to make me laugh a thousand times.

1101
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,170
That video was too much.

1102
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,940
I laughed with no regret.

1103
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,840
I'm going to laugh at that no doubt.

1104
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,310
If you're going to do it, I'll do it back.

1105
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,050
I forgot.

1106
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,520
A monster was there!

1107
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,190
-Other than Iron Man?
-Yes!
