1
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,690
The Owarai Laboratory

2
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,700
The show starts now   -Yes, got it

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,600
It's the 6th time now   -Yeah, the 6th time we're doing this

4
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,980
The 6th time of chaos

5
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,310
By watching previous contests, they can grasp the concept of how things work

6
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,250
As well as things which have never yet been done

7
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:56,890
So I feel like the contestants themselves are upskilling too

8
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,160
An ever-evolving battle

9
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,700
I believe that the atmosphere could still be tense, but without any useless anxiety

10
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,970
It has become a high level "tournament"

11
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,010
This is experimental, definitely experimental, this time, again

12
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,080
What is the highlight of the 6th experiment?

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,290
Season 2 "Point System"

14
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,130
Season 3 "Zombie System"

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,660
Season 5 "Helper system"

16
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:46,400
So, for this time...there will be many female contestants

17
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,070
"Female comedians" more than ever

18
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:56,010
I wonder what will happen...

19
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,220
In addition, umm...

20
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,390
How should I put it...

21
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,190
There will be some aggressive male comedians

22
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,560
I look forward to seeing the chemical reactions between them

23
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,160
It must be interesting

24
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:19,440
Some want more of it, others dislike it, but...

25
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,540
I believe there won't be any extreme dirty jokes this time

26
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,680
Well, it's game over if you dare to do dirty jokes among a bunch of females

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,220
It will simply become an adult video

28
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,560
So I believe that's not going to happen

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,590
Finally approaching the...

30
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, I'm expecting to have a champion contest

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
(Season 2) Winner - Kotoge Eiji from Viking

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,070
(Season 3) Winner - Yamamoto Keiichi from Gokuraku Tombo

33
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,840
(Season 4) Winner - Kukky from Yasei Bakudan

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,320
(Season 5) Winner - Hollywood Zakoshisyoh

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,550
It's probably going too far to have a 100 million cash prize

36
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:13,730
Putting it the other way round, it might be interesting to have no cash prize for the champion contest

37
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,100
*A Fall's Appetite (食欲の秋) is a term in Japan which describes the abundance in food during the season of harvest

38
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,100
Although we use to say "A Fall's Appetite"

39
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,770
However, I'm having remarkably small appetite recently

40
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,310
All that I'm eating is udon with deep-fried tofu

41
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,250
That being said, I would like to offer you an invitation

42
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,480
Could you prepare one million yen
and gather at a designated location?

43
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,760
I shall reinitiate Documental

44
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,630
I have prepared a reward of 10 million yen for the winner

45
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,900
Of course, participation is voluntary

46
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,700
For those of you who wish to participate, I shall inform you of the time and location

47
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,440
Awaiting your reply

48
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,210
It's getting colder in the morning and at night

49
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,180
Please take care of yourself and don't catch a cold

50
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,680
Sincerely, Matsumoto Hitoshi

51
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,730
THE PARTICIPATING COMEDIANS ENTER

52
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,370
That's such a big bag

53
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,710
So that's how she looks like

54
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,790
This is her first appearance, Yuriyan Retriever

55
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm Yuriyan Retriever from Yoshimoto

56
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,530
I'll keep calm and carry on

57
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,760
Yo   -Nice to meet you

58
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,970
So I'm here to give you something, Yuriyan

59
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,070
This is it

60
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm being invited?   -Yes

61
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,040
I've been waiting this for so long

62
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm so happy! Hooray!

63
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,510
This gal cares nothing about others

64
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,420
All that she's thinking about is herself

65
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,120
We'll see how far she can go on her own

66
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,030
*Yuriyan is famous for being able to speak English very well, because she loves watching English movies

67
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,030
The Smashing Bilingual Girl*

68
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,700
Matsumoto-san said to me "you are the one"

69
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,900
She suits Documental, doesn't she?

70
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,700
She has a strong heart too

71
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,110
To be honest, female comedians usually have a stronger heart than male comedians

72
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,050
"The W" champion

73
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,050
Female comedian
No.1 Tournament

74
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,050
How much was the cash prize for "The W"?

75
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,650
It's 10 million...

76
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,160
How did you spend those money?

77
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,720
Well, I only did it once a month, but...

78
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,770
I spent it all on dango, and I ate them all

79
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,270
I don't mind losing this money at all

80
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,040
For being able to appear on this show

81
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,450
How will you spend the 10 million this time?

82
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,120
I want to get laser hair removal

83
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,730
Someone's coming

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,440
Who will it be?

85
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,880
Nice to meet you

86
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,180
Kurozawa-san

87
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,980
Nice to meet you

88
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,320
I'm so happy to see you

89
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,560
I'm Kurosawa Kazuko from Morisantyu

90
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,660
Anyway, I'll try my best!

91
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,190
Hello

92
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,740
Kurosawa is someone who reads between the lines

93
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,410
She's interesting as long as she don't read too much between the lines

94
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,780
If she thinks too much and reads too much between the lines

95
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,180
She ends up crying

96
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,880
What happened, Kurosawa?

97
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,720
She's crying   -What happened?

98
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,390
Crying all of a sudden

99
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,050
Seriously, what happened?

100
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,890
It's truly a male‐dominated society

101
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,560
A male‐dominated society...

102
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,530
I'm shy with strangers...

103
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,660
Shy with strangers?

104
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,910
A meat that sings and dance

105
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,940
I feel regret

106
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:09,010
For being unable to give good results in front of Matsumoto-san

107
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,320
I have to admit my inadequacy

108
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,490
There's not much chance to talk with other comedians

109
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:22,830
I have only talked with Tsubaki Oniyako and Oasis about health while having dinner together

110
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,200
I'm so nervous   -Same here

111
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,430
But I'm really happy, it has been a male-dominated society before, so I'm really happy to see more girls

112
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,780
Other comedians are thinking like "so that's all she can do"

113
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,850
And that really makes me suffer

114
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,250
So I will let them know, "this gal is insane"

115
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,550
Let's take the chance to laugh now

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,570
Here comes the 3rd contestant

117
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,700
Didn't bring much

118
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,110
Wow, so happy, another girl

119
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,980
I'm so happy

120
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,420
So it's a kitty party

121
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,190
Why does Kurosawa keep saying "so happy, so happy"?

122
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,160
I get it, so it's a kitty party

123
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,390
Women-only...   -Many females

124
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,200
I'm Kondo Haruna from Harisenbon

125
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,400
I'll definitely take the 10 million back home

126
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,830
This is for you

127
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,540
The 3rd contestant is a female comedian too

128
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,880
For me?

129
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,810
Me?

130
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,850
She has a strong heart too

131
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:56,250
I'm not sure how should Haruna position herself in Documental though

132
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,960
I'm the daughter of a civil servant

133
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,930
And I'm being raised by really strict parents

134
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,630
So if my senior invites me

135
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,330
I have no choice but to accept it

136
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,270
I just have to accept it

137
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:19,910
The Counter Fantasista

138
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,580
I'm sure going to laugh

139
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,620
Will it be fine? They're all easily amused

140
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,860
It's gonna be interesting to see Haruna break down

141
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,830
As a hidden theme, I want to make Matsumoto-san laugh

142
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:44,700
I've actually enrolled in comedy school to become a Boke

143
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:57,050
*Haruna is the Tsukkomi of Harisenbon

144
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:57,050
So I want to challenge myself and seek opportunities to join other's Boke this time

145
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,490
It's your second time right, Kurosawa-san?

146
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,520
Yeah, but I don't need to be shy with strangers this time, so I'm really happy

147
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,430
I actually think Haruna is really strong

148
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,900
You were a bit shy with strangers last time, right?   -Yes, I was

149
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,640
Here comes the 4th contestant

150
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,350
Nice to meet you

151
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,250
Women, women-only

152
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,190
Women-only...

153
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,290
Daigo must be shocked

154
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,790
I'm a man though...

155
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,260
Yeah, suddenly a man among women

156
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,800
It's not supposed to be a women-only contest, right?

157
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,800
I'm Daigo from Chidori, and this is my second time

158
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,970
I will win

159
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,040
I will enjoy

160
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,270
I will not lose

161
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,410
Good morning

162
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,980
Do you recognize this?

163
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,910
I do

164
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,280
Isn't it too fast?

165
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,780
Why is Daigo invited?

166
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:13,490
Because the producer wants to make sure that there's always some popular comedians

167
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,660
Well, you should have noticed this already, but...

168
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,760
I'm weak

169
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm super weak

170
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,840
(Season 4) The second dropout within 4 hours 30 minutes

171
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,750
The rough and shy baldy

172
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,950
But I do feel regret about the last contest

173
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,160
I will try to be aggressive and attack more this time

174
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
I do want to take revenge

175
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,990
Wait a second, this can't be true

176
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,600
I thought there would only be one girl at most

177
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,930
I didn't prepare anything last time

178
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,040
So this time, not anything fancy, but I've prepared something

179
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,940
Well, you'll probably be like "why the heck", but...

180
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,710
I've actually...

181
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,640
Removed my pubic hair

182
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,850
And I have some beautiful paintings on my balls

183
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,190
I have no idea when to show it though

184
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,120
So the best case scenario is that someone will take off my pants

185
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,660
It was never like this before

186
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,630
Exactly   -Yeah

187
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:28,830
So they did this to prevent the predominance of men over women

188
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,040
Don't call us women, call us girls please

189
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,310
Daigo's face looks funny

190
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,650
This is incredible   -Nice to meet you

191
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,820
It's a kitty party, completely a kitty party

192
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,990
I'm Tomochika from Yoshimoto

193
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,890
Instead of being nervous, I just want to do what I want to do and accomplish my goals

194
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,760
This is for you   -Yes?

195
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,270
Documental

196
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,600
I'm looking forward to it

197
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,070
This is something that I really want to join

198
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,640
She is a woman of principle

199
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,280
And she is mentally strong

200
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,780
The Protean Imitation Queen

201
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,620
My style is basically to imitate and become someone else

202
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,090
So from this perspective, I'm quite similar to Akiyama-san

203
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,860
So it's tough if Akiyama happens to be joining too

204
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,830
I think there should be more female comedians

205
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,370
There wasn't much before, right?

206
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:41,210
Friends who I usually hang out with, Haruna from Harisenbon, Yuriyan, Ooshima-san

207
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,280
If these people are joining, it must be hilarious

208
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,550
Tomochika-san don't laugh at all, right?

209
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,780
I've never laughed since I was born

210
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,780
That's so true

211
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,220
Tomochika never laughs, right?

212
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,090
She is probably one of the contenders for the championship

213
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,720
When I'm not into it, I don't laugh at all

214
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,430
But when I'm into it, I can laugh for a week

215
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,670
What I'm concerned about is...is it fine to just aim to win?

216
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,470
If you ask me, do I want 10 million?

217
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,900
Not really, to be honest

218
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,940
Well, I mean, of course I want it, but...

219
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,410
It's kind of a collective gameplay, right?

220
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:21,680
I want to attack aggressively, score the most points, and finally win the 10 million

221
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,980
Why am I the 4th person to enter the room?

222
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,180
Exactly, why not the last one...

223
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,690
It makes sense if I enter after her, so it's all men thereafter

224
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,320
But then I'm in between the girls...

225
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,430
They're quite concerned about who the other players are

226
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,730
Hello everybody

227
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,930
Good morning   -Amazing

228
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,670
This combination is so rare

229
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,100
It sure is rare

230
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,810
So it's not a women-only contest

231
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,480
Hello, I'm Maeda Ken from Slimclub

232
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,280
I will enjoy the time with other comedians and win the contest

233
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,480
Hello   -Hello

234
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,890
Hooray!

235
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,460
I'm actually betting on Maeda

236
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,830
This should be a stage for him to unleash his talent

237
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,600
Seriously, I like Matsumoto-san so much

238
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,530
But I've never won any championship in front of Matsumoto-san

239
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,140
Neither the M-1 contest

240
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,540
Nor the IPPON Grand Prix

241
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,510
I really want to win in front of Matsumoto Hitoshi

242
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,750
Husky Voice Mutant

243
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,480
I believe he will work hard

244
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,390
To compensate for failure of his duo partner

245
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,520
He was neither attacking nor laughing

246
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,290
His partner was unbelievable

247
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,360
According to what he said

248
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,830
"That place has no Owarai, mental is all there is"

249
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,730
He then said "I have neither Owarai nor mental"

250
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,530
"All I have is a body sitting there"

251
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,240
I've actually been fasting for 4 days

252
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,870
It's a jinx

253
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,340
Whenever I do fasting, good things happen

254
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,750
When I did fasting for 3 days, I got into the finals for the M-1 contest

255
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,880
When I did fasting for 10 days, I became a regular member of Tantei Night Scoop

256
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,750
So this time, I've been fasting as well

257
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,630
I'm not mainstream, and I'm not capable of being mainstream

258
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:21,530
So I believe that with my participation, Documental will become something different

259
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,000
So they are male comedians liked by females?

260
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,970
Maybe the male comedians liked by female comedians

261
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,580
Yeah, they are both genuinely nice

262
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:38,680
Agreed, they tend to treat us as comedians instead of females

263
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,550
-This contest is going to be exceptional   -Yeah, definitely exceptional

264
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,300
Here he comes

265
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,800
What should I do?

266
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,340
So many girls?

267
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,740
He's a male comedian that likes females though

268
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,570
No way, don't talk to me like that

269
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,780
I'm Jinnai Tomonori from Yoshimoto

270
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,820
I really want to stay till last this time, at least the last 2 or 3 people

271
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,990
Hello

272
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,990
Hey, isn't this too fast?

273
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:27,160
Well, last time, Jinnai did nothing and went home

274
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:35,640
No wonder people say he's not interesting anymore after he's married

275
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,350
When you enter that place, you no longer know what is interesting, or what is not interesting

276
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,720
It's just true chaos

277
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,820
Chaotic place

278
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,700
Mister Hidden Boke

279
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,100
But he's definitely a fast learner

280
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:12,310
So I believe he will prepare himself this time

281
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,150
What should I do?   -This is amazing

282
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,880
Probably a lot of veteran will be joining today's contest

283
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:26,460
So my tactic is to expand their Boke and find a way to counterattack

284
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:37,130
I want to let everyone know, even the Tsukkomi type of comedians, stand a chance to win

285
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,100
I'm definitely going to laugh, I hate being Tsukkomi-ed

286
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,040
Having these members to work together is interesting

287
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,780
Here he comes, a familiar face

288
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,260
He's almost like a regular member

289
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,830
So strange to have these members

290
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,500
He's the Mister Documental

291
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,000
Fujimoto is going to make me laugh

292
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,300
Yoshimoto creative agency, I'm Fujimoto from Fujiwara

293
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,740
This time, seriously, I'm aiming to win the contest

294
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,140
Okay, okay, this atmosphere again...

295
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,980
I knew it, here it is

296
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,320
Here it comes

297
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,250
Fujimon, he's a familiar face, the man who is disliked by everyone

298
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,060
Come on, there's no need to dislike him that much

299
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:35,460
Matsumoto Hitoshi is not a fair judge, he's being too kind to Fujimon. I love Documental, but I want a fair contest

300
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:35,460
Matsumoto Hitoshi is clearly being too nice to Fujimon.
Everyone can see he's laughing a lot.
He's being too kind to his junior

301
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,460
I don't think he'll win the contest anyway

302
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,460
The show is interesting, but the judge is being too kind to Fujimon. If the same thing happened to other comedians, they'll definitely be out.

303
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,260
In my opinion, it's a safe

304
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,140
Barely safe

305
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,010
He has the ability to expand other's potential

306
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:55,380
So yeah, I enjoy it when he's here

307
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,210
How many times have you been here, Fujimoto-san?

308
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,850
4 times!   -That's too much

309
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,160
Many people say to me "you're so interesting" because of Documental

310
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,030
Many people say that to me, however...

311
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,460
Seriously speaking, the number of job offers didn't increase at all

312
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,800
Well, I had three days off in a row recently

313
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:23,340
Come on, I've been so active in Documental, and yet I'm having three days off in a row? Isn't that strange?

314
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,550
People seem to see me as a byplayer

315
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:34,990
I always hear people saying "he's definitely not the protagonist"

316
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:40,060
Speaking from my heart, I really want to be the protagonist

317
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,530
Yeah, that's how I feel now

318
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,470
So just two more people

319
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,100
Yes, two more people

320
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,710
He's barefooted

321
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,710
So hot...

322
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,110
Come on, what the heck are you doing

323
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,450
Waste of bullets

324
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,350
Waste of bullets

325
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,750
It's not even started yet   -Not yet?

326
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,850
Ouch, ouch, so hot

327
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,190
Well, maybe this is his tactic

328
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,430
I'm Jimmy Onishi

329
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:21,430
I'm the No.8 hostess in Shinjuku Nichome, Kubukicho

330
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,970
Jimmy-san, hello...   -Hello

331
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,940
Wait a second, this is...Jimmy-san...

332
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,940
What's that?

333
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,540
This is for you   -Here it is again

334
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,010
You know what this is, right?   -Yes, at the moment I see it

335
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,750
I have to borrow it from Yoshimoto,
how else can I even prepare 10 million

336
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,450
Please borrow me 10 million for Documental

337
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,920
10 million yen

338
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
For Matsumoto-san's Documental

339
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,120
Documental?   -Yes, Documental

340
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,930
It's him again...

341
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:57,730
He's really interesting, however funny people are always easily amused

342
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,840
Well, it's probably difficult for him to win the contest

343
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,110
I'm easily amused

344
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:08,550
So I'll try not to laugh and improve my defense

345
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,550
Why are you always attacking before it's not even started yet?

346
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,020
Well, I just want to alert myself right from the beginning

347
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,790
Oh, I get it   -So to remind yourself that it's getting serious now

348
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:24,030
I've dedicated all of my salary to Documental

349
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,130
It even shows up in my dreams

350
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,800
Did you win the contest in your dreams?

351
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,170
No, not even in my dreams

352
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:41,510
People are only concerned about the "thing" in front

353
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:46,780
But actually, our butt is also something to be aware of

354
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,560
So this time, anal is the main point

355
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,220
Are you a hostess this time?   -Yeah, hostess

356
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,690
You won't laugh later if we talk about it now

357
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,900
You'll eventually know why my face is red

358
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,160
Why did you say it then, dude

359
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,570
Come on, this is going to make me laugh either way

360
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:11,910
Probably everyone will be surprised by this contestant

361
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,780
So, I've prepared this contestant for you all

362
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,860
Strong presence, very strong presence

363
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,530
Nice to meet you

364
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,360
They all have to stand up

365
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,500
He is the person who I don't want to see here the most

366
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,570
I'm Murakami Shoji

367
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,570
First thing first, I'll try my best

368
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,570
Excuse me

369
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,410
Hello

370
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,750
Is this from Machan?

371
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,580
I never watched Documental, but I've heard of it before

372
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,580
Too late, dude!

373
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,720
Come on, it's already the 6th contest, you're asking me to join the 6th one?

374
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,090
Sorry for being discourteous...

375
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,730
Well, I'll join though!   -You're joining?

376
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,490
Amazing, right?

377
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:08,670
For the first time in Documental's history,
my senior is joining the contest

378
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,830
Well, I really like him

379
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,070
He's really interesting and I always hoped he could join

380
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,740
But I bet he'll laugh immediately

381
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,580
Showa Gag Geek

382
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,050
So late

383
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,480
Offer

384
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,690
I wonder if Machan is already feeling tired about Owarai

385
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,620
*Matsumoto is hosting a show called "Wide na show", which reports and comments on news

386
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,620
It's not time for you to report news yet, right?*

387
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:41,230
This is a battle between me and Matsumoto Hitoshi, the man who built up a generation of Owarai

388
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,400
I'll give it everything I've got,
everything that I've learnt in the past 43 years

389
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,070
I hope I can at least last for 30 or 40 minutes

390
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:53,180
Why are you having a one-tone dressing?

391
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,710
Stop it, that's hilarious!

392
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,680
As an old man into my forty-second year of career, I'll try my best and go all out

393
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,520
And I hope the audiences can feel the passion running through my veins

394
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:11,160
I'll put up a good fight with the experience that I've gained in my 42 years of career

395
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,960
Well, just look forward to it

396
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,760
Please don't speak with a voice like that   -Eh?

397
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,130
Come on, don't let others repeat themselves

398
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,970
No...I've actually...umm...

399
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,730
Sorry, I don't want to talk about it now

400
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,770
Why did you end the conversation?

401
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,100
Please stop it

402
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,070
I hate those curve balls from Shoji-san

403
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,150
He's so angry

404
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,850
Why is he always angry when he enters the room?

405
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,220
It's so interesting to have these members   -This is awful

406
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,760
I can watch this forever

407
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,760
This is just chaotic

408
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,090
This is incredible, right?

409
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,860
Yeah, this is gonna be awful

410
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,130
Shoji-san don't know Jimmy is going to be here, right?   -No clue

411
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,900
And of course, Jimmy don't know as well, so it's impossible for anyone to team up

412
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,380
So I wonder are you guys feeling nervous right now?

413
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,310
Of course we're nervous

414
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,620
Shoji-san's husky voice is already so interesting

415
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,580
This must be awful

416
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,680
Maeda's voice is husky too

417
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,990
Exactly, this is a crush of personality

418
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,220
For having a husky voice too

419
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,230
The husky brothers

420
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,290
I can't take this anymore

421
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,500
Shoji-san, are you really fine with this?

422
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,340
I think your defense is really weak   -Yeah, he always laugh

423
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,740
I laugh a lot   -And you have a smiling face

424
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,410
So please remember to keep a poker face

425
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,840
It's game over if you laugh

426
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,380
I know about the rules

427
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,680
I really think your defense is weak

428
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,080
And your attack is not strong as well

429
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,380
I'm really worried about you

430
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,350
That's what makes us laugh

431
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,420
But I do want to watch him on stage, so please work hard Shoji-san

432
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,360
Yeah, I'll try my best   -Yes please, Shoji-san

433
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,000
What about the battle between the girls?

434
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,400
Tomochika is probably strong, in my opinion

435
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,000
It's like "how many characters does she even have?"

436
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,040
And I never saw Tomochika laugh at other's gag

437
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,040
You're right   -No way, that's not true

438
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,540
But actually, Tomochika always laugh at some lame gags

439
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,150
Yes exactly, I've always been laughing at Fujimon's gags

440
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,310
Yeah, those kinds of lame gags

441
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,220
You're gonna make him angry

442
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,220
Yeah, he's lame

443
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,620
But good type of lame, right?   -No, she didn't say that

444
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,220
He always makes us laugh, right?

445
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,120
I have the impression that Yuriyan doesn't laugh much too

446
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,090
She doesn't laugh at others' gags, but she laughs at herself

447
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,600
Yeah, I laugh at my own gags

448
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,630
She's always like that

449
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,730
These girls are all so strong

450
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,140
Can you please put out the candle?   -Yeah, seriously

451
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,170
No, I want to let you guys wither

452
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,370
No way, we won't

453
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,780
You've been laughing so fast last time

454
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:16,480
And I actually think highly on Maeda   -I'm so happy, thank you

455
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,850
But Maeda is actually really weak, seriously

456
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,380
I really like to watch people Boke, so...

457
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,060
-For Jinnai, he's not interesting anymore after he's married
-Who are you talking about? Please stop it

458
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,260
Everyone knows that

459
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,090
I'm in a gud...good condition

460
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,960
Although I can't even say "good condition" clearly

461
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,200
-Are you really in a good condition?
-Seriously, please stop saying those kinds of thing

462
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,130
Anyway, please give me your one million yen

463
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:44,410
I actually wanted to watch more of these 10 people talking   -Eh?

464
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:49,010
That's how interesting it is, the personality of these 10 people

465
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,210
It's in an envelope...

466
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,420
Hey, come on, Jimmy

467
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,050
Is this really one million?   -Yes it is, one million

468
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,160
Then why did you take it out of the envelope?

469
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,360
We can just put it together like this...

470
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,800
Okay, this is it

471
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,570
So this adds up to 10 million

472
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:15,040
And this is the one million from me

473
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,680
And this is the 10 million prepared by the staffs

474
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,280
Brand-new notes   -Wow, amazing

475
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:29,690
Please work hard and fight for this

476
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,890
We all know about the rules, right?

477
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,460
So I'll give you cards

478
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,230
You could be out immediately, if the laugh is too excessive

479
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,230
Only if it's too excessive, but this never happened in the past

480
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,970
If you go too far, you'll be out

481
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,100
You can't have a smiling face, right?   -Nope

482
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,670
Need to keep a poker face right from the beginning

483
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,670
But this is my neutral face though

484
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,010
Then please keep it like that

485
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,920
Can we shuffle seats?

486
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,820
Do that after it starts..   -It makes no difference though

487
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,750
So we're not always sitting here?

488
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,490
You can move around as you like

489
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,630
Could we go to the toilet?   -Yeah, it's over there

490
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,490
He never watched this?

491
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,900
Because there's many girls this time, so there's no camera over there

492
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,930
Thank you very much

493
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,000
Well, I'm not talking to you though, Haruna

494
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,640
How come?

495
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,600
You're the least relevant one in the room

496
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,870
I don't have that thing!

497
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,510
That one just now was awful...

498
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,110
Please stop this...

499
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,050
Kurosawa, please don't cry today

500
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,680
Please don't cry

501
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,880
That's gonna make others laugh too

502
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,120
There's many girls today, so no problem

503
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,990
It's fine to cry?   -Yes, it's fine to cry

504
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,560
She cried last time, and said it's a male-dominated society

505
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,360
Yes, thank you for helping me last time

506
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,830
I'll give cards to people who try to muddle through too

507
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,330
For example, if you keep drinking water

508
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,470
Or keep smoking cigarettes   -Yes, that's inappropriate too

509
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,540
So keep these things in your mind

510
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,280
Let's get off to a slow start this time   -Yeah, let's take our time

511
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,050
Please let me make one thing clear, 6 hours is just the time limit

512
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,650
It can finish in just 2 hours as well

513
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,450
Although it never happened in the past

514
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,960
It's completely fine to finish the contest in an hour

515
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,160
Someone can strike a fatal blow, and kill everyone in the room

516
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,330
Catching the whole herd with one throw   -Exactly

517
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,830
I'm looking forward to that too

518
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,070
Come on, no one has that kind of killer technique

519
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,200
Good luck everyone   -Thank you very much

520
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,770
It's still fine to laugh now, right?

521
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,010
Ah, I can't take this anymore

522
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,580
-Are you gonna put out the candle?
-I'll put it out once the contest starts

523
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,110
Once the contest starts? That sounds weird

524
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,250
Give me a break, I'm gonna laugh at the moment it starts

525
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,990
You're definitely going to wear something, huh?

526
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,660
You're definitely going to wear something, like a wig, right?

527
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,890
You made yourself easy to wear it   -Yes, I'm going wear it

528
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,030
About time to...

529
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,700
Documental Start!

530
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,140
I'll put out the candle now

531
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,850
It started   -People are not looking at you yet

532
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,120
It started?

533
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,750
Yes, it started

534
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,690
What are you going to do with the candle?

535
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,320
I'll put out the candle now

536
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,220
Excuse me

537
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,760
So hot

538
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,720
Are you okay?   -That's dangerous

539
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,430
Are you okay?

540
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,100
Why did you light the candle so early then?

541
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,060
Are you done with this?

542
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,530
Jimmy-san, let's go slowly

543
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,440
You're going too fast right from the start, seriously

544
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,410
We have plenty of time, you understand me?

545
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,480
Yeah, he's right

546
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,940
It scared me

547
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,450
You're going too fast

548
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,180
We have 6 hours, Shoji-san

549
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,120
Exactly

550
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,650
Let's tea (calm) down and keep going*

551
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,790
*Yuriyan did a word play with tea (Ocha) and calm (Ochi)

552
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,790
Calm down, you mean calm down, right?

553
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,890
Let's get off to a slow start, okay?

554
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,660
Let's discuss this first

555
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,700
Let's discuss how to spend the 6 hours

556
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,930
Yeah, let's talk

557
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,800
Jimmy-san?

558
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,540
You're going too fast

559
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,870
He's incredible

560
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,170
Jimmy-san, that's not how you use it

561
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,880
Put it around your upper arm

562
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,410
It's gonna squeeze your neck

563
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,020
This is how we do things at Shinjuku Nichome

564
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,720
*Shinjuku Nichome is home to the world’s highest concentration of gay bars in a single area

565
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,720
You mean that Shinjuku Nichome with many gays?   -Yes, gays

566
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,990
So you are gay too?

567
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,060
Well yeah, I'm kind of mixed

568
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,390
Mixed?

569
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,830
Yeah, only half of me, so...

570
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,400
It's gonna squeeze you hard   -Too dangerous

571
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,040
We're worried about you   -You better not do that

572
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,640
Yeah, don't push yourself too hard

573
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,110
Is my face turning red?

574
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,040
Oh, I see, so that's why...

575
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,050
I can feel my face turning red

576
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,320
And yet, you're still squeezing it

577
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:06,230
That's dangerous   -Please stop it, Jimmy-san, seriously

578
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,700
Your face is turning red

579
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,170
Even your eyes are turning red

580
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,140
That's pink...k...k...   -Jimmy-san, too dangerous

581
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,440
Seriously, please stop it

582
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,970
Look at my eyes, I have pink ass (eyes)*

583
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:25,420
*Jimmy did a wordplay with conjunctiva (Ketsu-maku) and ass (Ketsu)

584
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,980
(Pink ass?...)

585
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,340
Pink ass, I have pink ass

586
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,610
What the heck is a pink ass?

587
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,420
Jimmy-san, this is seriously inappropriate

588
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,750
Come on, he laughed

589
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,150
Did Daigo laugh?

590
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,720
Maybe Daigo...

591
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,830
Daigo and Fujimon is close

592
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,370
Are you done with the candle   -Yeah, I'm done with it

593
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,970
I'll Shoji (dispose) of it*

594
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:56,080
*Jimmy mistaken Sho-ji (Matsumoto's senior) for Sho-bun (Dispose of it)

595
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,970
Shoji of it?

596
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,210
Shoji of it? You mean dispose of it?   -Yeah, dispose of it

597
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,280
What the heck is Shoji of it   -That's impolite

598
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,080
He said Shoji of it

599
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,050
-(Shoji-san is drinking so much water)
-Are you done with your red face too?

600
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,620
Huh?

601
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:06,060
-Are you done with your red face?
-Yeah, I'll count (remove) my makeup now*

602
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:10,230
*Jimmy mistaken remove makeup (Kao-otosu) for count (Kau-n-to)

603
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,890
Countdown?   -You're counting on something?

604
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,230
He said remove his makeup

605
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,560
Can you speak clearly just for once, please?

606
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,000
I am speaking clearly

607
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,400
Please take a seat, just take a seat

608
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,770
Did you buy these yourself, Jimmy-san?

609
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah, for bandage

610
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,840
Bandage?

611
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,170
It's bondage   -Oh, bondage...

612
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,250
Is he okay? Can he endure it?

613
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,980
It actually doesn't hurt, right?

614
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,420
Can he endure it?

615
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,250
You rigged it, so it doesn't hurt, right?

616
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,620
He probably loosened it

617
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,460
It doesn't hurt at all

618
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,760
That's very disappointing

619
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,430
This is just cunning

620
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,460
Why did you do this...   -It doesn't hurt at all

621
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,370
Not at all, I can't even feel it

622
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,510
So hard!

623
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,040
Hard?

624
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,110
What do you mean it's hard?

625
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,980
You mean it hurts?

626
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,780
It doesn't hurt, but it's hard?

627
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,720
What's so hard?

628
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,760
Not necessary to give cards for this though

629
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,460
Well, let's see how it goes

630
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,360
Maybe the candle isn't hot too, can we test it out on you, Shoji-san?

631
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,860
This is a court trial   -Yes

632
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,770
Tell us if it's hot   -This is a Sullivan (court trial)*

633
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:31,310
*Court trial (Sai-ban) and Sullivan have similar pronunciation

634
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,470
I wanted to say that too

635
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,070
Huh?

636
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,240
He said Ms Sullivan

637
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,310
He said court trial, then he said Sullivan, and I wanted to say that too

638
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,880
She's Helen Keller's teacher, right?

639
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,940
Is that even worth mentioning?

640
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,580
What's making you so excited?

641
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,380
I just wanted to tell you guys about this...

642
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,820
Let's do a Ms.Sullivan

643
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,220
Hey, hey, hey you

644
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:47,120
Leaving me alone like this...don't treat me like a lost child

645
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,160
No idea what you're talking about

646
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,670
Your skin look so old

647
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,900
You said I'm old?

648
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,070
You look slimmer

649
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,800
You idiot!

650
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,370
I'm a 63 years old in my prime, dude!

651
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,080
But you're supposed to retire at 65 though

652
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,590
But in terms of aby-lity...   -It's ability, please say it clearly

653
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,630
Are you ready?   -Yes

654
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,900
Is it hot or not?   -We can't tell if it's hot or not

655
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,710
We can't tell

656
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,540
Is it hot?

657
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,280
Shall we try one more time?

658
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,240
Shall we try one more time?

659
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,760
Is it hot or not?

660
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,020
No idea

661
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,490
We can't tell if you just say "eh"

662
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,700
I don't know either, because this half of my body is dead already

663
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,600
It's dead?

664
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,470
But it's moving a lot though

665
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,740
Then why did you ask him to do it on this side

666
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,470
You said it's dead, but...

667
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,340
But it somehow came back to life, and keeps moving

668
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,080
No need to say those lies

669
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,610
We still don't know if it's hot or not

670
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,450
It's definitely moving, right?

671
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,980
A fox...

672
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,050
Why a fox...

673
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,190
Let's stop this

674
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,290
His hands are shaking...

675
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,830
Let's shift our focus away from Shoji-san and Jimmy-san for now

676
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,230
Agreed   -You're right

677
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,000
So only this half of your body is dead?

678
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,040
It feels so good

679
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,970
It feels good?

680
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,340
Tomochika is so strong

681
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,580
Really strong

682
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,810
There's girls here too

683
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,980
No worries, I'm wearing something inside

684
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,690
It's a fishnet tight though

685
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,850
Fishnet tight...

686
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,990
It says "hole"

687
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,230
A hole

688
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,090
There's a lot of holes

689
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,100
You mean the holes of the fishnet tight?

690
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,160
Yeah, the holes of the fishnet

691
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,730
Or do you mean the hole of your...?   -Ass

692
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,070
That wasn't really interesting

693
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,570
We can clearly see your balls

694
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,970
That's no good, there's many girls here

695
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,080
I'll remove my makeup

696
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,310
Before that, we can clearly see your balls

697
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,120
Looking from the side...

698
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,720
-If you got sued for this, you're definitely gonna lose
-Yeah, in this day and age

699
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,550
If Haruna or Kurosawa sue you...

700
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,320
Did you put some coins inside?   -No, I didn't

701
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,660
How does testicles...

702
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,670
How does testicles look like?

703
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,700
You didn't see that?

704
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,070
Nope   -You never saw testicles before?

705
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,040
Nope

706
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,770
It's a round thing

707
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,570
How does it looks like?

708
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,540
Tell us how it looks like

709
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,210
Testicles?

710
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,080
What happened to your voice?

711
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,120
It's so husky

712
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,980
Husky testicle

713
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,390
So it's a hus-ticle

714
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,350
We're thinking the same thing   -Yeah

715
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,100
He's washing his face like an old man

716
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,830
You're wearing something inside

717
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,900
Are you okay?   -I'm fine

718
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,900
Why are you wearing this kind of cloth?

719
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,800
With stretch fabric...

720
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,670
But I love this kind of fabric too   -Oh, really?

721
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,810
That's how gangsters wear in private life

722
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,240
Only gangsters wear like that

723
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,210
That's you, idiot!

724
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,210
He's a gangster?

725
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:32,880
It's you

726
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,250
No way, it's not me   -It's you

727
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,820
Just look at what he's wearing

728
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,260
He's just being sporty

729
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,160
It's him

730
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,290
No way

731
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,630
Gangsters won't be here

732
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,390
Did you catch a cold?

733
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,230
A bit, my throat   -How come?

734
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,630
Well, it suddenly turned cold

735
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,270
There's so many people with husky voice today

736
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,070
Three people

737
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,240
I'm just having a nasal voice though

738
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,840
I'm having a nasal voice too

739
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,510
No, you're not

740
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,580
You're natural-born

741
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,150
You sound like you've drank some magma

742
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,520
Magma?

743
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,050
When I first met Norio-shisho

744
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:14,960
He said to me "did you eat sand for breakfast?"

745
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,790
Norio-shisho asked me "did you eat sand for breakfast?"

746
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,000
And he said "it's not something that you should put in your mouth!"

747
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,770
Norio-shisho?   -Norio-shisho

748
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,640
You two are close, huh?

749
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,880
Yeah, we are really close

750
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,680
Are you taking off your clothes?

751
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,080
You're belly is bulging in a good way

752
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,150
Because it's full of my gags

753
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,150
Oh, really? Please show us then

754
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,960
Just a little bit though   -Okay

755
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,960
We will learn a lot from that

756
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,260
Yeah, you're right

757
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,030
Lesson from a veteran

758
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,830
It's already his fourty...   -How long have you been a comedian?

759
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:56,570
My mic is...

760
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,100
You don't need that mantle, Jimmy-san

761
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,940
No...well...it's Shoji-san's turn now, so...

762
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,210
No worries, it's fine

763
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,910
That makes us curious

764
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,880
Actually...I...umm...want to have a deep talk with you guys

765
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,480
Eh? What's that? I want to watch that

766
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,380
No, it's not something to watch

767
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,020
He's balding in an unusual way

768
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,020
What do you mean?

769
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,890
You're right, it's strange   -Where?

770
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,830
You're balding in an unusual way

771
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,330
The front part of your head   -Oh, over here?

772
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,300
It took all our attention

773
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,800
You're balding in front too

774
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,170
Because I got an electric shock

775
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:34,800
In my head

776
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,510
You got an electric shock?   -Yeah

777
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:41,040
-Then you should end up having more hair, right?
-No...well...it's not that kind of electric shock

778
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,450
He sticked those electrode pads on my head

779
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:47,850
Then the doctor switched it on and I went like "ahh"

780
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,760
Shoji-san and Jimmy-san, why are you guys always telling lies that distress yourself afterwards

781
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,960
No, I'm lying, this is true, I really got an electric shock

782
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:59,430
Why did that happen then?

783
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,100
Please help Shoji-san wear the mic

784
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,870
What's that thing?

785
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,100
There's a hole   -Something is out...

786
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,370
Why only one side?

787
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,210
That shirt must be old

788
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,510
You're always wearing it?

789
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,320
It's really pinkish...

790
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,920
Of course, I don't hang out with girls

791
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,860
Let's guess if it's in the hole or not

792
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,430
So let's guess if it's in the hole or not

793
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,000
I'll be the dealer   -Okay

794
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,630
And we'll be betting

795
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:36,630
It's in

796
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,270
It's in

797
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,840
It's not in

798
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,900
It's in

799
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,740
It's not it   -It's not in

800
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,310
Oh, it's not in

801
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,210
Hooray!

802
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,080
It's not in

803
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,180
What about this time?

804
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,080
Wait a second...

805
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,960
Do you know if it's in or not, Shoji-san?

806
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,160
Please bet with us, Shoji-san

807
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,930
Am I Akina, dude?!

808
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:06,430
It should be Yukina (Fujimon's wife)

809
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,570
Akina is Hamaguchi-san's wife

810
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:10,930
You mixed them up

811
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,210
You changed my wife

812
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:17,840
It's Yukina

813
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,080
Come on, how could you get it wrong?

814
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,180
If he did it to Akina, that would be wicked

815
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,010
If Fujimon-san did it to Akina...   -That's a big issue

816
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,350
I'll be in big trouble for that, so...

817
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,250
Please say it properly

818
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,620
Please say it properly, Shoji-san

819
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,860
Am I Yukina, dude?!

820
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,230
Too late

821
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,130
Please help him wear the mic

822
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,500
It's dangling

823
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,770
Daigo is very close

824
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,230
I have to give him...

825
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,840
A yellow card next time...

826
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:51,540
It's stuck?

827
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,180
Do you think it's in the hole?

828
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,580
Well...let me think...

829
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,610
I'm not the goodwill ambassador of nipples, dude!

830
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:57,680
Please wait for a while

831
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,310
Please learn to wait

832
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,180
How long have you been a comedian? Please learn, Shoji-san

833
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,330
That one is definitely out

834
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,060
No way, that one should be safe

835
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,770
No, you completely laughed

836
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:19,740
I didn't laugh   -You clearly laughed

837
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,140
Matsumoto-san will make the decision

838
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,970
Maybe he'll see it differently

839
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:34,050
Well, to be honest, everyone is having a smiling face

840
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,580
I've been made aware of it

841
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,150
However...   -Look

842
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:44,960
In particular, Fujimon and Daigo is very close   -You're right

843
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,960
That being said...

844
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,930
I didn't see Shoji-san's face clearly

845
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,400
That should be safe   -No way

846
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,740
All I said was "ta-ha!"

847
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,970
So you said it!

848
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:56,970
Saying "ta-ha" is just a habit

849
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,010
Well, let's take a look

850
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,080
Let's take a look, Shoji-san   -It should be safe

851
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,750
I'm not the goodwill ambassador of nipples, dude!

852
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,850
Please wait for a while

853
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,480
Please learn to wait

854
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,350
How long have you been a comedian? Please learn, Shoji-san

855
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,030
He laughed at that one, right?

856
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,500
No, I didn't laugh

857
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,600
It's just "ta-ha"

858
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,100
Shoji-san...

859
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,170
Yellow card   -That one is out

860
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,730
But it's just yellow   -He said "ta-ha"

861
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,300
You clearly said "ta-ha"

862
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,040
Laughing out loud is not allowed

863
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,470
So it's not allowed to say "ta-ha"?

864
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:34,280
Yeah, please don't say it

865
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,410
Why would you want to say it?

866
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,780
Let's continue and good luck everyone

867
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,980
Thank you

868
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,190
Shoji-san knows the rules now
