Endo Shozo  Tanaka Naoki

Gaki no Tsukai's Backstage

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,000
Good Morning

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,680
'Morning

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,270
Manager

00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,270
Yuichi Tajima

8
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,270
Excuse me

9
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,660
Err...

10
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,860
It's about Hamada-san, but...

11
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,700
He kinda...

12
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,700
Found something he's crazy about to become

13
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,340
And said he also said "If you run after two hares, you will catch neither"

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,220
He was wondering if you would come and watch him

15
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,800
No way

16
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,000
Downtown

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi

18
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,000
But, guys...

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
Hamada-san said "If you run after two hares, you will catch neither"

20
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,600
What he's up to and why should we come?

21
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,400
Yamazaki Housei

22
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,670
I thinks is something related to comedy, but

23
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,000
It's something about the thing he's crazy about to become

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
About that thing that punk wants to become...

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm positive it's going to be something he can't do

26
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,180
But you know, where we are right now is the actual spot of our job!

27
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,950
I know that

28
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,500
Well, anyway

29
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,820
Hamada-san said that "If you run after two har-

30
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
We got that already!

31
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,790
Really, right now

32
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,350
You look like a poster of Youku Hata

33
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,560
(March 2005)

34
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,560
Japan Entertainment!

35
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,560
You've been looking so long at this Youku Hata's poster!

37
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
So, what's this going to be?

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:16,840
Right...

39
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,540
Enough already!

40
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,000
Really!

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,700
It's in here!

42
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,710
Guided by manager Tajima, towards the place where Hamada is waiting

43
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,510
Where again?

44
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,000
What's that?

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,650
Enough already!!!

46
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,740
It's cold in here!

47
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,380
What's that?!

48
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,000
So... is this going to be part of today's broadcasting?

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,800
Is that true?

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,320
Huh?

51
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,690
I can kinda hear a voice

52
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,480
And it's loud, too

53
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,480
He must have realized (we're here)

54
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,700
In front, in front, in front!

55
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,800
What is that...?

56
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,060
Go in front, in front!

57
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,530
How did this happen?

58
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,350
More forward, you dumbass!

59
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,140
Forward, I'm saying!

60
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,300
Don't be afraid you bastards!

61
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,210
Are you afraid of the ball?!

62
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,260
Don't be afraid!!

63
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,260
You should come nearer the net!

64
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,210
Don't be afraid of the ball, you bunch of idiots!

65
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,320
Hamada's rage in the gymnasium!?

66
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,320
What's the true meaning behind

67
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,860
It's close, it is really close!

68
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,320
The tournament is drawing closer, you idiots!

69
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,760
What the hell is he doing?

70
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,630
I want to go too! (to the tournament)

71
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,770
What is he doing?

72
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,840
Takahara, come here a second, you brat

73
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,340
What the hell are ya doin'?

74
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,240
I'm sorry!

75
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,950
Do the stance, brat

76
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,410
Yes!

77
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,580
What the hell was that?

78
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,850
Don't let everything be vain, you idiot!

79
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,200
I'm so sorry!

80
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Bend your leg more!

81
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,400
Your stance should be that way, you idiot

82
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,090
Yes!

83
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,390
Do some squat, brat

84
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes! I'm really sorry!

85
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,000
BACK ON TRACK!!

86
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,500
Is Hamada-san

87
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,400
Doing a volleyball coach

88
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,050
Or something like that?

89
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,050
I WANNA GO THERE TOO!! (to the tournament)

90
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,800
I have no idea

91
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,100
Oh, wait a second, just a moment

92
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,550
Guys..!

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,550
Good Morning

94
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,890
A total different Hamada from before

95
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,890
Which is even showing his smile

96
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,000
Good morning

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What's that all about?

98
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,450
What?

99
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,900
Well, that's

100
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
Our daily practice session

101
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,900
Because the tournament is really close!

102
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,900
And I want to go to it too!

103
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,100
That's...

104
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,300
What do you think, Endo?

105
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,570
Excuse me?

106
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,800
What do you think?

107
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,580
Well, what should I think about this...

108
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,310
In order to get them into the tournament which will begin shortly

109
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,680
We need to finish up some preliminary contest during in a month or so

110
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
I want to be part of those, really

111
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,180
The tournament, uh?

112
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,350
What do you think, Endo?

113
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,800
For some reasons, Hamada asks only for Endo's impressions.

114
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,890
Well but...

115
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,490
This is going to take some time, right?

116
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,490
U-uh, you got that right

117
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,630
That's why I'm scolding those girls for good

118
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,940
Say, Endo

119
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,770
I got a nice bunch of young £@!#=&s, right?

120
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,000
Wanna take some of them? Are you thinking about this?

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,080
No way...

122
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Okay! Next up is blocking, blocking! Blocking practice!

123
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,650
Wait a little, won't you?

124
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,480
They were doing squats...

125
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,780
The break is over!

126
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,020
His voice turned all raspy with all those screams!

127
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,850
You're right

128
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,850
He shouted so much

129
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,320
Jump, jump, jump!

130
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,000
Wanting to live by his true nature, uh...

131
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,830
Probably his new life purpose

132
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,400
What the hell is that?

133
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,600
What the hell dude

134
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,750
Risk your life and jump, you idiots!

135
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,550
Shut up and go jumping!

136
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,550
He seems to be merciless

137
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,050
Their hope is going to vanish rapidly

138
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,260
Etou, come here a second

139
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,260
What the hell was that, you idiot?

140
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,630
You should jump more and you know that, you moron!

141
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,630
DON'T YA DARE MAKE FUN OF ME!

142
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,370
Are you despising volleyball?

143
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:02,760
No

144
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,760
YA REALLY ARE DESPISING IT, YA ASSHOLE!!

145
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,270
I'm sorry!

146
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,270
Why did ya ran away, you moron?

147
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,940
UH?!?

148
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,340
Yes!

149
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,340
DON'T YA DARE UNDERESTIMATE VOLLEYBALL, YA IDIOT!

150
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,820
YES!

151
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,410
UNDERSTOOD?!

152
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,000
YES!

153
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,620
Now drag the tire!

154
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,110
Woah... so strict...

155
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,760
For real?!

156
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,360
No one does this nowadays!

157
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,860
Let people from outside do this!

158
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,160
It won't make sense anyway

159
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,990
Really...

160
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,560
I wonder if it's slippery in here...

161
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,560
That's so pointless

162
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:37,970
Jump a lit-

163
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,270
Don't try to slow the pace!

164
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,270
Yes!

165
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,270
ETOOOOOOOU!

166
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,740
Sorry there

167
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,380
Woah, really

168
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,580
As you see, being strict is necessary

169
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,150
So they won't make the same mistakes again

170
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,050
What do you think, Endo?

171
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,050
What do you think?

172
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,890
Well, you're acting very harshly...

173
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,380
Well, Etou won't take this seriously if she's not scolded

174
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,000
Etou?

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,990
Etou, Etou

176
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,030
Ah, Etou-san

177
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,560
Well, she has a nice #"%£

178
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,450
Uh...

179
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,540
Well, that's how it is

180
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,000
That's...

181
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I think that's the only way possible to raise them

182
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,360
I'm protecting them

183
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,210
Just like Mama's Volley?

184
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,440
Yeah but...

185
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,890
The preliminary contest already began

186
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,890
And I want to be part of it too!

187
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,890
I WANT TO GO TO IT TOO!!

188
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,600
Hamada ends up raising the tone of his voice due his overwhelming amount of passion

189
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,190
Trainer!!

190
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,190
Trainer!!!

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,890
Trainer!!!

192
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,890
What happened?!

193
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,080
She hurt her foot?

194
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,570
In here?

195
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,570
Call an ambulance, an ambulance!!

196
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,000
Hang in there

197
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,440
Wasn't he saying "I want to go there too"?

198
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
There's too much fuss in there

199
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,380
He's back

200
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,100
Use this

201
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,450
I don't get the meaning of this

202
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,220
He brought a tree branch

203
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,650
Stay still or I can't place this branch, you moron!

204
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,600
Hamada is performing a first aid by using a tree branch

205
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,430
Isn't the ambulance already there?!

206
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,590
An ambulance?!

207
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,590
Get her in the ambulance!

208
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,450
What the hell...

209
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,190
Oh, they came

210
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,090
That was fast.

211
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,090
Oh, they're there

212
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,090
Nurses are there, but where's the doctor?

213
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,410
She hurt her feet badly, so take good care of her

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,280
Aahh, wait a sec

215
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,500
You know, during this time the street is crowded

216
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,800
Be sure to take kototoi street

217
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,180
Yes

218
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,880
What's with that thoughtfulness?

219
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,750
I agree

220
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,000
You should encourage her!

221
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,100
Take care!

222
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,950
Encourage her!

223
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,200
Get well soon!

224
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Remember: from kototoi street!

225
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,200
It's "KOTOTORI STREET"!

226
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,760
Why giving instructions about the street?

227
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,520
Alright, let's take a break

228
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,170
Yes!

229
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,940
After this get serious about your training!

230
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,240
Etou, no one told you to stop running with the tire

231
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,410
Got it

232
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,600
He's so strict on Etou, isn't him?

233
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,940
He's a jerk against her

234
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,940
So strict on her...

235
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
We broke a sweat, didn't we?

236
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
A break...

237
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,290
The preliminary contest is very near, that's why I'm being so strict, you know...

238
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,100
Hamada suddenly turns into mama-san during the practice, concealing his rude side

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,490
Who the hell told him anything about that?

240
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,490
You're right...

241
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,300
Really!?

242
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,570
It would feel bad even to have a chat with him

243
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,430
I agree

244
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,900
That's a sandwich I made!

245
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,700
Eh? Really?

246
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,000
Looks delicious!

247
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,710
Thanks a lot

248
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:41,880
Hamada is being a real mama-san, having his pupils making him try the hand-made food they brought

249
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,980
That's disgraceful

250
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,650
Cucumbers? That's good!

251
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,030
Stephanie, how about that matter of your?

252
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,300
That's possible...

253
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,300
Huh?

254
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,300
He totally answered randomly

255
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
He answered so bluntly

256
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,300
Just like a "is that so.."

257
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,650
I didn't understand anything

258
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, if you think it is like that, isn't that enough?

259
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,600
Once more a random answer

260
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,360
Shouldn't he answer in english?

261
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,960
That's right, he should

262
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,400
But he's answering in japanese

263
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
That's delicious, it's ok to me

264
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,260
But that sandwich, it just

265
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,100
It has too many cucumbers in it!

266
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
It looks as if he's very popular

267
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,640
The tension completely vanished

268
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,060
Looks like it

269
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,060
He's coming

270
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,380
Endo?

271
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,210
Yes?

272
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,350
Eat up

273
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,560
Ah.. okay, right

274
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
It's safe

275
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,560
Everyone eat one, starting from Endo

276
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,160
This time not only Endo?

277
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,340
If it's like that, I'm going to eat

278
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,900
It's hand-made

279
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
Hand-made cookies

280
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,870
Cookies?

281
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,870
They're delicious

282
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,750
Well, they're not bad

283
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,170
I told ya

284
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:11,680
Yeah

285
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,370
That's it?

286
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,370
If you want another, take it

287
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,240
Thanks

288
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,410
Who made those?

289
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,410
Ah, Stephanie's grandmother

290
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,410
She's a baker

291
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,410
You can have this, hold them

292
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,850
Take them home

293
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,720
Huh? All of those?

294
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,290
Uh-uh

295
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,290
Let your daughter Hoheto have some of those

296
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,560
Her name is Iroha

297
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Thanks a lot

298
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,700
Hamada, you too should uhm...

299
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,000
You know is getting sunny

300
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,650
The weather is going to be good...

301
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,650
yeah...

302
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,000
Well but it's still cold outside, I prefer train in here

303
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,790
If we can do it, it's good

304
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,030
Etou is still running

305
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,250
Isn't okay for her to stop now?

306
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,250
Well, she has a nice #%!&, so this won't hurt

307
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,250
You've been saying #!%& a lot, recently

308
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,460
That's because I'm working on them

309
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,870
If they accomplish this training, I'm coming back for sure

310
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,130
Okay?

311
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,220
You know, the preliminary contest is drawing near

312
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,220
I want to go to it too!

313
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,670
ALRIGHT!

314
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,270
Back to practice!

315
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,270
Etou, get to training!

316
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,610
I wonder why he snapped at us

317
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,740
Because "I want to go to it too!"

318
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,450
Mama Hamada is beginning the attack practice

319
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,030
Woah! she's good!

320
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,030
Really good!

321
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,730
Huh?

322
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,670
He didn't get angry on that person just now

323
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,400
He snapped at Etou but not at the old lady

324
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,400
More, more!

325
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,910
Strike the ball harder!

326
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,280
Awesome!

327
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
She's on a high level!

328
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,380
We're doing great!

329
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,880
Number 7 is strange

330
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,190
Yeah, she's strange

331
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,170
Number 7's figure looks like a red wiener

332
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,410
Tatemori, wait a second

333
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,410
You've been acting strange

334
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,250
What the hell? Your hand must be like this to strike

335
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,950
*Guu: rock in rock-paper-scissor

336
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,950
Why are you doing the guu--- what the-?

337
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,600
What's that? What happened?

338
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,580
Well, actually...

339
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,240
What

340
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,570
Why are you keeping the guu, what the hell

341
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,160
What's that?

342
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,000
It's chocolate!

343
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's Valentine day, you know, today!

344
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,400
So...

345
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,360
You've been holding this from the beginning?

346
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,840
Coach! Me too!

347
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,570
Me too!

348
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,320
For real?

349
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,570
Me too! Me too!

350
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,510
What the hell

351
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,710
Really?

352
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,710
What the hell are you doin'?!

353
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,560
From me too!

354
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,450
Girls! let's lift up our coach!

355
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,450
What the hell are you sayin'!

356
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,450
There's no need to do that!

357
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,560
I didn't get the meaning of this lift-up.

358
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,010
Good, isn't it?

359
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,240
What do you think, Endo?

360
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,160
Isn't a relation like this a good thing?

361
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, it is... yeah

362
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,950
Well...

363
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,800
There are also times in which I'm harsh

364
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,900
But relationships among us humans should have this feel... kindness and the rest...

365
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,900
*bell rings*

366
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,900
Perfect timing, this bell

367
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,210
It rang at the most perfect moment

368
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,590
Are we done with this, now?

369
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,210
That wasn't part of the performance, am I right?

370
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:23,690
Subtitles, encoding and translation: Mauro (マウロ) (aka Shion from TeamGaki) Visit: teamgaki.com follow me on twitter: @0daruma And don't forget to read the description! More has to come...

371
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,210
Okay! Back with the practice!

372
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,690
Shall we go?

373
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,690
I'm done with this, I don't get its meaning

374
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,690
Really, dude
