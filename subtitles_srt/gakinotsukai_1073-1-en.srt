00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Gaki no Tsukai presents- Risk it on this mouth full

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,300
Prize money worth 10,000 Yen- Potato Chips!!! (OR CRISPS!!)

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,500
Number 29!

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Number 29!?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And we haven't done this one so far?..

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
No, we hadn't done this one yet.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Last time, on Kiki Apple Juice

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,300
Tanaka got it right (First time in 9 years!)

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,800
First time in 9 years

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
My god, Tanaka.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
It took me 9 years..

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
You, with your nose illness.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Your ill nose finally..

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
It doesn't matter, I got it right finally!

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,600
But anyway, today, Yamazaki-san's confidence is just ridiculous

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,000
It really is.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,800
Because seriously, I really love Potato Chips.

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,500
Ye, you are always eating it.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,800
You do, you really do.

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,400
I eat like, so much!

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,400
Honestly, I literally like, never eat it.

22
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Me neither..

23
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,000
But today, out of 24 people, 6 got it, so its a 1 in 4 chance of getting it.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So someone should get it right for sure.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,800
No way...

26
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Apparently all the people who got it right are 'gay'

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
For christs sake, stop that..

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,500
I don't get why only the 'homosexual's' got it right?..

29
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,000
But... Most of the Gaki no Tsukai are 'gay' you know?

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,550
Really?!

31
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,150
I don't think anyone is!

32
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,850
DOWNTOWN GAKI NO TSUKAI

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,000

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Kiki Potato Chips. Out of the 15 choices of them

36
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:29,400
You taste one whilst blindfolded, then have to taste and see which one is the one you ate. Get it right, 10,000 Yen, get it wrong, and a punishment awaits...

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,700
First off is Yamazaki, who has so much confidence in getting it right.

38
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,700
The answer to his 'selection' is the 'lightly salted Koikeya' Potato Chips

39
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,700
OH!

40
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,500
I've eaten this before!

41
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
He's gone for it.

42
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Whenever he eats here, he always changes the way he bites and stuff.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let me ask you something

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,300
Is it a new potato style?

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,700
Or a normal style potato?

46
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,200
Right, let's go.

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Ok. Good luck.

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Good luck!

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Good luck!

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,500
Wait, let me just eat a bit more.

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
You know...

52
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
They're all the same you know?

53
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going for it!

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No seirously, just go for it.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Sure.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I really eat this one like, loads!

57
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Honestly..

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,000
Either Karbi, KOIKEYA,

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,700
One of these three.

60
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,200
Oh?

61
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
Or...

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
You're saying 'Or?'...

63
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,200
You said three...

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm about 80% sure it's one of those three.

65
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,400
And..

66
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,700
This one.. This one or this one.

67
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,700
There's loads now...

68
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,700
This one will...

69
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
The numbers are seriously increasing...

70
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,700
They only sell this one in Family Mart.

71
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,200
There's a huge choice now...

72
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,200
No, at the beginning you sounded so sure...

73
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
Oh, that's how it is...

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,800
He couldn't even make me feel nervous or relaxed there at all...

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,000
I couldn't even make you laugh, nervous or relaxed??

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You weren't intimidating, you weren't funny...

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,500
Let's have none of that...

78
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,700
Hold on a second...

79
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,000
God, he's taking ages..

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hurry up and pick the one you think it is.

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's not eating at all!

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
Let's go for it man!

83
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Can I first eat this one? By eating this...

84
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,200
I will be able to tell the difference.

85
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
What do you mean, what do you mean?

86
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,200
You do know that now you're eating it, you're going to have to decide if it is the right one or not, right?

87
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,800
Of course, of course.

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
No, this is different, even from the scent, it's different.

89
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
That potato is really yellow...

90
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
It's SO different.

91
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,100
The potato chip I ate...

92
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Was NOT

93
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,100
The Sant Cashio.

94
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,500
Go on, get it right.

95
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,100
Ye,

96
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,600
So what was so different?

97
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,600
First, the feeling

98
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,800
The smell

99
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Even the feeling on my finger.

100
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,200
And when it was on my tongue.

101
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
So from the very start?

102
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,200
Yep, the very start.

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
All the 5 different senses said it was wrong.

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
It's that different, huh?

105
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I've definitely eaten this before, I'm going to try this 'Boku no Oyatsu'

106
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,700
Hang on a second, this is dangerous.

107
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,500
What the hell

108
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,500
What the hell, man?!

109
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,700
What is it?

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,700
Whatever happens, you need a tempo

111
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,500
And your tempo... Has been

112
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Shit from the first day you started on set.

113
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
How many years has he been in this industry again?..

114
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Even though his tempo is shit,

115
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,900
He is able to spot the difference

116
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,590
And gets through 2 more bags.

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
I think I'm just going to go for it.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It can't be helped.

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,800
King?

120
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
King. It's these three.

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It has to be one of these 3.

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Ok, let's go for it. I'm going to try this one.

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,400
No, it's wrong.

124
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,000
The feeling on my finger is totally different.

125
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,800
It's totally wrong.

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The potato chips I ate.

127
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,000
Was not the...

128
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,500
Lightly salted 'Koikeya'

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're so uncool..

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What the hell, man!

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,700
Hurry up and come to the front.

132
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,700
You're kidding me!!!

133
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
I can't help you. You're really pathetic..

134
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,000
Here he comes!

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
God, he's ugly..

136
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,700
*&%(&$(*#$& (I think he says 'Motto Baito Shiroyo!' which means 'Bite it more!'

137
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,000
No idea what he just said..

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
&#$*#$&!*#&! (I think 'Kono Ringo yaro' meaning 'You apple shit..(?)'

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,500
That's why he's scary... That's exactly why...

140
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
That was really hard...

141
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,200
That looks so painful...

142
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,100
That has got to hurt..

143
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,100
It's this one.

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,100
No way!

145
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,300
It's not.

146
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,900
That man was so ugly!..

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Aww, am I finished already?...

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes, you're finished.

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,500
Please let me do it one more time...

150
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
No, the viewers don't want to see you anymore.

151
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,600
Next, is Endo, who says he hardly ever eats Potato Chips

152
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,000
The answer for his one will be one which they sell only at the supermarket store, Life.

153
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,600
Kurashimoa Potato Chips

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,900
Going to try the salt...

155
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,800
Well they are all salted....

156
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,800
They're all lightly salted.

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,800
There's like a thickness to it... And wow! It's really tastes of potatos.

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Well, obviously it's going to be.

159
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I know, but..

160
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,060
Did you think it wouldn't or something?..

161
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,560
It really felt like.. thick.

162
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,560
You were saying it felt thick.

163
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,560
I'm going to try this one. Housei-san went for it as well.

164
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
San Nicasio...

165
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,900
It's totally wrong.

166
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,300
It's so different!

167
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
I'm so sick and tired of hearing 'It's so different'

168
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,300
The potato chips I ate...

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,300
was not the..

170
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,300
San Nicasio...

171
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,000
Next, he got through the 2nd packet of crisps with no problem.

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is one I sometimes eat...

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
'Karbi' huh?

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Karbi Potato Chips...

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm going to try this one.

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Karbi, huh?

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The thickness is similar...

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,200
So far, you've said that the other ones..

179
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Weren't thick enough to be the right one, right?

180
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Yep, that's what he said.

181
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
It's thicker, right?

182
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,800
But unlike this one, which you eat from time to time...

183
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Oh man....

184
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,700
Have I really already met the one?

185
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,000
He said that the potato taste was really thick..

186
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
He's literally got his back to us.

187
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
Why are you facing that way?

188
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,400
What the hell man?

189
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,000
What's wrong?

190
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,900
I can really taste the potato.

191
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Like, I can really taste the potato fully.

192
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,400
When I licked the 'correct one' before,

193
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,750
I thought it was like...

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Even though it's 'lightly salted'

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's literally stuck on your nose though, you know?

196
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,800
Oh man, this is like seriously...

197
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Like, the salt is really thick and...

198
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,200
The thickness is the same, and that last feeling...

199
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,800
of the potato chip..

200
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,900
So why are you still taking the chip and walking over there to eat it then?!

201
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,700
Eat it over here..

202
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
He shouldn't turn his back to us...

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is like... It's come.

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It came all of a sudden..

205
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,000
And when I told my daughter today 'I'm off to do Kiki' she was so happy...

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,500
You're daughter will be watching right now as well, right?

207
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,000
Ye for sure. She was asking me to put it on a DVD and everything...

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So far, you know...

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,900
Even if a close relative was watching, they wouldn't be interested.

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,500
Sorry, I'm going to take the last one..

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,500
I've got nothing against how much you eat..

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
Oh man, seriously, today...

213
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
My daughter will definitely be watching as well...

214
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
This part is crucial, you know?

215
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,000
Daddy's going to do it!

216
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,000
He's really going to do it!

217
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
The one I ate..

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,800
IS the Karbi Potato Chips!

219
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
This is really...

220
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,400
terrible.

221
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,700
Stop going for..

222
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,400
the girls who like like potatos...

223
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
That's a very rude thing to say.

224
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
His daughter!!

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Ye, my daughter's watching you know!

226
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,500
I wonder why this time, the guy was able to say it so well..

227
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
This is the one you ate before.

228
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
This is the one...

229
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Oh... Ye, they're the same.

230
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,500
Third is the man who's got the right answer 5 times.

231
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Hamada.

232
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,800
His answer is one that uses healthy products..

233
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,400
Soukensha Potato chips.

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,800
The piece that fell back into the plate was bigger...

235
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,500
How the hell do you manage to drop more than you actually eat?...

236
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
He's even moving weirdly from left to right...

237
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,900
You know, when Yama-chan and Endo said

238
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,200
the salt was quite strong?

239
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes?

240
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,750
This ones quite weak.

241
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,200
I think it also has to do with your body condition.

242
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Like salt intake...

243
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
My body is in its prime!

244
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,000
Ye, they're all salted aren't they..

245
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,100
But as I said before, this is quite strong on the salt right?

246
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,800
Of course

247
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,500
It would be totally weird if there was

248
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
consomme here, wouldn't it?

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,200
Right now, I'm looking at the ingredients.

250
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,500
But if you were to ask me, I wouldn't say it has much salt on it.

251
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,800
I feel sorry for the Potato Chips

252
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
They're being stared down...

253
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,800
From quite close range too..

254
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,800
I feel so sorry for them!

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It must be horrible for them...

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This one...

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Soukensha..

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,500
Everyone sniff it huh?

259
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
I'm guessing the scent's strong

260
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,200
No, it definitely is important

261
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,200
Ok, he's gone for it now.

262
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
He certainly did

263
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I have no idea at all

264
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
It's the first one!

265
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,500
I thought he was going to say 'It's totally wrong'

266
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,800
So it's a shock to me that he said 'I have no idea'

267
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Well they're all potato chips!

268
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Well ye, they are but..

269
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,500
But you were saying something about the salt?

270
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,000
When I compare it to before, this one has a little bit more..

271
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is the taste strong?

272
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ye.

273
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But, if someone told me this was the correct one, I would say

274
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh right..

275
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,200
But if it's totally different, it's totally different

276
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,900
WHAT?

277
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,000
Every time we do Kiki, your ears never seem to work...

278
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No, he can never hear us...

279
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,500
I have no idea at all!

280
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Who gives a shit!

281
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,000
That's the whole point of this corner..

282
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,000
This is where you got to try hard and work it out

283
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I mean even the fat is like...

284
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,700
completely the same. They're all the same.

285
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,700
My god, he's looking at us..

286
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,300
What the hell is this?!

287
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
In a few years time

288
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,900
He will be doing this alone at home, you know?

289
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
While mumbling about it...

290
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,000
While mumbling about it?..

291
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,500
Oh, I have no idea but..

292
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,400
It had more salt than the one I had before so it must be wrong!

293
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
The Potato Chips I ate...

294
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,500
was NOT the lightly salted Soukensha..

295
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
IT'S THE FIRST ONE!

296
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
The first one!

297
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,200
Are you serious!?

298
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,800
You were lucky!

299
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Ye, and then I thought he would get it right!

300
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
I really thought 'God, he's so lucky'

301
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,500
Ye..

302
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Seriously

303
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
You've got to be kidding me!

304
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,500
Here he comes!

305
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
This really hurts...

306
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,200
Your sense of taste...

307
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
It's worse than...

308
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
No idea..

309
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It sounded kind of philosophical..

310
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What did I do wrong?!

311
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He hit me even though I didn't really do anything wrong to him!

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He said 'worse than'

313
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,700
You can't hit me without saying anything!

314
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Are you serious!

315
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,500
Next is

316
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,700
Tanaka, who last time for the first time in 9 years, got the correct answer

317
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,800
Tanaka-san, you eat quite a bit right?

318
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
I really love the stuff.

319
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
However

320
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,200
But it's the Karbi

321
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Which I'm crazy about and eat all the time

322
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,800
So I'm not really sure about the others...

323
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,400
His answer is Yamnoshi's

324
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,300
Okinawa's Umami Shio Aji'

325
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,600
Are you a French person?

326
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
It's crunchy!

327
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,600
All of them are!

328
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,600
You love the stuff though, right?

329
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
Ye, like seriously

330
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,600
I eat like, so many of these

331
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,000
How many bags do you get through a year?

332
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
In a week, I will definitely have eaten a packet at least.

333
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I've eaten hundreds of packs of these, ever since I was a kid.

334
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's loads

335
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,200
That's more than Yamazaki.

336
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,500
But that's why I'm going to automatically compare everything to this now..

337
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,500
I haven't eaten..

338
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Any of the others

339
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,500
So I need to find out the difference

340
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Tarimono Shoukai

341
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,000
This uses Olive Oil

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I see.

343
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,000
No, the olive oil is really strong

344
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,300
The olive oil's different?

345
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
No, it's wrong!

346
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,500
It's not this one!

347
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,000
The one I ate...

348
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,600
Was not Tanimoto Shoukai no Olive Oil Potato Chips!

349
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Well that one was easy..

350
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,500
Now he's gained a bit of confidence from that one.

351
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,300
It was like really crunchy..

352
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,300
The Shizuoka-san Potato chips

353
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,700
His nose is buggered...

354
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Ye, it's been like 20 years now..

355
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,200
Then why is he smelling it?

356
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,200
I think he wants to do the same thing as other people..

357
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
It's just to look good, huh?

358
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Oh, he's posing?

359
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,900
No, the feeling is wrong.

360
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,900
The one I ate was crunchier.

361
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,700
The one I ate was

362
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,300
Not the Mikata Potato Chips

363
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,000
Hang on a second...

364
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
He's been doing a one man show for a while now...

365
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Like a little play or something...

366
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,000
He's going to perform at the Aoyama Theatre (place were comedians trying to make it appear to make a name for themselves)

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I want to know if there are other ones

368
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
which have this crunchiness, that's what I want to know

369
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,500
We were all the same..

370
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
But you should be able to get it since you eat it all the time.

371
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,000
I really felt it was crunchy

372
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I really felt it was crispy and had a solid taste

373
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,000
The thing I'm scared about

374
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If there is like another type

375
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,500
of crunchiness.

376
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,000
You said basically the same thing before!

377
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We have no idea what you mean!

378
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
They're all crunchy!

379
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm sure they're all crunchy.

380
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,500
They're made like that

381
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm going for it

382
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,500
Oh please, I beg you.

383
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,000
I really want to get this one right.

384
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
The Potato Chips I ate..

385
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
WAS the Fukayayoshi no

386
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Hokkaido Potato Chips!

387
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,900
This is too hard!

388
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,800
It's so difficult!

389
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,800
I don't want to do it anymore..

390
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Shall I fry you in some oil as well!?

391
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
That one, we understood

392
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
I understood that one.

393
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Umm, excuse me?

394
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Can we please do it properly?

395
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The guy today is just riduculous!

396
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That was like un-heard of!

397
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,500
His understandings of shapes is just shit!

398
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,200
So far, this is the WORST the 4 members have ever done in a Kiki.

399
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,800
Can Matsumoto save the show..

400
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,500
And get the correct answer?

401
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Who's got the eye mask?

402
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
The eye mask?

403
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,400
It's ok, seriously, no problem.

404
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,100
No no, just in case.

405
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,100
You'll definitely look

406
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,200
I will do it like this..

407
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,000
No, you'll look

408
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And you wouldn't be able to eat it either with your hands there.

409
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,700
The answer to Matsumoto will be the same as it was to Yamazaki

410
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,200
Koikeya's Nishi Nihon Potato Chips

411
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,600
Hmmm... I see, I see

412
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,800
Shall I tell you something that you guys have missed out on?

413
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,800
The lighter ones.

414
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,900
The fat shapes too.

415
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,400
That's disgusting!

416
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Wait, what, what, what is it?

417
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Oi, you.

418
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,300
Don't say that it's disgusting so loudly..

419
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,800
I do have feelings too you know?..

420
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,800
You know this part which is a little different?

421
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Some have it and some don't.

422
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think that's a big clue

423
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,000
I think most of them have that...

424
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Ye, they do. They all do I think..

425
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And plus, that could confuse you..

426
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,500
There's like no saltiness at all!

427
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,000
Ye, I felt exactly the same when I ate mine too.

428
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Hang on, I'm pretty sure I've eaten this one before.

429
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I've eaten this one before!

430
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
I... Have eaten this one before!

431
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,200
Right then, let's go.

432
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,800
Ok, good luck!

433
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,800
For someone like me, who doesn't eat potato chips much

434
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,000
to say he has eaten it before...

435
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,000
It's going to be around here.

436
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,500
I see.

437
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,000
Can I just go for Honmaru Karbi?..

438
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Well ye, sure, why not.

439
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,300
I don't get why he's asking

440
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,300
But you know how I can be quite like, reckless sometimes?

441
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,300
I don't think you are that kind of guy to be honest, but ok...

442
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,300
I've never listened to like theories or rules or morales and I have always

443
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,800
crushed them throughout my life

444
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,000
That's not true at all!

445
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,700
It's got to be one of these three.

446
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,400
I've definitely eaten it before.

447
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,400
And to be honest, I think you would have chosen one of these three last.

448
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,400
I'm actually going to go for King Potato Chips now.

449
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
I'm going to tuck in.

450
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,000
With no breaks.

451
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,000
Well you've just got to decide on wether it's right or wrong.

452
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Just in case, let's go for this one.

453
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,400
The one next to it?

454
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
The one next to it?..

455
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
He chose the one next to it..

456
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
After that speech, he went straight to the one next to it..

457
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I get it..

458
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,800
This is totally different.

459
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,300
I could laugh...

460
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
I'm telling you, I could laugh at it..

461
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,300
It's so wrong that I don't even need a second one.

462
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,300
The potato chips I ate

463
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Was not the Koikeya lightly salted Potato Chips

464
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,300
The Honmaru one is the scary one...

465
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,300
This one.

466
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
I really get it.

467
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,000
This one is too hard!

468
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,000
It wasn't like this, it wasn't like this!

469
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,300
It wasn't like this, it wasn't like this!

470
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,000
God, I want to smack him

471
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,800
Please smack him.

472
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,400
It's totally different, I get it.

473
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,000
The Potato Chips I ate

474
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,500
was NOT the Koikeya Potato, hang on

475
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,300
Wasn't the one before the same?

476
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,200
That one is different.

477
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,200
Oh... It's NOT the Nishi Nihon Gentei.

478
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,800
No, no, no

479
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
It doesn't count, it doesn't count.

480
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
No, it does.

481
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,200
You can't do it again.

482
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Let me do it once more.

483
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
No, you can't!

484
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
LET ME DO IT ONE MORE TIME, GODDAMN IT!

485
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,000
LET ME DO IT ONE MORE TIME!

486
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
No, that's not allowed!

487
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Just bring him to the front.

488
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,500
How can we show this to the public?!

489
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,800
How can we put this on air!?

490
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,800
Let me do this once more!

491
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
You got it wrong..

492
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Bring him to the front!

493
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,800
How can we air something so crap!

494
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,000
Let me do it once more!

495
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Just hurry up!

496
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,800
You really were pathetic

497
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
That really was pathetic.

498
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Why the hell is he getting so angry?!

499
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
You serious?!

500
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
You have a head like a...

501
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Potato and...

502
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,800
................................

503
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
And?.. A potato and?

504
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
God, he forgets the words a lot..

505
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
He really does forget the words a lot..

506
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Say something!

507
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,300
When he said at the beginning, because he was last

508
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
We might choose one of the ones we chose the near the beginning..

509
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Ye I know..

510
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,200
You know, we chose the same one as we did for Yamazaki at the start/

511
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,800
I thought he was thinking like that as well.

512
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,800
I told you so!

513
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,800
Your voice went crazy there!

514
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
You're voice is like nearly gone.

515
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
No seriously, bring me the eye mask

516
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Oh, who cares.

517
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,500
No seriously, seriously.

518
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,200
I'm mucking around now..

519
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,780
Let's go, let's go.

520
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,780
Ok, but I will leave him the eye mask anyway.

521
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,780
Ye, just leave him the eye mask

522
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,200
Actually, it's ok. I'll just do it like this..

523
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,000
Who's going to choose it and bring it to you?

524
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Someone help him out.

525
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,500
Hurry up, hurry up.

526
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,000
It's not like I can see at all.

527
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Hurry up, hurry up.

528
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
I'm really sad and lonely now..

529
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Stop making me wait..

530
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
