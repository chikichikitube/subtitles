00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:09,820
When it was first soaked in the sake it must have been shit scared...

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,730
It all started with this comment

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,730
m -13 37 l 2 37 l 3 18 l 2 -4 l -2 -23 l -68 -25 l -86 -25 l -86 39 l -86 37 l -33 37

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,460
Sorry this isn't a funny story at all but I was watching some some stuff on BS

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,330
and it looked SO GOOD!

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,640
Mom's top "want to try" food...

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,030
Thinking I would love to go. Can't we go there with this show?

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,700
For what? What looked good?

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,640
Japanese blue crab!

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,940
Japanese blue crab

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,810
They like soak them in sake

12
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:33,580
Different from normal Japanese blue crab!

13
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,510
and then they take this drunken crab

14
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,540
and a dude grills it for 3 hours.

15
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,080
This old guy is horrible isn't he?

16
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:41,150
The name is drunken crab!

17
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,520
Then they crack it open

18
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,920
and the stuff inside...

19
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,920
The crab innards right?

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,850
It looked so damn good

21
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,360

22
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,490
A hearty budget of...

23
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,490
Matsumoto family & Drunken Crab

24
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,490
80.000 Yen!!

25
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,030

26
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,690
Yeah it'll definitely make it!

27
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:58,840
In order to fulfill mommy's dreams, a big horse racing competition!

28
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,800
Keep going! It can make it!

29
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,800
So close so close so close!

30
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:58,840
However, an unexpected event awaited them...

31
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,500
Wait, hold on

32
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,500
Huh? Hold on!

33
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,210
He's holding a ton!

34
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,210
Wait a minute...

35
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:09,780
A ticket that daddy bought secretly with his own money

36
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,910
"#4 takes the prize"

37
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,910
100,000 Yen!

38
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,780
Got him 450.000 Yen!

39
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,610
He bet 100,000 Yen...

40
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,350
We got 450,000 Yen (4000$)

41
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,380
This bastard kept it a secret

42
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,920
Let's go get some crab!

43
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,160
Let's get 100,000. 100,000 Yen for crab

44
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,430
～Let's go get some crab～

45
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:24,800
A budget of 100.000 Yen!

We've now arrived in Himeji!

52
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,610
We've finally made it!

53
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,180
Let's go and get the drunken crab mommy wanted!

54
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,290
Although it's all thanks to Dad..

55
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,050
It's all because...

56
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,050
Yeah that's true

57
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,660
...Dad decided to be dishonest with us about that bet

58
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,190
No, no, no I wasn't being dishonest

59
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,190
Okay that's good

60
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,560
We officially won the bet in a fair way...

61
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,560
Alright that makes me happy

62
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,500
100.000 yen

63
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,500

that daddy actually gave us

66
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,830
The horse racing right?

67
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,830
I think this is the first time?

68
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,330
For us to have this much cash on hand

69
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,340
Since we had money, we were both able to get these

70
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,210
Yeah! Thanks Dad!

71
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,210
Yayyー

72
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,040
You actually bought these?

73
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,610
Yeah. But they were pretty cheap though...

74
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,280
5800 Yen! (50$)

75
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,910

If this was a normal "Matsumoto Ke" episode

81
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,250
That's already half our budget ya know!

82
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,250
You spent it on that for real?

83
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,250
Yeah...

84
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,320
Huh? Vacations are supposed to be like that!

85

Agreed!

86
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,660
That's scary

87
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,230
We still have a lot of money left

88
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,230
We have 100.000 Yen!

89
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,060
That 100.000 Yen is legit mine though

90
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,400
That was actually yours yeah..

91
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,400
But I'm your child!

92
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,700
Dude you better watch it..

93
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,700
I'm a good crab, a good crab～

94
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,900
He's super pumped isn't he?

95
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,240
Today, we're going

96
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,940
Yeah, let's go

97
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,640
The crab is already drunken

98
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,640
It's already drunk?

99
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,480
Well..

100
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,480
Like super drunk?

101
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,580
It's already drunk...

102
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,580
Already? Wow..

103
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,320
Yeah, so since it had to stay soaked for quite a while...

104
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
...It's already drunk.

105
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,320
Seriously?

106
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,790
It's probably walking forward by now. Cause it's so drunk.

107
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:07,070
2 hours ago

108
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,630
So in terms of time, It's been soaked

109
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:04,530
in the sake ever since you passed Gifuhashima in the train.

110
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,270
What a dummy～

111
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,270
He's so dumb

112
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,740
And aren't we gonna... be taking a ship today?

113
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,500
Yes, we're going on a boat.

114
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,500
From here

115
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,040
Yeah, we can't go there by car

116
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,940
We're going to be going to a place called Ieshima

117
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,610
Ieshima?

118
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,810
We can only go there by boat

119
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,410
I won't get seasick?

120
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,750
We already got something for seasickness so it'll be okay!

121
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,890
Are you for real?

122
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,590
How much I wonder…

123

How much will it be shaking…

129
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,890
Your mom and I aren't good with big movements

130
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,890
It'll be okay

131
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,260
This is going to make me not talk is that alright?

132
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,830
I can't sit the opposite direction of travel. It makes me feel sick.

133
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,900
See, look at this

134
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,900
Wow!

That's big!

136
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,410
It's slightly smaller than what I imagined

137
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,280
This one's huge though!

138
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,840
This is the first time I've been on something like this

139
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,050
People from Ieshima use this too so... Like high school students.

Well uh…

152
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,000
Now this is really starting to annoy me, given our situation.

153
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,040
～8,000 Yen! 8,000 Yen!～

154
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,370
You seriously bought those for something that didn't get any laughs at all

155
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,240
How much did you freaking spend?!

156
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,240

I've never seen this much money in here on this show.

160
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,950
Yay!

161
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,420

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,480
Everyone here are like waving goodbye to us

179
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,650
Here, use this. Wave with this!

180
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,650
Huh?

181
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,820
I'm telling you.. no one knows what the heck this is for

182
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,190
Hahaha!

183
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,190
They don't know why we have this...

184
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,890
Hahaha!

185
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,830
But they like it!

186
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:24,070
If you do get seasick, tell me just in case..

187
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,210
Yeah I will but...

188
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,040
I got something that you can put on as soon as you get seasick

189
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,140
You put it on?

190
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,140
Yes

191
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,210
Eh, what do you put on？

192
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,220
This…

193
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,790
If ya put these on

194
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,790
it'll fix your sea sickness right away

195
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,290
So it has water to balance your vision...

196
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:52,530
Glasses that won't make you sea sick: Boarding ring

197
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:52,530
The blue liquid always stays leveled and cancels the imbalance between sense and vision

198
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,960
Yeah, exactly

199
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,130
In cooperation with the french navy

200
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,000
I mean the French Navy endures the strait of Dover...

201
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,570
Waves crashing... They all wear this

202
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,810
They don't get seasick?

203
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,810
Well it's more like..

204
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,710
It'll fix it if you do

205
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,550
Dude it's already moving so much

206
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,550
Huh? Hold on!

207
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,250
No it's like a car making a sharp turn. We're going straight now It's fine!

208
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,090
Ugh, this is scary...

209
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,730
Off to our destination of drunken crabs!

210
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,830
It's gonna be good...

211
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,830
It's gonna be so good

212
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,930
It's gonna be good

213
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,930
I'm super excited

214
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,740
Today is going to be a full course crab meal.

215
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,440
I made reservations as "Matsumoto Ke"..

216
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,370
Does the island have other gourmet places?

217
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,540
like a place to snack…

218
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,540
They do they do!

219
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,410
Plenty of delicious places!

220
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,120
Let me know if anyone needs these...

221
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,090
This was

222
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,090
11,000 Yen

223
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,620
My what a bargain

224
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,450
Eh?! You bought it?!

225
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,320
Yeah...

226
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,390
Huh? What's wrong?

227
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,390
This is super necessary!

228
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,560
Yeah, we need it!

229
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,560
Hold on hold on...

230
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,000
We didn't have 100,000 Yen in the wallet so...

231
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,870
Oh, well yeah, we spent money from that...

232
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:11,310
Huh? 1  2  3  4  5  6...

233
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,880
We've got 70.000 Yen...

234
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,580
Well of course! We spent 5800, 11000

235
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,550
"Cosmomarin" A boating ring: 11000 Yen

236
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,550
2 x crab gloves crab ● hat: 5800 Yen

237
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,550
75200 yen

238
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,550
Himeji port 〈 〉 Ieshima port fare (round trip): 8000 yen

239
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,550
Left:

240
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,550
m -13 37 l 2 37 l 3 18 l 2 -4 l -2 -23 l -68 -25 l -86 -25 l -86 39 l -86 37 l -33 37

241
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,350
and then 8,000 Yen on those things...

242
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,150
What the hell are you doing?

243
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,720
Come on, let's not be stingy!

244
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,330
100,000yen..

245
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,330
Dude, you..

246
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:33,730
The crab and the people watching us are probably laughing at us

247
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,540
Have you ever seen anything this fun before!?

248
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,170
No no, maybe we could've spent that money to stop by to snack somewhere

249
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,640
But with those on, even on a roller coaster you'd be fine

250
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,620
Haha, he's getting seasick!

251
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,620
Eh, are you kidding?

252
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,520
From your own talking?

253
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,520
You're the one that brought this up!

254
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,820
This is really...

255
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,820
It's moving so much

256
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,790
This is actually pretty unpleasant

257
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,790
This is awful isn't it?

258
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,460
The sound too...

259
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,460
I'm actually doing fine

260
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,630
I'm completely fine..

261
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,630
These actually..

262
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,870
..make things so much better. I'm serious!

263
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,240
Let's try those glasses on.

264
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,040
Maybe I'll try and see..

265
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,040
Please.

266
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,320
Ohh I see I see…

267
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Right!?

268
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,420
Seriously?

269
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,260
This is actually pretty fascinating..

270
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,260
It's seriously good!

271
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,660
Dad, it's good, it really works!

272
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,700
But I'm not seasick..

273
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,670
Wow!

274
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,670
You get it?

275
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,310
It starts to feel super refreshing

276
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,370
That much though?

277
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,370
For real though,

278
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,740
Maybe it's just a placebo effect?

279
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,880
No, I get you. I totally get what you're saying.

280
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,580
It starts to feel refreshing

281
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,580
Refreshing! Yeah

282
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,290
It helps me even see so much better!

283
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,960
Good isn't it?

284
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,960
I can see so clearly!

285
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,460
I can see you're wearing panties!

286
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,460
See!?

287
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,260
Wasn't it worth spending 10,000 Yen?

288
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,260
Nah, I'd rather get it on my own time

289
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,700
What's this what's this...

290
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,770
Dang... This is so cool

291
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,780
Yeah! It makes me a bit sick when I take it off

292
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,180
It works as promised..

293
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,180
If this looked a little more fashionable..

294
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,550
..Then it'd be perfect

295
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,550
Yeah the design is kind of..

296
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,760
You look like some kind of charismatic artist from England

297
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,460
Do I look like I nag about complicated things?

298
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,460
Exactly, Exactly

299
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm glad I tried these out

300
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,340
That's good that's good..

301
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:57,380
Interesting. Maybe when the waves are more violent they are most effective..

302
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,380
Yeah, maybe you're right

303
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,350
It would be cool if Matsumoto Ke could go abroad somewhere though right?

304
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,850
We've been saying that for a while now though..

305
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,120
Like get everyone's schedule for New Years and plan something together.

306
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,120
Yeah for sure!

307
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,820
Like?

308
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,690
Like where?

309
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,690
Yeah...

310
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,230
I wanna go to Hollywood!

311
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,470
Ugh.. That's just, well..

312
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,470
I don't think we can earn enough for a hollywood trip from horse racing

313
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,340
No? Too expensive huh...

314
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,810
You know...

315
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,210
We should just do like a before and after

316
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,950
Like if it's really warm and we go adrift

317
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,920
And how we fall into the ocean..

318
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,720
And then how we get washed in. Like a before and after!

319
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,130
Then we should just show that all of the members

320
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,330
have acquired special abilities

321
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,570
And when we leap like this we can go wherever we want..

322
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,670
This place looks like something that would achieve that too right?

323
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,040
Then we'd be able to go anywhere we want

324
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,040
Yeah, that'd be good

325
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,380
So let's just make an episode about us obtaining special powers

326
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,250
Getting struck by lightning...

327
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,250
Yeah, like an incident that triggers that

328
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,590
I guess lightning would be the most probable

329
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,590
Lightning…

330
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,520
Ya know, they have those electric...

331
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,330
The really strong electric device… Whatcha think?

332
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,530
We're all doing it right?

333
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,530
No, just you

334
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,430
No, no, no I...

335
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,470
You can just get the powers and if we hold you directly

336
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,010
Then we can go anywhere!

337
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,010
Yeah exactly hahah!

338
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,010
What the hell

339
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,480
You wanna try?

340
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,210
What do you mean "You wanna try?"

341
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,010
This won't give me anything!

342
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,380
Why is it with that?

343
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,620
You do that long enough and get special abilities

344
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,620
That's the scene we're going for

345
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,520
This is just a rehearsal

346
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,520
I think that'll be really good

347
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,720
We'll shoot it again for real but right now...

348
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,990
We need to rehearse it a few times

349
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,400
Kenji Obtains Special Powers

350
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,400
Rehearsal:

351
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,400
m -13 37 l 2 37 l 3 18 l 2 -4 l -2 -23 l -68 -25 l -86 -25 l -86 39 l -86 37 l -33 37

352
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,400
with Electrocution!

353
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,400
If I can get special powers with something like this, I'll be a super star

354
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,470
How many times have we been doing this?

355
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,470
Ready, action!

356
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,340
Alright let's go! 2018's first electrocution!

357
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,650
Dude you can't drop it

358
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,650
You have to hold it

359
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,720
"You have to hold it" you say....

360
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Also,

361
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,660
The windows are starting to fog up

362
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,700
We can't see the view!

363
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,440
Now, even during these past 30 minutes, the crab is getting

364
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,810
more and more delicious

365
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,010
The crab is getting drunk

366
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,650
Meanwhile in Ieshima...

367
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,510
The crab is starting to show signs of the sake...

368
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,820
It's just barely starting to get drunk

369
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,760
Do you guys know why they choose to use sake?

370
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,630
Why do you think?

371
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,630
Why?

372
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,260
To drunken… Why they get the crab drunk

373
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,630
Eh, why?

374
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,870
Why do they soak it in sake?

375
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,180
I just thought the components of the sake brings out the flavor of the crab

376
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,550
That was my thinking

377
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,550
Apparently, crabs...

378
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,380
can cut off their own arms when they feel like they're under attack.

379
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,220
They just cut them off themselves

380
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,220
In case of an emergency?

381
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,290
If that happens, the flavor of the crab

382
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,330
will start to escape right? if we just cook them normally.

383
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,330
So to prevent that, they soak the crab in sake

384
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,130
To kind of blur their instinct to protect themselves..

385
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,800
To distract them…

386
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,800
So they won't be scared

387
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,410
Yes, exactly. Then, so that they don't get alert

388
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:51,710
they grill them on very low heat so they don't notice

389
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:56,320
The crab doesn't even know

390
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,320
when it dies

391
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,520
I guess in some way

392
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,690
They have animal cruelty in their minds when they cook them

393
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:04,690
In a respectful... so they don't get scared

394
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,690
It would seem so, yes

395
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,730
Making sure their last moments aren't stressful

396
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,560
Although I bet they were scared to death when they first got caught

397
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,200
Either way

398
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,400
Yeah I'm sure they were a little panicked

399
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,500
when they were first soaked in sake

400
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,500
Yeah, I bet they were super scared

401
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,740
What? What? What is this? What?

402
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,940
Ah! Bitter! It's bitter!

403
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,940
It tingles! It tingles!!

404
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,680
Oh! We're arriving!

405
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,050
We're here

406
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,050
Ahhh so cool, is it this?

407
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,650
This is Ieshima

408
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,650
It's pretty big!

409
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,860
The island floating in the Seto Inland Sea: Ieshima

410
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,860
Population of about 3000 people

411
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,970
Number of tourists have also increased in recent years!

412
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:47,970
Boasting fresh fish!

413
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,500
Thank you so much

414
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,110
Eh? There's a bunch of people!

415
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,510
What the heck is this

416
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,380
It looks like all of Ieshima is here

417
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,380
What a crazy scene

418
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,280
What should we do?

419
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,290
I kind of want to see the map so let's go look at one!

420
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,520
Let's go look at the map

421
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,690
This you see, is Ieshima

422
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,660
Right now, we're in Maura Ko

423
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,660
Right there

424
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,170
And then came in here

425
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,200
And the place we're going to go now

426
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,040
is Shimizu no Hama

427
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,040
That's a pretty long way to go

428
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,670
Yes, that's right

429
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,890
Is it walking distance?

430
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,890
About 20~30 minutes on foot

431
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,560
That'll take us a while huh

432
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,560
Takes us a while...

433
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,760
It'll take us a long time. You don't really want to walk

434
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,060
all the way over there right?

435
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,060
Eh, what do you mean?

436
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,500
We have no choice but to walk

437
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,500
Do they have something like this?

438
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,470
What is this?

439
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,470
This is nice

440
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,170
Max 4 people!

441
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,170
We can go on it

442
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,940
There's a 200kg weight limit on this one, we can't take it

443
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,510
"Weight limit 200kg"

444
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,510
Sadako 90kg

445
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,580
I'm 90kg!

446
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,580
Then 180kg together...

447
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,580
Man...

448
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,580
These jerks…

449
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,850
What the hell is that

450
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,850
That's so irritating

451
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,520
Go lose some weight!

452
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,890
We don't have enough to rent 2 huh?

453
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,760
Then why don't we just go into this town a little

454
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,800
and find someone that can take us to Shimizu by car

455
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,430
What?

456
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,430
Wanna do that?

457
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,500
But there's 4 of us is that okay?

458
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,500
We won't fit

459
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,970
It should be fine. People on these islands usually have big cars

460
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,650
For someone

461
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,650
Let's go searching

462
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,650
in the port area!

463
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,650
m -10 -6 m -11 -6 l 17 -6 l 17 10 l -11 10

464
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,650
we can catch a ride with

465
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,810
So let's look around the town first then we can find someone

466
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,910
Sure!

467
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,910
Let's go let's go

468
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,550
This is such a big welcome

469
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,720
It's pretty small island-like

470
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,720
Yeah yeah

471
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,590
See look at this helmet! The way you can just leave it here

472
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,690
No one even thinks about taking it

473
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,690
They won't steal it

474
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,700
This is like... really nice

475
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,570
Nice isn't it?

476
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,570
I can't explain. This feeling

477
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,770
Isn't this so nice? Just this atmosphere

478
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,270
It's great

479
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,340
So nice

480
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,480
This vending machine is something else too

481
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,480
How nostalgic

482
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,680
Can you still buy stuff from it?

483
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,680
It's so thin!

484
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,350
It's leaning on its side!

485
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,850
Since we have the money, let's give it a try

486
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,390
Let's try and buy!

487
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,760
It's not going to come out! It's a waste of money!

488
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,360
Wait... is it even plugged in?

489
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,990
No! Don't dont!

490
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,000
It's not plugged in!

491
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,000
But he have so much money!

492
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,070
NO! I'm telling you, it's not plugged in!

493
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,070
I just told you it's not plugged in. Why the hell are you still putting in money?

494
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,570
Dude, the thing is not plugged in!

495
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,170
Guess It doesn't work...

496
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,170
It didn't work...

497
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,810
I just told you its not plugged in! Ya guys idiots?

498
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,120
Well, I guess we should just leave it here then...

499
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,120
Why the hell!

500
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,520
My.... my hard earned money...

501
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,320
Are you guys stupid? I've had enough

502
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,660
What should we do? Who will give us a ride?

503
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,860
This is so nice

504
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,430
I really like places like this

505
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,400
Very nice

506
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,370
I like it I like it. It's nice

507
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,240
There's a lot of children

508
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,780
Let's see if this one works, the money...

509
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,550
Let's give it a try

510
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,550
It says out of order!!

511
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,280
Let's test if it's really out of order. We don't know for sure

512
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,980
Can you not read? Out of order!

513
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,320
Like 10,000 Yen would fit in there stupid!

514
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,320
10,000 Yen wouldn't fit anyway...

515
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,660
This is my money!

516
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,660
This whole thing

517
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,730
scared off the kids and they all went somewhere

518
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,470
A bunch of geezers fighting or something

519
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,340
Oh, excuse us

520
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,340
Hello there

521
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,400
Haha, What do you mean "hello there"

522
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,400
Oh! They're drying octopus!

523
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,940
Woah! What the heck

524
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,940
There's so many

525
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,240
Eh what? That's crazy

526
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,240
There's fish too!

527
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,180
They have a bunch of dried octopus and next to it, it says "MACKEREL"

528
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,820
Mackerel is over there

529
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,820
The mackerel is over there right?

530
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,720
How.. what is this?

531
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,720
This is octopus that's been washed and boiled

532
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,290
Eh? Just boiled?

533
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,820
So you boil it, and wash it and…

534
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,820
No, not dried, you eat it just like that

535
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,130
Oh you're not drying these?

536
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,130
Then why…

537
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,100
They're just being cooled down here

538
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,100
Oh to cool it down?

539
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,760
Oh is that so?

540
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,760
Like this

541
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,670
Wow, this is from Ieshima?

542
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,070
Mom!

543
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,670
Ieshima, yes

544
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,370
Wanna eat?

545
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,970
Are you sure?

546
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,770
The daughter was like "mom," and handed her a knife

547
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,410
so I thought she meant "finish them"

548
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,710
What kind of place is this

549
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,710
Ehhh!?

550
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,280
Did you want to eat it here?

551
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,280
You don't mind?

552
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,220
I love octopus so much

553
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,860
Slicing them like this is the best

554
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,190
Ehh? You guys don't sell them like this do you?

555
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,160
It's sold in wholes right?

556
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,160
No, we sell them by slices too

557
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,530
Can I try this right here?

558
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,530
Yes, please go ahead

559
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,600
Just like this?

560
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,870
Delicious innit?

561
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,000
IT'S SO GOOD!

562
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,470
SO GOOD!

563
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,540
What is this seasoning?

564
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,540
Huh? I mean all I did was

565
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,440
add just a little bit of salt, that's it.

566
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,440
It doesn't even need soy sauce or wasabi

567
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,280
Right?

568
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,480
This octopus is the best!

569
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,780
The meat closer to the end tastes the best

570
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,590
And this is of course all caught here right?

571
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,590
Yes indeed

572
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,420
That was so good

573
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,420
I'll uh...

574
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,560
I'll be taking this... thnk you sho much!

575
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,770
Woahh this is a good picture

576
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,400
Sorry to bother you, thank you so much

577
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,400
Sorry to bother!

578
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,640
We really appreciate it, thank you

579
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,640
This really makes you feel like you're in Ieshima

580
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,740
That was a nice scene. I was pretty surprised though

581
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,440
That was unexpected huh

582
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,440
It was so good

583
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,810
They don't even have soy sauce and wasabi. Eh? What's this?

584
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,380
Huh? Is this a gasoline stand?

585
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,050
Huh?

586
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,650
This... you get gas from this?

587
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,650
Like all the motorcycles..

588
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,690
Well I mean not everyone but...some do, I suppose

589
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,090
Really? What about the money?

590
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,430
I don't drive so I can't really be too sure...

591
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,370
But I've seen some people use it before

592
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,100
Are you sure?

593
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,100
You call the…

594
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,770
You tell the person up front?

595
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,770
I think so

596
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,170
Like the air for the bike tires from back in the day

597
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,980
Something like that right?

598
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,980
It would seem so

599
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,680
I think so, yeah

600
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,710
Hmm.. that's pretty interesting

601
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,950
They're selling an Alphard (Toyota) for 1,000,000 Yen*

602
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:17,390
*Roughly 7000£ or 9000$

603
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,790
Should we... buy someone some gas?

604
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,390
Good idea!

605
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,790
That guy over there

606
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,790
D'ya need any gas?

607
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,700
Are you really going

608
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,700
to buy me some?

609
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,100
Matsumoto

610
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,100
My name is also

611
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,660
We are the most inconvenienced ones aren't we?

612
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,560
Are you low on fuel?

613
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,500
We don't know how to use it so we'd like to know!

614
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,840
How do we pay?

615
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,840
Have you done it before?

616
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:42,810
Hello, we would like to put in some gas

617
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,650
How much would gas you would be needing?

618
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,650
How do you pump it?

619
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,020
He's just about to run out!

620
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,590
He was just barely makin' it!

621
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,790
Put the gas in!

622
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,790
It's fine! It's just some gas!

623
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,930
It moves? Huh!?

624
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,930
Fascinating!

625
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,900
Oh it's at zero now!

626
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,470
We're so lucky!

627
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,270
He's pumping it while turning it!

628
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,280
You can't find this anywhere else?

629
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
No, no no!

630
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,610
There's nothing like it!

631
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,250
We just put in 4.7 liters

632
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,020
And how is the math done?

633
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,020
The total is done here…

634
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,290
It says right there

635
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,690

He kind of looks like my ex comedy partner

653
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,980
There's a car! Someone's in there

654
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,310
Excuse me? Sorry to bother... Good evening

655
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,650
Maybe he's in the middle of working?

656
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,090
May I ask you what you're doing?

657
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,790
After a jog

658
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,790
Heading home

659
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,890
Oh is that so? Can we hitch a ride?

660

Do you think we can?

661
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,200
May I ask you what you're doing?

662
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
I'm heading home after a jog

663
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,700
Oh is that so? Can we hitch a ride?

664
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,760
Can we?

665
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,700

671
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,050
It doesn't seem like all 4 of us can go...

672
