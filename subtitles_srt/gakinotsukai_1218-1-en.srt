Vice Principal!

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:10,590
Yes!

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,890
They're still not here?

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,230
Principal

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,230

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,230
Vice Principal

10
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,830
I thought they would be here by now

11
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,760
Is that so?

12
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,460
Good morning!

13
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,740
Good morning!

14
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,880
Broadcasted the other day "Hot Blooded!! Hamada's Training School"

15
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,720
Principal Hamada's teachings with an overflowing emotions of love got a huge reaction!

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,150
And so for today as well!!

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,750
We're ready!

18
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,090
Good morning!

19
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,030
Good morning!!

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,560
There's different members today!

21
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,960
There was a bit of minor changes

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,930
Ah, I see...

23
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,470
In regards to the Principal

24
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,840
We've gathered only people who hold the highest respect for him!

25
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,610
If you guy's aren't doing this with a sense of death then you will die!

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,810
Exactly!

27
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,940
Look alive today!

28
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,380
Yes!

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,050
Please act like your alive today!

30
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,050
Yes!

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,420
Don't die!

32
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,420
Yes!

33
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,850
Even if something happens

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,850
In order to not reveal it

35
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,090
You all signed the wavers right!?

36
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,590
Without looking at the document you signed it!!

37
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,630
By the way Fujiwara

38
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,970
Did you watch the last episode?

39
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,730
I got a DVD of the last one

40
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,970
I would have been happier if I didn't see it

41
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,970
What do you mean by that?

42
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,710
All that Terror....

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,810
Not with terror....

44
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,110
There's nothing to be afraid about!

45
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,850
It was really scary...

46
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,480
It was an extremely heart-warming episode!

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,190
The DVD doesn't show it that well

48
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,420
According to one theory It's being washed away by Kabukicho

49
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,420
Kabukicho is a red-light district in Shinjuku

50
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,630
HOT BLOODED!!

51
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,630
HAMADA'S TRAINING SCHOOL!!

52
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,470
Shall we get started everyone!

53
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,930
Yes!

54
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,800
Alright Vice Principal Matsumoto!

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,170
What are we doing?

56
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:05,600
First up!

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,440
PRINCIPAL RUGBY!!

58
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,010
To explain Princiapl Rugby...

59
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,250
We'll be using this Principal ball

60
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,880
What are you laughing about?

61
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,850
The principal...

62
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,450
Sorry!

63
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,120
With the Principal ball

64
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,420
What are you laughing at!?

65
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,090
Because it's the principal!

66
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,360
You must tenderly and daringly win with it!

67
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,400
In order to not forget about your love for the principal!

68
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:39,400
The trial of passing the principal rugy ball between the 8 of them tenderly starts!

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,640
Is there anyone experienced in playing rugby?

70
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,710
Yes, I am!

71
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,540
Let's start!

72
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,980
This is good huh?

73
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,660
They're really not looking at the principals face huh

74
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,700
Go for a try!

75
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,430
Alright, Line up!

76
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,300
I said it was rugby!

77
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,810
That wasn't bold at all!

78
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,780
It's no good if you don't look at my face when you throw it!

79
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,850
Haranishi you didn't do rugby did you!?

80
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:21,850
Yes I did!

81
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,350
Is that so?

82
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,050
I want bigger throws!

83
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,320
Did it startle you too much?

84
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,140
You let go of the principal!

85
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,180
You can't let go of the principal in the last minute!

86
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,210
Here you go principal!

87
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,350
It's burning!

88
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,920
This won't give burns

89
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,730
Let's move on to the next one

90
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,600
HOT!

91
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,470
Shall we do another round of rugby?

92
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,600
It came out principal!

93
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,170
Hot water leaked out!

94
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,940
HOT BLOODED!!

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,940
HAMADA'S TRAINING SCHOOL!!

96
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,080
When your throwing me make sure your looking at me

97
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,050
Don't you think you should kiss when you throw him?

98
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,460
Wanna try kissing it?

99
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,290
How do I put it...

100
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,490
Your not really conveying your emotions of love

101
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,030
Kiss it then throw it from now on

102
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,130
READY!?

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,200
That's good!

104
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,470
He's looking strong!

105
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,370
You like the principal right!?

106
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,640
Good! Give him a kiss!

107
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,880
Good! You like the principal!

108
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,420
You understand the principals love right?

109
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,390
Alright!

110
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,990
That's no good!

111
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,320
Right there!

112
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,190
Yes like a gun!

113
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
It really hurts when you fire it right at me!

114
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,440
That was no good huh!

115
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,340
If just two of them do it it'll be easy to understand for everyone

116
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,680
You've got that right

117
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,450
Alright go FUJIWARA!

118
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,420
You want us to still kiss him right?

119
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,620
Do it with a better tempo this time!

120
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,030
Do it with the feeling of "This is our Youth!"

121
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,560
You can have an accident later!!

122
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,040
Alright Lets do this!

123
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,290
This is no good!

124
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,590
There's a drop kick rule in rugby!

125
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,700
Sit down

126
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Put down your head!

127
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,310
Getting hit directly...

128

Next up

136
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,200
We're gonna be going with your body!!

137
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,700
Body?

138
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,070
"Beach Scuba" body movements

139
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,510
Body movements?

140
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,340
You all enjoy scuba diving right?

141
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,650
On this beach, your going to use your body and go scuba diving

142
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,820
Until the principal accepts it your all gonna have fun scuba diving!

143
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
With your body

144
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,170
This is pretty bad huh

145
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,170
You got that right

146
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,740
Someones making a profit off this

147
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,950
For whatever reason I thought this was good in the beginning

148
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
They're all taking pictures together

149
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
They're all gathering like theres bait

150
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,490
It's by no means done yet huh

151
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,970
I still don't get it

152
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,240
I don't get it

153
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,350
Where are you going!!

154
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,320
Where are you going!?

155
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,950
Where are you going!?

156
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,420
GET BACK HERE!!

157
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,260
What was that!?

158
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,960
That was all terrible!!

159
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,300
We intended to do this for 40 mins in the plan!

160
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,970
You guys definitely couldn't pull that off!!

161
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,840
Haranishi should do it solo

162
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,150
Do your solo Haranishi!

163
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,160
Man this pisses me off!

164
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,770
How is it?

165
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,900
Haranishi is pretty good huh?

166
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,670
That was good Haranishi!

167
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,780
Yamazaki!!

168
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,350
What was that just now?

169
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,800
Join him Iwao!!

170
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,640
Are they friends?

171
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,640
Acquaintances?

172
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,510
Haranishi!!

173
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,620
What the hell is that?

174
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,920
I really can't understand this one

175
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Who swims like that!?

176
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,420
He's a fish!

177
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
That's pretty interesting!

178
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,570
Tanaka!!

179
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,310
Find something original alright!

180
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,840
Believe it's your own world!!

181
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,980
I don't need Tanaka!

182
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,690
I don't need Yamazaki!

183
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,130
I don't need Iwao!

184
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,100
As I thought, This is what it comes down to

185
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,510
He's not a scuba diver!

186
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,510
But a fish!

187
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,750
He's in a fish tank!

188
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,050
I'll get the tea

189
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,460
Barley Tea!!

190
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,460
Haranishi

191
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,460
Thank you!

192
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,690
That was really good!

193
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,200
If you work this hard

194
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,200
you can drink Barley Tea as well!!

195
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,170
If you work this hard you can drink Barley Tea too!!

196
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,400
Yes!

197
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,940
HOT BLOODED!!

198
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,940
HAMADA'S TRAINING SCHOOL!!

199
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,340
What now Vice-principal?

200
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,340
For the next one we'll be using this drum can!

201
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,080
From now on the principal will be in this drum can!

202
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,050
With these corn dog sticks

203
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,020
Your going to stab your favourite spot

204
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:58,530
If you happen to stab the principal in the can you'll be punished!!

205
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,030
If you get it then be careful alright?

206
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,040
As planned, The Principal is going to standby in the drum can!

207
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,170
Just what on earth is going to happen!?

208
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,310
Good luck Principal!

209
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,910
So, We'll go in order!!

210
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,920
Everyone take one alright!

211
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,520
The Principal is looking!

212
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
He's not looking! Hurry up and do it!

213
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Hurry up and get with it!

214
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,860
This is bad!

215
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,830
Going from the front is really bad!

216
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,830
I guess that might be true!

217
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,730
Fujimon get's it!

218
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,740
I'm safe!

219
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,850
This is what will happen to you if you manage to stab the principal!

220
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,460
Try stabbing me

221
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,730
Stabbing you?

222
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,900
Someone holding one try stabbing me!

223
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,230
It's fine just try stabbing me

224
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,400
Nothing will happen just try stabbing me!

225
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Just try stabbing me

226
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,740
This is just my hunch from being with him for such a long time but

227
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,510
The principal is a pretty rotten guy!

228
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,350
He's a pretty rotten guy!

229
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,350
Only an idiot!

230
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,920
This is pretty unexpected so you'll sure to be fine!

231
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,070
Principal!

232
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,940
Shall we try this one once more?

233
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,010
Once more?

234
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,880
Your starting to look like The Phantom of the Opera!

235
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,890
HOT BLOODED!!

236
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,890
HAMADA'S TRAINING SCHOOL!!

237
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,320
Should we try putting someone in there?

238
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,120
What if you all

239
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,190
Tried getting in there!

240
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,190
All of you get in!

241
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,300
The principal will stab you!

242
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,300
That's a good idea!!

243
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Isn't that really dangerous!?

244
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,500
Let's not do it!

245
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,440
Just wait a second!

246
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,410
Let's just try getting in there for once

247
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,910
All we want to do is try it once for now

248
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,910
Inaba try getting in there

249
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,180
Eh?

250
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,520
First try getting in there

251
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,520
That's....

252
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Hurry up... It's gonna get dark

253
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,760
Good Luck Inaba!

254
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,090
Let's try to keep this up

255
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,800
Fujimon you get in as well!

256
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,470
Scary isn't it!

257
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,810
Vice-Principal we can probably fit more in

258
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,810
Seems like we still can

259
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,810
Fujihara get in

260
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,910
Cmon get in

261
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,020
Yamazaki!

262
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,560
Why!?

263
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,990
It's so scary!

264
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,690
You've got enough room for this right?

265
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,230
Like you can run around inside

266
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,330
No... We can't run away!

267
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,660
This is seriously dangerous!

268
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,570
What is this? Hot water?

269
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,570
No way!

270
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,410
I haven't stabbed you yet!

271
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,410
Oh, You can use this

272
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,780
HOT!

273
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,550
STOP! STOP!!!

274
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,820
OVERCOME THE SUMMER!

275
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,530
STOP!!!

276
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,830
Have you overcome the summer?

277
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,130
YES!

278
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,070
Can you overcome it!?

279
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,470
YES!

280
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,670
DO YOU WANNA BE THE PRINCIPAL!?

281
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,470
YES!

282
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,900
YOU WANNA BE THE PRINCIPAL RIGHT!?

283
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,410
YES!

284
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,570
Alright... Be the Principal!

285
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,310
HOT BLOODED!!

286
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,310
HAMADA'S TRAINING SCHOOL!!

287
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,280
So what's next Vice-Principal!

288
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,080
Next is....

289
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,750
Well, You're gonna keep moving without stopping

290
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,660
It's the Principal's favourite

291
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,600
The principals favourite "Don't Stop! Don't Stop!"

292
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,530
In other words the episode where they had to keep moving without stopping

293
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,970
Will be happening in this episode!

294
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,970
What's wrong?

295
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,740
What's wrong with these 3?

296
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,910
Well for this one...

297
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,910
We have experienced this before...

298
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,080
Honestly...

299
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,080
I've seen hell

300
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,550
That was in a studio

301
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:23,020
This time we're going to try doing it under a clear sky

302
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,320
We're gonna be doing it in the sand as well

303
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,130
Your going to appeal to yourselves

304
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,800
You'll be useful after you go out to society

305
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Let's go from Endo!!

306
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,140
Just by myself?

307
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,640
Until the Principal's plan says so

308
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,710
If the plan is to do it endlessly then your going to do it endlessly

309
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,710
Alright, Let's do it!

310
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,750
Make sure your all watching!

311
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,930
In order to not make it the same thing over and over

312
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,230
Make sure to throw in some difference

313
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,130
That's good!

314
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,070
You don't wanna bear your past!

315
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,470
Go find something new in the sand!

316
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,170
I feel like you shouldn't be standing in the same spot

317
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,510
A battle with your past!

318
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,510
Your bearing your past!

319
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,450
Find a new Endo!

320
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,450
Try and find a new Endo!

321
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,080
There's still much more to come!

322
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,260
This isn't the withdrawal of Endo after all!

323
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,800
He's running away!

324
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,910
He's like an infinite battery

325
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,840
Show us a new Endo!

326
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,120
Endo Complete!

327
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,720
Yamazaki!

328
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,330
Here Endo!

329
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,860
Drink some barley tea!

330
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:19,870
Last time Yamazaki took the most damage after it all

331
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,870
While we're looking at Yamazaki

332
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,040
Continue with him Tanaka!

333
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,120
They're doing the same movements

334
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,520
Your being pulled a bit!

335
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,220
So that you both aren't pulled by each other

336
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,960
Keep it up Fujimon!!

337
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,490
Yes!

338
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,600
Ah! That's good!

339
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,170
Something new!

340
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,970
Yamazaki is already...

341
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,440
Yamachan can't move at all...

342
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,010
Haranishi!

343
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,590
Haranishi is already showing us his true worth!

344
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,230
Yamazaki Complete!

345
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,170
FUJIWARA is pretty good huh!

346
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,270
Haranishi's got quite a large vocabulary!

347
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,140
Iwao!

348
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,380
Iwao... Go find something new!

349
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,380
Iwao...

350
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,920
That's different for sure!

351
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,720
Tanaka Done!

352
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,090
Haranishi's vocabulary...

353
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,090
Inomoto!

354
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,430
Move! Move!

355
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,770
Please look at Haranishi's vocabulary!

356
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,630
It's everlasting!

357
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,600
His never ending vocabulary is crazy huh!

358
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,740
Fujimon is getting there but he can still move it

359
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Fujimon is moving a lot more than I thought isnt he?

360
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,350
Fujimon's been going for quite a while too!

361
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,780
Iwao is completely devoted to one side huh!

362
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,780
Fujimons good!

363
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,430
Fujimon's doing really well!

364
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,860
Look at Haranishi's sense of stability

365
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,500
Iwao Done!

366
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,470
He's started to use the sand!

367
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,320
Inamoto done!

368
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,160
Is he going to pull out some drastic moves from here on out?

369
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,470
Fujimon done!

370
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,470
Fujimon's world!

371
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,600
It's Fujimon's world!

372
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,680
A new world!

373
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,820
Fujimon done!

374
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,650
That was really something!

375
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,900
What's with you?

376
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,330
What's with you standing by yourself?

377
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,070
Because I didn't hear my name called
