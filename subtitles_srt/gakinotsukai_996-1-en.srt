<Rules>

11
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:17,260
As a group, the five must eat a boat of 8 takoyaki balls in each store

12
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,390
Rules are, the group must eat a boat of 8 takoyaki balls in each store

13
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,700
shared amongst the five members!

14
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:23,270
Anyone else can eat the remaining three!

15
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:23,270
Each member must eat one

16
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,560
Everyone must at least eat one in each boat

17
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,070
But the remaining three is for anyone!

18
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,810

20

But, if anyone retires

21
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,180

The retiree

26
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,950

After four locations have been finished, a suggestion from Matsumoto!

51
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,300
A good pace at the fourth location

52
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,340
Here, Matsumoto makes a suggestion

53
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,610
So

54
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,610
No one's

55
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,610
said they'll eat the remaining three, right?

56
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,580
Not yet, no.

57
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,120
With this, the final person is forced to eat the remaining three takoyakis

58
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,150

84
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,630
After a full rotation,

85
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,260
The group arrives at the 10th store!

86
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,000
So Tanaka's

87
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,000
going to be eating four here

88
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,800
How about we stop for once?

89
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,840
How about we stop for once?

90
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,540
How about we stop for once?

91
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,540
The four-at-once rotation

92
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,540
Why?

93
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,370
Can we break this up?

94
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,980
I don't know what you're saying

95
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,280
Well...

96
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,150
Eh?

97
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,150
Give it our all, with everyone

98
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,280
Going back to the first plan

99
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,720
Yes Yes

100
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,350
So everyone eats one each

101
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,590
Yeah, everyone eats at least one

102
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,120
then the remaining three we can discuss

103
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,120
so then...

104
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,790
I think going back to our starting point...

105
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,790
Let's just try going back

106
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,730
Things were more frank back then

107
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,630
Things were more frank back then

108
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,660
Yes they were!

109
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,670
Everyone was saying "Then I'll go!"

110
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,760
Absolutely

111
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,670
You're right

112
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,640
At this point

113
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,640
Would anyone still say "Then I'll go"?

114
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,100
No one would

115
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,370
No, right?

116
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,200
So in the end we have to choose someone to eat 4

117
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,340
So in the end we have to choose someone to eat 4

118
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,280
It's all about who's eating one and who's digesting the four

119
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Then let's complete a full rotation!

120
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,880
Yes we should

121
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,010
We should!

122
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,780
Are you sure!?

123
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,780
We should!

124
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,290
But Tanaka has the biggest bod (body) here

125
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,790
But Tanaka has the biggest bod (body) here

126
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,320
Basically speaking

127
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,320
We have to acknowledge that

128
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,460
I was worried about bringing it up

129
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,460
Me, too

130
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,360
His bod (body) is the biggest

131
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,860
His bod (body) is the biggest

132
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,630
You're the closest thing to a giant here

133
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,370
Even off of looks you can tell

134
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,070
So why are we lumped up together with him

135
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,840
So why are we lumped up together with him

136
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,840
Exactly

137
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,870
Let's go!

138
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,700
We have arrived!

139
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,740
Let's go!

140
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,740
We have to be careful

141
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,150
No one's gonna eat if we don't keep things the way they were

142
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,450
We're gonna start owing each other if we don't stick with the plan

143
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,120
Store No. 10 Kanamachi Station Front

144
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,090
Now at their tenth store, Kanamachi Station Front location

145
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,820
Gindako Menu

146
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,190

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,500
The Filling

152
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,500

153
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,500
Teritama 1 Boat 600 Yen

154
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,530
A filling alternative, Teritama

The Refresher

163
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,940
Which one of the four will the men be choosing from?

164
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,840
Can their "Manliness"  be shown through their choices?

165
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,840
Will this choice reveal their "manliness"?

166
00:03:17,840 --> 00:04:48,630
Store No. 10 Kanamachi Station Front

167
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,410
Which one are you gonna go for?

168
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,180
Which flavor?

169
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,650
One Negidako, please

170
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:30,560
Negidako

173
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,820
One Negidako, please

174
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,390
I don't care

175
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,190
So weak

176
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,560
No matter what you say, I don't care

177
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,730
Here you are

178
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,730
Oh, it's already done

179
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,630
That's suspicious

180
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,030
So everyone eat one each first

181
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,770
I'm just gonna check, there's gonna be four left right?

182
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,300
These onions

183
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,070
This should be a group decision

184
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,370
Maybe I might enjoy this

185
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,810
No, it's delicious

186
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,710
The onions

187
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,710
Delicious, right?

188
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,680
This is good, we're moving forward

189
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,680
How is it?

190
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,750
And then we pour the sauces...

191
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,820
We should go about this quickly like we discussed earlier

192
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,820
It's delicious

193
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,390
Let's go

194
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,220
Negidako's the way to go

195
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,860
Are you good?

196
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,860
Yes

197
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,170
Tanaka can we wait in the car?

198
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,240
Wait, wait

199
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,200
Then we'll stand here

200
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,040
Of course

201
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,710
We won't even look away

202
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,750
A little encouragement

203
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,550
Would be nice

204
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,550
Right

205
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,050
You would go at the same pace whether we do or not

206
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,050
No, no

207
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,790
I will go faster

208
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,490
This is everyone's efforts

209
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,420
Right right

210
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,430
You have to put on the sauce quickly

211
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,030
Alright!

212
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,160
Okay!

213
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,160
Tanaka finishes!

214
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,630
Complete

215
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,030
Great job

216
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,300
On to the next one!

217
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,840
Alucard Kameari

Store No. 10

220
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,840
Store No. 11

221
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,210
We've finished up ten stores

222
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,740
And here are the standings

223
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,280
I've eaten 18

224
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,550
Yes

225
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,580
I have eaten 18

226
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,450
So now it's up to Shozo

227
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,790
I'm up next

228
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,490
You can do it

229
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,360
You'll have 20 by the next one

230
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,790
Hitting the 20 mark

231
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,360
Amazing

232
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,130
This one's no good

233
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,630
What do you mean?

234
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,360
This feature's really...

235
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,200
This feature's really...

236
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,400
It feels like this every time

237
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,400
Every time

238
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,440
Everyone's going to get so fat

239
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,180
If we keep doing these things

240
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,180
We actually will get fat probably

241
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,720
"I watched Gaki no Tsukai for the first time in a while. What happened?"

242
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,380
Everybody got so fat

243
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,990
Everybody got so fat

244
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,120
What happened to them?

245
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,120
What did happen?

246
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,930
We keep doing these challenges

247
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,930
So true

248
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,090
That's Ryo-san

249
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,460
Oh it is Ryo-san!

250
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,130

251
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,130
Statue of "Ryotsu Kankichi"

252
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,530
The group passes by the character stature of "Ryo-san" from the manga "Kochi Kame"

253
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,430
At the Kameari station front

254
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,540
Cool!

255
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,540
Whoa

256
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,570
That's impressive

257
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,040
If everyone could follow me

258
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:07,050
Store No. 11 Alucard Kameari

259
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,610
At the 11th stop, what will Endo order?

260
00:06:07,050 --> 00:07:22,050
Store No. 11 Alucard Kameari

261
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,850
Negi-dako, please

262
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:22,330
Negi-Dako

263
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:22,330
Rectangle

264
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:22,330
The Refresher

265
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,380
Yes

266
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,880
One Negidako!

267
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,390
Endo!

268
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,220
Just this once, please

269
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,190
We're back to eating Negidako again!?

270
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,330
I haven't been able to order negidako yet

271
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,590
By myself

272
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,170
Alright just sit here

273
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,570
let's get this over with

274
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,100
Let's eat!

275
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,040
Go ahead

276
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,040
Might as well

277
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,010
Negidako again

278
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,910
Just make it quick

279
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,580
Wow

280
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,550
Would you like any seconds?

281
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,010
We're good, thanks

282
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,350
Don't forget the green onions too

283
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,350
We got more green onions than usual

284
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,390
You could probably finish that

285
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,890
You got it

286
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,290
Let's go Endo

287
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,290
Nice

288
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,100
You can probably go on, can't you?

289
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,100
To the next store

290
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,770
What?

291
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,100
I don't think even he'll be able to do that

292
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,140
That would be difficult

293
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,810
He can't help

294
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,810
But look like Mori Shinichi

295
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,510
And the 20th one is..

296
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,680
Is finished!

297
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Good!

298
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,980
Alright!

299
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:22,050
Complete

300
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,850
Because it's just that good!

301
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,550
Of course!

302
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,520
You can't start disliking it here!

303
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,060
Next the group is moving to Nishiarai Store

304
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,630
According to the order we have in our current plan, Matsumoto-san is next

305
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,890
According to the order we have in our current plan, Matsumoto-san is next

306
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,300
According to the order we have in our current plan, Matsumoto-san is next

307
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,960
Me already!?

308
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,260
Yes

309
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,100
That is absolutely right

310
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,800
I'm sure he already knows what to order

311
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,870
Oh, really?

312
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,670
Are we sure that we want to keep going with this plan?

313
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,370
Are we sure that we want to keep going with this plan?

314
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,510
Yes

315
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,510
Yes please

316
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,280
I agree let's keep going

317
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,280
I kinda understand, though

318
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,380
Let's keep it

319
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,450
At this rate...

320
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,820
Tanaka and I already went so

321
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,680
We've already started the plan

322
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,180
But we could

323
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,220
if Tanaka, Endo, Matsumoto-san, me and Hamada-san went in that order

324
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,620
Nothing would change!

325
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,730
Yes and that's fine

326
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,730
We are a group after all

327
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,660
There's no visual appeal

328
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,660
There's no change in scenery

329
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,660
What do you mean "no visual appeal"?

330
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
The people watching

331
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,400
would be like "Eh!?"

332
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,630
"Tanaka's going next now!?"

333
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,100
For the people watching

334
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,700
Right

335
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,270
No No No

336
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,340
We don't have any elements of surprise

337
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,740
Right?

338
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,080
"Gaki" was able

339
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,080
to get this far because of stuff like that

340
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,080
That's true

341
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,250
Also through turning on each other

342
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,050
That's the two mains talking

343
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,220
But we should also...

344
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,490
How about we do rock paper scissors?

345
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,490
Eh!?

346
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,150
Your eyes keep getting bigger today

347
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,420
Your eyes keep getting bigger today

348
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,220
Your eyes keep getting bigger today

349
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,990
It's scary

350
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,390
It's for good reason!

351
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,360
Alright! We'll do the four!

352
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,800
Thank you

353
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,800
Are you sure!?

354
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,300
I...

355
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,500
Why are you farting in here?

356
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,270
Why do you have to fart in such a tight space like this

357
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,270
When we first started

358
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,500
this plan

359
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,040
maybe we should reconsider

360
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,240
when the three of us are left to do it

361
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,980
We can't do that for sure

362
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,440
We all have different states of hunger!

363
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,450
We all have different states of hunger!

364
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,650
Because some of us started eating earlier than others

365
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,020
The "states of hunger"?

366
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,950
WHO'S EVEN HUNGRY?

367
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,430

369
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,130
Those takoyakis are starting to hit me

370
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,670
But wait...

371
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,870
What are you thinking of ordering?

372
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,570
That's important

373
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,570
True

374
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,570
We've talked about this a lot

375
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,540
I've been thinking a lot about the Cheese and Roe

376
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:44,500
Cheese with Roe

377
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:44,500
Reectangles

378
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:44,500
The Pack-a-Punch

379
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,380
Teriyaki?

380
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,310
I thought about getting Teriyaki too, but

381
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:44,500
Rectangle2

382
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:44,500

384
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,750
That person

385
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,750
just bought it so

386
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,420
What?

387
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,920
That's unrelated!

388
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,920
So I was considering that

389
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,020
That just hit me

390
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,630
"I can't get that now since they bought it already"

391
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
What're you saying?

392
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,630
Thinking about the four

393
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,500
going inside me

394
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,630
Are you stupid?

395
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,530
Alright, please

396
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,200
Yes!

397
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,370
Takoyaki it is!

398
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:58,310
Rectangle

399
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:58,310
Takoyaki

400
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:58,310
The Standard

401
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,540
What the hell!

402
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,310
Let's just go with something normal!

403
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,310
This is the second time in a row

404
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,310
That's right!

405
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,850
Let's eat!

406
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,410
Let's eat!

407
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,410
Ok, Itadakimasu!

408
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,850
Are you serious!?

409
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,450
These are really cooked!

410
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,290
So that's one

411
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,930
So he's doing four

412
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,660
Indeed

413
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,370
Yes, eating four at this point

414
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,370
That's gotta be rough

415
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,970
Oh, he's doing it!

416
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,140
Matsumoto-san's got it!

417
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,140
That's the pace, Matsumoto-san!

418
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,140
For real?!

419
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,880

Along with the takoyaki Matsumoto had

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,260
For real though, huh.

432
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,730
We are for real

433
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,170

434
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,170

They meet at a park

Yamasaki's stomach prepares to not fail them

445
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,850
Will they be able to clear it!?

446

Going for it now?!

He's an old pervert

507
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,760
At this point

508
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,680
Getting cheese and roe at this point,

509
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,820
such an old pervert move.

510

is coming out

513
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,890
It's hard to pick the right time, huh

514
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,760
Yea, it is hard

515
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,800
I thought it was pretty manly

516
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,630
I thought it was a good choice, but now I'm just an old perv

517

Hold on, hold on

519
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,110
Itadakimasu

520
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,480
Wow, you really are a man for picking this

521
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,620
This is somethin'

522
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,180
Stop messin' around

523
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,020
This really hits you

524
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,820
Ohh

525
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,960
Just one more

526
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,230
Only one left.

527
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,840
Complete

528
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,540
He's completed it.

529
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,970
Incredible!

530
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,970
He did it!

531
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,310
Complete!

532
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,840
That's the second round of 4 pieces-per-person complete

533
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,040
Alright everyone,

534
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,480
Juujou Ginza

535
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,480
Ooyama Happy Road

536
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,480
Store No. 14

537
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,480
Store No. 15

538
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,010
Let's head to the next location!

539
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,480
Let's count up the total

540
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,650
So we've gone to 14 stores so far,

541
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,720
and everyone's eaten either 22 or 23 takoyaki balls.

542
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,020
But since we've gone through everybody twice now,

543
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,790
what should we do about this system?

544
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,790
Do you wanna keep doing the same thing or change it up?

545
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,100
Since we just ate,

546
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,730
Starting with Tanaka, the whole boat 2 times in a row...

547
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,530
Starting with Tanaka, the whole boat 2 times in a row...

548
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,130
Starting with Tanaka, the whole boat 2 times in a row...

549
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,240
Starting with Tanaka, the whole boat 2 times in a row...

550
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,800
One person does 2 stores in a row...

551
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,800
A new plan?

552
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,710
I haven't heard the rest of the plan but

553
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,710
it sounds good to me

554
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,180
That's not right

555
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,480
No way, no way

556
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,040
You mean I have to eat 16 balls?

557
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
You mean I have to eat 16 balls?

558
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,580
16 balls at once?

559
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,850
If we go with what Hamada-san just suggested...

560
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,850
There's no way

561
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,680
Hold up,

562
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,220
You're supposed to say "Cocorico will eat as much as they can"

563
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,220
Again with this

564
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,300
Hey

565
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,300
We want to say that, but...

566
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,900
Say "Us two are gonna switch off

567
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,900
every time" right now!!

568
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,330
This again....

569
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,340
It always ends up like this

570
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,340
I was wondering when he was gonna say it

571
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,340
Seriously though

572
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,710
Tell them yourself, Matsumoto-san

573
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,710
You know,

574
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,950
If Shinsuke-Nii were here

575
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,950
he'd actually be pissed at you

576
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,550
I don't know about that,

577
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,090
Shinsuke-san would probably,

578
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,450
He would never

579
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,020
never do that

580
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,390
Alright, how 'bout from now on I eat two balls

581
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,530
Alright, how 'bout from now on I eat two balls

582
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,530
Really?

583
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,730
Seriously?

584
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,900
If you guys are gonna insist

585
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,600
Two balls.

586
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,540
Tanaka is tall so

587
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,540
he can eat three

588
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,670
You're tall so you eat 3

589
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,740
Does height really have anything to do with this?

590
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,180
Alright, then please split the other ones between you guys

591
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,520
So Tanaka eats 3, you 2, then 1-1-1

592
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,650
Alright, alright I get it.

593
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,620
I'll eat three!

594
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,990
I'll do 3 and he does 2

595
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,720
I'll do 3 and he does 2

596
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,290
But at this point,

597
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,360
when it gets to be too much I'll have to give up,

598
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,430
so if it gets to that point I'll need everyone's help

599
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,300
If you agree to that, then let's do it

600
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
Amazing.

601
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,600
This is a good plan

602
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,940
We finally have a good plan

603
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,510
If we didn't decide this it'd still be unsettled

604
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,080
We need everyone else's help...

605
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,340
'If we didn't decide this it'd still be unsettled'

606
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,340
What do you mean

607
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,850
Alright, here we are

608
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,510
We're here, huh

609
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
A new plan

610
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,490
Is this a shopping street?

611
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,520
A shopping street?

612
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,720
After being pressured by their senpai,

613
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,860
The plan is 'Endou eats 2, Tanaka eats 3.'

614
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,630
Store No. 15 Ooyama Happy Road

615
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,130
But will it work?

616
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,600
Okay, what's it gonna be?

617
00:16:26,630 --> 00:17:37,870
Store No. 15 Ooyama Happy Road

618
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,270
Tanaka's gonna eat the most, so

619
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,130
Tanaka

620
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,100
Huh, Tanaka?

621
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,470
Where's Tanaka?

622
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,940
Tanaka?!

623
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,380
Huh, Tanaka?

624
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,850
Where's Tanaka?

625
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,510
Tanaka?!

626
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,550
Oh, he scared me, I thought he ran away

627
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,550
I thought he escaped!

628
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,520
Sorry, my microphone fell

629
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,720
I'm really sorry

630
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,690
You scared us

631
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,360
You're gonna eat the most out of any of us, so

632
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,760
you pick.

633
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,730
I think...

634
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,030
What's it gonna be?

635
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,230
I'm thinkin',

636
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,200
the standard.

637
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:10,240
Rectangle

638
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:10,240
Takoyaki

639
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:10,240
The Standard

640
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,230
Just plain?

641
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,940
Yea.

642
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,240
That was a little too casual

643
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,740
*TL Note: He was speaking too informally

644
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,740
Hold on,

645
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,940
Thank you

646
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,940
Here you go

647
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,780
I's so hawt

648
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,820
You were cocorico bombers after all

649
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,820
Yea

650
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,590
A long time ago, yeah

651
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,290
After this,

652
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,790
Not bad.

653
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,530
He did it!

654
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,600
Okay!

655
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,600
He's done it!

656
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,870
Complete

657
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,530
Beautiful!

658
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,530
Well done!

659
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,430
Completed!

660
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,430
Good work

661
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,700
Next is the 16th store, Waseda

662
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,410
which is always crowded with students

663
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,980
Store No. 16 Waseda

664
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,810
Tanaka again orders plain takoyaki, however

665
00:17:45,980 --> 00:18:49,540
Store No. 16 Waseda

666
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:52,750
Rectangle

667
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:52,750
Takoyaki

668
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:52,750
The Standard

669
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,650
his expression soon turns gloomy.

670
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,090
Are you alright,

671
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,090
Tanaka-san?

672
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,490
Because his no one is turning his wind-up key, he eats slow like that

673
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,890
Keep going, keep going

674
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,700
Housei-san

675
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,030
Yama-chan,

676
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,030
help him out!

677
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,040
I'm the one that needs help...

678
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,340
Why?

679
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,340
What?!

680
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,210
Why's that?

681
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,370
Right now,

682
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,080
We've received some troubling news.

683
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,240
After about 5 minutes,

684
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,110
an exam at the university will end,

685
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,880
and an unbelievable amount of students will rush here

686
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,880
Very quickly.

687
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,450
We have to finish this quick, or else

688
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,920
Look, look, look

689
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,620
Time is of the essence!

690
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,820
it's gonna get crazy

691
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,820
Only 5 minutes

692
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,860
Hamada-san looks like

693
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,860
he could eat another one!

694
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,860
Hamada-san should eat it!

695
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,960
Please!

696
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,870
There's not much time!

697
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,140
Completed!

698
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,540
Complete

699
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,140
Alright, we're done!

700
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,540
Let's go to the next store!

701
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,210
8 hours since starting, is this the stomach's limit?

702
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,750
The atmosphere is as heavy as their guts.

703
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,890
We can't even

704
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,090
laugh and talk while we walk right now

705
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,030
Store No. 17 Sanmoru Nakano

706
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,030
After arriving at Nakano, the 17th store awaits!

707
00:19:10,030 --> 00:20:21,330
Store No. 17 Sanmoru Nakano

708
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:18,200
Rectangle

709
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:18,200
Takoyaki

710
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:18,200
The Standard

711
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,530
Here it is

712
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,530
We're they always this big?

713
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,030
Here it is guys

714
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,200
These look really big

715
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,670
Take yours, Yama-chan,

716
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,040
This is my second one

717
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,740
This is my second one, too

718
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,880
Eat it for them, Yama-chan

719
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,650
Please!

720
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,580
Zaki-san

721
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,110
Please!

722
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,110
Please.

723
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,120
Hurry up!

724
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,580
This one is Hamada-san's

725
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,720
I just

726
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,720
ate one, idiot!

727
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,620
Please, nii-san

728
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,630
You can give up here, you know?

729
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,160
Everyone's eaten what they're supposed to already.

730
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,160
Exactly.

731
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,360
This is his problem

732
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,360
Right.

733
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,300
You came all this way,

734
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:49,870
There's courage in giving up, too!!

735
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,370
There's courage in giving up, too!!

736
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,200
There's courage in giving up, too!!

737
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,570
So, Yama-chan.

738
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,770
What are you gonna do?

739
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,940
Housei-san.

740
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,350
At least

741
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,350
make that look good!

742
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,390
Why did it stick like that?

743
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,560
Why did that happen?

744
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,890
There it is!

745
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:21,330
Complete

746
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,360
ＹＥＳ!

747
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,330
Completed!

748
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,900
Roppongi

749
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,900
Sanmoru Nakano

750
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,900
Store No. 17

751
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,900
Store No. 18

752
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
We're heading out!

753
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,870
It's just that, uhh

754
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,470
There's a big gap between us and Matsumoto-san now

755
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,510
That's true

756
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,840
At this point, 4 balls is a massive difference

757
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,010
Really?

758
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,450
It's not even close

759
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,180
At the next store, does something think

760
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,920
they could eat a full boat?

761
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,650
they could eat a full boat?

762
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,150
they could eat a full boat?

763
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,890
That's called drastic measures

764
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,360
Then,

765
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,430
If you do it, you'll catch up to us

766
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,930
If you do it, you'll catch up to us

767
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,600
That's right

768
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,960
You can close the gap

769
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,870
Me, a full boat

770
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,600
A full boat

771
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,770
all at once

772
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,770
at once.

773
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,040
No, I mean,

774
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,610
Not me, but another human here who could eat a full boat.

775
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,680
The only one here is Tanaka.

776
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,740
There's absolutely no way.

777
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,310
Understood, let's do this

778
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,710
Let me do rock paper scissors with Tanaka!!

779
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,220
Let me do rock paper scissors with Tanaka!!

780
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,750
Me...?

781
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,750
I got it.

782
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:17,050
Hold on a second...

783
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,950
Why is it always me this time!

784
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,050
Why is it always me this time!

785
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,360
If I lose to Tanaka, then I'll do it, but

786
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,300
Tanaka's just not even trying at all, so

787
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,300
No, no, no

788
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,730
I've eaten the most of anyone!

789
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,470
Can we add in

790
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,470
one more person?

791
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,600
I agree with that

792
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,470
I'm okay with that

793
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,780
He's spinning the roulette

794
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,780
Alright

795
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,920
Alright!

796
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,790
Store No. 18 Roppongi

797
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,020
At last, the deciding battle.

798
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,290
Alright

799
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,900
Ready?

800
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,360
Alright, let me put this on

801
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,130
One boat, the 8 ball battle

802
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,130
The 8 Ball Battle!

803
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,000
With three participants

804
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,470
The loser eats a full boat

805
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,500
Is putting the hat on an official rule?

806
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,340
It decides who eats a whole boat, so

807
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,410
Gotta get into gear

808
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,410
Here we go.

809
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,080
Ready?

810
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,810
Rock, paper, scissors shoot!

811
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,620
YES!

812
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,620
YAYY!

813
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:18,780
1 Boat, 8 Ball Hell

814
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:18,780
1 Boat, 8 Ball Hell

815
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:18,780
Tanaka!!

816
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,890
1 Boat, 8 Ball Hell

817
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,890
1 Boat, 8 Ball Hell

818
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,890
Tanaka!!

819
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,320
Tanaka-san, you lost!

820
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,860
God is watching over us!!

821
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,560
God is watching over us!!

822
00:22:28,560 --> 00:24:01,190
Store No. 18 Roppongi

823
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,830
Alright, let's head over

824
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,530
Let's go!

825
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,000
Eat your whole body weight's worth, Tanaka!!

826
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,710
Rectangle

827
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,710
Takoyaki

828
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,710
The Standard

829
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,040
The boat of hell,

830
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,710
Tanaka chooses the classic standard, plain Takoyaki!

831
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,580
I just got one pair of chopsticks, since you know...

832
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,580
Oh I see! That's right, huh!

833
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,680
There was really no point in

834
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,020
There was really no point in

835
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,020
getting out of the car, but whatever

836
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
Honestly, yea

837
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,420
Cause we had an agreement

838
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,420
That's right, yes.

839
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,930
There's still 7.5 balls left.

840
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,400
7.5 left.

841
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,300
If we're calculating it, here

842
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,300
That's right

843
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,200
I'm working on it.

844
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,770
We're counting on you here

845
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,770
I will, I know.

846
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,440
Where's the next store?

847
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,710
Next is, uhh

848
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,910
Harajuku

849
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,750
Take us to Harajuku, Tanaka.

850
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,650
Take me down to Harajuku, baby

851
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,050
Take me down to Harajuku, baby

852
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,120
Take me down to Harajuku, baby

853
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,120
I really wanna go

854
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,090
It's pretty close, too

855
00:23:30,890 --> 00:24:09,830
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

856
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,090
It's close by, yes

857
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,260
What are you doing?

858
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,490
You can rest when we go to Harajuku.

859
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,830
He's crying!

860
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,100
What're you gonna do?

861
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,100
I give up...

862
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,100
Give up?!

863
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,900
Huhh?!!

864
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,110
What'dya say?

865
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,970
Give up

866
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,970
Give??

867
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,710
Could you say it for us one more time?

868
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,710
Say it loud and clear, please.

869
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,650
Can I please give up...

870
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,950
