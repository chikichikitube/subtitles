1
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,210
Are we rolling?

2
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,710
Well, not like I care...

3
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,820
There's no need for you to film any of this

4
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,060
You know, today...

5
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,390
I'm going to take divine retribution on those four

6
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,400
I'm talking about the "4 idiots" of Gaki no Tsukai

7
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,570
They're all helpless

8
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,170
I've been angry at them for so long

9
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,010
They've been making me angry for so many years!

10
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,510
That's why they'll all face

11
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,550
My divine retribution

12
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,390

TRANSLATION: SHION
TYPESET & QC: KEDOMAS

14
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,430
The one I can't forgive the most
between the four of them is Hamada, that idiot

15
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,660
The things he did to me to this very day...

16
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,600
Do you remember them all?

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,630
Let's go back to 20 years ago

18
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,300
It's Tanaka! Let's all gather!

19
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,640
This is from a show we did over 20 years ago

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,910
An episode called "It's Tanaka! Let's all gather!"

21
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,980
Just take a look at how guilty that idiot is

22
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,920
For this bit,

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,690
They had to snap at my poor host skills

24
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,860
So that the whole episode's atmosphere would be ruined

25
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,520
That's what the prank was all about

26
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,460
The small fry won!

27
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,990
I'm the champion?

28
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,130
Small fry won!

29
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,060
Eh? What about us?

30
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,400
Can we actually broadcast this on TV?

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,930
You think we should not?

32
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,470
Is this really the best you can do?

33
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,090
I'm being foul-mouthed, so...

34
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,240
Is that how you call that shit?!

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,640
Did you see that?

36
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,450
You see how he actually hit me?

37
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,380
Let's watch that one more time

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,120
Is that how you call that shit?!

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,810
We're sorry, we're sorry...

40
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,320
See?

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,530
That one actually hit me too

42
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,660
He grabbed my head

43
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,270
He grabbed my head so tightly

44
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,640
We were joking!

45
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,670
That was no joke

46
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,640
None of that was a joke

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,870
He clearly hit me with that racket

48
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,510
You know,

49
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,850
This was supposed to be a prank

50
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,080
So you gotta arrange it accordingly

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,150
But regardless,

52
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,680
Hamada, that idiot,

53
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,150
Hit me so hard with that goddamn racket!

54
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,690
And pulled my hair like this!

55
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,830
Hitting someone's head for a laugh is typical of Osaka's comedy

56
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,230
But to keep that style and bring it to Tokyo...

57
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,470
That's why he relies so much on violence

58
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,740
He's so quick at being violent, 'cause he thinks it's fun

59
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,670
And he can't just stop

60
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,110
In other words...

61
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,280
He's just a remnant of Osaka, isn't he?

62
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,680
But that's not all there is

63
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,080
In "Hot Blooded! Hamada's Cram"...

64
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,480
Hot-Blooded!

65
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,430
Hamada's Cram School!

66
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,960
It's a series with more episodes

67
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,190
And there's this section, the "non-stop club"...

68
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,030
In which we have to keep on moving until he tells us to stop

69
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,370
We basically have to keep on moving

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,900
Alright Tanaka, activate the turbo!

71
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,640
He ordered me to activate the "turbo" mode

72
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,610
And so I've started moving like crazy, but then...

73
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,610
This isn't very "turbo", is it?

74
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,850
This is how you break a person!

75
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,960
Engage in a 1vs1 turn-based war cry battle
If you shout the same war cry more than once, you lose

76
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,960
If you shout the same war cry twice, you lose       - I see

77
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,030
Komoto!

78
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,210
Tanaka!

79
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,270
Tanaka!

80
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,640
At this point, I had an headache

81
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,770
My head was hurting like hell

82
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,510
Tanaka won!

83
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,230
Tanaka won!!

84
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,700
Go away, Komoto

85
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,930
Tanaka won, so he stays

86
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,950
- What's wrong?

87
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,180
What does that mean?

88
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,020
Tanaka's personal hell is just beginning

89
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,020
Tanaka's personal hell is just beginning

90
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,020
Tanaka's personal hell is just beginning

91
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,120
What does that mean?

92
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,020
You won, you stay      - You heard him, Tanaka?

93
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,150
War cry battle, let's start from Tanaka

94
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,340
Come on!

95
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,890
In the end, Hamada...

96
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,730
Made me do the same shit

97
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,460
Countless times, over and over again

98
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,000
Tanaka!

99
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,130
Tanaka!

100
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,370
Tanaka!

101
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:45,540
Tanaka!

102
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,670
Tanaka!

103
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,460
Tanaka! Tanaka!

104
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,180
Tanaka! Tanaka!

105
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,080
Tanaka won!

106
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,280
He's strong!

107
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,470
Tanaka won!!

108
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,820
Looking back at his Osaka's years...

109
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,790
He said "I only eat flour-based dishes"

110
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,260
I bet the flour is the only flavor he knows

111
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,120
So I don't think he knows the flavor of comedy

112
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,860
He's a flour-dish remnant, isn't he?

113
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,160
That Hamada, here in Tokyo

114
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,170
But this isn't the end of it

115
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,400
As you know,

116
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,670
There's also the "Hamada's aging trial"...

117
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,210
Second
Hamada Masatoshi's
Old! Old! Aging Trial

118
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,210
Second
Hamada Masatoshi's
Old! Old! Aging Trial

119
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,210
I'd like to start the second "Hamada's Aging Trial"

120
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,120
This was the second time

121
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,240
As more and more years go by,
Hamada gets more and more senile

122
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,850
This episode wanted to prove this theory

123
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,860
But it's not just this,

124
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,560
As you know, he cares a lot about Inomoto and the Dorians

125
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,800
But we have some evidence from his manager

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,420
This one really shocked me

127
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
He asks "what's my schedule for tomorrow?"

128
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,900
He exchanged messages with his manager

129
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,740
"For now, you have tomorrow off"

130
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,740
"toriaezu"

131
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,740
- That's his manager

132
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,010
But then, Hamada replied...

133
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,180
And he called his manager

134
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,060
With a very threatening tone in his voice

135
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,080
It should have been fine

136
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,480
"Hey! What do ya mean?!"

137
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,920
"Dorians have a day off? No one ever told me!"

138
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,360
"toriaezu"

139
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,360
He misread "for now" as "Dorians"

140
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,770
This really shocked me

141
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,160
"toriaezu"

142
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,160
How can you misread "for now" as "Dorians"?!

143
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,740
This really shows how he's aging

144
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,800
And the way he snapped, too...

145
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,200
He's starting to look like Eiji Bando

146
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,270
Ah, Mr. Bando?

147
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,170
He's just an angry old dude

148
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,710
That's how he's becoming
- Bando gets angry in the same way

149
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,140
But it's not something worth a laugh

150
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,680
It just doesn't feel right

151
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,380
Hamada himself believes

152
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,580
That if we make an episode out of this, we can laugh it away?

153
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,650
Like, "isn't it ok if we can just laugh at it?" -- He's getting it wrong

154
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,620
The same goes for our audience,

155
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,130
They think it's good as long as they can laugh at him

156
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,530
They're all delusional!

157
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,500
This show itself is misleading us all!

158
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
This isn't ok!

159
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,100
This is just promoting Hamada's senility!

160
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,740
He's a remnant of senility!

161
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,170
That's what Hamada is

162
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,380
The same can be said to Hamada's partner...

163
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,060
He's nice to himself, but severe with others

164
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,090
Check this out

165
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,260
In this episode

166
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,530
We entered this stage to perform a play

167
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,230
And we had to fall over

168
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,070
When the timing required us to do so

169
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,770
You have to fall over, but only once

170
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,610
Because that's the best comedic fall we can do

171
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,040
You're gonna learn a lot from this!

172
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,580
You can see his legs, right?

173
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,950
As you can see

174
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,310
He's wearing knee pads

175
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,490
The four of us had to fall over countless times

176
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,890
And we didn't wear any knee pads

177
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,920
On the other hand,

178
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,430
Matsumoto only fell down one time

179
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,030
But he asked the staff to wear knee pads

180
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,300
He's a remnant of knee pads, isn't he?

181
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,770
I mean...

182
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,740
This...

183
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,740
I can't...

184
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,650
Matsumoto always says that

185
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,820
"Comedy has to be objective to work", but...

186
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,820
We recently had this episode, the "Breathless Club"

187
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,490
Lactic Acid Frenzy!
Battle - Read "The Turtle and the Hare"!!

188
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,430
"Lactic Acid Franzy! Battle -
Read 'The Turtle and the Hare'!"

189
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,530
Matsumoto will face the challenge!

190
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,670
What?!

191
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,270
Basically,

192
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,650
It's a challenge about how much
one can read after producing lots of lactic acid

193
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,620
You can hold it! I'm starting to feel nervous

194
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,680
It's fine, it's fine

195
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,750
Here, stop, stop

196
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,650
I can't!

197
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,790
I can't run for that long!

198
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,790
Stop the tape for a sec

199
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,620
See?

200
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,060
He could run for only 26 seconds, right?

201
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,860
But you see, before doing this bit,

202
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,130
He said "I usually run a lot, I won't produce any lactic acid!"

203
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,840
"It won't tire me at all!"

204
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,310
"If I'm doing it, it's not going to be fun at all"

205
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,440
That's what he said to the staff

206
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,810
But what's this?!

207
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,150
He can't run at all!

208
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,290
He could only run for 26 seconds!

209
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,160
What's "objective" about you, huh?

210
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,300
But this isn't the only shocking footage

211
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,060
There's more right after it

212
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,430
From this point on

213
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,670
There were less than 10 seconds left

214
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,070
Look at the machine

215
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,170
You gotta be kidding me

216
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,870
Can this actually happen?

217
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,380
It stopped

218
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,650
Are you kidding me?!

219
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,300
The staff was so worried they plugged the whole thing off!

220
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,570
But it was too fast!

221
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,320
- See this? Stop!

222
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,520
Tell me, what is this?

223
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,720
He can't run at all

224
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,390
But because he was still trying

225
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,090
The staff got worried about him

226
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,690
And they decided...

227
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,330
To plug the machine off

228
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,500
You haven't even done it

229
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,570
I think it was, like, two years ago...

230
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,400
Matsumoto made a post on Twitter

231
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:28,310
"I'm worried about my juniors.

232
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,310
Matsumoto will move on."

233
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,680
But now I'm really worried about him

234
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,250
Why don't you move?

235
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,120
Why don't you move, move, run?

236
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,930
Hosei

237
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,960
That guy...

238
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,030
He started from Osaka

239
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,200
And being a "remnant of Osaka", he moved to Tokyo

240
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,670
Then he became a remnant of Tokyo and went back to Osaka

241
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,640
He's always dragging along old stuff with him

242
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,070
So what can I say about him?

243
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,880
That's beautiful

244
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,610
He became some sort of flawless embodiment of remnants

245
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,250
Every year, on the opening for our New Year Ceremony,

246
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,990
Yes! Yes! New Year!

247
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,260
Yes! Yes! New Year!

248
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,610
Yes! Yes! New Year!

249
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,160
Yes! Yes! New Year!

250
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,860
Yes! Yes! New Year!

251
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,170
Yes! Yes! New Year!

252
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,080
Yes! Yes! New Year!

253
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,540
Yes! Yes! New Year!

254
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,920
If they ask me, "what's a remnant of Osaka?"

255
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,420
I'd reply "It's this"

256
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,990
"This is what a remnant of Osaka looks like"

257
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,090
He's repeating the same thing for years

258
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,430
Then we have Endo

259
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,800
This guy...

260
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,030
I mean, he---

261
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,970
I don't have much to say about him

262
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,870
Because he's got nothing

263
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,010
He's not even a "remnant"

264
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,890
He's just like a bell

265
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,350
A bell without a ball inside

266
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,590
In other words, a bell which makes no sound!

267
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,190
But this Endo here...

268
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:30,130
Has once found something which "made a sound"

269
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,100
Ogo! Ogo! Ogo!

270
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,210
This really made a sound

271
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,310
Louder!

272
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:45,800
If you missed this episode,
you can find it subbed on shionnotsukai.wordpress.com:
Life Of The “Ogoo” Endo Pteranodon

273
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,820
Ogooooo!

274
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,960
This is one of the things which made more sound for him

275
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,260
But regardless of it, this guy completely forgot about "Ogoo"

276
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,400
And didn't do it at all after that!

277
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,660
He just threw it away

278
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,700
And never tried to use it again, not even once

279
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,840
Even with his "Ogoo"...

280
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,210
He could have conquered the world...

281
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,140
I've talked a lot about them

282
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,410
But in the end

283
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,420
The one pulling the strings of those idiots

284
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,480
Is Hamada

285
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,890
Check this out

286
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,630
You have no idea what's going on, right?

287
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,670
That's because it's not ethical to broadcast this!

288
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,140
That's why all you see is a censored clip

289
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,610
And I've [censored]

290
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,810
Until it was destroyed!

291
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,840
But I bet all I just said got censored too, right?!

292
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,750
You have no way of knowing what's going on here!

293
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,520
What the hell is this for?!

294
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,760
But anyway,

295
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,090
Today I'm going to punish them all

296
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,830
To my heart's content

297
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,530
Without holding back

298
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,070
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai!

299
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,800
Get a 100-hit Badminton combo

300
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,970
And win 1 million yen!

301
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,970
Tsukitei Hosei          Matsumoto Hitoshi         Hamada Masatoshi         Endo Shozo

302
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,310
Nice one!

303
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,340
1 million each?

304
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,110
No way
- Oh, it's shared

305
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:26,250
As you can see, Tanaka is absent today

306
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,980
- Ah, you're right...

307
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,260
Alright, it's finally revenge time

308
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,630
They think I didn't show up because I'm sick,

309
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,430
But now I'll reach them and I'll get my revenge

310
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,510
Alright guys, let's aim at that sweet million!

311
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,240
Yeah, let's do this

312
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,680
We gotta make it

313
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,210
Nice one, like this

314
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,380
Four!

315
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,680
Six!

316
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,590
Come on...
- I think it went too far

317
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,160
You shouldn't hit it with the edge, that's not how it works

318
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,530
Here!

319
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,230
I can't believe it!
- Sorry about that

320
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,330
Yamazaki could have gone for it, though...

321
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,240
But he didn't go at all
- It was Endo's

322
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,500
Let's start again

323
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,610
16
- We're doing great!

324
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,190
17...
- We can do this!

325
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,680
19!

326
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,580
Get it!

327
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,980
28!

328
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,150
That damned spot...
- I thought it was Endo's...

329
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,820
You both hesitated

330
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,790
Maybe we should call it
- I agree

331
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,120
Like, "I'm going!" or such
- Alright, let's go

332
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
One...

333
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,360
Two...
- Nice one!

334
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,230
Three...

335
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,400
Four!

336
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,830
Aw, crap!

337
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,670
Let's try again

338
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,670
Ready...

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,870
Hey...

340
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,270
Hey...

341
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,680
Let's call it when it's ours

342
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,780
That's...

343
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,540
That's why I didn't go for it

344
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,250
I see...

345
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,150
But I think we can do this
- We should try it

346
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,160
Maybe we should aim lower?

347
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,160
I think Endo's quite good at it

348
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,220
Ow!

349
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,790
Let's just go
- Yep

350
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,000
Can you please...

351
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,570
Lower it a bit, would you?

352
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,140
Three!

353
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,270
Here...

354
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,380
Let's go
- Not much progress, huh?

355
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,550
It's because the distance is off--

356
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,820
I'm going

357
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,250
I'm going!
- Feel free to

358
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,170
You all ready?

359
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,060
One

360
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,400
Three...

361
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,940
Like this, kinda

362
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,450
Oh boy...
- Get ready

363
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,520
We can definitely do this

364
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,120
Let's not take any break
- Ok

365
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,990
Three...
- Shoot!

366
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,520
It went right through it, man

367
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,260
Two...

368
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,360
Yama-chan!

369
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,730
Yama-chan, what the?

370
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,030
Get a grip, man!

371
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,970
Can't be helped

372
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,470
It can happen, I know

373
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,910
Let's go...
- One!

374
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,640
Two...

375
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,910
Okay!

376
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,810
Hey, Shozo!

377
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,010
Come on, we can do this!

378
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,980
No way
- We're losing focus   - You're right

379
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,590
Maybe a 100 combo is too much for us?

380
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,790
Maybe...

381
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,260
How about, like, 51?

382
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,690
I agree, we should aim at that

383
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,260
One!
- If we can pull this off...

384
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,360
Here

385
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,160
Oh, no!

386
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,370
That's too high

387
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,500
Let's do this

388
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,930
One!

389
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,330
Two!

390
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,630
Three!

391
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,200
Go get it, Hamada!

392
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,770
Shoot, I'm sorry!

393
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,830
You're not getting a single ball...
- I'm sorry

394
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,300
What's wrong?
- I can't figure out the right distance

395
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,410
You're hitting it too softly
- But I just got that one, didn't I?

396
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,680
Let's go! One...

397
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,850
Oh, crap!
- I'm sorry about that...

398
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,680
Here it goes

399
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,690
Let's get it back, come on

400
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,820
Let's go
- One!

401
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,630
Oh, crap! I'm sorry!

402
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,440
Let's start again

403
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,270
Get ready...

404
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,490
One...

405
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,790
It's not even reaching me!

406
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,020
It's not?

407
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,930
Get it flying over here!

408
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,430
Come on

409
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,930
Counting on you!
- Alright, one...

410
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,600
Hamada, whenever you want!
- Oh, I'm sorry

411
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,570
Is everything alright?

412
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,040
I'm going

413
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,370
Hamada, please

414
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,910
What's going on? We can barely even hit it

415
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,050
Come on, man

416
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,450
Are you ok?

417
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,650
Let's go, Yama-chan

418
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,590
Alright, let's go

419
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,820
Come on, come on

420
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,650
Are you ready?

421
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,520
Come on, we don't have much time

422
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,090
We barely even made any progress
- That's right...

423
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,160
Yama-chan what's wrong? Did it slip?

424
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,600
Sorry, it just fell

425
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,030
Come on

426
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,300
One!
- Nice

427
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,910
Two-- hey, can you even see it?!

428
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,000
I can, sorry
- Come on, guys!

429
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,010
Let's do our best here

430
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,470
I can see it, but...
- Matsumoto!

431
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,740
We're counting on you
- It's there

432
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,840
It's right there
- Please!

433
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,850
He can't even pick it up!

434
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,220
Three!

435
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,850
Four!

436
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,220
It's yours, Hamada!

437
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,650
Five!
- Go get it!

438
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,720
Hamada!

439
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,170
Five!
- Go get it!

440
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,680
Your turn, Hamada

441
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,880
Let's go again

442
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,610
Come on
- Go, Hamada!

443
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,150
Come on, come on!

444
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,250
Let's go for that million!
- We're almost there

445
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,650
Whenever you want!

446
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,490
Here!

447
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,060
Sorry, sorry

448
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,580
Let's go already

449
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,300
Are you feeling tired?
- We are, actually

450
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,030
I see

451
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,440
Are you ok?

452
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,410
We can't even reach five

453
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,080
Not even five?!

454
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,430
Let's at least go for five
- That's strange...

455
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,410
What?

456
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:40,800
I think that's enough for them to realize
they should never do any of that again

457
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,600
My revenge was successful

458
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,070
We had fun!

459
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,600
Isn't it a bit hard to see?
- Yeah, I agree

460
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,060
I agree, I can't see that well myself

461
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,760
That's what makes it fun, huh?

462
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,950
One... two...

463
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,780
Three!

464
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,040
staff) Ok, we're done!

465
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,950
Thanks for today!

466
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:07,940
Tanaka, that fucking hurt!

467
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,810
When you slammed it on my face, it hurt so much!

468
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,380
I'm sorry

469
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,180
I've felt Tanaka's kindness

470
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,890
In the sweetness of this cream

471
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,910
BEFORE THE RECORDING

472
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,910
BEFORE THE RECORDING

473
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,420
Excuse me?

474
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,530
Good morning
- Morning

475
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,560
This script...

476
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,530
Badmouths Osaka and Kansai so much, don't you think?

477
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,900
It hurts my heart, I swear

478
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,540
Can I actually pull this off?

479
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,780
Was that good?

480
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,780
I think so

481
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,050
It's just an old dude empty laugh

482
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,250
Today's director is Ishikawa

483
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,500
- Ishikawa, huh

484
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,920
It's his debut

485
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,990
If I don't perform well on this one...

486
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,360
He's going to hate me so much after this

487
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,490
Can't we even reach five?
- Not even five

488
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,600
The first throw was so strong!

489
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,970
I'm sorry for all of this

490
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,110
Well...

491
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,580
I think it went just fine, right?

492
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,580
What's this feeling?

493
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,220
For a moment I thought

494
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,160
This was going to be a reverse-prank
and Hamada would hurt me again

495
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,700
My heart was racing

496
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,510
I couldn't breathe easily

497
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,650
Was that the original plan?

498
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,060
No, the plan was...

499
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,130
For you to act and choose when to end it

500
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,790
Ah, so I could have done more?

501
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,460
I see... that's not what I heard before

502
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,860
I'm glad it worked out, now I see

503
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,140
Sorry for that

504
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,730
And thanks

505
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,030
Alright, thank you so much!

506
00:23:52,950 --> 00:24:11,630
