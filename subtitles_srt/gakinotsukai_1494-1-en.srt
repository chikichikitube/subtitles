1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,120
The 1st time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arehende!

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,120
When will Hamada notice, verification test!

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,420
This is about Hamada...

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,930
recently his senility has been, amazing

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,930
Japanese people

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,960
He probably thinks that includes as far as Taiwan

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,870
Even further maybe, Asia

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,870
Possibly the entire Northern Hemisphere

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,270
Today we will be doing something we've done several times

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,810
Tanaka's expertise

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,580
World tabletop games

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,580
World tabletop games right

13
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,650
But that's not actually the real theme

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,550
We'll be doing things to see if Hamada will notice

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,880
We won't go as far as messing around but

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,450
We'll have some tricks we'll do

17
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,860
We'll see when will Hamada notice

18
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,160
If he never notices then it'll be

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,160
rough

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,530
If he never notices, we'll have to keep going the entire time

21
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,970
I think if that happens

22
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,240
We should fire him

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,240
Fire Hamada?

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,210
He can join

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,210
London Boots instead

26
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,210
An agent contract?

27
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,910
He'd be at the same level as Ryou

28
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,010
I mean he won't make it on YouTube alone

29
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,880
These recent events are slowly...

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
Sorry sorry I shouldn't continue

31
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,450
One at a time, each of us will

32
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,490
Endo, Me, Yamasaki, then Tanaka, are you ready?

33
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,490
I'm ready

34
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,130
We'll start with Endo

35
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,130
I'll be going first

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,030
I will, for the entire recording

37
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,900
I will not say a single thing

38
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,070
He should notice that

39
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,370
Everyone will be talking a lot

40
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,080
Since it's a tabletop game

41
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,240
Not talking there is kinda...

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,310
Plus, only 1 person out of 5 not talking is strange

43
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,180
If your family did that it'd definitely hurt your feelings

44
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,220
That's true

45
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,620
Here at Yoshimoto we're a family

46
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,960
I feel like I should say that

47
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,530
Now the preparations are complete

48
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,760
It's time to standby for the prank

49
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,200
Okay, I'll go fetch him

50
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,800
Everyone acts normally

51
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,840
Waiting for the clueless Hamada to come

52
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,440
And then suddenly

53
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,950
Don't need it

54
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,380
Please

55
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Say "you always say that" or something

56
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,390
I look like the bad guy

57
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,000
The first up is Endo

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,800
Now will Hamada ever notice?

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,870
Will he notice!?

60
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,910
Starting in 4, 3, 2

61
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,080
The 6th time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arehende!

62
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,080
So loud!

63
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,020
Let's play Tabletop Games from around the world!

64
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,190
We're doing this a 6th time?

65
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,090
This is the 6th time

66
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,460
Who wanted to do this?

67
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,760
He really loves this, seriously

68
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,570
I heard his thing was half standing on the way here

69
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,470
That'd make me a huge pervert

70
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,040
Just stop already man

71
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,040
Just play by yourself

72
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,240
But if he was alone,

73
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,840
it'd be limp

74
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,050
First is the same as always

75
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,350
They check out all the games

76
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,250
How much earlier did you come in?

77
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,250
I was around an hour early

78
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,220
Very meticulous

79
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,860
I had a confirmation

80
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,400
You we're lectured about all this

81
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,400
Yes, from the easy ones to the hard ones

82
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,130
Like let's do it like this

83
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,130
You've got it all inside you

84
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,900
Some of these were here last time and some are new

85
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,900
Like I remember seeing this

86
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,140
Right there are new games

87
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,610
There are some card games

88
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,250
And I've included some games that make you move a little

89
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,080
What are we playing?

90
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,320
Out of these, the one I thought of first

91
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,420
Is this German game

92
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,190
I think we should start with it

93
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,330
Germany

94
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,330
The Candy Witch (Knusperhexe)

95
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,590
Oh really?

96
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,260
Let's start with this one

97
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,600
Alright then, take a seat at the table

98
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,840
He really likes this huh

99
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,570
We'll it's true that

100
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,240
We all enjoy this

101
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,540
That's right

102
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,050
This is the best one right?

103
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,850
You can play it at home for a few weeks

104
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,850
Yes that's right

105
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,750
I think we need something like this

106
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,090
First is this

107
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,360
"The Candy Witch" a German game

108
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,360
I will begin explaining

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,630
There are four kinds of candies

110
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,630
Then just like this

111
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,570
We create a roof

112
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,000
The set-up is a little hard

113
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,140
This is just setting up?

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,170
Yes

115
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,410
Now if you'd like, we can all go around

116
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,780
Carefully placing cards in the middle

117
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,280
And make a roof

118
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,950
We're making a roof?

119
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,950
Right, first

120
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,720
This is unrelated to the game?

121
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,720
It's unrelated

122
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,720
What the hell?

123
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,650
This kind of a game...

124
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,150
You could've just set this up ahead of time

125
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,420
But then you wouldn't have seen this state of the roof

126
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,860
The thrilling part will come after this

127
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,690
It's gotten quite stable

128
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,060
Oh you're right

129
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,060
I see I see

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,270
We can fill in the middle part?

131
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,600
Yes, it's okay to fill in the middle

132
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,840
This is kind of amazing, a very strange idea

133
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,210
In order, we take a card

134
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,480
If it's chocolate then chocolate becomes one of your cards

135
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,150
In the second round, when it's your turn again

136
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,720
If you draw another chocolate

137
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,350
Rather if you draw the same card

138
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,790
You have to put it back

139
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,620
Put it back?

140
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,890
Both of them?

141
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,520
Just one

142
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,760
At the end whoever has the most cards wins

143
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,430
You want most unique candies

144
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,770
And if you cause the roof to collapse, you lose

145
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,770
That's obvious

146
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,540
At that time...

147
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,410
I suppose you're right

148
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,810
It's pretty obvious

149
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,910
That's why we were all doing this

150
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,380
At that time, whoever has the most cards wins

151
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,190
Say something!

152
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,790
Huh, what, what?

153
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,400
Congratulations!

154
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,400
What's going on?

155
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,260
This is scaring me

156
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,940
What? x9

157
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,440
Incredible!

158
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,380
As expected, Hamada!

159
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,910
Seriously this is scaring me

160
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,410
You're actually scaring me

161
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,150
Incredible!

162
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,950
Today there was actually a secret theme

163
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,650
"When will Hamada notice?"

164
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,220
How conscious is Hamada of the other members?

165
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,060
was the secret theme

166
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,460
Since the opening, Endo has not said a word

167
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,000
Really, Hamada

168
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,500
I didn't notice here, at the start

169
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,040
I didn't notice over here either

170
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,810
But once I came over here

171
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,140
I thought He's not saying anything

172
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,780
I'm so glad

173
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,650
For me it was slowly getting funnier

174
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,880
He wasn't saying a single thing

175
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,660
When is this guy gonna say something

176
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,320
I'm really glad

177
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,490
We're going to reset

178
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,720
Right let's clean up

179
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,360
I want to actually play

180
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,230
Right, this is a fun game

181
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,230
What the hell, seriously

182
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,200
To resume the game, they clean up the area

183
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,440
Can we go over the rules again?
I didn't really get them earlier

184
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,780
Currently, Hamada still has no suspicion

185
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,380
Were you actually filming?

186
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,650
Yes

187
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,320
We're filming?

188
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,130
A new trick awaits

189
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,760
This is fun though, really

190
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,870
Tanaka can you go over it again
Honestly I didn't get it before

191
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,040
Endo wasn't really listening I think

192
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,840
I thought if Hamada didn't notice

193
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,840
I'd say something to Endo directly

194
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,910
Early on it was nerve-wracking

195
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,180
It really was for me

196
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,480
What order are we going in?

197
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,220
We'll go around like this, starting with Housei

198
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,220
I'm first, okay

199
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,990
Can I take cards from the bottom?

200
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,990
Yes you can them from anywhere

201
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,490
If it collapses, that's bad right?

202
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,490
Collapsing is bad

203
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,330
Okay I got a candy

204
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,970
If it collapses you lose

205
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,200
A cupcake

206
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,880
Woah! You were really rough there

207
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,880
He really went for it

208
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,210
Chocolate

209
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,450
Huh? We got all 4 types

210
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,350
That's right

211
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,590
But we can get the same ones too?

212
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,420
That's correct

213
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,420
This was just a coincidence

214
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,590
It's fine, if you get the same ones, you just put it back

215
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,360
Perfectly getting all 4 types together

216
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,360
Isn't that a miracle?

217
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,830
We just grabbed the ones Tanaka put down

218
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,870
Oh really?

219
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,770
What the hell are you talking about?

220
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:24,540
No I'm just trying to include everyone and have fun

221
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,540
Sorry that was rude

222
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:31,120
In the first and second rounds
He doesn't notice the trick, the game advances

223
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,390
And we arrive at the third round

224
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,960
The target age is quite low

225
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,830
From 5 to 99 it says

226
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,030
From 5 to 99?

227
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,030
100 would be fine too!

228
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,540
They should include 100 year olds too

229
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,540
Include 100, seriously, they can play

230
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,670
These two are the exact same

231
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,940
You're afraid of it collapsing, right?

232
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,810
Does it collapse so easily?

233
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,650
Well it's stacked pretty densely

234
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,290
It's starting to get difficult now

235
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,860
It's probably still fine

236
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,230
It's the third round now

237
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,430
What should I do...

238
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,060
True, in the third round it gets a bit...

239
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,000
Aah, which one do I pick?

240
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,340
What? Just take any of them

241
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,640
It's still fine

242
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,650
I don't know...

243
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,710
What do you mean you don't know?

244
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,820
You can definitely grab one

245
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,850
Look these ones around here are fine

246
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,620
Just slide them off

247
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,990
Hm? Which one?

248
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,360
Like this one

249
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,600
This one's fine too

250
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,400
No I'm a little scared

251
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,400
Because it's on the corner

252
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,540
Aren't you like, really tall?

253
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,110
Congratulations!

254
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,880
What the hell, come on!

255
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,420
Say it sooner!

256
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,820
Oh it's this!

257
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,630
He didn't notice at all!

258
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,400
You were pretty slow!

259
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,700
I wasn't slow at all

260
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,300
How did you notice?

261
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,040
When I stood up, and was talking

262
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,280
I thought "Huh?"

263
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,940
You've seen him so many times so

264
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,580
I was like "Huh?"

265
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,080
Sorry! Sorry!

266
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,080
This is really

267
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,090
Cut it out already!

268
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,690
Let's play seriously!

269
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,690
This was really interesting

270
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,260
Play seriously

271
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,690
I'll play seriously, really

272
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,700
You're absolutely huge!

273
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,700
Right, that's why you should've noticed sooner

274
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,700
No I wouldn't know so early

275
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,600
Well he still noticed it in the end

276
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,470
Enough with these streamers already

277
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,840
The second reset of the day

278
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,610
How many centimeters are these things?

279
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,520
These are pretty tall

280
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,520
11 cm

281
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,090
11 cm would make you 183-184 cm

282
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,620
Let's play the game!

283
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,790
Right, this is a really fun game

284
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,470
However, the tricks on Hamada are not over yet

285
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,070
Oh sorry

286
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,470
There's a lot of these

287
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,250
The staff withdraw a little too carefully

288
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,650
Hamada appears extra vigilant

289
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,020
They're getting it all

290
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,960
It's fine if you leave some

291
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:04,930
That's true, now that you say it, it's really...

292
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,730
Alright we're going to resume filming

293
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,730
Starting on Tanaka, 3 2 1

294
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,940
Alright, once again, let's resume the game
It's Matsumoto's turn

295
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,150
You should be a little careful

296
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,150
How durable is this thing

297
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,380
Ohh, nice

298
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,590
He's definitely getting a duplicate

299
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,590
These edge ones are a bit scary

300
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,420
You put back the duplicates

301
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,660
This is a duplicate so

302
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,660
you put it back

303
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,600
I already have the walking stick so I can't take that one

304
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,730
Walking stick?

305
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,070
It's candy

306
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,740
It's "The Candy Witch"

307
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,980
You're completely off

308
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,410
Maybe I shouldn't talk after all

309
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,120
Endo and Tanaka grab their cards

310
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,420
Next up is Hosei

311
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,090
I'll grab...

312
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,060
I'm safe

313
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,310
You already had that one

314
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,080
He has to put that back

315
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,080
Put it back

316
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,890
I should remember that one

317
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,720
Only one, only one

318
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,520
So naggy

319
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,760
This is fine

320
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,670
Now I'll take the one I saw Matsumoto put back

321
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,770
And this is safe right

322
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,910
The tempo has risen a bit now

323
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,250
Yep, I'm safe

324
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,480
Hm, what to do...

325
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,880
Maybe the middle

326
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,320
Okay, safe

327
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,560
Man I don't remember any of them

328
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,700
Ooh, okay okay

329
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,470
Soon we'll be able to see inside

330
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,470
This is dangerous

331
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,040
Woah, that's a risky move

332
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,780
This is probably fine

333
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,110
Cupcake, okay

334
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,710
Now we can see inside the house

335
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,720
Which one should I take...

336
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,920
Ahh, this is no good

337
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,360
But it's still anyone's game

338
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,560
We all have around the same

339
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,260
Right, but I've never gotten a chocolate

340
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,600
Yeah you have no chocolate

341
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,940
Ah chocolate. I kind of want to take that one

342
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,700
I'm first though

343
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,340
It's a cane, so there's no point for you

344
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,280
Right, I'd have to return it

345
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,940
Man this is kind of...

346
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,510
It looks like it's about to break

347
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,560
One piece decides the game

348
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,690
Next is Hosei

349
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,790
Which one...

350
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,230
This one

351
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,810
Breasts!

352
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,750
Enough!

353
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,750
Thank you very much!

354
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,980
Enough already!

355
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,180
You we're slow again!

356
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,760
What the hell is this!

357
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,190
We all said we'd play

358
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,060
I wouldn't think he'd be next

359
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,800
You were a little slow Hamada

360
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,800
They were really poking out!

361
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,400
Why would I look at Yamasaki's chest?

362
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,040
When will Hamada notice, verification test!

363
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:20,750
Up until now, Endo, Matsumoto, Hosei's trick
Hamada has masterfully cleared them all

364
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,990
Sorry sorry

365
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,220
Let's play already, play the game

366
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,160
We'll play

367
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,560
This is the third reset today

368
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,330
As expected of Hamada

369
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,810
This... This is kind of...

370
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,780
The clean up is suspicious

371
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,950
Isn't the clean up kinda suspicious?

372
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,880
Really?

373
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,920
While they're cleaning...

374
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,990
They leave the set during cleaning

375
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,590
Otherwise it doesn't make sense
Suddenly Yamasaki's chest becomes huge

376
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,260
Now we change to another game

377
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,470
Eh, we're stopping?

378
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,800
This is good, it's good

379
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,800
Better than the last one

380
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,410
Thank you

381
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,780
This is good right

382
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,640
"Bounce Off!"

383
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,920
Okay okay okay okay

384
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,790
All the past American ones have been surprise types

385
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,790
We resume with a new game

386
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,820
"Bounce Off!" an American game

387
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,130
America Bounce Off!

388
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,130
It's a 2v2 Team Battle

389
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,930
You draw a card with these marks

390
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,840
You want to line up 3 balls of the same color

391
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,940
Each team tries to throw their balls onto the board

392
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,040
Throw?

393
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,250
Whoever makes the pattern first wins

394
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,720
When you're throwing, you need to bounce it

395
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,120
Wait how do we throw it?

396
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,720
Ah, like that? Ah nice

397
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,530
Right, just like that

398
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,500
Housei and Matsumoto Team

399
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,830
Hamada and Endo Team

400
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,200
They need to aim the balls into their place

401
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,370
This one's really hard

402
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,910
The four balls can be anywhere?

403
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,510
Yes, anywhere is fine

404
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,380
Then we'll go first

405
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,380
What why?

406
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,480
Shouldn't we do rock-paper-scissors?

407
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,490
He said it so casually

408
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,220
No no no no

409
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,330
Between us, it's a versus game

410
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,160
You're trying to notice things right?

411
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,900
I'm pretty on-edge right now

412
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,700
Seriously

413
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,170
Now we start the game

414
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,280
This is hard

415
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,380
Now it's the other team's turn

416
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,680
I see

417
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,590
Ahh, this is difficult

418
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,530
No way!

419
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,900
The game heats up

420
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,300
Seriously?

421
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,800
Then nothing happens for a while

422
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,180
I'm going to try and aim over there

423
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,950
And so the yellow team wins

424
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,620
This is fun, I like this one

425
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,220
Another round?

426
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,390
Let's change the teams then

427
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,730
Tanaka, do you want to play?

428
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,490
Yes

429
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,400
Why don't you swap with Endo

430
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,400
Okay sure

431
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,870
Let's do Rocky-Paper

432
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,870
Rocky-Paper?

433
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,240
No, it's not that

434
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,210
Oh to swap

435
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,210
To decide who's with who

436
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,180
You didn't mean me and Tanaka

437
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,180
That too, that too

438
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:12,880
We'll do that too

439
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,450
Okay, I see

440
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,620
Now we change up the teams

441
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,290
Carefully aim the balls into their place

442
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,760
This is the pattern

443
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,900
This is a hard one

444
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,900
It got really hard

445
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,600
It really is

446
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,100
Now decide who goes first

447
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,540
I mean either is fine

448
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,310
Rocky-Paper Sho-, er oops

449
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,980
It's not that, it's not that

450
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,980
This is just his old age showing

451
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,320
Sorry about that

452
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,490
They start the second game

453
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,670
Both teams reach the match point

454
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,940
You're both one away

455
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
This is hard

456
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,210
If you did it it'd be amazing

457
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,510
Concentrate

458
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,510
It'd be super cool

459
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,950
I'm going

460
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,990
Did you fart?

461
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,030
No I didn't

462
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,030
He just farted!

463
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,130
No there's nothing

464
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,900
I didn't even fart, what's wrong

465
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,740
No I heard this rumbling noise

466
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,810
It wasn't me

467
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,970
My stomach was growling

468
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,980
Oh my bad

469
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,750
Please apologize

470
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,750
Oh I'm sorry

471
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,450
Tanaka concentrate

472
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,150
Tanaka's bad side is showing

473
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,150
That was a huge blunder Tanaka

474
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,120
Now I just need to land it there

475
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,590
Hamada you can do this
You pretty much know where to bounce it

476
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,830
If Downtown can land this they win

477
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,440
Downtown Team Wins

478
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,440
It was really right there

479
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,910
That was great

480
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,250
And that's it

481
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,650
Alright! We're OK! That's a wrap

482
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,930
Already!?

483
00:23:37,330 --> 00:24:09,930
Translation - Tekno Timing - mattee53
Typesetting - Teknova QA - Shion

484
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,800
Man I hate this

485
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,970
It's exhausting

486
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,600
I've been so exhausted

487
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,410
The correct answer was "There's nothing else!?"

488
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,310
Ah, it was that...

489
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,580
Nobody had any tricks

490
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,780
I see, it was just three

491
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,450
"There's nothing else!?" Of course it was

492
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,620
"Tanaka's not doing anything!"

493
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,490
Of course, it was that

494
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,260
Ah, I'm sorry!
