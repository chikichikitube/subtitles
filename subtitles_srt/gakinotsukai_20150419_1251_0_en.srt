1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,520
1st Time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende
"I'm the One Who Understands you Best!"

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,720
"Anyways, I Think You'll Like this Item!" Mizusawa Ally Edition!!

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,230
Can I say something?

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,930
Do you really need to be so loud?

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,100
It really was something.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,100
It was right?

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,200
It felt like it just kept getting louder.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,210
Let's just move on, we don't need to keep talking about this.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,440
I get it.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,440
Let's get going.

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:43,120
A special series on Gaki, where the members buy gifts for guests based on their interests!!

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:49,430
(Also known as: Ari, Arie, Ali)

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:49,430
Today's guest is Tōkyō Girls Collection model and fashionable talent, Mizusawa Ally.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,300
The five member's will present a top and an accessory which they think will suit our guest.

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,310
However, will the members be able to choose something to suit the 24 year old!?

16
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,240
This is Mizusawa Ally, didn't you mistake her for someone else?

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,910
This is Mizusawa Ally, didn't you mistake her for someone else?

18
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,910
I mistook her for Omiya Ellie-san.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,380
You just changed up the letters.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,250
Remember who our guest is.

21
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,320
I will, I will.

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,490
We can't have you messing up her name again.

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,490
I won't mess up again.

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,490
How was it this time Matsumoto-san?

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,790
This time was pretty tough.

26
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,530
I mean, we've only seen her TV image.

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,530
That's true.

28
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,130
And she's the youngest guest we've had so far.

29
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,600
Add to that a young woman.

30
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,940
It's not exactly our speciality.

31
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,810
Yeah that's true, she's quite young.

32
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,480
Well, without further ado, let's welcome our guest, Mizusawa Ally.

33
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,790
Mizusawa Ally

34
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,420
You've got a completely different image!

35
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,220
I think I've only seen you with blonde hair.

36
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,260
I think I've only seen you with blonde hair.

37
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,260
Oh yeah!

38
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,230
Don't change your hair just before filming!!

39
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,260
Don't change your hair just before filming!!

40
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,270
You didn't just change it for today?

41
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,670
No I didn't,

42
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,640
No I didn't,
I just kinda felt like this recently.

43
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,110
The hair change has really thrown me off.

44
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,110
Ah, you thought of me as a blonde.

45
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,550
We've swapped haven't we!!

46
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,680
We've swapped haven't we!!

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,180
You're speaking really casually right now!

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,050
She's using Tameguchi, a more casual way of speaking, which can seem a little impolite when speaking to your senior.

49
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,050
Sorry, sorry.

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,990
Before the show started, the Gaki members went shopping.

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,660
The image I have in mind is a dress but...

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,660
Shibuya

53
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,730
...the others will probably go for something like that.

54
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,240
So I should go for something a bit different

55
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,540
maybe try a more casual place.

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,580
I'm not really sure what to look for

57
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,920
I wonder if this is too normal.

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,780
Man I hate this.

59
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,920
I think I've gotta find something more casual.

60
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,360
Well, Mizusawa Ally-chan, I think...

61
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,660
Omotesandō

62
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,660
...has a face which suits hats.

63
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,860
Her face is quite bright,

64
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,730
so I was thinking I don't want anything too flashy,

65
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,200
to have that kind of contrast.

66
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,400
I like the feel of this one.

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,470
It's quite a different image...

68
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,340
This kinda feeling...

69
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,220
...this would suit not only Mizusawa Ally, but anyone.

70
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,490
I want to find an item a young lady would love to wear.

71
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,490
Harajuku

72
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,490
Are these stockings?

73
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,620
Ah, I see.

74
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,620
These are nice.

75
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,460
Look at these flashy ones.

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,360
Pretty flashy right?

77
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,400
Should I go for these or...

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,570
Will this go with my other item?

79
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,610
What should I do?

80
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,640
Wait a minute... I've gotta think this through.

81
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,080
Wait a minute... I've gotta think this through.

82
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,650
I'm looking for the hottest look, the most trendy.

83
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,050
Shibuya

84
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,180
Ah, this is perfect!

85
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,150
There's loads to pick from here!

86
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,350
What a selection!

87
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,350
This is great.

88
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,160
I'm looking for something...

89
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,760
...Omiya Ellie-chan wouldn't buy for herself.

90
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,100
Mizusawa Ally

91
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,670
Ah, Mizusawa Ally!

92
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,740
Mizusawa Ally-chan...

93
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,680
I have a feeling that this guest doesn't like wearing hats and stuff

94
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,680
Marunouchi

95
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,220
so maybe, an umbrella is the answer.

96
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,880
Isn't this pretty good?

97
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,390
I think this looks pretty good.

98
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,260
I'm gonna have a look around and come back to this if I don't find anything better.

99
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:47,000
In search of something to suit Mizusawa Ally, Matsumoto moves to another floor.

100
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,630
This... looks like something Naoto Inti Raymi would wear, right?

101
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,040
This... looks like something Naoto Inti Raymi would wear, right?

102
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:58,710
Naoto Inti Raymi (Nakamura Naoto) is a Japanese singer-songwriter and composer

103
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,110
The Naoto Inti Raymi collection.

104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,710
How's this?

105
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,370
This isn't it right?

106
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,820
Nah, this isn't it.

107
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,260
But it's not far off.

108
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,660
I can't walk away from this.

109
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,330
I could definitely see her wearing this.

110
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:27,970
As usual, the guest will take home their favourite items.
The member with the worst item will have to pay out of pocket.

111
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,780
So, let's get going with our first items; a top for Mizusawa Ally.

112
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,720
I'm confident with this one.

113
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,750
I'm confident!!

114
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,750
That means nothing from you!!!

115
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,120
Even I admit... last time wasn't great.

116
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,020
Even I admit... last time wasn't great.

117
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,930
It was like you were shopping for the Joker.

118
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,760
Definitely something for the Joker.

119
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,270
First to present his top to Mizusawa Ally is Endō.

120
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,840
Moussy

121
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,740
The colour is...

122
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,740
Ah, no Endō!

123
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,840
This is just wrong!

124
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,850
This is perfect for her.

125
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,850
Look at that smile, this'll suit her perfectly.

126
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:15,750
6,912 Yen (£40/$67)

127
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:15,750
Price conversions are approximate for time of airing.

128
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,750
It'll look nice with Ally-chan's figure.

129
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,660
It's so dull.

130
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,320
No it's not.

131
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,630
Look at the face she's pulling! There's no way she likes it.

132
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,960
Look at the face she's pulling! There's no way she likes it.

133
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,800
Look, she's smiling.

134
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,200
Why did you buy it for her?

135
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,170
Would you like to hear my reasoning?

136
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,170
I'd like to hear.

137
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,310
I was thinking, you have quite a bright face

138
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,540
You don't want both your face and clothes to be flashy
because they'll end up taking away from each other.

139
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,880
You don't want both your face and clothes to be flashy
because they'll end up taking away from each other.

140
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,880
Ah, a balance?

141
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,980
So by having a plainer top, it'll make your face shine brighter.

142
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,980
It's just boring!

143
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,620
There's just one thing...

144
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,120
When I was buying it, I was picturing you with blonde hair.

145
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,720
When I was buying it, I was picturing you with blonde hair.

146
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,830
So truthfully it might not work as well with darker hair.

147
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,030
She'll look like an older sister when she's at home!

148
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,030
This is for wearing at home right?

149
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,900
Simplicity is sometimes nice.

150
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,940
That's true.

151
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,480
Next up is Hōsei, how will it go?

152
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,910
This is the first time I've seen this brand.

153
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,180
It's cute.

154
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,510
Cute?

155
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:22,020
Ally-chan, you'll probably hear this a lot but the moment I saw this, I knew it'd suit you perfectly.

156
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,330
22,680 Yen (£132/$221)

157
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,700
She's laughing like crazy!!

158
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,000
YAY!

159
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,870
What are you cheering for!?

160
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,200
Hmm, yeah, thank you!

161
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,540
Hmm, yeah, thank you!

162
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,070
Hmm, yeah, thank you!

163
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,610
Aww man that's bad!

164
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,140
I think it might be slightly better than Endō's.

165
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,580
It's better than that.

166
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,150
It's better than Endō's.

167
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,350
It feels more like something I might wear on TV.

168
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,450
It feels more like something I might wear on TV.

169
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,220
This can be used for both your free time and work.

170
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,890
Man this is tough!

171
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Timed, Typeset & Translated by Inepped

172
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,980
"I Think You'll Like this Item!"
Hamada is next to present his top to Mizusawa Ally.

173
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,450
I was going for a rougher casual style

174
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,280
that you can just throw on whenever.

175
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,220
This doesn't look quite right.

176
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,190
It's different from what we've seen so far.

177
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,260
12,960 Yen (£75/$126)

178
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,490
Nah this isn't it.

179
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,260
CUTE!!

180
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,300
She just let it out!

181
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,570
Cute! This is super cute.

182
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,980
I have no idea any more.

183
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,980
"That" is cute?!

184
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,750
This would go great with some jeans.

185
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,080
This is perfect for when it gets slightly chilly.

186
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,420
A cardigan is cute? It's so ordinary.

187
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,560
These black lines here are cute.

188
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,160
Are those needed?

189
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,130
That's what makes it unique.

190
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,530
This part here is super cute!!

191
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,630
You're joking!

192
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,260
Surely you don't need those lines.

193
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,930
Without these it would be ordinary...

194
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,300
...but with these lines it's super cute.

195
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,740
What?!

196
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,900
What if it had them on both arms?

197
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,540
Just the one is cute.

198
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,610
Next up is Matsumoto, what sort of top has he chosen?

199
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,980
With this one I went with...

200
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,050
...a cheaper option.

201
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,820
That's ok, I don't mind that.

202
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,420
If you think about it,

203
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,820
young ladies probably go for the style over the price.

204
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,260
When I was getting this there were loads of people in there.

205
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,760
It's cheaper, but still good quality.

206
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,200
Ah, this is a cheap place,

207
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
but it has cute stuff.

208
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
See, she said it has cute stuff.

209
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,840
See!

210
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,350
See!

211
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,850
This is the one!

212
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,620
You can't go wrong with a dress.

213
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,650
5,990 Yen (£35/$58)

214
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,020
It looks a nice fit.

215
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,220
I think it would've looked nicer with my lighter hair.

216
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,730
Yeah, I was shopping with the image of you with light hair.

217
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,370
Were you going for a simpler look?

218
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,170
Yeah.

219
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,870
To begin with we're going for different themes...

220
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,670
We're not talking about your theme right now!!

221
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,340
We're not talking about your theme right now!!

222
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,870
I was just saying we were coming at it from differing angles.

223
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,680
I don't care about your theme!!

224
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,050
I was just thinking how lame your's looks!

225
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,210
I was just thinking how lame your's looks!

226
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,950
APOLOGISE TO ZARA!!

227
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,090
Lame?

228
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Last up is Tanaka. How will he fare?

229
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,060
Tanaka, I've got to say this...

230
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,300
...you've gotta stop messing around.

231
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,170
I'm not messing around at all.

232
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,370
This time you'll see how serious I am.

233
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,840
I'm confident in this.

234
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,310
Is that store well known?

235
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,310
It's quite well known.

236
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,310
It's a pretty small bag...

237
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,320
Wait, wait she's laughing!

238
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:19,520
8,575 Yen (£50/$84)

239
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,090
TANAKA!!

240
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,020
Wait, wait, wait...

241
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,960
It's a tank top!

242
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,930
It looks like a burnt up curtain!

243
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,600
What were you thinking?!

244
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,600
What were you thinking?!

245
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,440
No, no... Ally-chan

246
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,240
No, no... Ally-chan

247
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,480
has a flashy look, and having the sleeveless look...

248
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,710
Ah, maybe a sunbathing outfit.

249
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,410
Having the stomach exposed is a bit much.

250
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,410
Maybe if it wasn't it'd be ok.

251
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,390
It would be hard to match something with this.

252
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,920
Well, it'll be no surprise where this lands.

253
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,220
Maybe this would suit Tanaka-kun more!!

254
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,190
She's using Tameguchi again, using -kun instead of -san.

255
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,190
Maybe this would suit Tanaka-kun more!!

256
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,330
Well, I can't help if it suits me.

257
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,640
So, which of these will be Mizusawa Ally's favourite!?

258
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,280
Endō

259
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,280
Hamada

260
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,280
Hōsei

261
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,280
Matsumoto

262
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,280
Tanaka

263
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,340
Be honest.

264
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,280
Be honest, we're not looking for laughs.

265
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,910
To be honest, when they laugh, it really hurts.

266
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,250
To be honest, when they laugh, it really hurts.

267
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,250
Here we go.

268
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,660
Endō

269
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,660
Hamada

270
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,660
Hōsei

271
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,660
Matsumoto

272
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,660
Tanaka

273
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,250
In first is...

274
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,320
This one.

275
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,500
Well, she said it was cute.

276
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,970
This part here is super cute!

277
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,640
Don't you want to wear more bold and unique clothes?

278
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,340
Don't you want to wear more bold and unique clothes?

279
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,510
When it comes to unique things...

280
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,740
smaller things are better.

281
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
Really!?

282
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,740
So, what's in second place?

283
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,980
This one.

284
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,420
As I thought...

285
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,520
Downtown are amazing.

286
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,830
Downtown are amazing.

287
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,830
When you think about it.

288
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,770
It must be the Shōwa era running through us.

289
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,770
The Shōwa era: 25 Dec 1926 - 7 Jan 1989
Downtown made their debut in 1983

290
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,040
I like the brightness of the colours on this one.

291
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,840
I see.

292
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,710
A nice and bright feel.

293
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,010
This.

294
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,880
And in third is Endō's dress.

295
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,620
So, which of these two tops will come in last!?

296
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,490
All that's left is Yama-chan and Tanaka.

297
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,090
All that's left is Yama-chan and Tanaka.

298
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,360
That's enough with the joking around now.

299
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,230
Yeah, be honest.

300
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,400
Time to be honest and pick you're actual favourite.

301
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,830
Ok

302
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,770
So, please show us last place.

303
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,870
The worst please.

304
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,900
The worst...

305
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,200
Please

306
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,770
Hōsei

307
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,770
Tanaka

308
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,370
In last is...

309
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,370
This

310
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,920
Well, when you compare it to the others...

311
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,790
I could wear these on TV and they're quite pretty

312
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,090
but this one

313
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,890
just shows off everything.

314
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,860
Are you worried about that? Showing off the shoulders?

315
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,800
The shoulders and arms not so much

316
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,570
but around here is a bit too much.

317
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,340
Tanaka has to pay out 8,575 Yen (£50/$84)!!

318
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:25,780
Next up finding an accessory to suit our guest.
First to present is Hamada.

319
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,750
You might have quite a few of these

320
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,620
but maybe not in this colour.

321
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,380
Ehh, I wonder what it is?

322
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,420
It's quite small but it should pack a punch.

323
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,790
Ah, I think I know what it is.

324
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,530
30,132 Yen (£175/$294)

325
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,360
Sunglasses

326
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,030
No good

327
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,370
Why are these no good?!

328
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,010
You can put them up here, they're great for a summer look.

329
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,170
Nah, these are no good.

330
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,510
He's just picked out the first thing he saw!

331
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,040
No I didn't!

332
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,310
I saw some in black, but I thought she probably had loads in black already!

333
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,810
They don't suit her at all.

334
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,020
Stop it! Stop it!

335
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,920
Stop it! Stop it!

336
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,320
They look weird, take them off!

337
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
They don't look weird!

338
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,920
Don't put them on again!

339
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,900
What's up with you guys, dunking on me like this!

340
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,800
What's up with you guys, dunking on me like this!

341
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,740
Next up, Endō will present his accessory.

342
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,570
Orange coloured?

343
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,970
Orange? What is this?

344
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,580
Take this off.

345
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,970
There it is!

346
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,970
There it is, Endō's...

347
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,480
10,368 Yen (£60/$101)

348
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,880
Well, it's a hat...

349
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,650
This is the worst by far!

350
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,520
This'll definitely suit you.

351
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,460
It looks great!

352
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,460
Try it with the glasses on.

353
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,440
The hat ruins it.

354
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,310
I think this really suits you.

355
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,650
Just take it off for a sec.

356
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,980
Is it a straw hat?

357
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,020
Yeah it is.

358
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,650
What's this tag say?

359
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,050
UV Cut.

360
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,150
Oh right.

361
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,850
You hate UV right?

362
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,750
Hmm...

363
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,020
Girls hate it right?

364
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,560
I hate it.

365
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,260
Right, you hate it. This cuts it out.

366
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,930
I hate these two together!

367
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,730
Get back here!!

368
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,660
That's enough!

369
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,600
In last place with his top, how will Tanaka do with his accessory?

370
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,870
I'm much more confident with this one.

371
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,870
It's small.

372
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,290
I think you'll love this!

373
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,880
I wonder what it could be.

374
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,110
Take a look.

375
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,990
What is this?

376
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,290
A handkerchief?

377
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
They're tights!

378
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,430
Tights?!

379
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,430
YES!

380
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,190
This is... this is a perfect item for a young lady.

381
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,190
This is... this is a perfect item for a young lady.

382
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,900
Tanaka, it's creepy.

383
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,330
Tanaka, it's creepy.

384
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,330
Why?!

385
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,400
This is a great buy.

386
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,800
I don't think I'd ever pick out tights.

387
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,570
Really?!

388
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,070
What is that?!

389
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,070
What is that?!

390
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,710
It's a spring pattern.

391
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,020
It's a spring pattern, but also what surprised me is...

392
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,350
You have a dalmatian right?

393
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,350
Yes I do.

394
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,420
If you look closely, there are hidden dalmatians!

395
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,620
If you look closely, there are hidden dalmatians!

396
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,430
Who cares?

397
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,430
Look, look!

398
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,570
3,240 Yen (£19/$32)

399
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,800
Who cares if there's animals on it!

400
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,030
No, wait...

401
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,300
Among the spring colours are...

402
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,270
Ah, I see them!

403
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,270
There's a bunch of dogs' faces!

404
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,400
This is just gross!

405
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,510
What?! Why?!

406
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,180
Tanaka, change your manager!

407
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,180
Tanaka, change your manager!

408
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,580
He's definitely steering you wrong.

409
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,250
How many teams have you gone through?

410
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,320
It's still the same one.

411
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,320
Change it already!

412
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,490
Yoshimoto doesn't need a team of weirdos!

413
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,490
Hang on, seriously?

414
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,590
Should I try them on?

415
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,960
These actually might end up weirdly suiting you.

416
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,630
These are anything but sexy.

417
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,400
This is bad!

418
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,610
Really?!

419
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,540
Why? Why? Why?
These are super cute!

420
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,380
Seriously, don't listen to these guys.

421
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,280
It looks really odd with your current clothing

422
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,120
but what sort of clothes could you wear with these?

423
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,050
I'd like to hear your ideas.

424
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,160
Your usual clothes would work.

425
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,990
That sort of flashy...

426
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,890
Stop it with the "flashy" stuff.

427
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,560
Trousers are the only thing you can wear these with!
Long trousers.

428
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,160
Trousers are the only thing you can wear these with!
Long trousers.

429
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,160
These are useless.

430
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,830
No, no we want to see them.

431
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,930
You've seriously got to start trying!

432
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,600
You've seriously got to start trying!

433
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,580
I'm giving it my all!

434
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,780
Fourth to show off his accessory is Hōsei.

435
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,790
This is...

436
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,220
12,420 Yen (£72/$121)

437
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,220
This is just awful!

438
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,930
This is even worse than Tanaka's!!

439
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,360
This is even worse than Tanaka's!!

440
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,630
So, why did you pick this?

441
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,630
Who's the character on it?

442
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,000
Bartman

443
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,540
He's a small hero, Bartman.

444
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,570
So is this for using whenever?

445
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,580
Of course, it'll be great anytime.

446
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,580
This is just terrible.

447
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,750
It's not even spelt the way I thought!

448
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,880
It's not even spelt the way I thought!

449
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,290
I've lost all confidence!

450
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,360
I feel sorry for Yama-chan now.

451
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,670
Will Matsumoto's accessory suit Mizusawa Ally?

452
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,300
This item also wasn't too expensive.

453
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,100
Shoes?

454
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,540
Nice reaction.

455
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,710
Nope!

456
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,050
9,612 Yen (£56/$94)

457
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,420
Don't you think these are cute?

458
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,650
Nah!

459
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,650
These are quite nice.

460
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,820
These are quite nice.

461
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,660
Did you hear that?

462
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,630
She said "These are quite nice".

463
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,730
She said "These are quite nice".

464
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,730
What do you think?

465
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,170
I can't picture her wearing those.

466
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,100
I wear quite a lot of heels so...

467
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,200
They're so nice, the whole studio is speechless.

468
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,080
They're so nice, the whole studio is speechless.

469
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,040
That's not why they're quiet.

470
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
It'd be troublesome if they were all talking.

471
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,950
These are pretty cute.

472
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,650
They look great!

473
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,650
Hmm... They don't suit her.

474
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,120
Terrible.

475
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,120
Just terrible.

476
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,920
Just terrible.

477
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
They're nice, maybe I'll get a pair.

478
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,930
So, which of these items will be Mizusawa Ally's favourite?

479
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,030
How is it Ally?

480
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,030
Have you decided the ranking yet?

481
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,340
I'm still a bit unsure.

482
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,510
How about first?

483
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,610
First is the one I'm unsure about.

484
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,810
You're not unsure about last place though, right?

485
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,610
Hmm...

486
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,610
I am a little unsure!

487
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,880
No way!

488
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,880
YES!!

489
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
No way!

490
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,820
How can she be unsure about 'that'!?

491
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,160
So, which of these items will be Mizusawa Ally's favourite!?

492
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,160
Alright, here we go.

493
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,170
Endō

494
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,170
Hamada

495
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,170
Hōsei

496
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,170
Matsumoto

497
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,170
Tanaka

498
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,970
In first is...

499
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,330
This!

500
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,310
As I thought...

501
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,380
It's obviously the Shōwa era running through me.

502
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,020
It's like being bombarded by loads of pitches.

503
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,820
Since I'm always wearing heels, I've been wanting something like this, so these are perfect.

504
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,520
I always see you in heels.

505
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,990
I see.

506
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,160
I see.

507
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,990
They're super nice.

508
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,130
So, in second place?

509
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,560
This

510
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,230
See!

511
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,110
This is... this is a surprise.

512
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,870
This is... this is a surprise.

513
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,780
I actually really wanted something like this.

514
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,680
Out of all of those you chose 'this'?!

515
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,520
I quite like the American Pop kind of styling.

516
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,120
This

517
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,560
In third is Hamada's sunglasses.

518
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:35,330
Endō

519
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:35,330
Tanaka

520
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,830
All that's left is the Cocorico duo's items.

521
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:35,330
Can Tanaka avoid being last once again!?

522
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,330
So, the worst is...

523
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:40,300
Endō

524
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:40,300
Tanaka

525
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,900
In last place is...

526
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,240
This

527
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,010
Of course.

528
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,910
I thought that this one was quite cute but...

529
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,720
I hate ribbons!

530
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,280
Ribbons?!

531
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,280
You hate them?!

532
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,350
If this didn't have the ribbon attached, it would have been first.

533
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,520
If this didn't have the ribbon attached, it would have been first.

534
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,230
Can you explain why Tanaka-san's was in last place?

535
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,990
Please tell me.

536
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,000
I've thought about what this could work with.

537
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,030
After thinking it through, these are just impossible to wear!

538
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,400
After thinking it through, these are just impossible to wear!

539
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Really?!

540
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Don't Kagami mochi end up looking like this?

541
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:19,110
Kagami mochi (mirror rice cake) is a traditional Japanese New Year decoration. Usually consisting of two round mochi (rice cakes) stacked and a daidai (Japanese bitter orange) with a leaf on top

542
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,940
