1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
7th time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende
CHIKI CHIKI

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,660
"Are their hearts connected?" No Smartphone Meetup!

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,560
Of course, this is a "No Smartphones" challenge,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,000
I don't think that explains this though,

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,560
In the dressing room, you forgot your phone

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,340
Well, it is a "no smartphones" thing we're doing

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,400
But forgetting this in the dressing room is a different thing

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,430
Why do you have it?

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,680
"I shall return it" - I said

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,980
Oh is that it

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,630
For the 7th time, we test to see if the member's hearts are connected!

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,160
The Rule: Using the hint card given to them, if they all end up in the same location, the challenge ends

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,910
Everyone, look here please,

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,310
The results from previous episodes,

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,510
The person who meets up first the most;

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,830
Alright!

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,290
Yama-chan, and then Matsumoto-san

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,290
1st - Yamasaki

19
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,290
2nd - Matsumoto

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,290
3rd - Matsumoto

21
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,290
4th - Endo

22
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,290
5th - Tanaka

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,300
Our level is totally different

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,850
Tanaka is 0

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,310
Zero?!

26
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:12,910
Tanaka, in this series, and the outfit coordination stuff
He really does suck

27
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,690
That's true

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,630
These two end up meeting first a lot

29
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,230
That's true! Somehow, these two

30
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,490
The person who met up last
The guy who gets left alone till the end

31
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,900
It's Tanaka right?

32
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,110
Of course

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,430
Yup, Tanaka

34
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,600
Cocorico really suck

35
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,260
That's true, Endo sucks too

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,400
Hamada is pretty terrible too

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,230
Yeah, I guess him too

38
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,340
Hold on, I was last once

39
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,860
You have to consider this, and try harder

40
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,910
Yes, I want to meet quickly

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,860
Announcing the first location,

42
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,320
A place with lots of pigeons

43
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,100
It doesn't matter if there are pigeons there right now or not

44
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,800
Just a place that you would associate with pigeons

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,710
Let's meet immediately!

46
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,500
Yes!

47
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,630
Pigeons?!

48
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,470
There's nothing that comes to mind

49
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:11,260
Subbed by senor_wristband

50
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:18,460
The Hint: A place with a lot of pigeons
They start at NTV in Shiodome

51
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,860
Hamada is usally unsure during these challenges

52
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,900
TN: This is the Toyota JPN Taxi

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,900
Woah, this is the first time I've been in this type of cab
It's so spacious

54
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,630
I have two ideas,
Either Yoyogi or Komazawa Park,

55
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,710
Somewhere like that I think

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,770
Komazawa Park is pretty far from here

57
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,640
Oh, yeah you're right

58
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,400
Those stairs in Komazawa, you can imagine the flapping right?

59
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,740
I do have that image

60
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,200
You do have that image right? The "WASASA"

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,560
Komazawa Park, can we head there?

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,030
The only thing is, everyone else might not remember,

63
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,260
I went there for the parking lot thing too
I go to Komazawa a lot I think

64
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,290
I really don't want them to say "Damn, you love that place!"

65
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,200
You do have this image of getting on the expressway and heading straight to Komazawa

66
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,940
Woah, even you're picking on me now

67
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,970
That wasn't my intention!

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,710
Everyone thinks that then

69
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,540
Where is Matsumoto heading to?

70
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,230
You know, Hamada ...

71
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,260
Tweet ... That episode where you had to end up on Twitter

72
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,600
In Ueno, Hamada had to dance, and he was sweating like crazy

73
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,080
Weren't there pigeons there? Am I wrong?

74
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,710
I guess Ueno Park ...

75
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,630
Should we go there?

76
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,490
Can we? I think it's Ueno, Ueno Park

77
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:05,200
That episode last time, that took a lot of time to make

78
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,090
I hate these episodes where you don't know when they're gonna end

79
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,510
Last time we had this problem too,

80
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,200
Can we stop these episodes with undecided endings?

81
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,800
Like seriously

82
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,230
Seriously, make some 20 year olds do that

83
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,890
While these two are making the exact same complaints,

84
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,000
Hosei wants to maintain his ranking in this series

85
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,890
Oh hell yeah, it's this type of taxi

86
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,000
I have two ideas,

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,510
Komawa Park, was it called Komawa Park?

88
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,370
Komadai Park?

89
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,830
There's a  Komazawa Park...

90
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,030
Oh, Komozawa Park

91
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,710
Komawaza Park, and,

92
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,690
and, there, Meji Shrine

93
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,060
I bet someone will be at [!@!$!@]

94
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,050
Thank you

95
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,340
If he chose Komazawa Park, he'll meet with Hamada
What will happen?!

96
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,710
Who do you think will be there?

97
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:35,770
You know Matsumoto-san and I, it's like we've met everyday for over the last 10 years

98
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,260
So it's like the same,

99
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,270
The way you think?

100
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,000
The way we think

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,430
My wife told me,

102
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,140
"You and Matsumoto have the same eyes"

103
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,730
"Whenever you squint they look the same"

104
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,860
She said I have the same eyes when I do that

105
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,400
"You really know him"

106
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:06,290
Endo, who is almost as bad as Tanaka when it comes to being left behind ...

107
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,060
I think, it's gotta be a park

108
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,940
I think everyone else will take that approach

109
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,860
Ueno Park, Komazawa, oh yeah Yoyogi ...

110
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,840
They might go to one of those

111
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,370
I think I've got it this time

112
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,510
I think 3 or 4 of us will be there

113
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,540
If Endo is thinking along the same lines, he has a chance of meeting Matsumoto or Hamada,

114
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,630
And if Hosei goes to Komazawa, 3 people will be together

115
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:51,190
Meanwhile, the worst player Tanaka chooses his location

116
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:56,970
I do have one place in mind that I associate with pigeons, however,

117
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,660
What location, by the way?

118
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,110
It's, uh, Hachiko. In Shibuya

119
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:11,540
I do have this image of pigeons gathering around Hachiko's statue

120
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:22,460
And in the past, I've recorded an episode trying to catch the pigeons there, with Ryo-san from London Boots

121
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,230
Back when Ryo-san was young, I think,

122
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:33,140
I remember it was near Hachiko in Shibuya
But it was 20 years ago, so I don't remember exactly

123
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's head that way for now

124
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:42,850
Tanaka relies on a 20 year old memory, and decides on Hachiko

125
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,430
I think Endo would really remember that shoot,

126
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,170
He might think "Oh yeah! In front of Hachiko!"

127
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,860
I think he'll have that reaction

128
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,530
Actually yeah, I'm not changing the destination, but,

129
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,600
In front of Hachiko ... I think I went there before

130
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,070
But I think those were crows

131
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,770
Wait ...

132
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,690
The birds we caught with Ryo ...

133
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,340
Were they crows?

134
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,940
Hmm?

135
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,450
I think Tanaka doesn't understand this

136
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,970
Tanaka...

137
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:34,400
Cocorico will also graduate from Gaki in half a year,

138
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,510
So they're probably thinking about the memories they made on here, I bet

139
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,400
This is the first I've heard of this

140
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,800
Oh, I guess it was supposed to be a secret,

141
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,810
Cocorico and Hamada will both leave this show

142
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,310
We've arrived, however ...

143
00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:00,620
Incidentally there isn't a single pigeon here. Well, that's ...

144
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:08,230
Matsumoto is the first to arrive, at Ueno park. He is concerned about the presence of pigeons

145
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,740
Like I said, today is really hot!

146
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,830
There's no pigeons here!

147
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,310
Not a single one. Damn it's hot!

148
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,080
It's so hot today

149
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,940
Next, Hamada arrives at Komazawa Park

150
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,110
The pigeons ...

151
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,430
There's usually pigeons there,

152
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,660
And if you scare them off they all fly away,

153
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,430
The pigeon count could not be verified here either

154
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,970
Is there really not a single one?

155
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,110
There aren't any flying around either

156
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,270
Yeah seriously

157
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:55,310
On a future day, the staff did confirm the presence of pigeons,

158
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,570
It was exactly like Hamada described

159
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,600
Tanaka reaches Hachiko in Shibuya

160
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,990
See! Look there!

161
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,310
Look! That wall

162
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,490
Look at the wall!

163
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,860
They're on the walls

164
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,770
See? I told you

165
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,310
There's so many! Did you see them?

166
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,410
You saw them right?

167
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,110
Look!

168
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,430
See

169
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,770
This is a pigeon's feather

170
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,970
Right?

171
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,540
This is definitely a pigeon's

172
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,960
I can't imagine that everyone won't come here

173
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,970
Time Up! They confirm their locations with a phone call

174
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,910
Where did Hosei and Endo end up?

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,800
Hello. Where?

176
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,140
Endo, where are you? Endo?

177
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,320
I, am at Yoyogi Park

178
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,170
Yoyogi Park? Eh?

179
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,790
Yoyogi Park

180
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,260
Yoyogi Park?

181
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,760
Yoyogi Park huh?

182
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,580
You're at Yoyogi Endo?!

183
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,100
Ah, this is Hosei here. I'm at Meji Shrine

184
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,730
Where?

185
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,980
Meji Shrine!

186
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,890
Ahhh, I'm right next door

187
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,220
Damn, so close

188
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,480
Tanaka, where's Tanaka?

189
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,580
Tanaka here, I'm at Hachiko in Shibuya

190
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,910
There's no pigeons there!

191
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,220
Are you an idiot?

192
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,220
There's only people there!!

193
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,710
Tanaka, those were crows last time

194
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,920
Tanaka?

195
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,990
It's insane! There's an insanse amount of pigeons here

196
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,360
There's an insane amount?

197
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,670
There's an insane amount

198
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,200
Right now?

199
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,090
Right now, for real there's like 10 here

200
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,670
So there are pigeons

201
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,240
Huh, so there are pigeons

202
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,840
Mastsumoto-san, where are you?

203
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,930
You guys gotta think about this,

204
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,050
When you think of pigeons, it's gotta be Ueno Park!

205
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,650
Ueno Park after all!

206
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,880
So there must be a lot of pigeons there

207
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,720
They're standing on my head

208
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,530
There's 6 of them on my head

209
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,130
There's 6 on your head?

210
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,980
6, on your head?

211
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,590
Yeah. It's so annoying!

212
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,580
Where is Hamada-san?

213
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,970
I'm at Komazawa Park

214
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,740
You really love Komazawa Park!

215
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,740
What's so special about Komazawa Park?

216
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,420
Alright, alright then. Let's meet at the next one.

217
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,110
Indeed!

218
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,110
Yes indeed!

219
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,650
Well, I guess Tanaka, and I were alright,

220
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,650
Komazawa Park deserves a Batsu Game

221
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,600
Spread your ashes at Komazawa if you love it so much

222
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,000
The next theme;

223
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,820
Theater

224
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,610
This is another really broad query,

225
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,440
This is actually really tricky

226
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,140
There's a lot of choices

227
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,710
Within reach of the members, there are around 200 theatres

228
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,510
How they interpret "Theater" is vital!

229
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,020
A theatre huh...

230
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,110
I think we've got this one

231
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,390
Really?

232
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,910
Lumine (The Yoshimoto)

233
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,330
There's no answer but Lumine

234
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,490
Gaki no Tsukai -> Yoshimoto Creative Agency -> Lumine. That's it.

235
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:45,310
Hosei has total confidence in his choice of Lumine

236
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,490
Since we're all comedians,

237
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:53,650
So they might interpret this to mean Lumine, which makes sense,

238
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,710
And that hall where the young comedians work is a theatre right?

239
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,930
Mugendai Hall

240
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,620
And that's a theatre too right?

241
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,510
But with this "Theatre" prompt, would you really go to Mugendai Hall?

242
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,230
That's what I think

243
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,200
In that sense, Mugendai Hall is a theatre too right?

244
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:17,580
But Tanaka said he's at Hachiko,

245
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,840
If he's considering the distances, he might go there

246
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,580
But that's not really how this works right?

247
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:32,260
There's two theatres that just popped up in my mind,

248
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,290
Thinking about the distance, it's Shibuya's Mugendai Hall

249
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,040
Cause Shibuya is right there,

250
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,360
Plus ... Endo was in that Tom & Jerry play,

251
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,220
at Bunkamura Orchard Hall

252
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,000
They did it in Shibuya?

253
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,940
Yes, in Shibuya

254
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,130
Plus, another one I just thought of,

255
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,580
That place,

256
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,280
In Toyosu, the IHI 360 degree theater

257
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,690
That theater, the place with the revolving seats

258
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,670
But, the theater in Toyosu ... It's a really nice theater,

259
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,420
And I want to go there,

260
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,800
But the other 4, they don't know where it is I bet

261
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,160
Probably, I think

262
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,620
They don't know about it

263
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,380
I think,

264
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,090
That place, Teikoku,

265
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,220
Teikoku Theater right?

266
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,360
But you know ...

267
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,360
A place like Teikoku, those guys ...

268
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
Would they know it?

269
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,930
Those ... idiots, right?

270
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,820
If you ask me to name a theater,

271
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,640
Somewhere like Teikoku,

272
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,910
Or Honda

273
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,490
There's a good chance they'll all go to Lumine and ask "What is your occupation?"

274
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,160
But that's not a "THEATER"!

275
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,930
He's struggled to think of a location, but just where will he go?

276
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,710
It's gotta be Honda Theatre

277
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,580
In Shimokitazawa?

278
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,840
My dentist's office is close by too

279
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,730
Let's go to Honda

280
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,310
Have you ever gone to Honda Theater to watch a performance?

281
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,510
Ah, I haven't

282
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,930
You haven't?

283
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,290
I haven't

284
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,760
So this is really just about the dentist?

285
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,580
Shut up man

286
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,690
Wait, what was that place in Shimokitazawa?

287
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,470
Honda Theatre

288
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,130
Honda Theatre ...

289
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,980
Well, performing in Honda Theater is certainly a dream for comedians,

290
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,530
Kabukiza is also a theatre?

291
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,440
Hmm, Kabukiza?

292
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,890
Hamada-san goes to watch Kabuki

293
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,380
I wish they'd refuse him, the Kabuki theatre

294
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,910
Officially

295
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,640
I wish they would tell him to leave

296
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,110
I'm still drawn to Endo's Bunkamura Hall

297
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,980
Bunkamura...

298
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,470
Endo will definitely be there

299
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,200
Because ...

300
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,000
They were doing that play until recently

301
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,330
They were doing it until recently,

302
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,330
And he still has Osaka performances left to do

303
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,290
For Tom & Jerry

304
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,910
So "Tom&Jerry" is still in Endo's head

305
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,900
It's the stage for his performance,

306
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,640
It's like, just how many times has Endo been to Bunkamura

307
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,620
Like seriously,

308
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,730
I'll be shocked if he isn't there actually

309
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:05,230
DownTown have a chance of meeting. Just Endo's location remains.

310
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,600
Endo ... does he go watch performances in theaters?

311
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,160
Well he did do that play,

312
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,270
Wait, where did Endo do Tom & Jerry?

313
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,930
In Shibuya

314
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,690
"Orchard Hall" - Well, that's a theatre too

315
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,980
But I bet Endo really wants to avoid that place,

316
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:33,630
The things he's been through.
He must have some trauma that makes him avoid that place

317
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,600
Did you go watch Tom & Jerry?

318
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,610
Yes

319
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,930
How was it?

320
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,490
It was a lot of fun

321
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:48,890
Endo is the cat, so he's supposed to run around chasing the mouse,

322
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,040
He told me "I'm 48 man, this is too physically demanding!"

323
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,290
But he was totally running around on stage,

324
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:03,640
I thought "What? But you said you couldn't do it!"

325
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,760
I think Endo thinks ... He thinks it was a fun performance to be a part of

326
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,580
A theater ...

327
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,840
There's one place, as soon as I saw that hint I thought of,

328
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,400
[!@!@#!] in [*(@$!1#@!]

329
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,580
Will Endo be able to meet someone?

330
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,710
The most confident, Hosei arrives at Lumine the Yoshimoto

331
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,090
"We've got live comedy" - Amazing right?

332
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,730
That's a comedian there

333
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,580
Morning!

334
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,470
Ah! Keep up the good work!

335
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,260
What do they call you?

336
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,490
Somato

337
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,710
(It says Somato on his shirt)

338
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,710
Somato? Oh I see

339
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,810
You're a solo comedian?

340
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,810
Yes

341
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,810
Oh, this is a chance for you! Do something!

342
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,200
I have a one-shot gag

343
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,630
Yeah do it! One shot gag

344
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,490
Here I go,

345
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,970
Okay! Alright!

346
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,510
I apologise, I got very nervous

347
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,930
Well you would right, all of a sudden

348
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,000
Meanwhile, Hamada arrives at Honda Theater

349
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,060
So is someone here, or coming here?

350
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,340
Wait, I think there's someone there

351
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,940
No way, really? Really?

352
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,000
Wait I think there's someone there

353
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,320
No way, really? Really?

354
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,260
Thank you!

355
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,230
This is the place right?!
It's gotta be here

356
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,630
Thank god!

357
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,370
You know, I didn't think you would be here. Maybe Tanaka or someone else,

358
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,430
It's gotta be here right?
When you say "theater", it's gotta be Honda Theater

359
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,810
Thank goodness!!

360
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,330
You know for us, when we were young,

361
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,870
We were allowed to do a live show here,

362
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,550
Ah, is that so?

363
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,730
Then Tanaka should've come here

364
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,730
I thought he'd be here

365
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,270
If there's nobody here, I'm gonna be taken back, actually,

366
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,270
There's no way

367
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,500
Hmm, they're still not here?

368
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,470
Endo will come here, seriously,

369
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:31,000
There's no other place I can think of. Endo should be here for sure!

370
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,740
But, time ran out!

371
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,250
No way? For Real?

372
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,580
Where did Matsumoto end up?

373
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,930
Tanaka where are you right now?

374
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:49,360
I, Tanaka, am at Bunkamura Orchard Hall in Shibuya

375
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,800
Why the hell?! Why would go there?!

376
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
You did Tom & Jerry here!

377
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,870
Oh yeah, that's Endo's thing

378
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,700
Yes, yes!

379
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,600
But I thought Endo's trauma would prevent him from going there

380
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,730
Trauma? He has trauma from Tom & Jerry?

381
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,210
I had fun doing that show

382
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,270
Yama-chan where are you?

383
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,880
Everyone, what agency do you work for?

384
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,400
There it is

385
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,490
Well, spritually I'm a free agent

386
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,000
Spritually a free agent?

387
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,260
I'm thinking of signing up for an agent

388
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,530
It's gotta be Lumine!

389
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,330
There it is

390
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,770
Hamada, where are you?

391
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,400
Hamada-san and Endo have met up

392
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,750
Our location is, in Shimokitazawa, Honda Theater

393
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,850
Ahhh you went there?

394
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,250
Oh that place was an option!

395
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,950
Why Honda Theater?

396
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,620
Where are you Matsumoto-san ?

397
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,360
You guys ... What nationality are you?

398
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,800
Nationality?

399
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,810
Japan, I'm Japanese

400
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,800
If you think of a theatre, it's gotta be Kabukiza

401
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,640
In Ginza?!

402
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,530
It's gotta be here, this presence

403
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,600
It's gotta be a "Theater" though

404
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,330
You don't need to have "Theater" in the name,

405
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:20,600
A place where customers come to be entertained, that's what a theater is!

406
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,400
It's gotta be Lumine

407
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,320
There's no point complaining if you're alone,

408
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,600
THERE'S NO POINT COMPLAINING IF YOU'RE ALONE!

409
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,890
A very angry Hamada-san

410
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,070
Next Week - No Smartsphone Meetup Part 2

411
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,870
The Hint: A Gyoza no Osho location

412
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,940
I got this one, I got this for sure. Let's go

413
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,670
If we consider everyone's thoughts, they'll probably think of that place

414
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:51,070
Isn't this really hard? There's so many stores in the city

415
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:58,620
I think it has to be [!@$!@]. I can't really think of any other place.

416
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,930
Who will be the last to meet?

417
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:12,070
Thank you for watching!
