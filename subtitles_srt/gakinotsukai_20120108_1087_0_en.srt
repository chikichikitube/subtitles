00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,270
Self proclaimed American citizen, profession: Dancer

3
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,910
Immigration office headquarters

4
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,940
Are you really an American?

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,180
Yes!

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,340
If by chance you're really american

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,850
I bet you have no problem saying
in thirty seconds at least 10 words

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,550
Beginning with the letter A of the alphabet

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,990
Am I right?

10
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:40,920
Yes!

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,560
And... Start!

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,430
America

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,930
Apple

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,230
A... A...

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,230
An@l

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,610
An@l

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,740
Why picking up that from the many?

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,310
Was that the third(word)?

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:13,920
Not fair!

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,190
Even this clip is not fair!

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,220
Not fair on so many levels!

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,690
You said you're a dancer so... Are
musical instruments your strong point too?

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,760
A recorder was prepared for you, try playing something

24
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,400
It stinks...

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,180
Jimmy's sense of smell is sharp to abnormalities

26
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,210
Are you bullshitting us?

27
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:40,950
No..

28
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,460
The tough part came, didn't it?

29
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,400
Why is it tough from now?

30
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,500
He began the "it stinks" part...

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,470
I wonder if he will stop...

32
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,000
It's all about Jimmy's sense of smell, isn't it? It sure works strange.

33
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,470
It stinks...

34
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,620
That's kinda Hamada's weak point,
The authors must know it too, right?

35
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,050
Stop saying "It stinks"!

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,720
Ok, Just three times!

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,290
Think of something else, let's help each other

38
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,300
It stinks...

39
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,710
Please stop... Really... Let's skip that!

40
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,540
What the hell, man?

41
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,580
You can still get better

42
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,380
Enough... let's see what's next

43
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,380
No, from here Hamada-san

44
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,950
I got it, I got it.

45
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,960
It stinks

46
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,140
I've been tempted, damn! I've been tempted!

47
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,340
This must have hurt

48
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,280
Proceed, please

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,080
Please...

50
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,010
I'm really sorry

51
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm proceeding for sure now

52
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,920
I tried to endure that mess, but

53
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,700
You're not the American citizen
you claim to be, aren't you?

54
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,500
Get the hell away from this country!

55
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,240
The immigration officer's job is not over yet!

56
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,780
That was hard

57
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,750
I guess you're all worn out, aren't you?

58
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,820
Furthermore, this clip will continue...

59
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,430
Global economy of confusion

60
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,430
The road to revival

61
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,230
Katayama Satsuki

62
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,770
TN: A Japanese politician and bureaucrat. She was a member
of Japan's House of Representatives for about four years

63
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,400
Good evening

64
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm Katayama Satsuki, member
of the House of Councilors

65
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:42,520
No sub

66
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,390
Today, the topic is "The real path to the World Economy"

67
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,330
And we'll soon start a conversation about it

68
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,430
Therefore, let's call here a special guest

69
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,230
From the international school of analists this person!

70
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,100
Please, come in!

71
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:06,640
International's School Analist

72
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:06,640
Oonishi Hideaki

73
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,710
He's Mr. Oonishi Hideaki

74
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,710
Good evening, it's a pleasure

75
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,580
This week, we welcomed the
international analist Oonishi Hideaki

76
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,120
That's so wrong.

77
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,020
So, now that you're there, first of all, about TPP

78
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,020
TN: Trans-Pacific Partnership.

79
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,220
Yes?

80
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:22,390
The previous chairman of the democratic party
council said that the TPP idea was like a ghost.

81
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,400
But regarding that "TPP is like a
ghost"... What do you think Mr. Oonishi?

82
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,240
An offensive...

83
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,740
Pressure...

84
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,310
is...

85
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,270
Uhm...

86
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,140
Panicked

87
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,880
and

88
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,080
Ended up turning into a ghost.

89
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,750
What does TPP stands for?

90
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,490
Daddy

91
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,330
Is in a pinch

92
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,100
While picking

93
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,770
While picking
