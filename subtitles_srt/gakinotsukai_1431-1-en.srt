1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,900
Third time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,170
Let's play with table games from around the world!!

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,740
So, this is our 3rd round, Matsumoto

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,790
Endo Shozo

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,790
Hamada Masatoshi

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,790
Matsumoto Hitoshi

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,790
Tanaka Naoki

8
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,790
Tsukitei Housei

9
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,670
Is there more?

10
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,810
Of course

11
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,790
The world's big

12
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,790
So of course we have tons left

13
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,660
There are still tons of fun games to do

14
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,320
Why when it comes to this corner

15
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,860
Do we have to completely rely on Tanaka, I mean

16
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,860
I never agreed on that

17
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,660
Tanaka learned the rules for each game from an expert beforehand

18
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,480
I thought so too

19
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,660
Why don't you just

20
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,420
Learn the rules yourself first?

21
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,130
No way I can take control of this

22
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,440
How much do you think I'll complain over that?

23
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,240
Don't underestimate me!!

24
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:40,240

00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:48,690
Choose the game which caught your interest between the collected games

29
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:48,690
From around the world and play it!!

30
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:48,690
Let's play with table games from around the world~!!

31
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,150
This time too

32
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,240
They'll experience the game which caught their interest

33
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,840
Between the collected items from around the world!

34
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,990
Germany - "Halli Galli"

35
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,990
Once 5 fruits are present on the table, ring the bell as quick as possible!

36
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,680
The first game Tanaka chose

37
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,810
Is "Halli Galli", from Germany!

38
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,220
Long story short

39
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,950
When 5 fruits are present

40
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,500
Quickly ring the bell

41
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,000
It's a speed card game

42
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,800
As you can see, there are 4 types of fruit on these cards

43
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,030
Just 4 of them?

44
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,970
Yes, just 4 types of fruit

45
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,170
And there are cards containing from 1 to 5 of them

46
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:10,870
And so

47
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,850
And let them down one by one

48
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,850
We'll distribute these cards

49
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,620
As soon as

50
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,620
their number counts 5 pieces, of any fruit

51
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,590
The same fruit must count a total of 5 pieces

52
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,080
So is this one already ok?

53
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,790
Well, this one is...

54
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,160
They're actually 6

55
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,050
Right, they're the same

56
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,160
It's here

57
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,780
As soon as they're 5, right?

58
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,930
Germany - "Halli Galli"

59
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,930
Ring the bell as soon as there are 5 of the same fruit on the table!

60
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,150
On that moment, yes

61
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If you let the cards down and notice there are 5 fruits

62
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,340
This is so easy!

63
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,040
Pretty easy, yeah

64
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,640
Yeah

65
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,930
I can see
- I told you!

66
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,200
All of us pressing it at once

67
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,130
I'm giving each of you 6 cards

68
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,840
That's how it begins

69
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,670
So it could happen we get 5
of them as soon as we start...

70
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,750
Remember you shouldn't look at your cards

71
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,090
Ok

72
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,340
'Cause if you see, you'll know

73
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,440
Are those mine?
- Yes

74
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,070
Do we flip em from the top?

75
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,720
Yes

76
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,640
Let's start

77
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:05,150
note: I won't translate name labels, the color scheme is always the same: Matsumoto Hamada Endo Tanaka Housei

78
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,210
Don, don, alright

79
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,660
This is so hard!!

80
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,450
Come on we just started

81
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,820
This one too, right?

82
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,030
You sum em all up
- All of them?

83
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,660
So hard!!

84
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,660
The same type?!

85
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,660
Yeah, it has to be the same

86
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,850
What--?

87
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,970
This one's good, right?

88
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,970
Endo got it
- Does it count?

89
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,880
Endo ring it first

90
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,740
I did

91
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,910
So, these cards now are all Endo's

92
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,990
Germany - "Halli Galli"

93
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,990
The first one to press the bell

94
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,990
gets all the cards lying on the table

95
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,980
WHAT?!

96
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,650
He gets em all?!    - Yes

97
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,680
Yeah, the first one to press it gets em

98
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,490
Also, once you lose all your cards, you're out

99
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,800
Germany - "Halli Galli"

100
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,800
If you lose all of your cards, you're out

101
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,390
And can't play

102
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,800
You shoulda said it before then!!

103
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,390
I didn't think they had any value!

104
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,340
Right

105
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,670
Ok, from Endo
- Alright, I'm going

106
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,250
Ah... I'm wrong

107
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,020
These are 7 fruits, right?

108
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,710
I messed up

109
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,020
That's from before

110
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,750
And what now?

111
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,220
You made a mistake

112
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,210
So now you have to give one card

113
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:15,260
Germany - "Halli Galli"

114
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:15,260
If you make a mistake, you have to give each player one of your cards

115
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,280
To each one of us

116
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,550
I think he's... already done     - WHAT?!

117
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,120
You're done

118
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,260
One card for each of us?    - There aren't enough

119
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,750
I'm getting these
- But... Endo?

120
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,220
He doesn't get yours
- So he's out?

121
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,700
Yeah, he can't play anymore

122
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,190
Can I start?

123
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,390
Sure, let's go

124
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:36,110
MATSUMOTO GETS THE CARDS

125
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,530
That's right

126
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,400
Yup

127
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,480
So he gets these?      - Yeah

128
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,870
Pile em up like that

129
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,470
So you won't see them
- I didn't realize

130
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,950
Me too

131
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,610
Anyway, let's go
- Alright

132
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,070
MATSUMOTO GETS THE CARDS

133
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,890
Man I'm good

134
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,830
Amazing

135
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,070
I'm killing it!

136
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,570
This guy

137
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,140
This guy

138
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,140
is strong !!

139
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,140
Matsumoto-san?

140
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,930
He's strong!
- He's so good at this!

141
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,430
He's good

142
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,380
ENDO GETS THE CARDS

143
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,600
Who was it?

144
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,910
Me of course    - You, right?

145
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,590
It became a challenge between me and Matsumoto

146
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,360
Oh, Hamada-san, you're out of cards, aren't you?

147
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,810
Why you didn't say it?

148
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,350
He didn't say it

149
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,580
Tanaka too is about to

150
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,030
If he drops that it's over

151
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,580
One, two...

152
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,350
Here goes your last card       - Yes

153
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,300
ENDO GETS THE CARDS

154
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,300
But now it's between them, right?

155
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,040
When only two players remain

156
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,040
they have one last round

157
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,040
Ok    - I see

158
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,330
From this, we'll se who wins    - Can we go?

159
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,940
Germany - "Halli Galli"

160
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,940
The one with most cards after the match, wins

161
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,940
The remaining two players will have one last round until one of them wins it

162
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,000
You can

163
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,150
They're almost even

164
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,250
Starting from who?

165
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,200
Yeah, from who?

166
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,940
Me?     - Ok, from Endo then

167
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,700
One, two...

168
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,480
note: red arrow: "PAY ATTENTION"

169
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,610
That's it, we're done!

170
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,480
He took 'em

171
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,350
You weren't supposed to!

172
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,820
He should have taken only that one
- Right

173
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,120
You should have taken only that one

174
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
And the one with most cards, wins

175
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,760
Now we can't make it clear anymore

176
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,530
The ones I got from Endo

177
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,530
were around this...

178
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,090
No way, no way

179
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,150
There were more of them

180
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,600
These are too few

181
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,940
A drawing game based on words you can enjoy even if you're bad at it!

182
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,940
France - "Duplik"

183
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,220
The next game

184
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,960
Is about words and drawings

185
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,290
Which you can enjoy without being good at it

186
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,940
It's "Duplik", from France!

187
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,500
One person describes this picture

188
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:28,660
- explain the theme of the picture on the given card only by talking

189
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:28,660
- you choose who explains the picture and who will draw it

190
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:28,660
France - "Duplik"

191
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:28,660
the other players will listen and draw by guessing it

192
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,770
The others will listen to his explanation

193
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,300
And just by hearing that

194
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,810
They have to draw it anew

195
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,880
Only with words?
- Only with words

196
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,910
It's kinda like an e-kaki-uta
- Yes

197
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,000
It's about how you draw will come out

198
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,350
For example

199
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,050
The narrator has this card

200
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:49,680
"4 maids"

201
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,620
What's this?

202
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,730
It's about 4 maids

203
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,700
I see
- You can see it

204
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,600
I'll have to explain this situation, like

205
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,300
"There are 4 maids"

206
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,270
"They're walking facing left"

207
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,370
"Each one is carrying something" etc.

208
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,870
And so, you start drawing while you listen to me

209
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,680
And so, you start drawing while you listen to me

210
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,120
After it, the 10 points hidden on the card's side will be revealed

211
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,120
France - "Duplik"

212
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,120
The time limit is 90 seconds

213
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,670
After drawing for
90 seconds, our time limit,

214
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,120
The 10 points hidden on the
card's right side will be revealed

215
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:06,360
France - "Duplik"

216
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:06,360
If you have a match with what's written in here, you score a point

217
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,010
It's not about your
drawing being good

218
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,280
The player who will fulfill
these points, will win!

219
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,630
Drawing:

220
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,630
Endo

221
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,630
Explaining:

222
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,630
Hamada

223
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,630
Housei

224
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,630
Matsumoto

225
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,630
Tanaka

226
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,090
Tanaka will be
the narrator

227
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,420
And the others
will draw the picture

228
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,900
Before you start, let me tell you our topic

229
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
The topic is
"Breakfast"

230
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:24,040
BREAKFAST

231
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:24,040
TOPIC:

232
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,260
Got it

233
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,010
"Breakfast"

234
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,500
So, I want you guys
to draw a breakfast picture

235
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,040
Of course, after I'll
explain it to you

236
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,800
Ok, let's go

237
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,710
So...

238
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,040
A man is sat behind a table and is having breakfast

239
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,980
His face is really unique

240
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,710
So, the man...

241
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,350
Is sitting on a chair and he's facing left

242
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,250
W--wait

243
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,850
He's holding a newspaper

244
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,690
Also, on the table...

245
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,190
There is a cup of coffee and some pancakes

246
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,690
On top of the pancakes

247
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,600
Something like butter is dripping

248
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,370
On the pancakes' left side

249
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,950
There's some healthy looking food in a box, maybe cereal or flakes

250
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,710
So, I already said his face is really unique...

251
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,910
But his most unique feature is his nose

252
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,750
Surprisingly...

253
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,750
You shoulda said it before!!

254
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,230
Surprisingly,

255
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,090
On his head...

256
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,590
There's a chicken on the man's head

257
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,190
About the newspaper he's reading...

258
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,330
The chicken seems to be taking a look at it too

259
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,610
On the outside

260
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,780
On the sky

261
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,100
You can clearly see the sun

262
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,200
So if you thought it was inside a house, it's probably outside

263
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,570
The man is also wearing a bow tie

264
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,570
And he's well-dressed in general

265
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,310
A nice looking steam is coming out from the coffee

266
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,890
So...

267
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,280
On the table...

268
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,200
There are these 3 types of food

269
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,690
And he probably hasn't cut his moustaches yet

270
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,430
Alright, we're done!

271
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,790
What?! Wait a second

272
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,660
I think I've missed the fact there are 3 types of food

273
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,240
Is that so?

274
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,530
That was too fast

275
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,600
He was fast, there were too many informations

276
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,530
First off
- Yes?

277
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,970
I'd like to show the picture

278
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,770
The picture was this one

279
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,380
How is it?

280
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,080
He's facing that way...

281
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,650
Yeah, the left side

282
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,880
I made him face the front

283
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,420
I think I've said everything I could

284
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,920
What are the 3 foods?

285
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,460
Pancakes and also some cereal-looking thing

286
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,020
That's the one I didn't hear

287
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,960
Let's start from Housei's drawing      - Ok

288
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,360
Let's see what he did

289
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,660
This is his nose

290
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,570
This sucks

291
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,370
There's the nose, the newspaper and the chicken

292
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,670
His 3 foods

293
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,010
Pancakes, cereals, coffee

294
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,940
Also the Sun

295
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,220
I got most points

296
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:49,870
Ok, Endo

297
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,340
Mine is like this

298
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,080
His nose is unique

299
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,420
It's not bad

300
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,820
The chicken is peeping at his newspaper too

301
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,060
But I only put the pancake in here...

302
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,930
There's no coffee

303
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,080
The coffee

304
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,620
No coffee
and cereals

305
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,260
No sun too

306
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,700
The sun is missing too

307
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,700
There is
not, yeah

308
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,720
Ready, Matsumoto?

309
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,330
Why do I have to be the last one?

310
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,800
That surely is an unique face

311
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,930
Yeah but...

312
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,180
But when I first start drawing
the man, I made him face the front

313
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,000
You put a lot in here!

314
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,620
That could make him get points
- Yes, definitely

315
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,720
I see he's holding the coffee,
but there are no cereals

316
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,790
I didn't draw the cereals

317
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,430
That's impressive!
- Yes I think that

318
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,000
This is probably the closest one in terms of mood

319
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,000
Ok but...

320
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,380
We still got the champion here...

321
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,560
You're right

322
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,990
I bet he made a copy of that
- I don't think I can win

323
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,830
Ready to show it to us, Hamada?

324
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,740
He's floating midair

325
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,740
A prison?

326
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,740
The hell is this?

327
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,980
One thing is for sure, the Sun is clearly there

328
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,980
I know, right?

329
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,970
It's clearly there

330
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,120
Such thick lines...
where's the chicken?

331
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,720
I forgot about the chicken

332
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,580
You forgot about it?!

333
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,720
I didn't hear that

334
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,250
How can you forget about it?

335
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,530
Where's the newspaper?

336
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,290
I haven't drawn the newspaper

337
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,150
How do we judge these?

338
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,290
How many points?

339
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,430
I'm going to read you the 10 points

340
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,020
The 10 points written on the card's side are about to be revealed

341
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,880
And so,

342
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,040
The 10 points written on the card's side are about to be revealed

343
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,630
It's time to reveal

344
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,630
The 10 points hidden
in the card!

345
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,770
First:

346
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,160
The man's nose

347
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,410
Is bigger than the chicken's beak

348
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,700
So subtle

349
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't have a chicken to begin with

350
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,370
From the start

351
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,570
You missed it

352
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,410
How could you forget about it?

353
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,380
Second:

354
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,190
The chicken is standing on the man's head

355
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,550
Again, I don't have it

356
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,760
No chickens again

357
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,480
Third:

358
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,630
About the man's ears...

359
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,850
You can only see one of them

360
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,650
I got this

361
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,920
They're two...       - Eh?!

362
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Did you say that?

363
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,430
Well, he's facing left
- That's 'cause he faces left

364
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,230
Got it?

365
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,070
Fourth:

366
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,670
There's some butter over the pancakes

367
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,700
I got this one, I got the butter

368
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Is that butter?

369
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,870
...Is that but---

370
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,240
Of course it's butter!

371
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,210
I mean, it kinda looks like a 3rd pancake...

372
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,880
Looks like a whirpool to me

373
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,850
What the heck?

374
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:11,850
Fifth:

375
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:17,060
The newspaper is placed higher than the cereal box

376
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,990
You mean up?
- Yes, if it's higher, it's ok

377
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:20,900
Alright

378
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,520
Sixth:

379
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,770
The man has moustaches

380
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,040
AlrightI got them on his jaw too
- Oh, it's ok, there are moustaches

381
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,460
Yours is so smooth

382
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,460
Not a single hair

383
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,300
He's smooth...
- Smoothly smooth

384
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,870
No moustaches, huh...

385
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,080
Seventh:

386
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,470
The man is holding a newspaper

387
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,310
Ok, he's holding it

388
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,410
Hamada the news--
- oh, he's not holding it

389
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,910
Not even on his table

390
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,360
I thought he would
draw em both huge

391
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,560
No newspaper at all...
- Are all the points about these?!

392
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,750
You missed em all

393
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,900
Come on, say something
about the bow tie

394
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,260
Well...

395
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,300
I think it'll be a point

396
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,060
The bow tie I mean
- Yes, I'm sure of it

397
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,660
Eighth:

398
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,730
The piled-up pancakes are
not placed inside a plate

399
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,230
They're not?!
- Wha-!

400
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,900
Whaddya mean?!

401
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,470
Was it like that?

402
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,640
They're bigger than the plate

403
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,640
You didn't say that, Tanaka

404
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,380
You did not

405
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,850
He didn't, yeah
- Not that one

406
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,850
I didn't talk about this, yeah

407
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,060
This is ok, right?

408
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,210
This is not a plate

409
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,420
What's that?

410
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,320
This...

411
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,130
It's a placemat

412
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,190
What!

413
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,960
He never mentioned this before!

414
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,170
I don't think someone who doesn't
use plates would have a placemat

415
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,040
He barely even spoke today

416
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,160
Ninth:

417
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,830
Some steam is coming out from the coffee

418
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,740
Finally

419
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Yes, I remember saying this one

420
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,340
Finally...

421
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,270
Did he say that...?

422
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,110
Tenth:

423
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,710
You can see the chicken's feathers

424
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,880
Feathers? Oh, here

425
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,380
Well, Hamada, you don't
have a chicken, so...

426
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,290
And it's over

427
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,880
Ok so, I scored 8 points

428
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,130
Me too, 8 points

429
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,850
I scored 6... can I see yours, Hamada?

430
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,590
Show it to us

431
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,060
He scored one point

432
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,130
How can he---?

433
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,040
Why didn't the bowtie come out?!

434
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,300
I guess the bowtie didn't come out

435
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,990
It's that...

436
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,170
Maybe it was to easy to remember
- It means it wasn't a point

437
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,170
I see...

438
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,600
Which one made you score your 1 point?

439
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,180
It was the steam
- The steam

440
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,970
Is that thing steam...?

441
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,770
Of course it's steam!

442
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,020
Something's strange

443
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,990
There are some parts seen from above

444
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,450
And other elements which are seen from the side

445
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,360
This table you draw

446
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,360
has a weird concept of space-time

447
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,360
space-time

448
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,380
You're right

449
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,360
It's distorted

450
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,730
It's distorted
- Amazing

451
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,500
Space-time is all distorted

452
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,500
Space-time is all distorted

453
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,070
That's what made it overall unpleasant

454
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,350
That's right

455
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,350
I've been thinking about what it could be

456
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,590
The answer was: space-time distortion!

457
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,840
The decisive match! Matsumoto vs Hamada

458
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,840
Now I feel relieved!

459
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,710
A one-vs-one competitive game!

460
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,710
France - "Gobblet Gobblers"

461
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,960
Next up

462
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,600
A one-vs-one battle game:

463
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,230
Gobblet Gobblers, from France!

464
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,810
I think you all did this as a kid

465
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,160
It's basically tic-tac-toe

466
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,950
France - "Gobblet Gobblers"

467
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,950
You win by making a row (horizontal ,vertical or diagonal)

468
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,950
In which you have to line up 3 items
horizontally, vertically or diagonally

469
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,840
I think I got it

470
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,450
Yes, as you can see

471
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,860
There are 3 pairs of pawns: small, medium and big

472
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,120
So, you...

473
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,530
You can use them to cover others?

474
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,530
That's right!

475
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,050
For example, the next person...

476
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,350
Places this here

477
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,000
And then the other does this

478
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,990
At this point he almost made
the row, so the next person

479
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,030
He can both put this one here

480
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,730
Or cover this?

481
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,570
Or cover that, yes
- I see

482
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,350
So you can cover them
- Exactly

483
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:33,050
- It is OK to place your bigger pawn over an opponent' s smaller one

484
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:33,050
-It is OK to move an already placed pawn wherever you want

485
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:33,050
France - "Gobblet Gobblers"

486
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,350
Also, if you've
placed a pawn

487
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,240
You can move it
and eat that of the opponent

488
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,950
You can do that too

489
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,050
Even if you're covering something?
- Yes, you can

490
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:40,520
FIRST MATCH

491
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:40,520
ROUND ONE

492
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,640
And so,

493
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,710
We'll have a tournament setting

494
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,680
First match: Housei vs Endo!

495
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,050
Alright, I'm going

496
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:42,780
Ok

497
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,150
Oh, you went for that?

498
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,720
So sudden

499
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,600
That's the boss

500
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,420
He used the boss

501
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,260
That way you can protect...

502
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,160
You can also move the one you've placed

503
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,670
Oh, is that so?
- Yes

504
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,730
This is complex
- It is

505
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,730
You can also move that one

506
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,310
Would have been better if you couldn't move em

507
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,170
It's an easy game, though

508
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,070
Is...?

509
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,050
Ah, Endo, that--

510
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,390
May I reconsider this move?

511
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,150
But you let go of your hand

512
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,350
That's it, man

513
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,850
You're so dumb

514
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,500
WINNER: HOUSEI

515
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,600
Endo...

516
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
"May I reconsider this move?"

517
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,030
Do you seriously think we'd allow that?

518
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,500
I knew you would lose first

519
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,180
ROUND ONE

520
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,180
SECOND MATCH

521
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,060
Next round

522
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,360
Is Matsumoto vs Hamada!

523
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,700
I guess I'll use this too

524
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,040
Of course that's it

525
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,140
That's probably the best move

526
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,210
I see...

527
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,560
I can move that one, right?       - Yes

528
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,090
You can move the ones you've placed

529
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,090
But one chance, right?

530
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,360
I mean, once per turn
- Yes

531
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,470
Damn, he got two bosses

532
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,740
He moved quite a lot
- Can he do that?

533
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,840
He can, he can move em how
many times he likes, wherever he likes

534
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
Oh, is that so

535
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,340
Yeah

536
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,310
That's why he moved it
- Yeah, otherwise he'd lose

537
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,240
What now?

538
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,150
Like that

539
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,890
That thing is traveling so much !!

540
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,890
You're only moving that!

541
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,080
He surely can move

542
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,180
Just that one

543
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,760
You're making it restless

544
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,270
The situation got severe

545
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,090
What would you do, Hamada?

546
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,540
You can't move that now
- I can't, true

547
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,940
I mean

548
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,180
That guy is doing everything by itself!!

549
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,680
You won't win like that!

550
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,380
He's not adding fighters to his army!

551
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,610
That's it

552
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,740
Nice move

553
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,660
Wonderful

554
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,990
Amazing, Hamada!

555
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:14,610
WINNER: HAMADA

556
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,790
That was great!

557
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,610
Well done Hamada, amazing!

558
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,900
Flawless

559
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,700
What!?

560
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,810
Hamada won

561
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,640
He must feel so embarrassed

562
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:26,180
I'm sorry!!

563
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,180
Cut this part off!!

564
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,250
I've completely forgot about it!!

565
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,380
I see now

566
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,760
The tournament's climax! Hamada vs Housei

567
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,640
What a great match

568
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,780
This game is fun!

569
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,800
FINAL ROUND

570
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,280
Our final Gobblet Gobblers match

571
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,520
Will be Housei vs Hamada!

572
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,520
I wonder how one can be good at this

573
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,960
Come on man, the huge one in the center again

574
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,690
It's going to become a trend

575
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,060
It's a must
- It is

576
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,500
It's pointless

577
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,110
You can feel the tension

578
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,310
This is a good match

579
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,090
This is going to sell well

580
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,420
It's fun
- It will sell

581
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,890
I don't have much moves left

582
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,900
Oh, I messed up

583
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,700
He finally noticed it!

584
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,540
You made it!

585
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:37,290
WINNER: HOUSEI

586
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,440
But it took him so much

587
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,040
So slow!    - Yeah

588
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,910
This guy is a mess too, but he's slow!

589
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,510
And then he was like "aaah!!"

590
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,640
He totally went "aaah!!"

591
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,220
That was fun

592
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,530
A balance game in which you have to take all the pieces!

593
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,530
Germany - "Bamboleo"

594
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,250
Our final game will be
Bamboleo, from Germany!

595
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:55,840
First, you place the cork ball over the black prop

596
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:55,840
Germany - "Bamboleo"

597
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:55,840
Then you place the board with the 27 pieces over it and make it stay still

598
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,790
First off, you place the
cork ball over the black prop

599
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,030
And over them,

600
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,330
You place the board with the
27 pieces of different shapes on it

601
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:03,410
Germany - "Bamboleo"

602
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:03,410
It's a balance game in which you take the pieces off the unstable board!

603
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,500
Each player will take 1 piece off
the unstable board per turn

604
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,000
It's a balance game!

605
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,870
It is already tilted!
- Yeah, I know

606
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,820
That means it's heavier on this side
- Exactly ,that's it

607
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,770
Should I start?

608
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,320
This looks harsh

609
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,580
I guess this one?

610
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,580
I think it's good
- Right?

611
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,100
THIS IS SO FUCKING HARD!!

612
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,710
This is way too fucking hard!!

613
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:41,710
A crazy difficult balancing game!!

614
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:48,250
One more time: Bamboleo Challenge

615
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,810
They regained control

616
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,510
And they'll try again
a Bamboleo challenge!

617
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,250
This time is tilted
on the other side

618
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,050
Yeah, this direction

619
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,420
You serious?

620
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,190
Go, Yama-chan

621
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,700
This is scary

622
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,750
This one, right?

623
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,230
For sure

624
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,210
Please...

625
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,600
Woah, it kept the balance

626
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,110
HOUSEI: CLEAR

627
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,430
Alright

628
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,430
Ok, he took it, but...

629
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,770
I see

630
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,370
That's true

631
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,880
It's bad for us

632
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,270
Imagine if it would
have ended here again

633
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,010
This one, right?

634
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,620
REMAINING:

635
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,010
This should be fine

636
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,760
I guess that's possible

637
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,270
MATSUMOTO: CLEAR

638
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,460
Nice move

639
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:39,270
REMAINING:

640
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,290
Must be this one

641
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,340
The farthest ones are risky
- I see

642
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,880
Maybe this

643
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,370
I want to keep playing...

644
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,710
Amazing

645
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,820
HAMADA: CLEAR

646
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,260
REMAINING:

647
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,010
You all picked up close ones

648
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,480
It's risky at this point

649
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,120
How about this?

650
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,220
The round one? I guess
that's the only one, may I?

651
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,660
Just go

652
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,100
And trust your guts

653
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,430
Ok, I'll take this

654
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,340
ENDO: CLEAR

655
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,800
That was good

656
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,920
Tanaka, Housei and Matsumoto clear their own's next round

657
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,130
After Endo

658
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:21,900
Tanaka,

659
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,900
Housei

660
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,110
And Matsumoto clear
each round successfully

661
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,050
Isn't it leaning too much
from this side?

662
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,920
REMAINING:

663
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,350
It's way too tilted

664
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,660
This is scary

665
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,160
I don't want it

666
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,160
to end like this today

667
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,220
Yeah but look

668
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,150
It's true it's too tilted

669
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,530
But isn't it even easier this way?
- Maybe

670
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,330
Is that so?
- It will withstand it

671
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:49,960
He made it

672
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,870
See? Told you

673
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,870
Alright...

674
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,510
HAMADA: CLEAR

675
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,930
I told you so

676
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,370
That was ok

677
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:02,520
Cautiously, they kept on taking pieces and collected 7 more of them!

678
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,320
After this,

679
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,520
They carefully kept on going

680
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,370
And took 7 more of them!

681
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:08,460
REMAINING:

682
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,010
This looks bad

683
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,790
This is bad

684
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,610
But maybe

685
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,460
Maybe I should take this....

686
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,750
Yeah, it could be

687
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,060
The middle one?

688
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,090
I think that just for this round, taking it won't be a problem

689
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,400
I think that just for this round, taking it won't be a problem

690
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,630
What really worries me is the

691
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,630
influence your move is gonna make

692
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,040
Don't worry Matsumoto, I'm positive you can do it

693
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,770
I'm sorry about this

694
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,770
and I know you'll all hate me because of this

695
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,160
Are you for real?

696
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,770
I'm leaving it to you, Matsumoto

697
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,500
Alright!

698
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,170
He made it

699
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,320
HOUSEI: CLEAR

700
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,900
He actually took it

701
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,610
He did it...     - Yeah

702
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,220
And now it gets hard

703
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,240
I can only see one possible choice

704
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,320
REMAINING:

705
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,650
I'm going for this, it's the only one

706
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,480
It won't fall

707
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,520
I think that one is fine

708
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,990
See?

709
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,670
MATSUMOTO: CLEAR

710
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,190
Amazing!

711
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,260
What now?

712
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,670
That was
amazing

713
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:01,710
Hamada, Endo, Tanaka and Housei clear their own's round

714
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,260
After him

715
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,830
Hamada,

716
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,600
Endo,

717
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,230
Tanaka

718
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,100
And Housei win their round

719
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,780
There are only 6 pieces left

720
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:11,580
REMAINING:

721
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,310
But wait, isn't this easy after all?

722
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,580
It has to be the nipple

723
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,880
I think this is probably hard

724
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,810
I mean, those two are pressing the board down

725
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,110
If you took one from
this side, it will tilt more

726
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,050
Yes, it will

727
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,690
Yes?

728

Huh?

730
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,660
That's not what I---

731
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,990
Well, we told ya

732
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,760
