1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,460
Yanaoka (director) seems to like this theme very much

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,960
-Yanaoka is the one who likes it?
-Yeah, Yanaoka loves this

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,890
-I see
-Yeah

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,740
And Cocorico is on fire with this theme

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,160
No, we're not on fire

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,740
We're just always getting the joker

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,000
No, no, we're not

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,170
We wanted to show off our senses to the audiences

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,050
But then Cocorico takes all the attention

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,510
-Yeah, you're right
-Well, that's true

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,910
-I didn't get the joker for even once
-Yeah, not even once

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,110
And this is already the third time

13
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,970
Let's welcome the bunny girl

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,590
I see, so not even once

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,810
I even got it once

16
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,390
Hey, too fast, that's too fast

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,410
You didn't even look at her face

18
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,770
At least look at her face first

19
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,530
So better look from above right?

20
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,600
Yeah, that's too fast

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Subbed by Appieopie, more episodes at

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,600
The highly praised theme "Gaki Jiji-nuki"

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,610
Each card has a different question on it

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,620
The rule is the same as Old maid,
you win if you have no more cards left

25
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,630
But if you lose, you'll need to perform
based on the instructions of the last card

26
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,070
Let's decide the dealer first

27
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,410
Let me spin the roulette, alright?

28
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,350
Yeah, go ahead

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,740
You haven't spun it before

30
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,730
No no no no...

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,490
Not even spun one grid

32
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,370
I thought I would at least spin one grid

33
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,150
That doesn't even count as a Boke

34
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,280
That is unexpected

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,740
-Finally spinning the wheel
-That is how it should be

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,520
Come on, it's still Tanaka

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,350
Always these two

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,040
-We can't look at it right?
-Yeah, we can't

39
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,660
Ready?

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,660
I hate this...

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,490
No one wants to be punished before the 60th birthday

42
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,530
We should be having a celebration instead

43
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,780
Indeed

44
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,670
-All animals...
-Yes you're right

45
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,460
This time, the theme is

46
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,030
To mimic the sound of animals' shouting for real

47
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,320
It is all spread out

48
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,830
All spread out!

49
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,820
-For real?
-Yes, it should be real

50
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,450
Not the kind of fooling around with kids?

51
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,650
Be serious

52
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,390
Be so realistic that the animals may even gather around right?

53
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,200
So real that it may even attract female animals over?

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,360
Yes, be serious

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,310
Indeed, I was giggling when I see these cards

56
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,820
OK. let's get going!

57
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,800
Got it

58
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Hey, it only took short moment

59
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,260
I didn't know how to do it for this one

60
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,270
Sheep?

61
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,920
Well, well, well...

62
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,090
Yeah, it has to be a serious yell

63
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,090
Yeah, a serious one

64
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,980
The kind of yell which attracts females

65
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,050
Very few cards left for Yama-chan, less likely to lose

66
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,890
So many cards!

67
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,280
I really hope to match this

68
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,620
Yeah, got it!

69
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,230
This one

70
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,120
I actually didn't want to do this one too

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,900
Well, yeah

72
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,570
This one is not wanted either

73
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,280
I see

74
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,370
During first half, all members smoothly assembled same two cards

75
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,850
So that's a wolf

76
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,270
Well, what about this?

77
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,700
I would say it is just fine

78
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,530
Yeah, relatively speaking

79
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,980
In comparison to the others

80
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,230
Did you keep peeping at my cards like crazy?

81
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,560
Those cards were picked by me, you have been peeping for a while, right?

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,720
Seriously, I didn't peep those cards

83
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,530
Alright

84
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,670
All due to peeping before?

85
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,810
You've peeped, right?

86
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,150
I only got these cards left

87
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,930
-Everybody only got a few cards left
-I still have four cards

88
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,990
Come on, just let Hamada do it

89
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,840
Actually having more or few cards doesn't really matter

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,890
-Yeah
-Of course that is how it should be

91
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,950
Why is this card sticking out?

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,620
Trying to seduce you

93
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,620
Everyone, good to have this one paired up right?

94
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,400
Which means I'm done!

95
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,000
-That is great
-What? Is that real?

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,720
That's amazing

97
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,960
-You're so strong
-Why on earth is that?

98
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,190
Come!

99
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,410
Oh yes, it came

100
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,720
For real?

101
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,410
-It is goat!
-Don't want a goat too

102
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,950
I have to match it this round

103
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,800
Ugh, it is first time seen again!

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,180
First time seen this?

105
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,990
I definitely don't want to do this one

106
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,350
Got a couple?

107
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,830
Got it!

108
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,130
Eh?

109
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,630
-No way
-So happy

110
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,710
So happy

111
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,980
This means that...

112
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,360
Yeah, I'll win if this one matches

113
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,700
If not matched...

114
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,890
Just wait a moment

115
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,400
I see

116
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,630
It probably won't match

117
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,790
Yeah, I hope so too...

118
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,980
Probably it takes another round back and forth

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,250
Yeah, lion pair

120
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,680
Hamada wins

121
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Then, Tanaka loses for sure

122
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,130
Though certain but which animal?

123
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:20,230
You need to make us think that this animal is actually in the studio today

124
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,920
I am going to draw the card

125
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,440
Well, the couple is cat

126
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,310
Which means

127
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,160
What?

128
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,030
Tiger!

129
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,790
Be serious

130
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,260
This is quite tough

131
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,000
That's like the High tension theme

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,440
And ranked number 10

133
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,960
That is ranked number 10

134
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,270
Not good enough

135
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,200
I have seen this before

136
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,390
That's terrible

137
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,210
The theme is different

138
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,920
Tanaka, cool down, cool down first

139
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,320
This is just awful

140
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,060
It's like watching some boring zombie movie

141
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,000
A really boring one

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,910
An exceptionally disappointing zombie movie

143
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,390
I know that feeling. I was like that just now?

144
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,900
That's the worst, that's terrible

145
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,600
-I'll spin it now
-Okay

146
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,560
I'm gonna spin it a lot

147
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,960
Come on, it's Endo!

148
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Seriously what's happening?

149
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,740
It has been these two folks all the time

150
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,660
Matsumoto-san, looking to you!

151
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,240
I won't see it either

152
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,190
-Did you flip it?
-Yes

153
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,780
-I want to do that too, you know?
-Yeah, yeah

154
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,260
I actually wanted to shout as a tiger

155
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,700
The next Jiji-nuki theme is

156
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,590
To improvise and compose something based on the characters on these cards

157
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,080
So it's this pattern again

158
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,700
-Yes, there's various artists
-It's all spread around

159
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,470
This time the theme is to compose an original new song

160
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,430
-Eh?
-That's impossible, seriously

161
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:14,590
Improvise a new song for these famous musicians on the cards and do Cappella

162
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,420
-This is too hard
-That's just ridiculous

163
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,170
Start the game right away

164
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:24,630
This time we ask everyone to predict the joker as well

165
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,220
-You only got 3 cards
-Yeah, 3 cards

166
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,730
There is always some comments every time

167
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,730
Ugh! That many cards?

168
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,610
Super many cards, is that real?

169
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:41,040
Well, based on past experience, people with many cards eventually win

170
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,410
Well, but...

171
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,600
Eh, none?

172
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,010
Eh, really?

173
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,500
How come...

174
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,800
Ah, I'm so sorry

175
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,620
Didn't say this until now...sorry!

176
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,430
Please listen to me...

177
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,370
I have cards in couple

178
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,370
He should really be punished, right?

179
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,170
Yeah

180
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,100
After playing tiger, my brain is full of blank

181
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,140
-You should know when you see it in the beginning
-Yes it is, though it is

182
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,290
Saying your mind went blank and tiger is a pun of white tiger

183
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,830
-You're not allowed to say those puns
-Like the "Kitano-san" you said before

184
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,930
Like your "Kitano-san"

185
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,250
This card came so many times

186
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,360
It came so many times

187
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,210
Don't say "Kitano" dude

188
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,930
I did the same thing last time

189
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,550
Can't escape from my radar

190
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,610
Please excuse me for this

191
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,930
Furthermore, it's Ei-chan

192
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,220
Not exactly understand what it means by "furthermore" though

193
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,330
Alright? I will just draw the card

194
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,260
-Hamada-san's turn
-Really?

195
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,420
I haven't drawn the card yet

196
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,610
Yes you did

197
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,200
I said "no matching cards yet"?

198
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,560
And you said "sorry"

199
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,030
Though I really didn't draw any card, anyway forget it

200
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,250
It is not about "forget it"

201
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,160
Alright, this one

202
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,060
This is it

203
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,770
Who is this?

204
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,770
Nakajima Miyuki-san

205
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,380
-Perhaps it is considered a good one
-Yes, I would think so

206
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,840
After that

207
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,480
This is difficult in another sense

208
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,140
Thank you very much

209
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,260
Yonezu Kenshi-san

210
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,840
-I don't know about him
-I don't know either

211
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,060
This is very tricky

212
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,210
What about this one?

213
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,910
(Matsuda Seiko)

214
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,340
Yes, I feel it is good

215
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,230
Quite difficult

216
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,070
Really?

217
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,050
Well, because it is female

218
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,820
It looks like those difficult ones are avoided one by one

219
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,390
The outcome could be out pretty soon but...

220
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,900
Let me finish it

221
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,050
12 minutes after the game was started

222
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,780
-First time..
-Ugh even until now?

223
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,120
So far no one has won

224
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,310
The person that breaks the balance is

225
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,630
If can't decide, just pick the middle one!!

226
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,310
It is quite loud, these two gentlemen

227
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,660
Yeah, that was so loud

228
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,580
Coming!

229
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,430
*(Card) Mori Shinichi

230
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,430
The first to win

231
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,080
Hamada wins

232
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,720
That's awesome

233
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,320
Endo must had want to do this one

234
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,640
*(Card) Mori Shinichi

235
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,890
Well, on the opposite, it's actually shy to do this one

236
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,360
Opposite?

237
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,150
How far are you away?

238
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,040
15 mintues later

239
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,650
Come on, I'm sick of this

240
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,210
I'm enough of this

241
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,210
This is enough

242
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,180
It is the first time for this person to come

243
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,830
Come on, really? Really?

244
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,640
Please, please

245
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,030
Oh, this again

246
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,090
Matsumoto-san wins if he can match this

247
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,900
I don't want to sing!

248
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,490
Pick one

249
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,180
If not sure, just pick the middle one!!

250
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,360
Is this the tiger just now?

251
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,560
Let's see, is it coming?

252
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,110
Oh no, it's not

253
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,980
This is the first time seen

254
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,790
Here comes the first-time seen

255
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:04,380
18 minutes after the game starts

256
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,710
Now, the cards at hand for 4 players are as the above

257
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,370
And among those

258
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,740
These three cards are tricky ones

259
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,790
Which one is joker?

260
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,660
Please, please, please!

261
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,730
I really don't want to sing

262
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,500
Enough is enough!

263
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,580
Super difficult!

264
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,310
Yama-chan, Yama-chan, let's game over after your drawing

265
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,280
I will finish the game, please!

266
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,420
-Oh yes!
-Really?

267
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,980
It's Julie

268
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,890
Matsumoto-san if you can get this one

269
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,800
Yeah right, my turn to draw, right?

270
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,960
-Only got this card now
-After drawing this card...

271
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,670
Matsumoto-san if you can get this one

272
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,910
Yeah right, my turn to draw, right?

273
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,900
Only got this card now

274
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,030
It will become the Cocorico battle again though

275
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,680
Please! sincerely, really sincere

276
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,940
Coming, coming

277
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,020
Please, please

278
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,990
Get the right one, get the one

279
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,770
This one right? This one right?

280
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,820
Please, please, really sincere

281
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,940
Feeling good, feeling great!

282
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,240
Bravo!

283
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,090
It is fortunate you got that one

284
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,380
This is really incredible

285
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,280
This card will be granted to Takana-san unconditionally

286
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,650
This card...

287
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,290
If this card matches then game finished

288
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,250
This card was here since the beginning

289
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,490
I was really worried about this card

290
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,430
Let's finish with this card

291
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes, let's get it done with this card

292
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,610
Oh please, here comes the card

293
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,450
No, no

294
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,500
-Please!
-No!

295
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,720
Not the right card!!

296
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,760
So weak

297
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,810
What is the matter? You two have been several rounds back and forth

298
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,900
Good, good

299
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,760
-This time Shozo will pick the card
-Yes

300
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,150
Please! please! please! please!

301
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,870
Pick one

302
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,960
Which one could it be?

303
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,750
I'll pick this one

304
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,190
Go, go!

305
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,010
Get it, get it!

306
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,380
Oh yes!!

307
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,580
It's Yosui Inoue-san, and this card will be given to Tanaka-san

308
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,220
Can you show us those 2 cards?

309
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,910
So it's Nagabushi-san or TUBE

310
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,720
Let's turn this card and see which one is this

311
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,580
-Must start right away
-Yeah, you must start singing right away

312
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,580
Think about it now in your mind

313
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,770
-Come up with a plan now
-Yes, yes, yes

314
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,060
-Must start right away
-Yeah

315
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,750
So it's Nagabushi Tsuyoshi's new song

316
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,860
*Nagabuchi Tsuyoshi was sometimes called a "gangster" due to his appearance and the roles he played in dramas

317
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,860
Was called little gangster

318
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,710
Aren't you even mindful with that?

319
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:56,650
Take a piss, and come up with this weird style?

320
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:03,960
What do you think about this Japan?

321
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,140
All full of pee

322
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:16,900
Towards tomorrow, let's run

323
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,150
Wonderful!

324
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,770
Really? Really?

325
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,490
-This is great
-Thanks god

326
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,620
-He lost because he cheated in the beginning right?
-Yeah, God is watching

327
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,880
So that's why I lost

328
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,860
So as a punishment, your singing scene needs to be cut

329
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,950
Because it was funny

330
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,440
Perhaps just mute it?

331
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,870
It will be muted

332
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,960
Only with mouth gestures like "paku-paku"

333
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,660
No way

334
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,080
People will think "What's the matter with Tanaka? Why is he mumbling?"

335
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,410
So strict

336
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,610
Because it was funny

337
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,600
Isn't that great? Is there anything not feasible?

338
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,910
Cut, just cut anything funny

339
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,160
One more round?

340
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,480
Yes, the last one

341
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,850
-The last one is Batsu game
-This one is annoying

342
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:07,090
The last Jiji-nuki theme will be Batsu game

343
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,360
The punishment for this round, is the classic nose hook

344
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,690
Now the game starts

345
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,120
These four cards are quite subtle

346
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,970
Only got these cards?

347
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,030
Yes, I got 4 cards

348
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,480
This is quite awful...

349
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,800
These punishments are quite lame

350
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,090
*(Card) Stick your tongue to the fan

351
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,090
Hey no, this is absolutely no way

352
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,580
Some are absolutely not possible, right?

353
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,020
Yeah

354
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,710
Like are you joking?

355
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,220
This card

356
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,340
Ah, none

357
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,580
This one right

358
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,630
You got it?

359
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,220
Yes, got the matching card

360
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,390
*(Card) Eating raw meat

361
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,390
And this one is just insane

362
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,360
(Eating raw meat)

363
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,440
Actually this is could be the better ones right?

364
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Eh? Really?

365
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,390
You got it?

366
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,450
Seems to have seen something

367
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,800
-Oh, looks like got something
-Good for you

368
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,600
This one was annoying too, look

369
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,760
Pinch the tongue

370
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,380
-No way
-Dislike this very much

371
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,380
Please, anything else?

372
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,880
*(Card) Freaking hot tofu skin

373
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,880
Eh, what the heck is this?

374
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,490
Don't come to grab dude, not ready

375
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,020
Tidy here

376
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,950
Hurry up dude!!

377
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,340
So difficult

378
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,830
-So difficult
-This is one set

379
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,450
Yeah, I noticed this too, this conversation is becoming a set

380
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,810
The sensor devices for you two have activated

381
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,350
Ah, what is this?

382
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,350
*(Card) Skull bowling

383
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,350
What is this about? Damn

384
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,440
Let's just time it

385
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,190
Yeah

386
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,430
The one with the most cards lose

387
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,370
Last one minute

388
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,610
That's too fast!!

389
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,850
Too fast, one minute left

390
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,080
And I have disadvantage with so many cards at hand

391
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,500
His Tsukommi is also on fire today

392
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,690
Right?

393
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,650
Saying like "Too fast!"

394
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,970
No, please stop mocking me

395
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,290
After that

396
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,360
Oh!

397
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,300
These two cards match

398
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,330
-Bicycle on top of forehead
-This is good news

399
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,690
Tanaka-san with only 3 cards left, everyone got his hands ready

400
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,330
And now, the joker card starts action

401
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:40,010
*(Two cards) Nose hook bottle and Nose hook floating

402
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:40,010
No, no, no, no, not this one! Though these two cards look alike

403
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,450
Really, let me win this time!

404
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,760
Wow here it comes again

405
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,140
Here it comes again, comes again

406
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,440
When not able to decide, pick the middle one

407
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,600
Don't know what you are talking about

408
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,330
Yee, it comes back again

409
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,640
(Nose hook bottle)

410
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,690
It's back

411
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,940
Recommending this card

412
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,670
No no no no

413
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,270
-No way dude
-I didn't see this card

414
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,680
-Really?
-Just based on feeling

415
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,250
What difference does this make?

416
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,330
(Nose hook)

417
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,660
*(Two cards) Nose hook bottle and Nose hook floating

418
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,660
What is the difference?

419
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,830
There are such kinds of cards, right?

420
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,690
Feeling like "what's the difference between these two cards?"

421
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,490
I will take care of this

422
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,690
Just let Tanaka do it, I really want Tanaka do it

423
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,830
-Come!
-No way

424
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,690
Don't match please!

425
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,820
Lying right?

426
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,000
He has no understanding of how to be funny

427
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,480
There is slight difference though

428
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,730
-Slight difference
-The same skull bowling

429
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,670
Oh yes!

430
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,770
If it goes that way, we won't be good

431
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,290
But Matsumoto-san never got the joker right?

432
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,210
I don't want to do the Batsu game,
anyone can do it and it'll just be the same

433
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,080
Please

434
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,290
Damn it! Doesn't look good

435
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,020
Put it down, put it down

436
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,140
This sucks

437
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,900
Please, not like that

438
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,530
Oh, I can see this, this one

439
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,020
Really? No way, no way.

440
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,420
It's this one right? The two cards that
make you think "what's the difference"

441
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,780
Like stay home and homestay

442
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:28,220
Come on, please, let me pick the right card

443
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,730
Let's see

444
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,190
Please don't

445
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,650
*(Card) Sumo wrestler press

446
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,650
Ah, come on, not this one!

447
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,260
Thanks god

448
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,600
When is this going to end?

449
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
I want to win, I want to win!

450
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,380
Want to win

451
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,380
End it here

452
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,680
Why? Not this one

453
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,020
It is about time to finish

454
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,460
Otherwise it is not in good shape

455
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,370
About time to end!

456
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,430
Let me win!

457
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,110
I saw this one before!

458
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,110
It's not ending at all

459
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,780
Yeah, it's not ending

460
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,270
Come on

461
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,270
This is a good chance for you

462
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:11,430
I really think Downtown should just do it

463
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,190
Pick the middle one intentionally!

464
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,110
Hmm, did the same just now

465
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,910
What the heck is this?

466
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:22,040
Not right, definitely not this card with so many white space

467
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,660
Huh?

468
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,250
It shows up again!

469
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:31,160
That homestay and stay home thing

470
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,220
Totally different though

471
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,540
The meaning is different

472
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,960
About to draw, put it down

473
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,240
Hurry up

474
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,110
Let's see

475
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,520
Would like to win here

476
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,610
Not even sure if he has my cards though

477
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,990
Yeah, don't know if the card has switched back

478
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,840
Pick the first card on top

479
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,510
Oh, come on, what?

480
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,680
This is a really long offense and defense

481
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,510
Please, enough

482
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,790
Please, please, this is enough

483
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,680
Just let Downtown try once

484
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,950
No way!

485
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,280
That's definitely unforgivable

486
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,560
That's just definitely unforgivable

487
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,920
No no no no, so

488
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,980
That's absolutely no way!

489
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,880
I actually matched it, yet continued playing

490
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,330
Eh, what do you mean?

491
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,600
That's scary

492
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,260
Let's watch replay once more

493
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,870
Hamada should had win for picking Matsumoto-san's nose hook card

494
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,590
What the heck is this?

495
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,450
However, although the cards actually matched

496
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,930
Hamada continued to play the game

497
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,780
Just let Downtown-san do it

498
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,160
No way!

499
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,260
You saw the card after picking it from Matsumoto-san right?

500
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,400
And it matches so you should just put it down

501
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,920
I thought there is no matching so put out 3 cards

502
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,140
This absolutely deserves punishment, right?

503
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,240
Hey, why?

504
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,010
Batsu game!

505
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,500
This has no choice

506
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,880
This is really shocking

507
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,080
I've been doing this so many times

508
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,420
Your favorite

509
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,220
There's still zero bottle though

510
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,570
Eh, zero bottle?

511
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,120
Yes, zero bottle

512
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,520
It's already hooked quite a lot though

513
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,100
The rocket start is awful

514
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,330
He's stretching his legs

515
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,780
-One bottle now
-That's cheating

516
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,490
I would like to eat dinner while watching this

517
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,420
Such dinner show would be nice

518
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,110
Alright, now with second bottles in

519
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,450
With the third bottle

520
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,860
The posture has totally changed

521
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,570
From the third bottle, it is strengthening

522
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,090
Can see inside quite a bit

523
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,710
Yes, not bad, not bad!

524
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,440
-Hold on to it
-It's going to break, it is breaking!

525
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,120
My nose is breaking apart, stop!

526
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,200
Stop!

527
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,710
Scary! Scary! Scary!

528
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,870
It is going to break here!

529
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,760
Very very painful!

530
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,440
-Okay, enough
-Finish

531
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,850
No way, no way

532
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,470
-Oh, fun game!
-That hurts

533
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,300
What had you confirm about after drawing from my cards

534
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,470
Yeah?

535
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,690
Why didn't I notice it?

536
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,470
He must be shocked

537
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,160
The cameraman

538
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,960
He must had wanted to say it

539
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,820
Just tell me then, dude!

540
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,860
He must be thinking "what's happening?"

541
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:39,230
All he can do is to slowly blur the focus

542
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,110
To be considerate

543
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,840
Yeah, blur the focus to be considerate
