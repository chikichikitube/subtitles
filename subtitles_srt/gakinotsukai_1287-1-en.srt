This show has run for a long time,

but even this show doesn't show

20
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,600
all the videos that are recorded, so

21
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,600
but even this show doesn't televise

22
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,600
This time, we thought we could show

23
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,270
This time, we thought we could show

24
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,270
everyone one of those unseen videos.

25

26

Last year, on New Year's Eve, 24 Hour Absolutely No Laughing Detectives was broadcasted.

35
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,590
There's a never before seen video that wasn't shown during the program

36
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,590
What will that video be?

37
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,360
At the time it was recorded, there was a video that wasn't shown.

38
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,590
What will that video be?

39
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,950
Endo's Verification Prank Video.

40
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,890
Endo's Verification Prank Video.

41
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,560
My prank video?

42
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,130
Yes.

43
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,160
Eh?

44
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,160
They recorded that?

45
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,930
Yes, they recorded that.

46
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,300
You can feel how the mood changed...

47
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,130
Wait a minute...

48
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,130
What's this about?

49
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,160
The mood really changed.

50
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,840
My prank video?

51
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,630
You have no idea?

52
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,300
I have a faint idea.

53
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,040
I remember there was one show where I felt

54
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,040
something was wrong.

55
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,400
At the end of the year.

56
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,400
Yeah.

57
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,300
It was before the end of the year.

58
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,160
Between October and November?

59
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,160
It was around October, right?

60
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,530
Well, I don't know if that's it.

61
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,120
I really tried my best in that show.

62
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,320
Nico Nico Douga. You had a show, right?

63
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,530
There was Nico Nico Douga.

64
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,320
Nico Nico Douga. You had a show, right?

65
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,190
With Nico Nico Douga, we had

66
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,190
Something like a big discussion.

67
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,630
It was a show.

68
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,800
And they had you?

69
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,030
I was a part of the show, but I thought it was strange.

70
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,800
It was a bunch of super smart people and a super dumb guy!

71
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,300
It was a bunch of super smart people and a super dumb guy!

72
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,860
He straight-up said it.

73
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,840
I kept wondering why.

74
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,830
That was the point.

75
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,030
No, I mean, it was...

76
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,460
The place was just...

77
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,700
I didn't know what was going on.

78
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,700
Something like that.

79
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,980
Well, Endo...

80
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,980
You felt strange?

81
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,160
It felt very strange.

82
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,990
But we're watching it today so,

83
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,990
it couldn't have been that bad, right?

84
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,390
Ah, we haven't watched the video yet, but...

85
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,620
What what we heard from some of the staff was that

86
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,160
there were very few laughs,

87
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,800
Wait a minute.

88
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,160
that's what they said.

89
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,930
Let's just stop this right now.

90
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,130
This is gonna bomb.

91
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,900
But they're not zero, not zero.

92
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,640
I don't want to go through that.

93
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,440
So this is my fault!?

94
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
It's your prank video.

130
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,500
The three duties that Endo wrote are these.

131
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,060
Life, Meal, Home

132

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,360
He's been acting like he's smart.

143
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,740
I wasn't acting smart.

144
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,640
Is that information correct!?

145
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,630
But is this information correct!?

146
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,650
How far can Endo keep acting smart!?

147
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,650
Thorough Verification

148
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,500
So this time, we'll conduct a thorough verification to see

149
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,700
how far Endo can keep acting smart.

150
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:30,090
A Fake Discussion Show was prepared

151
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:30,090
A Fake Discussion Show was prepared

152
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:30,090
Talking about Japan's future

153
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:30,090
Talking about Japan's future

154
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,060
Without delay, we cooperated with Nico Nico Douga and prepared

155
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,360
a fake discussion show that would talk about Japan's future.

156
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Athlete

157
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Former Hostess

158
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Former METI member

159
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Former NHK announcer

160
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Hojo Kayo

161
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Hori Jun

162
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Kimura Masaki

163
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Kishi Hiroyuki

164
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
NEET

165
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Sakurayuki

166
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Takei So

167
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,060
Underground Idol

168
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,100
These six collaborators were tasked with confronting smart Endo.

169
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,630
I see.

170
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,700
Recording Day

171
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,700
Clueless Endo enters the Green Room

172
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,830
No problem.

173
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,830
Excuse me.

174
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,300
The green room was really far.

175
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,020
Quickly going through the show's script

176
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,360
Excuse me, do you think

177
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,360
we could have a little meeting?

178
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,600
Ah, sure, please.

179
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:11,130
ask him about a certain social problem

180
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:11,130
Our accomplice, the director will

181
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,200
First, one of our accomplices, the director, will ask him about a certain social problem.

182
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,730
I think I'd like to talk about the TPP.

183
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,530
Well, there's (all kinds of) other points of view

184
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,540
It's a big problem for farmers,

185
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,540
for everything made in Japan.

186
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,040
because they're cheaper.

187
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,040
Like people buying things from overseas

188
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,180
They were expensive because of taxes but,

189
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,180
without taxes, people will buy those instead.

190
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,420
People who think "I'll buy Japanese products"

191
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,420
will now think "maybe I'll buy Japanese products."

192
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:43,560
Endo starts acting smart using

193
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:43,560
all the knowledge he has.

194
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,200
As expected, Endo uses all his knowledge on the subject,

195
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,130
I'm not acting.

196
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,130
I'm not acting smart.

197
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,500
and suddenly begins acting smart.

198
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,100
I wasn't trying to act smart.

199
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,500
So that's how it's gonna go.

200
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,770
Kishi, Endo, and Takei,

201
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,070
You're all used to being on TV

202
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,070
so you'll be fine, however

203
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,710
There's the NEET guy and the idol,

204
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,710
and the former hostess...

205
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,580
There's gonna be things they won't know so

206
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,680
we might switch (the subject) over to you.

207
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,050
Right, it's fine.

208
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:18,260
Former Hostess

209
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:18,260
Hojo Kayo

210
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:18,260
Kimura Masaki

211
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:18,260
Masked Idol

212
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:18,260
NEET

213
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:18,260
Sakurayuki

214
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,130
However, there's something Endo doesn't know.

215
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:18,430
These three collaborators are actually very smart members.

216
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,740
The Masked Idol is an idol enrolled at Todai

217
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,100
The masked idol is actually an idol enrolled at the University of Tokyo.

218
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,530
Now I get it.

219
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,140
Former Hostess is a Kyoto U graduate and social studies writer

220
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,230
The former hostess is actually a Kyoto University graduate and social studies writer.

221
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,230
That's how it is.

222
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,650
The NEET is a young man knowledgeable on social problems

223
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,530
And the NEET youth is very knowledgeable on social problems.

224
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,130
What about this guy?

225
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,860
I see.

226
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:44,890
Gradually, the three will reveal their intellect

227
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:44,890
Gradually, the three will reveal their intellect

228
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:44,890
How will Endo react!?

229
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:44,890
How will Endo react!?

230
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,800
As the show continues, they will gradually reveal their true intellect.

231
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,660
What will be Endo's reaction when that happens?

232
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:52,060
Clueless Endo heads to the studio

233
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,130
Clueless Endo heads to the studio where the recording will take place.

234
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:57,240
The Fake Show Starts!

235
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,830
At last, the fake show starts.

236
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,440
Politics, economics, medicine, sports

237
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,440
All kinds of topics are discussed here at "Gendai Nippon"*

238
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:06,810
*"Gendai Nippon" = Modern (Current) Japan

239
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,310
We begin the year 2016.

240
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,440
We've gathered controversialists who will talk

241
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,440
about Japan's troubling future.

242
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,750
A passionate discussion with our seven samurai of the future.

243
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,760
He's trying to...

244
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,280
A passionate discussion with our seven samurai of the future.

245
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,080
Hori Jun

246
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,080
Host

247
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,080
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

248
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,380
I'm your host, Hori Jun. Thank you.

249
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,580
put on a smart face.

250
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,600
Thank you.

251
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,400
Looks like it.

252
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,500
Raising his mouth like that.

253
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,790
Now,

254
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,520
I'd like to introduce all of our samurai of the future.

255
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
First, a former member of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry,

256
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,860
who has recently made appearances in news and other kinds of programs as a commentator.

257
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,430
Former METI member

258
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,430
Kishi Hiroyuki

259
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,430
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

260
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,520
Professor at Keio University's graduate school,

261
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,430
Kishi Hiroyuki.

262
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,900
Thank you for having me.

263
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,840
There were many things to discuss about 2015, but...

264
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,280
First thing I'd like to ask is,

265
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,510
is Japan's future bright or dark?

266
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,280
is Japan's future bright or dark?

267
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,940
I've come to the conclusion that it's dark.

268
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,880
I've come to the conclusion that it's dark.

269
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,870
Economics is my specialty, I know that

270
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,050
to make the future bright, things like

271
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,490
"Increasing the rate of economic growth" and

272
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,490
"Figuring out financial reform" are both needed.

273
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,950
Abenomics depends

274
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,950
too much on monetary easing,

275
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,960
and such an important thing as

276
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,960
raising productivity can't be done.

277
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,900
We have financial reform and many consumption

278
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,360
You're acting smart.

279
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,900
tax increases but no results or reductions at all.

280
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,330
He's just nodding.

281
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,600
I can't say the future is very bright.

282
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,600
With the way it is,

283
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,720
Right from the start we have somber comments.

284
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,110
Representing the sports world, a former track-and-field decathlon athlete and record holder,

285
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:11,240
Athlete

286
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:11,240
Takei So

287
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:11,240
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

288
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,260
The king of the jungle, Takei So. Welcome.

289
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,280
Is Japan's future bright or dark?

290
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,310
Is Japan's future bright or dark?

291
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:14,780
I think the future is bright.

292
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,520
I think the future is bright.

293
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,920
Once athletes become part of society,

294
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,560
they should promote young people

295
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,560
to use their energy and make the world a better place to live

296
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,430
Japan would be able to

297
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,430
become a much brighter place, that's what I'm hoping for.

298
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,630
We've had dark and bright outlooks so far,

299
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,600
Now, the tsukkomi half of the comedy duo Cocorico who's very popular in variety shows.

300
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,460
Lately, he's been participating in news programs as a commentator.

301
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,560
It's Endo Shozo, welcome.

302
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Happy New Year.

303
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,850
What will Endo say about Japan's future?

304
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,850
What will Endo say about Japan's future?

305
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,850
What will Endo say about Japan's future?

306
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,850
Following Kishi and Takei, what will Endo say about Japan's future?

307
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,500
Ah, what did I say?

308
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,260
I really can't remember.

309
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,510
Endo,

310
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,510
is Japan's future bright or dark?

311
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,320
is Japan's future bright or dark?

312
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,920
Well, I've always lived here in Japan,

313
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,920
and I've been doing this job for a while now.

314
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:56,790
And well,

315
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,020
Of course, my daughter is here too.

316
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,130
Thinking about all those things,

317
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,130
it absolutely needs to be bright.

318
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,130
That's how I feel.

319
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,700
Conversely, is there anything that makes you feel uneasy?

320
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,600
Conversely, is there anything that makes you feel uneasy?

321
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,600
Makes me uneasy?

322
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,270
Well, my everyday life makes me uneasy.

323
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,970
But I think that struggling with all your might,

324
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,680
But I think that struggling with all your might,

325
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,680
is something that feels very human.

326
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,450
I think it's fine to struggle from time to time.

327
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,960
That way...

328
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,930
As a person...

329
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:31,360
What Endo thinks about the future of Japan

330
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:31,360
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

331
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:31,360
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

332
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,030
Sounds like
Aida Mitsuo.

333
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,360
Struggling with all your might,

334
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,700
Please stop this.

335
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,360
is something that feels very human.

336
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,900
This is the same as the
"Hamada's wise sayings"
episode!

337
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,030
To give Endo a sense of security

338
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,030
we begin the discussion with a friendly topic

339
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,860
I hate this.

340
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,300
In order to give Endo a sense of security, we begin the discussion with a friendly topic.

341
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,230
Here we go...

342
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,230
The future of idols.

343
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,400
Idol Group Masked Girls

344
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,400
Sakurayuki

345
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,400
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

346
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,330
A current idol, Sakurayuki, is part of a group

347
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,330
Yes.

348
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,160
The Masked Girls, it's really amazing, have you heard of them?

349
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,910
They're idols but they all wear a mask.

350
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,380
Wouldn't it be better if she kept her mask on?

351
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,210
It just doesn't feel complete.

352
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,780
If you take it off, you're not complete.

353
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,690
Endo feels comfortable talking about a friendly topic

354
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,960
Endo feels confortable talking about such a friendly topic.

355
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,590
We throw the following question at Endo

356
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,930
We throw the following question at Endo.

357
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,160
Endo,

358
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,630
What kind of requirements does an idol need to meet

359
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,630
in order to survive in the world of show business?

360
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:19,500
What kind of requirements for popularity will Endo mention?

361
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,830
In the ebbing and flowing world of show business that Endo knows,

362
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,930
This isn't something to
struggle with.

363
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,430
what will be the requirements to become a popular idol?

364
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,940
Well, if you ask me that...

365
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,410
The Hello! Project idols are the

366
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,410
strongest there is, right?

367
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,880
Everyone who wants to become an idol

368
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,880
want to get in there.

369
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,880
They want in,

370
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,520
but from those rejected in auditions, there's people

371
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,320
who don't give up and think, "We'll do it by ourselves."

372
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,290
Well, these people are also idols, fine idols.

373
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,830
If you asked every one of them to describe

374
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,830
how they see themselves, they would say things like:

375
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,200
Rebellious spirit

376
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,200
Rebellious spirit

377
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,200
Rebellious spirit

378
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,200
Rebellious spirit

379
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,200
Rebellious spirit

380
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,860
Endo really
knows...

381
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,870
Not an elite

382
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,870
Not an elite

383
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,870
Not an elite

384
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,870
Not an elite

385
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,870
Not an elite

386
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,770
But also:

387
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,360
about feelings.

388
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,640
With a firm belief

389
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,640
With a firm belief

390
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,640
With a firm belief

391
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,640
With a firm belief

392
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,640
With a firm belief

393
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,860
Like the one ideal they will always keep.

394
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,900
They should be people like that.

395
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:04,420
Here our accomplice Kishi

396
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:04,420
will interpret what Endo wanted to say with a smarter explanation

397
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,700
Kishi is really amazing.

398
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,720
There's a very important thing that Endo mentioned just now.

399
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,120
What is really needed in the idol world

400
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,120
and the sub-culture in general is innovation.

401
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,760
Idols are now similar to say, AKB48

402
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,660
they join big groups and

403
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,660
Endo quickly begins taking notes

404
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,200
What?!

405
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,600
they wear matching uniforms.

406
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,030
You're even doing that?

407
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,030
Why?

408
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,500
Idols have started evolving,

409
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,500
What are you writing down?

410
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,130
making something that...

411
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,200
Doing that...

412
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,040
Who are you trying to look like!?

413
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,210
Comedy too,

414
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,210
involves constant innovation, so there's a lot of variety.

415
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,310
It's similar to that, right?

416
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,310
Yes, that's what I think.

417
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,180
Endo agrees completely with Kishi's opinion.

418
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,700
Endo agrees completely with Kishi's opinion.

419
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:44,960
We checked Endo's note after the recording

420
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,800
And after finishing recording, we checked the note Endo took while Kishi was talking.

421
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,460
They checked that?

422
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,700
You took a long time.

423
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,660
Hello Project

424
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,660
Like

425
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,660
Mask

426
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,900
He didn't write down anything

427
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,330
What the hell?

428
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,660
about Kishi's comment.

429
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,670
What the hell were you doing?!

430
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
You should have written down the "innovation" thing.

431
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,800
Now then,

432
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,460
let's move on to the main topic.

433
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,460
TPP's future.

434
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,210
Do you know what it is? TPP

435
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,800
TPP is rather...

436
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,100
Basically, it's something that has

437
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,610
That's just...

438
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,850
Endo talks down to the idol.

439
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,900
been planned for many years.

440
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,430
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership,

441
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,300
is a trade agreement between America, Japan and other countries in Asia and around the Pacific Rim,

442
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,730
with the purpose of liberalising trade by providing measures for tariffs, intellectual property and investments, among other things.

443
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,760
Tariffs, intellectual property, investments, etc

444
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,760
Trade Liberalization

445
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,630
Meat, vegetables and other imports will become cheaper

446
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,630
Merit

447
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,630
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

448
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,770
This will allow imports, such as meat and vegetables, to become cheaper.

449
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,380
It's very good news for some companies.

450
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:36,570
Japan's domestic products won't sell

451
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:36,570
Demerit

452
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:36,570
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

453
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,760
On the other hand, Japan's domestic agriculture will suffer a big blow.

454
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,570
There's a big concern about its demerits.

455
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,510
Regarding Japan, the TPP has

456
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,510
many kinds of merits, however

457
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,850
there's also many demerits and risks to consider.

458
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,460
You're twisting it.

459
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,460
You can do it.

460
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:52,620
Everyone, please use your notebook to write

461
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,620
whether it's a merit or a demerit.

462
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,560
That's difficult.

463
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,500
He was about to write his own opinion, but then...

464
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,460
It's serious.

465
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,400
This was meant to bring down smart Endo by making him write his own opinion, but then...

466
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,200
It's pretty hard.

467
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,620
This is important.

468
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,800
Our eyes caught him in the act!!

469
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,800
Our eyes caught him in the act!!

470
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,800
Our eyes caught him in the act!!

471
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,300
Our eyes were able to catch this suspicious behavior.

472
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
He's gonna copy it. Ah, he cheated!

473
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,680
Kishi's answer is copied by Thief Endo

474
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,460
He just cheated.

475
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,900
He's very quick.

476
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,680
Now then, everyone...

477
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,500
He copied it!

478
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,280
Raise them up at the same time, please.

479
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,200
Demerit, demerit, merit, merit, merit, merit...

480
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,530
Looks like this side is all merit.

481
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:29,560
Idol Sakurayuki will begin discussing the TPP in detail

482
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,260
Now, the idol Endo looked down on will suddenly

483
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,300
begin discussing the TPP in detail, showing off her knowledge.

484
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,330
How will Endo react!?

485
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,330
How will Endo react!?

486
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,900
Now then, Sakurayuki?

487
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,900
Yes.

488
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,900
It's a merit.

489
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,600
Yes, joining the TPP will place

490
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,600
four of the world's nations

491
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,510
with the highest GDP together,

492
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,510
forming a new economic bloc, right?

493
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,540
That way, these countries will have free trade

494
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,180
That way, these countries will have free trade

495
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,900
That was sudden.

496
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,180
and thus little to no tariffs.

497
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,700
Too sudden.

498
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,150
Foreign trade will improve a lot, don't you think?

499
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,310
Foreign trade will improve a lot, don't you think?

500
00:12:50,520 --> 00:13:00,260
After becoming aware of the idol's intelligence, Endo tries to laugh it off.

501
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,060
You asked her before.

502
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,130
I thought she was on my side.

503
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,130
You asked her if she knew...

504
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,430
Furthermore, the former hostess too

505
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,530
Furthermore, the former hostess too

506
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,030
It's been said that the tariffs on car parts

507
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,600
It's been said that the tariffs on car parts

508
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,600
will be promptly eliminated, right?

509
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,270
However, most of Japan's car makers

510
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,270
don't even have domestic production.

511
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,960
So it doesn't actually provide any benefits there.

512
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:24,050
At this unforeseen development, Endo can only look downwards.

513
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,260
That just...

514
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,430
I didn't know what was going on.

515
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,060
How did you not figure it out.

516
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,790
At last, Hori asks Endo for his opinion

517
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,960
I wonder.

518
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,400
This is when Hori asks Endo for his opinion.

519
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,890
We knew this
was coming.

520
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,190
Endo, what do you think?

521
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,890
But this is really, um... uh... this is uh...

522
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,790
But this is really, um... uh... this is uh...

523
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,120
But this is really, um... uh... this is uh...

524
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,460
But this is really, um... uh... this is uh...

525
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,490
But this is really, um... uh... this is uh...

526
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,730
I'm a consumer so, um... cheaper things are a benefit.

527
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,460
I'm a consumer so, um... cheaper things are a benefit.

528
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,300
I'm a consumer so, um... cheaper things are a benefit.

529
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm a consumer so, um... cheaper things are a benefit.

530
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,660
But if I thought Japanese things were better,

531
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,370
But if I thought Japanese things were better,

532
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,040
But if I thought Japanese things were better,

533
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,800
I could just buy Japanese things.

534
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,040
I could just buy Japanese things.

535
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,740
Being able to choose, I think that's pretty nice.

536
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:45,870
Being able to choose, I think that's pretty nice.

537
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,970
Being able to choose, I think that's pretty nice.

538
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,100
Being able to choose, I think that's pretty nice.

539
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,740
Being able to choose, I think that's pretty nice.

540
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,040
Being able to choose, I think that's pretty nice.

541
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,630
That's how I see it.

544
00:13:52,710 --> 00:14:00,420
Endo on the TPP

545
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,810
Cheaper things, that's pretty nice.

546
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,420
Cheaper things, that's pretty nice.

547
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,930
I hate this.

548
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,660
Endo isn't able to hide his surprise at this unexpected development

549
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,960
Endo isn't able to hide his surprise at this unexpected development.

550
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,300
I really hate this.

551
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,360
We're gonna keep going like this to corner him

552
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,330
What's more, we're going to keep this pace in order to corner this man.

553
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,630
100 Million Active People

554
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,630
100 Million Active People

555
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,630
Talk Topic

556
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,060
Our next topic is the "100 Million Active People" Plan.

557
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,870
With Kikuchi Momoko's appointment as a member,

558
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,870
it became a much-discussed  topic, the 100 Million Active People Plan

560
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:30,880
Prime Minister Abe explained it as
"the creation of a society where anyone, at home,

561
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:30,880
at the workplace, and in their region, can play an active role in their society"

No definite details have been explained

564
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,220
However, there haven't been any clear details, which has raised discomfort and concerns with the public.

565
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,220
No definite details have been explained

566
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,550
A sense of discomfort can be felt

567
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,220
A sense of discomfort can be felt

568
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,020
Right, here's the question for everyone,

569
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,190
The "100 Million Active People", do you think it can be implemented?

570
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
Look at your face.

571
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,260
The "100 Million Active People", do you think it can be implemented?

572
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,460
If you think it can, then write can

573
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,460
If you think it can't, then write can't.

574
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,430
Please write down your honest answer.

575
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,000
100 Million...

576
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,630
Active People.

577
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,940
There's no way
you can do this.

578
00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:02,180
He decides to take the risk and do or die!

579
00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:02,180
After copying once, he faces another binary question

580
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,160
Having just copied an answer, he's faced with another question with two answers.

581
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,300
However, this time, Endo decides to take the risk and do or die.

582
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,720
Now then, are you all ready?

583
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,360
The 100 Million Active People Plan,

584
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,950
100 Million Active People

585
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,950
Can't?

586
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,950
Can?

587
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,330
Can? Can't? Raise them all the the same time...

588
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,200
He took too long.

589
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,200
Yeah.

590
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,290
Go!

591
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,200
"Can't"

592
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,830
Endo, you're the only one who wrote "Can"!

593
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,100
Yeah.

594
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,300
Endo is the only one who writes down "Can".

595
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,660
You added something in parenthesis.

596
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,130
Not to mention,

597
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,040
I wish they do

598
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,830
he wishes they do implement it.

599
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,200
You backed away.

600
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,040
This line is his insurance.

601
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,780
It feels like you're in a gray area.

602
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,740
You didn't commit.

603
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,310
Everyone said it can't be done, so

604
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,310
Kishi, what's your opinion?

605
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,880
Well, the citizens need to feel safe about their future.

606
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,480
Well, the citizens need to feel safe about their future.

607
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,350
If you have that security, then everyone can

608
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,020
If you have that security, then everyone can

609
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,850
begin taking an active role in society.

610
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,020
begin taking an active role in society.

611
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:46,720
That sense of security is important

612
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,720
but the government didn't do enough to foresee our future.

613
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,930
You're not looking up.

614
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
but the government didn't do enough to foresee our future.

615
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,700
Just telling them to become active makes them think,

616
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,700
"Isn't that a bit arrogant coming from them?"

617
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,960
That's right.

618
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,660
You're right, you're right.

619
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,100
You're right, you're right.

620
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,160
"You're right"!

621
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,170
They need to present it in a much more specific way,

622
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,170
otherwise we won't know if it's an actual policy

623
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:04,210
or the government is just telling us

624
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,510
You're right.

625
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,210
to keep trying to do our best.

626
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,960
Looks like you're
apologizing.

627
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,810
I don't think they can do it this way.

628
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,750
I wish they could tell us something more conclusive.

629
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,480
Endo, you're nodding.

630
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,450
It's exactly as they said.

631
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,150
It really is

632
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,150
as you're all saying, you're all correct.

633
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,350
However, I really wish they could do it,

634
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,390
However, I really wish they could do it,

635
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,390
that's how I feel about it.

636
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,860
He goes with the opposite opinion

637
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,000
He goes with the opinion that is opposite to his own,

638
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,560
You switched sides.

639
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,500
And yet, despite being a discussion program

640
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,260
And yet, despite being a discussion program...

641
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,000
I had no choice.

642
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,360
You switched.

643
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,760
that's how I feel about it.

644
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,770
Endo mentions an unfounded idea based on a feeling

645
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,600
He contributes with an unfounded idea based on a feeling.

646
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,700
You're all over the place.

647
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:37,170
Endo can't keep acting smart, so we ask him this

648
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,100
Endo can't keep acting smart,

649
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
so we ask him this kind of question:

650
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,650
Individually, in order to make Japan's future

651
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,650
brighter, what exactly do we need?

652
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,880
If you could appoint a historical figure as our prime minister,

653
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,520
If you could appoint a historical figure as our prime minister,

654
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,520
who would you decide to appoint?

655
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
A leader, this is interesting.

656
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,990
Everyone, please write it down.

657
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,120
Endo's answer is completely unexpected!

658
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,120
He only needs to write down a person and explain why.

659
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:59,260
Endo's answer is completely unexpected!

660
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:59,260
He only needs to write down a person and explain why.

661
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,630
He only needs to write down a historical figure and explain why.

662
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,230
However, Endo's answer is comepletely unexpected.

663
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,030
Raise your answer at the same time, please.

664
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,200
There, ah.

665
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,060
There's a lot of variety, between all of you.

666
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,710
Hanshin Tiger's Manager

667
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,710
Kanemoto Tomoaki

668
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,800
People from very different eras.

669
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,930
You really like him, huh?

670
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:18,650
Endo will try to overcome this once-in-a-lifetime mental lapse

671
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,360
Endo will have to try overcoming this once-in-a-lifetime mental lapse.

672
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,830
But first...

673
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,550
Kishi.

674
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,690
prime minister during World War 2.

675
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,690
I chose England's

676
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,360
This person's leadership skills were obviously amazing.

677
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,730
He really inspired

678
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,730
his people and helped to encourage them.

679
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Embarrassed, Endo hides his answer.

680
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,000
Put it down!

681
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,100
You did put it down.

682
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,230
He gave so many speeches,

683
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,560
Churchill put a lot of importance

684
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,900
They told you
not put it down?

685
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
on using the right words.

686
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,760
Probably.

687
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,770
How about you, Kimura?

688
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,030
I chose Ino Tadataka.

689
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,550
He's the person who created so many maps of Japan.

690
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:57,490
The studio's staff orders Endo to pull up his answer.

691
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,860
His vitality was amazing, being able to walk all over the country.

692
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,750
Pull it up, pull it up.

693
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,230
Endo?

694
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,890
I chose Kanemoto Tomoaki.

695
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,560
Hanshin Tiger's manager so...

696
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,560
Starting this year, he became the

697
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,860
Yeah.

698
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,300
Well, it's said that even if he broke his arm,

699
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,300
he would still be able to achieve a hit, right?

700
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,830
So, that sort of leader with a strong character.

701
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,840
That's right, for a prime minister.

702
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,970
That's right, for a prime minister.

703
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,610
The question made me think of Kanemoto.

704
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,810
Well then, we've been broadcasting this special show

705
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,810
live on Nico Nico Douga for over an hour.

706
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,410
With our seven samurai of the future.

707
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,310
To finish, everyone will answer.

708
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,350
Japan's future brighter?

709
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,350
What are we missing that will make

710
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,050
Tell us your plan to make Japan better

711
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,050
using a four-character idiom.

712
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:35,830
Next

713
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:35,830
Shocking! Endo's four-character idiom!

714
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,130
We've been broadcasting this special show

715
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,130
live on Nico Nico Douga for over an hour.

716
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,730
With our seven samurai of the future,

717
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,630
To finish, everyone will answer,

718
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,670
Japan's future brighter?

719
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,670
What are we missing that will make

720
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,370
Tell us your plan to make Japan better

721
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,370
using a four-character idiom.

722
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,260
You're doing it again.

723
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,460
Really makes one think.

724
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,690
Anything is fine,

725
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,690
it doesn't have to be kanji.

726
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,360
Like if you have a catchphrase.

727
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,520
Can you tell me

728
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,520
how to write this?

729
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,260
"Surrounded by"...

730
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,260
Endo ends up asking about a kanji he doesn't know.

731
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,560
Right, let's go everyone.

732
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,400
Raise your four-character idiom at the same time.

733
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,160
Ah, we got many different ones.

734
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,900
Ah, very complicated.

735
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
"Surrounded by enemies"

736
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,560
He just laughed at
the staff's reaction.

737
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,960
I was really surrounded
by enemies.

738
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:36,350
Once again, Endo hides his answer.

739
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,230
It's the only one
that came to mind.

740
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,600
Again.

741
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,360
Hide it, hide it!

742
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,390
...everyone has their assigned role,

743
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,200
but they could solve it by becoming more flexible.

744
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,000
I think it would be great if society would become aware of this.

745
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,830
Next, Kimura.

746
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,060
It's "Unite in a common purpose".

747
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,560
From an organizational perspective,

748
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
it could mean to get together

749
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,440
Once again, the staff orders Endo to fix it

750
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,460
to be able to fight a common enemy...

751
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,980
Endo, you wrote "Surrounded by enemies".

752
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,480
That means everyone around us is our enemy.

753
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,530
Hori is laughing at you.

754
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,060
Why is that?

755
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,580
This is the only one I know... the four-character idiom.

756
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,950
This is the only one I know... the four-character idiom.

757
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,880
Sorry, that's all.

758
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,650
Sorry, that's all.

759
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,190
That's it.

760
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:17,190
Well, in a way,

761
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,190
Frankly, I'd say it really describes Japan's current situation.

762
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,190
We're in a deadlock.

763
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,460
Is it considering the US-Japan Security treaty and the like?

764
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,460
Yes, yes, considering everything.

765
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,970
Well then, we really got all kinds of comments.

766
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,800
Well then, we really got all kinds of comments.

767
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,810
With all your help,

768
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,810
let's do our best to make 2016 a good year.

769
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,580
Let's meet again. Now then, goodbye.

770
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,360
Thank you.

771
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:48,490
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

772
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:48,490
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

773
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:48,490
Verification Results

774
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:48,490
When he can't pretend to be smart,

775
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,490
Endo begins to deceive

776
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,730
I see.

777
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,130
And that was the end of the video.

778
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,670
Endo, why did you write down that note?

779
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,830
Yeah, that thing.

780
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,100
I was wondering too.

781
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,360
Normally, you would have written down the "innovation" bit.

782
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,860
Yes, in the idol world.

783
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,860
I thought you'd made a note of that.

784
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,040
I was thinking that taking notes

785
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,680
I was thinking that taking notes

786
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,680
could make me look smart,

787
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,860
Yeah, makes sense.

788
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,400
"Ah, that's good".

789
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,230
I was thinking that nobody would look at it.

790
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,830
I didn't imagine it would get exposed like this.

791
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,040
I couldn't act smart with all those people.

792
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,860
Well, yeah, that happens.

793
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,800
That masked idol that was sitting next to me,

794
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,960
at first she kept her pace with me.

795
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,430
With that girl here and the hostess over there,

796
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,060
At first I thought that I wouldn't have any problems answering.

797
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,400
But halfway, that happened.

798
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,080
We watched it, so we know!

799
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,130
That was so slow.

800
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,760
What the staff said now makes sense.

801
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,930
"Surrounded by enemies"

802
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,930
In the video, you used the idiom

803
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,290
For the year 2016, tell us about your expectations, Endo.

804
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:03,470
For the year 2016, tell us about your expectations, Endo.

805
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,470
Of course, using a four-character idiom!

806
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,060
Eh?

807
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,200
Nice.

808
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,200
Write it down.

809
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,960
He can't use "Surrounded by enemies".

810
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,200
What?

811
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,530
A four-character idiom?

812
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,230
About your expectations.

813
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,940
We'll wait for you, we'll wait 40 minutes.

814
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,510
We'll wait for you, we'll wait 40 minutes.

815
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,560
It won't take that long.

816
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,060
10 minutes per character.

817
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,960
Uh, what about...

818
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,030
Wow.

819
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,860
Are you ready?

820
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,090
Ah, yes.

821
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:29,190
Endo's expectations for 2016,

822
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,190
as a four-character idiom, let's see it.

823
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,630
Alright then.

824
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,200
My expectation for 2016 is this...

825
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,060
"Once-in-a-lifetime experience"

826
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,060
"Once-in-a-lifetime experience"

827
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,400
Endo, this is just...

828
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,730
This is very...

829
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,240
I think this isn't really an expectation.

830
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,240
This is just a phrase.

831
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,080
Actually,

832
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,580
I don't actually understand what it means that much.

833
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,830
What it means?

834
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,130
You don't know?

835
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,060
You should know what it means.

836
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,630
I just kinda know it.

837
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,930
Then how do you understand it?

838
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,930
You should have an idea, otherwise

839
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,560
you don't actually have any expectations.

840
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,730
Right.

841
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,730
I know it uses these four kanji.

842
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:54,780
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

843
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,700
Like with the last idiom.

844
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,700
And you understand them.

845
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,430
Sort of, like...

846
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,830
Something like "one meeting per semester"?

847
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,860
One semester?

848
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,860
What are you gonna do with one meeting per semester?

849
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,860
That hurts.

850
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,330
So dumb it hurts.

851
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,000
There's the movie "Forrest Gump" that uses this.

852
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,160
Yes, that's right.

853
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,930
It's the movie's subtitle.

854
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,930
It had that subtitle.

855
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,930
I haven't watched it though.

856
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,730
That hurts!

857
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,730
You're so dumb it hurts!

858
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,400
Why mention a movie you haven't seen?

859
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
My tooth hurts.
