Tanaka goes on first! What will he prepare?

00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,650
Here's my first recipe.

30
00:00:49,880 --> 00:01:09,700
Cabbage

31
00:00:49,880 --> 00:01:09,700
Chinese

32
00:00:49,880 --> 00:01:09,700

Nukadoko*

00:00:49,880 --> 00:01:09,700
Radish

38
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,240
What's this?

39
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,480
Nukazuke pasta !

40
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,710
Hey, it could actually taste good, Tanaka!

41
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,410
I think this can give new Japanese pasta

42
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,730
I put al dente pasta in the nukadoko yesterday.

43
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,500
Aren't these the vegetables you had to put in?

44
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,500
No, I didn't put them in.

45
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,700
You didn't ?!

46
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,070
You just need to put the pasta and the vegetables together, there's nothing special.

47
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What happened to the pasta?

48
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:20,540
Nukazuke Pasta

49
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:20,540
Tanaka

50
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,010
Check this out.

51
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,630
Original.

52
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,620
This is really original.

53
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,500
We really need to try this out.

54
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,520
You call THIS pasta?!

55
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:28,550
Mix the assortiments with the pasta which has been put in the nukadoko.

56
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,710
The smell is really strange!

57
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,290
I know, but I'm sure this is gonna be delicious when everything will be clear!

58
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,500
I really want to try it and see what it tastes like.

59
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,420
Okay, so here is my second recipe.

60
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,390
What's this?

61
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:45,010
Carrot

62
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:45,010
Fukujinzuke "Soup"

63
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:45,010
Ingredients

64
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:45,010
Onion

65
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:45,010
Pork

66
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:45,010
Potatoes

67
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,560
Fukujinzuke Pasta!

68
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,990
Weeew! I don't want it!

69
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,440
Everything's macerated with you.

70
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,340
Tanaka Naoki presents: Maceration.

71
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:43,260
*Missed line*

72
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:47,540
I really love fukujinzuke! But did you know you need to throw the liquid before eating it?

73
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:53,810
Fukujinzuke Pasta

74
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:53,810
Tanaka

75
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,260
I know, but I could not do that!

76
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,830
That's why I had the idea to soak the pasta in!

77
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,770
I'm kinda afraid of this

78
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,490
The other ingredients are the one you need for curry rice

79
00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:01,740
Mix the curry rice's ingredients with the pasta which soaked in the fukujinzuke liquid.

80
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,630
Oh, the idea is to do the same as with the curry rice.

81
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,700
Exactly. At the end, you mix everything up and you eat.

82
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,790
Nukazuke Pasta

83
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,790
Tanaka

84
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,790
Tanaka's first recipe! What will the nukadoko pasta taste like..?

85
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,400
OPEN!

86
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,220
Bland taste!

87
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,260
Yeah, seems like it is tasteless

88
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,550
It's like some flat diet!

89
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,390
Well, let's it!

90
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,470
There's no particular smell.

91
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,400
You're right.

92
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,580
It's really salty !

93
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,570
A pronounced salty taste.

94
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,330
Too salty, this is too salty !

95
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,420
Now, you know that tsukemono are ALWAYS salty...

96
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,760
It has to be served with rice.

97
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,690
Alright.

98
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,820
I don't like this.

99
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,780
Don't say that!

100
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,110
It's very different from what I have imagined!

101
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,080
If your wife prepares this for you, you'll  overturn the table!

102
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,260
You'll get mad.

103
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,330
You had a really bad day, you arrive home, you eat this, you'll overturn the table!

104
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,960
Your kids will be crying.

105
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,020
The dog will be barking.

106
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,800
You overturn the table.

107
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,490
I give a 2 or 3.

108
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:04,620
Even if he did not make this thing, since Tanaka always looks dirty...

109
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,700
Okay, so I'll give a 2 !

110
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,480
You have 2 because you're dirty.

111
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm not dirty !

112
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,840
Not a 3.

113
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,100
Nukazuke Pasta

114
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,100
Tanaka

115
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,100
Influenced by Tanaka's dirt, his recipe got 2 points.

116
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,830
Fukujinzuke Pasta

117
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,830
Let's see the pasta which has been soaked in the fukujinzuke's liquid.

118
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,830
Tanaka

119
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,210
OPEN !

120
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,110
What the hell is this colour !!

121
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
Interesting !

122
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,130
It looks like some spaghetti with ketchup !

123
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,940
That's true! You can add some ketchup if you want...

124
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,130
Fukujinzuke...

125
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,720
Curry's powder

126
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,720
Depending on your taste...

127
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,720
Fukujinzuke

128
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,690
Fukujinzuke AGAIN ?

129
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,760
or curry's powder.

130
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,600
We'll see what it gives after we taste it.

131
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,190
Yes, let's taste it first.

132
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,180
Those who want can add some if they like.

133
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,480
Let's taste this pasta without adding anything.

134
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,490
It's really good !

135
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,750
It's good, isn't it?

136
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,050
It's a bit sweet isn't it?

137
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,300
Really good!

138
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,040
Not bad!

139
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,010
I can feel a good mark!

140
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,710
Well done, Tanaka! This is spectacular!

141
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,300
I feel it good!

142
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,830
What do you thing about it, Hamada?

143
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,600
It's delicious if you add curry !

144
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,440
It's not bad, but no need to shout like that...

145
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,040
I give a 3.

146
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
Hey, hey, no, is this a joke !?

147
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,560
This dish deserves more than a 3 !

148
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,080
Then, I give a 3 too.

149
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,050
If I had a wife, I would get mad if she prepares me this 2 days one after the other!

150
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,050
C'mon, this is disgusting !

151
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,360
Fukujinzuke Pasta

152
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,360
Tanaka

153
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,360
The taste is not bad, but because of Hamada, his pasta only got 3 points.

154
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,960
Endo's Pasta

155
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,960
It is Endo's turn. What ingredients is he going to use?

156
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,420

I call it Momoya Pasta

164
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,850
It will be delicious !

165
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,930
These things are already delicious!

166
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:04,550
Back in the time when there wasn't a lot to eat, I used to eat those Momoya products.

167
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:08,770
EndÃ´

168
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:08,770

They are all really delicious.

You're going to use everything ?!

171
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,770
I'll mix up everything with the pasta.

172
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,280
We'll see what it gives.

173
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:18,120
Mix the pasta with these Momoya products.

174
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,770
It will be delicious, I'm certain of it!

175
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,390
Seriously, those Momoya products really saved me.

176
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,040
Stop talking! Present us your second recip !

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,890
What's this? It looks like makizushi

189
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,920
Yes, I'll try to create makizushi with pasta

190
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,410
Generally, we use rice to make makizushi. But I've heard that some people make it with soba

191
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:39,260
EndÃ´

192
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:39,260
Makizushi Pasta

193
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,560
I'll use pasta.

194
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,020
You'll replace rice with pasta

195
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:48,170
Pasta will replace the rice in the makizushi. They need to be fried before served.

196
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,770
And finally, we fry them.

197
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,300
Fry them?

198
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,120
Yes, we fry them a little bit before eating them.

199
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,230
EndÃ´

200
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,230
Momoya Pasta

201
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,230
Endo's "Momoya Pasta" are finally ready!

202
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,150
Here's the result.

203
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,960
Not bad, not bad!

204
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,390
Not bad, not bad !

205
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,870
It smells good !

206
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,860
This looks delicious !

207
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,100
Not bad at all !

208
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,810
It looks delicious.

209
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,910
The form appearance is perfect.

210
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,580
Yes!

211
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,940
I beg you, be delicious !

212
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,750
But it's...

213
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,020
really good!

214
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,970
But a little bit salty.

215
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,180
I find them salty too!

216
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,170
You're right.

217
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,270
I want to eat this with rice.

218
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,630
You're right.

219
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,370
Anyway it's really good.

220
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,280
Even the pasta is good!

221
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,760
They're good!

222
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,970
Alright. You just need to reduce the chili sauce, and it will be perfect.

223
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,190
How much you'll give?

224
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,070
I'll personally give...

225
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,520
... 7!

226
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,930
Thank you so much !

227
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,930
You're generous!

228
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,920
It deserves it.

229
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,740
a 5 is enough already!

230
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,460
I'll give a 6, it's my day.

231
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,420
You're really severe today, Hamada-san!

232
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,700
If you give me a portion, I'm not sure I'll be able to eat it all.

233
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,020
But to be honest, the taste if perfect, it's a 100%.

234
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,840
Thanks !

235
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,090
It's delicious, but...

236
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,760
This is Momoya's recipe...

237
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,350
Yes, that's true...

238
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,700
This is not an Endo's creation.

239
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,100
You did nothing !

240
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,530
Nothing !

241
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm sure Cocorico would have been better without Endo!

242
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,540
Tanaka alone ?!!

243
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
Everybody says that.

244
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,030
Seriously?

245
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,380
It's true that's it's Momoya's creation but...

246
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,400
a 6 is not bad at all.

247
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,590
a 6 is good. Try to assemble all this pasta.

248
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,250
We could open a restaurant !

249
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,490
EndÃ´

250
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,490
Momoya Pasta

251
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,490
The taste was welcomed, but the whole thing only got 6 points.

252
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,200
EndÃ´

253
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,200
Makizushi Pasta

254
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,200
His second recipe is a mix between Japan and Italy, Makizushi's Pasta!

255
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,240
Here's the result.

256
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,520
You could have added some more flags...

257
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,150
Why are there only 2 countries?

258
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,760
Since it's pasta and sushi, it represents Italy and Japan.

259
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,230
It's an Italian-Japanese alliance.

260
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,820
Bon appetit !

261
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,380
Endo, this thing has NOTHING to do with Pasta !

262
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,990
No link at all!

263
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,950
Seems like regular makizushi.

264
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,820
You don't feel the rice's texture, do you? You feel the pasta.

265
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,170
How much do you give, Endo?

266
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,810
Me ?

267
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,450
After what you told me, I feel like I'm obliged to give a bad mark.

268
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,290
I'll say 8 at least.

269
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,830
You're too high of yourself.

270
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,330
You're just excited because your family comes to visit you on New Year's Eve.

271
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,320
* They're speaking with Osaka's dialect.

272
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,320
I've been often told: "Don't get mad !"

273
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,320
I've been told: "Stop it fool!"

274
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,050
That's really not it, I'm sorry!

275
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,670
So what, you'll give me a 2?

276
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,560
I give 1, you're okay?

277
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,230
I'm okay with it. I give 1 too.

278
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,340
1 ??!

279
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,040
You didn't thing about the pasta's feelings.

280
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,850
What do you mean?

281
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,200
Yama-chan is saying something interesting!

282
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,850
What do you want to say?

283
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,940
What do you mean by "feelings" ?

284
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,720
This is rambling !

285
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,230
What's this face expression ?

286
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,680
From the angle we see it from, it's really funny. But seen from TV, I'm sure it is not.

287
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,380
It's much more funny from our side!

288
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,980
So, how much shall we give? 2 or 1?

289
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,840
1 !

290
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,940
Ok!

291
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,130
EndÃ´

292
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,130
Makizushi Pasta

293
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,130
Since he didn't thing about pasta's feelings, the recipe gets one lonely point.

294
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,010
Yamasaki's Pasta

295
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,010
The next one is Yamasaki. Will his pasta be appreciated by everyone?

296
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,760
You both were disappointing.

297
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,190
Exactly.

298
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,460
We're sorry !

299
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,880
Show them!

300
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,410
Here!

301
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,530
You definatly love them!

302
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:22,240
(Tastes: Tonkatsu salsa, corn's soup, salad)

303
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:22,240
Ingredients

304
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:22,240
Umai BÃ´*

305
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,350
I really love Umai BÃ´. I'll use the one with corn taste,

306
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,080
salad taste and tonkatsu taste salsa.

307
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,860
I'll create 3 different types of pasta.

308
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,390
Without mixing them together.

309
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:30,310
Umai BÃ´ are crushed into small pieces then mixed up with the pasta.

310
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:30,570
Until now, spaghettis were a dish for adults.

311
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,510
Really?

312
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,950
Children love it too...

313
00:09:30,790 --> 00:10:04,470
(3 kinds)

314
00:09:30,790 --> 00:10:04,470
Umai BÃ´ Pasta

315
00:09:30,790 --> 00:10:04,470
Yamasaki

316
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,290
No, it's not true.

317
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,010
Kids really love spaghettis...

318
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,010
Spaghettis are an adult dish.

319
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,690
I see...

320
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,640
It is not fit for children. So I imagined a dish for them.

321
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,370
Perfectly fit for children.

322
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,740
And it doesn't cost more than 10 yen! (0.08â¬)

323
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,770
You don't prepare spaghettis for you children, then?

324
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,610
I do, and they eat it.

325
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,160
But they sometimes think "Oh, this is for adults"

326
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,060
And they cry-

327
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,130
Heeh?! What !

328
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,170
Idiot!

329
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,960
Epic fail.

330
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,350
Sorry.

331
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,060
Are you my friends or my enemies?

332
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,480
Oh! This looks good!

333
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,420
Candied chestnuts

334
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,420
Fresh cream

335
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,420
Ingredients

336
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,380
I want to eat is "as is".

337
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,400
Look, it looks like spaghettis.

338
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:22,340
Mont Blanc Cake Pasta

339
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:22,340
Yamasaki

340
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,330
You're right, looks like pasta.

341
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,230
Chestnuts' cream

342
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,790
will be made with pasta, genoese too.

343
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,700
This is disgusting...

344
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,860
Spaghettis became a dessert !

345
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:33,410
Mont Blanc Cake is made with pasta, candied chestnuts and fresh cream.

346
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,270
Oww! This is too much!

347
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,290
This is disgusting.

348
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,780
It is a good idea.

349
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,200
You'll unleash the god's wrath upon you.

350
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,190
What do you mean?

351
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,210
Don't say that !

352
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,410
(3 tastes)

353
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,410
Umai BÃ´ Pasta

354
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,410
Yamasaki

355
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,410
His first pasta, specifically for children, are ready.

356
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,900
Let's go!

357
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,320
Interesting.

358
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,940
Looks like urchin's eggs!

359
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,140
Good point.

360
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,990
This one is canned tuna

361
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,480
You're right

362
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,650
And this?

363
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,700
What do you mean?

364
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,750
Don't ask us that!

365
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,730
Who told you we're tasting everything?

366
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,560
We'll only eat the nearest pasta.

367
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,530
We aren't trying the 3 sorts.

368
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,130
...

369
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,270
Eww..

370
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,630
This is not that bad..

371
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,180
It's sticky...

372
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,150
It's sticky with a special sensation in the mouth,

373
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,240
but the taste is excellent.

374
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,680
Liar !

375
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,880
I'm only talking about the taste !

376
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,340
Are you serious ?

377
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,020
The problem is to know what we're going to take into consideration: the bad sensation or the taste.

378
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,310
I'm telling you both are bad.

379
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,350
The taste isn't that good...

380
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,840
We did take the 2 points into consideration.

381
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,290
We have to make the final decision.

382
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,210
I give a squeletton head.

383
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,770
Non, wait, this is not possible!

384
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,400
You're lucky we know you for long.

385
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,270
If you were a new little boy,

386
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,350
I would have called you in my office.

387
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,580
Did I really do something bad !?

388
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,700
I would have said to you: "What did you do!!"

389
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,750
We got it, so it's a 1.

390
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,380
(3 tastes)

391
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,380
Umai BÃ´ Pasta

392
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,380
Yamasaki

393
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,320
Appreciated by it's inventor but not by the others, it got one point.

394
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,090
What does his second dish look like?

395
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,090
Mont Blanc Cake Pasta

396
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,090
Yamasaki

397
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,000
Please give points for the design.

398
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,570
It's very important when it comes to cakes.

399
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,090
Let's go.

400
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,330
It's pasta isn't it?

401
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,440
Yes !

402
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,090
The design is really not bad.

403
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,940
Looks like real Mont Blanc.

404
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,630
Exactly.

405
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,190
Ouaah! Look at the genoese!

406
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,830
It's pasta too !

407
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,490
Incredible.

408
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,010
I really don't want to eat that !

409
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,690
Don't say that!

410
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,350
I'd prefer this part.

411
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,540
Bon appetit !

412
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,110
Hang on a sec !

413
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,320
What?

414
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,630
You have to mix it up before eating.

415
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,560
What !?

416
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,510
Otherwise you won't taste the fresh cream. So mix it up!

417
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,890
Are you serious?

418
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,920
Mix up with the fresh cream.

419
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,590
I'm a little bit scared.

420
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,360
It looks like carbonara pasta!

421
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,360
That's true !

422
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,580
It was way better looking before.

423
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,680
What's this?

424
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,700
It's the worst.

425
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,280
It's sweet !

426
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,250
It's the worst.

427
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,930
Too sweet.

428
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,230
That's really not it, Yamasaki.

429
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,060
Maybe it's not that good...

430
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,480
I think it's the time to give...

431
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,640
No squeletton head, please.

432
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,270
It's time...

433
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,940
It gives a really bad impression.

434
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,610
A squeletton head !

435
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,420
Here we are.

436
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,260
Wait !

437
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,660
We decided it's going to be a skeleton head

438
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,690
This is not what everyone thinks !

439
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,470
It deserves a skeleton head, really.

440
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,240
And you, Tanaka chan?

441
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,140
a skeleton head is good with me.

442
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,320
Mont Blanc Cake Pasta

443
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,320
Yamasaki

444
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,320
Even with a good design, the sweet taste didn't please anybody. It's a skeleton head!

445
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,140
Hamada's Pasta

446
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,140
Hamada's turn. What is he going to present.. ?

447
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,530
The theme is "party".

448
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,530
Here's my first recipe.

449
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:01,900
Ingredients

450
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:01,900
Potato

451
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:01,900
Wheat flour (poor)

452
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:01,900
starch

453
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,630
What's that?

454
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,670
Pasta that could be served on a buffet.

455
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,010
That's all ?

456
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,970
I'll mix this with the pasta, and I'll cook it on a stove.

457
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,340
Like senbei?

458
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,070
Exactly !

459
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,220
We eat that during party.

460
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:19,470
Hamada

461
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:19,470
Yaki Pasta

462
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,230
I don't know what it'll look like.

463
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,730
You'll know very soon.

464
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,570
We mix the ingredients together

465
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:28,860
The pasta is mixed with wheat flour and potaton starch then cooked on a stove.

466
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,860
We'll cook that?

467
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,310
It looks like okonomiyaki, doesn't it?

468
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,560
Look at the cooking.

469
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,010
While he's preparing it, I'll show you this.

470
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,250
What's all this?

471
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,210
Ouaah! Unbelievable!

472
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:48,550
Chicken

473
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:48,550
ConsommÃ©

474
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:48,550
Foie Gras

475
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:48,550
Ham salad

476
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:48,550
Ingredients

477
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,540
It's a luxury dish.

478
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,150
Is it...

479
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,810
It's foie gras

480
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,320
with ham salad,

481
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,780
consommÃ©,

482
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,150
and roast chicken.

483
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,670
We take all those ingredients and we put them inside the chicken.

484
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:55,540
Celeb Party Pasta

485
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:55,540
Hamada

486
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,330
So that was it !

487
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,350
And I put it in the oven.

488
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,170
And when we cut it...

489
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:04,420
The chicken is stuffed, then put in the oven.

490
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,200
Exactly, then when we open it...

491
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,900
I'm kind of scary..

492
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,590
It's a dish for stars.

493
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,370
The other one is for buffet.

494
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,930
Hamada

495
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,930
Yaki Pasta

496
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,930
The first dish is the pasta on the stove.

497
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,440
Eat it up !

498
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,100
You can choose between tentsuyu, yukukoshÃ´ and tartare sauce.

499
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,430
It's.. hmm..

500
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,070
Depending on the taste...

501
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,070
Tentsuyu - YuzukoshÃ´ - Tartare sauce

502
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,940
... a dish for the poor !

503
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,830
I'll try it with tentsuyu.

504
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,060
Bon appetit !

505
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,650
I put yukukoshÃ´.

506
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,070
I'll try tentsuyu.

507
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,840
I put tentsuyu too.

508
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,940
It's delicious with tentsuyu.

509
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,740
It's good !

510
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,460
It's really good !

511
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,840
It's a snack.

512
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,440
The texture is particular somehow. I'll try with yuzokosho

513
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,020
Not bad with the yuzukosho

514
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,050
Delicious with the yuzukosho

515
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,150
Excellent !

516
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,460
Really good.

517
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,700
I think what's good is what we put on it

518
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,200
not the pasta in itself.

519
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,560
You ate tons of it !

520
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,110
It deserves a 8 though.

521
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,780
It's too much!

522
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,940
You give an 8?

523
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,630
What do you think about it?

524
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,630
It's really good.

525
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,640
Wouldn't you eat this at an italian restaurant?

526
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,610
I would!

527
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,350
Wouldn't you?

528
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,700
How much would you give?

529
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,140
The idea is not bad!

530
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,490
Should we say the mark aloud?

531
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,300
One, two, three

532
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,380
6 !

533
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,380
6 !

534
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,380
6 !

535
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,380
9 !

536
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,640
6 ?

537
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,070
It's a 6 for me too. We were 3 saying it.

538
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,230
Since we were three saying it, it's hence a 6.

539
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,220
a 6?

540
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,460
Hamada

541
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,460
Yaki Pasta

542
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,460
The crusty pasta get 6 points.

543
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,090
Celeb Party Pasta

544
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,090
Hamada

545
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,090
Next to the dish using the luxury ingredients.

546
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,170
Wow, this kicks ass !!

547
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,990
True!

548
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,330
After all what we put into it..

549
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,870
Yes, there was a lot.

550
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,610
Incredible.

551
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,500
It seems like...

552
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,670
A dead chicken after eating too much spaghettis.

553
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,990
Matsumoto san, don't say that !

554
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,990
Don't say that !

555
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,360
We can actually feel the chicken's smell

556
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,770
I'll serve you chicken too.

557
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,870
It's evident.

558
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,630
Go on!

559
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,410
Looks like leftovers.

560
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,380
Yamasaki just said it is leftovers.

561
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,180
Don't be idiot!

562
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,320
Look at this !

563
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,300
Leftovers.

564
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,590
Is this the celebrity pasta?

565
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,320
I worked really hard in my life

566
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,190
to not put myself in a situation like this one.

567
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,200
This is impossible...

568
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,370
No thanks, I don't want it!

569
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,740
This tasta comes from...

570
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,570
the bottom of a lane.

571
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,420
What sort of taste is this?!

572
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,480
It comes from the bottom on a lane in a big city.

573
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,750
What's this thing ?!

574
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,970
This is disgusting !

575
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,290
Not good at all !

576
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,580
He's right, it's disgusting !

577
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,170
DISGUSTING !

578
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,660
It deserves a skullhead !

579
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,650
but why ?

580
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,410
A whole skeleton !

581
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,500
Not only the head, a whole skeleton !

582
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,790
Celeb Party Pasta

583
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,790
Hamada

584
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,790
Not good in style nor in tast, this dish gets the first full skeleton !

585
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,450
Matsumoto's Pasta

586
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,450
At least, Matsumoto's turn. Will he make something better than the others ?

587
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,520
So, how do you feel? Bad, don't you?

588
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,970
Exactly !

589
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,790
Don't exagerate.

590
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,010
My theme today will be "Freshness."

591
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,520
Well, my theme has always been "freshness"

592
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,580
Look

593
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,220
Ingredients

594
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,220
Little watermelon

595
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,110
A watermelon ?

596
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,850
A little watermelon.

597
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,800
What do you think about it? I'm sure that you, members and staff of Gaki

598
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,690
you think it's a weapon

599
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,690
Oh, true, we used it once

600
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,690
in Yamasaki vs Moriman

601
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,720
Remember that it's something you eat

602
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,490
It was a weapon !

603
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,210
It's food !

604
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,360
It's a bit risky to use a watermelon.

605
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,550
I wanted to make you taste that freshness.

606
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,510
It sucks.

607
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,060
It's like visiting your grandma on summer holiday.

608
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:02,360
The capellinis and watermelon pieces are mixed up.

609
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,270
And your second dish?

610
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,140
Don't forget that the theme is "freshness" so that's all.

611
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,660
Ingredient

612
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,660
Toothpaste

613
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,720
This is too much !

614
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,120
What's this dish ?!

615
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,650
This is way too much !

616
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:22,800
Matsumoto

617
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:22,800
Morning Tooth Pasta

618
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,790
It's not even an ingredient !

619
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,310
We'll first prepare some delicious peperoncino spaghettis.

620
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,330
Then we'll add a little bit of toothpasta

621
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,090
to have a cool peperoncino.

622
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:31,880
Mix the peperoncino spaghettis and the toothpasta.

623
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,130
Trust me !

624
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,190
I always try what nobody has ever tried.

625
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,420
And we'll not have the disgusting bottom lane taste.

626
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,460
This will erase it.

627
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,710
I don't doubt that !

628
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,990
Matsumoto

629
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,990
The first Fresh Matsumoto dish is ready !

630
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,990
Watermelon freshness pasta

631
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,110
Each one of us have a watermelon

632
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,810
This is how it is inside.

633
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,070
It looks good.

634
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,950
If you want you can add

635
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,480
some condensed milk

636
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:57,400
Condensed milk

637
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:57,400
Depending on the taste...

638
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:57,400
Rock salt

639
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,380
or rock salt

640
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,780
Like this...

641
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,480
Why are you trying it?

642
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,610
This pasta looks like noodles.

643
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,020
So it looks fresh

644
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,620
It's true, it's noodles !

645
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,280
If I used bigger pasta, it would have looked bad.

646
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,750
Is this really spaghetti?

647
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,910
I see...

648
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,930
DISGUSTING !

649
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,490
UNEATABLE !

650
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,080
Disgusting !

651
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,260
Unbelievable.

652
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,540
I feel like a beetle.

653
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,360
You better not put condensed milk on it !

654
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,220
We better stop now.

655
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,460
This should be banned.

656
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,420
Ouaah! This is disgusting !

657
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,870
Disgusting !

658
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,880
Tanaka !

659
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,300
We're on TV !

660
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,990
It's really bad isn't it?

661
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,360
We're on TV !

662
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,410
This is uneatable !

663
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,210
It's really horrible.

664
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,880
Don't say it's disgusting.

665
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,940
It's uneatable, it deserves a skullhead doesn't it

666
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,390
Yes, a skullhead !

667
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,860
I hate this thing more than I hate Hamada's dish.

668
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,060
I understand.

669
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,060
Tanaka, I'm telling you we're on tv.

670
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,650
I think we're allowed to give 2 skeletons.

671
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,720
Yes, that wouldn't be too much.

672
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,010
This is not true...

673
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:07,230
Matsumoto

674
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:07,230
Watermelon freshness Pasta

675
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,230
His dish didn't get the desired effect. Result: 2 skeletons !

676
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,000
Matsumoto

677
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,000
Morning Tooth Pasta

678
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:12,000
At least, the peperoncino spaghettis with toothpasta

679
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,870
No, you don't need it at all.

680
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,280
Hang on a sec !

681
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,520
We're putting too much of it !

682
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,020
That's too much isn't it?

683
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,830
Not at all. Look, there's a lot of pasta.

684
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,330
If you want you can add mouthwash.

685
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,900
We don't want it !

686
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,340
Like if it was tequila.

687
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,670
It smells bad !!

688
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,050
What a smell. Incredible.

689
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,120
It smells like toilets.

690
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,450
Look, there's no more!

691
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,700
You served by yourself, that's why

692
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,990
It disappeared !

693
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,240
You're the one who decided for each plate, idiot !

694
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,390
Since you're the last one, you got a lot of toothpasta

695
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,800
I don't want to be the last one !

696
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,200
Record it !

697
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,760
They ate everything !

698
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,750
Nobody ate yet.

699
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,020
Good!

700
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,090
I don't want to eat it...

701
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,740
It looks refreshing.

702
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,690
We really feel the freshness, the smell is incredible.

703
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,390
Excuse me, but...

704
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,460
It's disgusting !

705
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,470
Taste this!

706
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,450
Sorry but I can't...

707
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,510
It smells like if shit happened.

708
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,550
Hamada-san, don't say that !

709
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,210
It's true!

710
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,190
It's like some sort of flavouring.

711
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,070
It smells...

712
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,970
like the deodorant for toilets

713
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,170
It's gonna be delicious~ !

714
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,260
Enormous.

715
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,590
Bon appetit !

716
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,400
I hear a small voice

717
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,860
deep inside me saying

718
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:01,350
The aftertaste is not bad at all

719
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,990
It could even be a batsu game !

720
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,930
It IS a batsu game!

721
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,080
Seriously, you have to taste it first.

722
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,940
We're preparing ourselves for it.

723
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,540
Ready?

724
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,080
It's not good at all.

725
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,340
Ouaah! The aftertaste is horrible !

726
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,170
What are you doing ?

727
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,410
We're adding the mouthwash.

728
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,200
It will get the smell out.

729
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,700
The smell comes from the peperoncino and toothpasta mixture.

730
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,470
I just added some mouthwash.

731
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,700
Now, it smells like kitchen scraps.

732
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,310
This is incredible.

733
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,600
It could be a weapon.

734
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,860
a weapon of mass destruction.

735
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,470
Incredible

736
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:55,300
I really want people to try this at home.

737
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,120
If we ate that everyday...

738
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,570
This thing is incredible.

739
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,530
We would become monsters!
