1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,350
Subbed and Timed by Outlaws0020.
Outlaws025 on some sites.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,880
Downtown's diary tells about lots of things

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,590
One of them is the hard batsu games

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,890
Matsumoto and Hamada have both tried it numerous times

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,000
It's become a sort of Downtown Trade Mark

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,900
The battle between the two keeps on going

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,310
Maybe it's because of the pride as man

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,480
They are both going after the victory, since that's the only way to avoid the batsu

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,080
It might be beautiful to some

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,490
Some might even say it's refreshing

11
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,090
But actually..

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,490
It's a hard battle for them

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,400
Unfortunately for them

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,700
A whole new batsu game is about to take place

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,410
Um... you're pretty confident in golf, right?

16
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,210
I'm very confident

17
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,910
Yamazaki, me and Cocorico..

18
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,520
us 4 vs you

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,420
Doesn't it sound a bit ridicules

20
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,390
No, no. It does sound ridicules,
but it's you after all

21
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,790
Like this

22
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,600
Well then.. let's do it

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,700
Do what?

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,200
Let's make a showdown
- Showdown?

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,500
Why?

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,210
Well.. when we are four.

27
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,310
You'll definitely die!

28
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,310
All four of us will have a knife
and go like: "Argh!"

29
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:02,200
This showdown is being held at the
maple point golf club

30
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,210
At 1:00 pm, precisely on time, Hamada arrives.

31
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,710
Good morning
- Good morning

32
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,910
Is it here?

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,620
Keep an eye on it

34
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,930
Huh? Is it the same?

35
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,230
Why's that?

36
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,240
30 minutes later, Matsumoto's team arrives

37
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,110
We are all wearing red jackets

38
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,720
Right?

39
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,520
Yea, it's unbelievable

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,520
What this?

41
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,830
Just take it, then I'll take this one

42
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,730
Hey you! What are you doing?

43
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,640
What's this doing here?

44
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:20,450
Welcome everyone to the Hamada, Matsumoto
and some other persons golf showdown!

45
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,950
Wait a second, what do you mean with
"Matsumoto and other persons"?

46
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,420
Yea, yea, yea

47
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,220
I think it's wrong!

48
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,720
Why do you care?

49
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,330
Well, actually this is only about me

50
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,930
It's still wrong, right?

51
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,930
Yea, yea

52
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,130
He gave up

53
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,730
He really did

54
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,140
It's alright? Peace
- Yea

55
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,140
Now here's the game rules

56
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,240
It's me vs the 4 of you

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,350
Every time I do 1 shot,
you guys have 4

58
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,850
We're going to need those 4 huh?

59
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,550
Yea, now we really can't lose!

60
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,830
Since I'm alone, I want Matsumoto
to do the tea shots

61
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,930
That's more fair right?

62
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,500
Yea, yea it is

63
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,340
He thinks I'm retarded

64
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,140
Do your best!

65
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,580
Second is Tanaka, Third is Endo
and last is Yamazaki

66
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,150
The first hole is 354 yards and par 4

67
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,260
It can be bit tricky as it bends to the left
and goes just past a lake

68
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,860
First up is Hamada with his first shot

69
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,370
What?
- He didn't hit it

70
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,240
Here I go

71
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,460
Matsumoto are you okay?

72
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,160
What going on?

73
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,960
You'll get it just as far right?

74
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,460
Yea, yea it'll be alright

75
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,670
But I really need a smoke now

76
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,840
Time for Matsumoto's first shot

77
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,580
I might not do so well today
cause I have a stiff shoulder

78
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,250
Are you okay?

79
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,590
You should have said so earlier!

80
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,960
It's okay

81
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,260
Really?

82
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,270
Okay go!

83
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,870
Make it fly far!

84
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,570
Bad! Bad!

85
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,180
Really bad!

86
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,450
Next is Tanaka. Which club will he pick?

87
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,250
This?

88
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,250
3-Iron... guess it's okay

89
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,260
This?

90
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,690
You look on it as if it's beautiful

91
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,860
Here I go

92
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,970
We rely on you Tanaka!

93
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,970
Where is it going?

94
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,370
Oh, it's there

95
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,250
There's high expectations for Endo.
Can he get it close to the hole?

96
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,260
Yes! Nice shot!

97
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,860
It's okay, it's okay!

98
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,370
Matsumoto's team has used 4 shots
While Hamada just used his second shot

99
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,670
To get it up to here

100
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,570
Hamada's third shot

101
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,670
It's pretty deep

102
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,810
Oh, it is

103
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,280
To the right! Right!

104
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,980
You think it'll go to the right?

105
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,490
You really are stupid

106
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,790
Oh no! This is bad!

107
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,800
Yea it got close!

108
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,560
Can't be true!
- Really?

109
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,800
This is pretty bad for us huh?

110
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,270
We have to be careful from here

111
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,970
Yea, we have to watch out for the bunker

112
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,680
If I just get it over there to the left
then I'll be happy

113
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,380
To the left and you'll be happy?

114
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,890
Just to the left of the edge over there

115
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,990
Left of the edge?

116
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,030
How is Yamazaki's shot going to be?

117
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,630
It's going! It's going!

118
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,030
It's great!

119
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,340
The 2-Iron really worked huh?

120
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
I would never have imagined that!

121
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
We can still win!

122
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,440
Yea, we can still reach it

123
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,940
Yes, it isn't to late yet

124
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,650
Now it's Matsumoto who have chosen the putter,
but can he pull it off?

125
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,050
Great!

126
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,860
It's going, going, going!

127
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,860
That wasn't bad!

128
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,830
Hamada has used 3 shots
Matsumoto's team has used 5

129
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,240
Hamada is on par if he get's this in.
But it looks pretty hard

130
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,840
Come on, go in!

131
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,250
How is Tanaka going to do?

132
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,060
That's not good , not good, not good!

133
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,160
Good!

134
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,260
Good!

135
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,560
Endo it's good!

136
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,470
Good! Okay, okay! Great!

137
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,470
Oh, he's got it!

138
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,380
Hamada made a Bogey

139
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,940
Awesome!

140
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,450
So that'll give you a score on 20, right?

141
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,950
Ok, we'll get no higher than 12

142
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,450
Okay, no higher than 12!

143
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,460
I'll have the pleasure of putting it in

144
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,260
Yea, go ahead

145
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,460
Thank you very much!

146
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,970
After the first hole
Matsumoto's team is in the lead

147
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,970
The second hole is 391 yards and par 4

148
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,380
It's said to be pretty difficult

149
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,080
This looks hard!

150
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,360
Hamada! Get over here!

151
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,460
This looks difficult even for me!

152
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,070
Hamada's tea shot. What's he going to do
at this difficult course

153
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,380
Here's Hamada first shot again
at this very challenging hole

154
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,590
That was all wrong

155
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,560
Now it's Matsumoto's chance to show
what he can do

156
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,060
Matsumoto-san..

157
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,970
You weren't even close at hitting it

158
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,070
Next up it's Hamada again with his second tea shot

159
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,480
Okay?

160
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,580
You used 12 hits at the tea

161
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,490
Matsumoto teams second shot taker is Tanaka

162
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,590
What?

163
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,990
Great!

164
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,160
Wait a sec, that's bad!

165
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,170
Can Yamazaki do it?

166
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,170
Oh, he did it!

167
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,370
Yes! It's there!

168
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,580
But the ball is in a bad position

169
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,490
How?

170
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,230
Wait a sec, I was practicing.

171
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,500
He was just practicing a bit, right?

172
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,240
Matsumoto's last challenge

173
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,670
It's to hard! It's impossible!

174
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,680
After that Tanaka had a shot
and now it's endo

175
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,380
Oh, in the bunker.

176
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,390
But it's good, that doesn't matter at all

177
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,090
After only his tea shot,
Hamada seems to be in trouble

178
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,590
Can he still get back in the game?

179
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,700
This looks pretty good

180
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,280
Matsumoto's team came back on the course

181
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,110
And are still far ahead of Hamada

182
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,220
Yamazaki this bunker looks hard
to get up from huh?

183
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,480
Ah, it does

184
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,330
Endo tells Yamazaki the "rules",
for when he's in a bunker

185
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,100
This is scary

186
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,700
Hey, hey, hey!
Didn't you touch it?

187
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,010
Yamazaki-san did you even listen
to what I said?

188
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,410
You, die!

189
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,580
I rely on you

190
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,890
Okay, okay! We got it out!

191
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,190
This is bad

192
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,500
He got it.
Nice

193
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,410
Have you secretly been practicing?

194
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,410
Yamazaki took his turn and now it's time
for Matsumoto with the 15th hit

195
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,610
I'll try to get it past the bunker

196
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,020
Aim a little bit to the right of the bunker

197
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,220
Is that so?

198
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,020
I'm just doing whatever you tell me to

199
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,630
Great!

200
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,230
What is this?

201
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,630
Great!

202
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,030
Super shot!

203
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,910
Matsumoto's miracle shot has forced Hamada
to get on the green

204
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,710
It's going to the right!

205
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,010
Oh, bunker!

206
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,720
My shot early really made me happy!

207
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,420
That's gotta happen more!

208
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,330
Hamada's bunker shot.
Can he chip it?

209
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,530
To long.

210
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,710
Hamada's third try to get on the green

211
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,440
Go further!

212
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,120
Tanaka with a bad 16th shot

213
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,330
Can Endo get it up after Tanaka's failure?

214
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,440
Yamazaki go on!

215
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,240
Me right?

216
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,940
Yea

217
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,050
Don't beam away now,
you have to be in the moment

218
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,660
Come on, home already!

219
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Go home

220
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,130
Here I go

221
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Matsumoto's team is in the lead!

222
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,550
Matsumoto's team has gone inside
for a rest

223
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,560
In the meantime Hamada is out training
for the last hole

224
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,060
Oh, he's outside

225
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,560
Why?

226
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,860
Oh, he got it

227
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,670
Yamazaki maybe you should go out
and tell him to "wait, wait, wait"!

228
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,170
Wait, wait, wait!

229
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,870
Wait ,wait!

230
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,850
Oh, nice shot!

231
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,650
The batsu game is near.
Only one hole left

232
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,980
So last hole

233
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,850
We finally made it to there

234
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,860
It's soon time to
declare the winner

235
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,060
That's right... We'll probably get in a conflict
for first and second place

236
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,560
So Hamada do you think it was
a mistake of you to do this?

237
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,170
Well a little, cause these rules
are really weird

238
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,580
A thing that really surprised me was
that Endo is so good at this

239
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:18,280
Well I honestly just think I was lucky
to hit the ball that well

240
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,260
Last is this 543 yards par 5 hole

241
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,860
It's breaking to the right
which makes it a difficult hole

242
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,100
Here I go

243
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,870
First up is Hamada's tea shot

244
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,870
Great!

245
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,340
Yards

246
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,980
Wo~ awesome

247
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,580
That was really awesome!

248
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,880
Next it's Matsumoto

249
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Wait a sec

250
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:59,990
My drive... is like this.
That's why I hit the ground

251
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:06,570
This time I'll try to raise it higher

252
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,970
I think it's going to work

253
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,510
Okay, let's see

254
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,160
Yards

255
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,700
That was really great!

256
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Hamada had a bad second shot

257
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,010
And Tanaka didn't do much better

258
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,610
Can they make a super shot now?

259
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:09,490
Matsumoto's team is getting closer
and closer to the batsu game

260
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,200
Then Tanaka 13th shot

261
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,480
Really good Tanaka!

262
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,380
After that Endo made a crooked shot
and Hamada came even closer to the green

263
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,190
Then a chance to get close to the flag

264
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,190
Keep going, keep going!

265
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,400
Matsumoto's team Yamazaki

266
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,510
Bad! This is bad!

267
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,590
Then on the 20th it's Matsumoto's turn

268
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,490
I'll try to get it up this way

269
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,090
The batsu game is approaching

270
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,090
Here I go

271
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,830
Good! Go in, go in!

272
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,640
I'm really good at this!

273
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,340
Then Hamada's put

274
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,320
Hamada missed another put after,
but got it in on his 9th stroke

275
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,320
In the meantime Matsumoto's team
is still on the green

276
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,030
But they don't seem to be able to make
the ball go in

277
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,830
This is it!

278
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,040
What do you say to take
one last hole?

279
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,350
What?

280
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,050
Just one last hole.
Give me a chance

281
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,060
Why did you even have to talk about that

282
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,260
Then no

283
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,060
Wait

284
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,860
We might lose

285
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,230
It's scary

286
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,340
Somehow Hamada got his will,
so they'll play one last round

287
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,840
This hole is 392 yards and par 4

288
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,650
It's straight all the way to the green,
but there's lots of bunkers

289
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,450
It's a difficult hole

290
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,950
Here I go

291
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,190
You surprised me
- Are you okay?

292
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,660
It really surprised me

293
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,860
Matsumoto's team has used 7 shots
while Hamada has used 6

294
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,960
They both in the bunker

295
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,970
Matsumoto teams 8th shooter is Yamazaki

296
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,170
He'll try to take on this difficult bunker shot

297
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,040
No good!

298
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,350
6 shots later Matsumoto's team is still
trying to get up on the green

299
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,260
Oh, that's good

300
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,360
Hamada with a nice out (out of
the bunker shot

301
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,960
Matsumoto's team might regret doing this,
here it's Yamazaki

302
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,470
It went further down

303
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,480
Even further! How are we gonna do this?

304
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,380
You almost can't see it

305
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,280
What is this?
- Wait a second

306
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,760
Go ahead

307
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
It's going, going, going!

308
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,370
It went to far now

309
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,470
Shortly after Matsumoto's team
made it to the green

310
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,170
And Hamada took his 8th shot

311
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,880
But even tho Hamada had done everything he could

312
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
This happened...

313
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,690
So that'll say that Hamada is up
for a batsu game!

314
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:39,660
The losing Hamada is to do a batsu game!

315
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,870
In the past Hamada has done many
different batsu games

316
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:49,370
Such as getting water and skydiving

317
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:59,780
Getting water in France and later
going to New York to get a pen

318
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,290
Then this time.. what will Hamada have to do
