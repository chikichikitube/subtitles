00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,550
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,700
This 'aint bad

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,020
Letâ€™s get on with our first presenter please

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,220
Someone gonna come out?

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
It's Magical Lovely!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,700
It's Magic Love!
-It's us

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,070
Your collar looks a bit damp

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,300
I've never worn this before

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,880
It suits you so well!

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,280
I want to wear it for the rest of my life

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,250
Didn't we win the championship in M-1?

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,020
Do you remember the segment we won the championship with?

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,960
The S&M tax one, right?

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,650
That was Football Hour
-Oh

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,160
Your statement is a bit problematic

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,000
Did you see it?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The bicycle bell, right?
-That's Tutorial

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,340
This isn't a guessing game!

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,970
What about you?

20
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,240
How do I say it? Is it the one with the hoops?

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,980
Ah, that's the one

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm hanging on by a thread here

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,570
What's so concerning about this?

24
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,450
We won the championship with this segment

25
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,200
This time we brought this hypothesis based on the routine we performed in M-1

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,420
This is it

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:28,400
In light of Magical Lovely's "ring" routine, even on a shaking train, Noda Crystal should be able to keep standing without using the hoops

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,700
So that's it

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,950
This is it
-A remarkable hypothesis

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,640
After half a year, we finally made this project

31
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,500
What does everyone thing, does everyone here regularly ride the train?

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,300
I usually use it.
-I don't use it much

33
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,520
Do you ever ride the Yamanote Line or something like that?

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,200
Never, right?
-No

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,420
Never use the Yamanote line
-So you never use it

36
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,460
As expected, since when did you stop using it?

37
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,190
When I became a big shot

38
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,620
It's true. I don't see many big names on the train.
-I guess so

39
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,070
Next: Don't grab the rings! The Noda Crystal Championship

40
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,870
This is not good.
-This is too difficult

41
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,840
And

42
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,710
Excuse me, can I?
-Of course

43
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,750
If a random old man suddenly appears to give advice

44
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,900
And then later appears the recording site as a director

45
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,100
Will the comedians hastily change their routine?

46
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:46,510
In light of Magical Lovely's "ring" routine, even on a shaking train, Noda Crystal should be able to keep standing without grabbing the ring

47
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,770
Probably not JR

48
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,300
Not JR

49
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,920
Don't grab the ring! The Noda Crystal Championship

50
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,250
They all went to Chiba!

51
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,030
You're in the zone, Noda is in the zone!

52
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,100
Like the segment we performed in the M-1 final last year

53
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:11,470
This time we will challenge whether its possible to not grab the ring on a shaky train

54
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,470
Why's he there!?

55
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,950
This time, in addition to Noda Crystal

56
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:21,350
There are also the following four players who have expertise in physical strength, balance and railroad knowledge

57
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,620
This lineup is awesome

58
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,010
How do you feel, Noda?

59
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,850
I really do not need to grab the ring

60
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,390
I'm just here to show you that.
-But you fell on the floor, didn't you?

61
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,890
I was in a bad state that day

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,760
Let me introduce the rules

63
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,930
Everyone will stand on a 45cm diameter platform in the carriage

64
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,820
So small

65
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,300
The challenge is to not fall off the platform from the starting station to the end station

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,370
The stage for implementing the validation is

67
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,950
A local route in Chiba Prefecture known for its violent shaking, Kominato Railway

68
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,680
Kominato Railroad this tram itself is very old

69
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,460
The shaking is the same as that of the Showa era

70
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,260
There are a lot of corners.
-I see

71
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,800
And so, they get ready

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,650
Shakes a lot

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,660
So small

74
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,600
They'll all be out super quick, surely

75
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,870
This is too small

76
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,110
It's small.
-Much smaller than I thought

77
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,040
How do you feel when you step on the stage?

78
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,780
So small

79
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,250
It's small.
-Too small

80
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,380
The moment I stepped on this platform, I didn't feel good

81
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,890
But I think, in a usual train ride, you usually have a small amount of space

82
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,650
Why are you still wearing a jacket?

83
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,620
Why are you not showing your muscles?

84
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,130
So maybe its not too difficult

85
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,550
What are you doing here?

86
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,230
How do you feel, Orakio?

87
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,460
No problem at all

88
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,770
I rely on my sense of balance

89
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,750
Yeah, he's a gymnast

90
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,470
I won't even move a bit on this

91
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,470
Looks so strong

92
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,770
Yamada seems pretty suited too

93
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,110
What are you doing?

94
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,940
Pretty impressive

95
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,940
He absolutely can't

96
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:05,000
From the first to the last station

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,970
A total of 18 stops, the estimated travel time is about one and a half hours

98
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,300
Who will be able endure until the end without grabbing the hoop?

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,770
Who? Noda has to win!
-Yes

100
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,800
So, the Noda Crystal Tournament begins

101
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,400
It's my tournament

102
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,070
So this is the Noda Crystal Tournament?

103
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,070
It's moving

104
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,370
But now the car is still very slow, right?

105
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,170
I do not want to grab the ring!

106
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,940
Quite slow, quite slow

107
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,540
OK OK OK OK OK

108
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,610
If its like this, its fine

109
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,150
If it suddenly speed ups, what should we do?
-Its unpredictable

110
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,610
Can feel a sense of gravity

111
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,720
The sense of vibration is transmitted to the centre of the foot

112
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,090
The horizontal shake is also very strong

113
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,350
It's tough

114
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,690
Gotta stand for an hour...

115
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,820
It's difficult

116
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,460
It's faster than I expected!

117
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,790
It's pretty fast now

118
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,390
This is bad!

119
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,230
So this is how it is!

120
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,500
So hard

121
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,430
Shaking so much

122
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,270
Look at the rings, they're shaking so much!

123
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,730
So shaky!

124
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,820
Yes, you can watch the rings

125
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,200
Moving up and down a lot too

126
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,370
I can't.
-This is really hard

127
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,910
The thought of standing like this for a long time is tough

128
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,770
With more violent shaking than expected, everyone is shocked

129
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,400
Never seen anything like it

130
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,620
Then

131
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,650
We're going into a big turn now

132
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,420
I wonder how everyone will deal with it

133
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,720
One minute after the departure, the train reached a big turn

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,200
The whole thing is tilted

135
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,330
Definitely can't keep this up for an hour

136
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,130
It's too hard

137
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,800
I can't.
-Might not be able to hold on

138
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,400
So hard

139
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,370
Ah!

140
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,110
This is very difficult

141
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,520
Noda's in trouble

142
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,880
It's really shaky!

143
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,250
This is really impossible

144
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,980
Its impossible

145
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,380
Once the energy is not concentrated its dangerous

146
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,100
All they can say is its impossible

147
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,350
Even to one station is hard enough

148
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,050
Oh, no
-Eh!?

149
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,490
This guy sucks
-Too bad

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,200
No, wait.
-Are you serious?

151
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,050
What are you doing?

152
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,520
1 minute and 33 seconds into the game

153
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,170
Haven't even reached the first stop yet

154
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,910
Unexpectedly, Noda Crystal is the first to fall

155
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,780
How dare you grab the ring, just don't grab anything, fall straight to the floor!

156
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,120
That's too dangerous...

157
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,420
No, Noda!

158
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,860
What is the point of this verification now!?

159
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,360
I'm glad you guys are holding it together!

160
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,600
Your routine wouldn't even be finished after this amount of time!

161
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,300
Honorable Mr. Noda, so soon

162
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,040
I can't do it

163
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Sit down

164
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,970
Absolutely impossible

165
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,170
It is not absolutely impossible to do

166
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,910
Everyone is holding on, Yamada and the others

167
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,710
Absolutely not.
-Yoshikawa is still going

168
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,010
Can't even last one stop

169
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,980
Our main character is gone
-Noda!

170
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,390
With Noda gone, what are the rest of us still doing here?

171
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,160
Coming to a stop?

172
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,430
Stopping time, stopping is not good

173
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,170
Stopping is indeed quite scary

174
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,060
Whoa!

175
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,700
It'll happen like this

176
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,970
Ah, not good!

177
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,370
This is so tiring

178
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,970
It is true, this is common when entering the station

179
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,240
Ok, got it

180
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,280
We've passed the fork point

181
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,270
This kind of fork in the road is very dangerous

182
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,220
We've arrived at the station, coming in there was a lot of shaking

183
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,220
Will it shake here?

184
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
We've stopped now

185
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,450
Yoshikawa is still going

186
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,920
Shoji, it feels so tense here

187
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,330
I don't really train here much

188
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,400
Who'd use this part?

189
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,900
It's time to go again

190
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,970
It's too fast, isn't it?

191
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,200
17 stops left

192
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,270
It's still early

193
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,270
Everyone pay attention!

194
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,270
Noda, you!

195
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,270
It takes a while to pick up speed to begin with

196
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,070
Go home, you!

197
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,510
Isn't it a little too fast?

198
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,080
It's really too hard, isn't it?

199
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,530
Get off at the next stop!

200
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,510
It's too hard, isn't it?

201
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,850
It's too fast. The car is still picking up speed.

202
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,120
It's overtaking!

203
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,120
So scary!

204
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,020
Next we will enter a big turn

205
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
Turning in this state will be tough

206
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,290
A big turn

207
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,690
This is a relatively fast state to turn in

208
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,600
We're all shaking in the same way

209
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,400
Hold on!

210
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,570
Yes, everyone is in a similar state

211
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,420
Are we there yet?

212
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,810
See, I told you! Yamada can't do it!

213
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,510
Don't say "I told you Yamada can't do it!"

214
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,800
Are we there yet?

215
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,520
Yamada has fallen!

216
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,260
Yamada! How come?

217
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,420
Carelessness

218
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,320
Six minutes into the match, Yamada drops out of the race

219
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,600
How do you feel?

220
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,630
It's not a usual type of shaking

221
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,200
I kept my balance like this

222
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,170
So my legs are at their limit

223
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,570
I see

224
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,350
It's only been two stops?

225
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,300
It shouldn't take long for everyone to fall, right?

226
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm exhausted

227
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,150
Is it tiring?

228
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,580
Quite exhausting

229
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,420
It's gone. It's gone.
-So fast!

230
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,120
The departure is so fast!

231
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,760
Yoshikawa is surprisingly tenacious

232
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,250
After that, the fork in the road that produced the violent shaking just now reappears

233
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,560
Focus

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,650
So

235
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,870
By the way, here's the thing, the fork

236
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,680
If you fall it should look like this!

237
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,250
I do want to do the same

238
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,100
Yamada didn't do it either

239
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,820
This is it

240
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,220
This is the effect you want

241
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,660
Damn

242
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,570
What a beautiful fall, Shoji!

243
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,320
Nine minutes into the game, Shoji drops out

244
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,820
On the way to the third station, more than half of the people have fallen behind

245
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,550
It's too fast

246
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,380
One stop at a time.
-Is this project really okay?

247
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,150
Gymnastics practice is worth it

248
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,350
Left, retired Orakio

249
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:20,600
And Darling Honey's Yoshikawa

250
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,550
He seems to know this line

251
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,500
In fact, in the interview before the start of the competition

252
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,300
I know Kominato Railway better than anyone else

253
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,840
The degree of shaking, the turns, I know it like the back of my hand

254
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,710
No problem

255
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,540
How many times have you ridden it?

256
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,910
This railway...

257
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,680
50 times or so

258
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,500
Awesome!

259
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,950
50 times?
-Yes

260
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,820
So it's no accident that Yoshikawa has made it this far

261
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,620
Thus, its a battle of body vs mind

262
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,050
The two sides both tolerate the shaking for the next 15 minutes

263
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,770
It's pretty shaky.
-Yes

264
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,570
Ah not good

265
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,170
So shaky!

266
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,070
Is it really that shaky?

267
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,980
Even the rings are shaking loads

268
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,000
More shaky than expected

269
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,170
You'd surely fall

270
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,760
Ah!

271
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,070
Yoshikawa has won!

272
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,830
Yes!

273
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,540
So happy!

274
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,220
Darling Honey's Yoshikawa wins the championship after 23 minutes

275
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,470
Impressive!

276
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,020
However

277
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,750
Well, I was wondering, can I continue to the end of the line?

278
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,420
I am alone

279
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,760
Eh?

280
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,030
Haven't we got the railway under contract now?
-Yes

281
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,600
This is too wasteful

282
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,100
So the next step is out of Yoshikawa's interest

283
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,120
How much can the record be extended?

284
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,210
What the hell is going on now?

285
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:23,410
A person who looks like a train conductor standing in the middle of a shaking train, what is this?

286
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,720
After that he continued his lonely challenge alone

287
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,570
And lasted an hour in the shaking train

288
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,570
So strong

289
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,170
Finally

290
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,260
Oh wow, so dangerous!

291
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,430
Yes!

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,050
Darling Honey's Yoshikawa - Complete Railroad Domination!

293
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,940
Awesome!

294
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,010
Thank you for your hard work

295
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,800
That's awesome

296
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,280
Can't even stand up anymore

297
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,710
He's become a ring, just like in our routine

298
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,690
I really have no desire to try this again

299
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,350
It's really too tough

300
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,060
Thank you

301
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,260
He's not even in the same dimension right now

302
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,890
So let's move on to the second round

303
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,530
Eh?

304
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,860
Don't talk as if we all know about it

305
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,800
We didn't even know there was a second round

306
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,800
Yes, in fact, Kominato Railroad is the first round of the challenge

307
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,570
The total score of the next round will be added to determine the final winner

308
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,980
How about the bottom 60 points?

309
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,810
This score is really not reasonable

310
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,450
The venue for the next round is

311
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,060
Ladies and gentlemen, we have arrived at the site of the second round of the competition

312
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,950
Quite far away

313
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,730
The second round...

314
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,200
There's no train here

315
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,000
The second round is to ride this

316
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,530
That one

317
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,470
Eh?

318
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,040
Bus

319
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,910
This also has rings, right?

320
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:01,610
The second round is to take the bus that runs a cross-country route

321
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,950
There is no bus that runs this kind of line

322
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,750
This is not the same as the shows you watch when you're a kid

323
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:28,500
The second round of the race is to take the cross-country bus line for 2 minutes

324
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:35,270
Holding the side, sitting or falling will result in a loss of points

325
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,150
These are the rules

326
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,290
Although it is a competition, its more like a punishment game, right?

327
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,790
How many points are deducted for falling down or holding onto something?

328
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,100
Touching the handrail or the body of the car results in minus 5 points

329
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,750
If you accidentally sit down, you lose 15 points

330
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,470
If you fall on the ground, congratulations, minus 30 points

331
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,910
If I fall twice, I'll get a zero?
-Yes

332
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,080
Am I a 100?
-Yes, 100 points

333
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,280
And what is the score of the person behind me?

334
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,510
It's me. I have 90 points

335
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,480
I'm upset there's only a difference of 10 points between us

336
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,550
My advantage is too weak, right?

337
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,360
Fall twice and you're at the bottom

338
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,560
Your love of the railway is now useless

339
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,160
I've lost all motivation

340
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,770
So, the challenge is from lowest to highest score in the first round

341
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,350
One by one!

342
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,720
First, Noda Crystal takes on the challenge

343
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,270
Noda, are you ready?

344
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,710
My goal is a perfect pass

345
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,210
Please

346
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,550
To maintain a score of 60

347
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,850
Good

348
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,450
Show us how cool you are

349
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,920
Like walking to the stage of M-1

350
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,970
Looking good

351
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,190
Wow, it's so narrow!

352
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,650
Next is the second round, Noda's challenge.

353
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,650
To avoid injury, there are some protective measures

354
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,060
Start!

355
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,100
Come on!

356
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,750
Padding all around

357
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,020
So caring

358
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,500
What a gentle program

359
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,570
Immediately after the start, the first challenger is greeted by the snake area

360
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,650
What'll happen?

361
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,100
The vehicle is now moving

362
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,020
It's not easy

363
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,170
Too fast!

364
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,450
Sitting!

365
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,900
Then held the armrest

366
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,050
Contact!

367
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,400
Awful

368
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,000
Sitting!

369
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,670
Don't mess around here

370
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,270
Seriously, it was super unsteady

371
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,920
Contact!

372
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,450
Contact!

373
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,270
Contact!

374
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,750
Contact! Contact!

375
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,820
The whistle doesn't stop

376
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,770
Sitting!

377
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,620
Contact!

378
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,910
He's losing points!
-It's bad

379
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,600
Next is to pass through the longitudinal bumpy area of the big bulge

380
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,170
Now it's 0 points, right?

381
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,270
Not fell over yet

382
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,900
Contact!

383
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,850
Fall!

384
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,170
Straight down

385
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,220
Contact!

386
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,770
Contact!

387
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,670
Contact!

388
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,650
The last section is the highest difficulty

389
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,150
The score's already bad enough

390
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,550
Sitting!

391
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:34,390
Score continues to decrease for sitting for 3 seconds

392
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,050
3 2 1 Sitting!

393
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,000
3 2 1 Sitting!

394
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,020
You can't even stand up.
-Stand up!

395
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,400
Can't stand up really

396
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,050
3 2 Contact!

397
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,850
Still holding on
-What's wrong with this guy?

398
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,860
Contact!

399
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,700
Fall!

400
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,350
The End

401
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,970
That's hard to top

402
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,100
Looks like a tough fight

403
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,340
It's bad. I'm going to throw up

404
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,340
His face is bloodless

405
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,610
Really, you look pale

406
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,050
Noda, if you want to throw up, there is a bucket over there

407
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,850
How do you feel, Noda?

408
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,950
As it went on, it becomes a battle to not vomit
-Is that so?

409
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,720
Noda's score results are as follows

410
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,720
His meager savings from round one were squandered in a flash

411
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,920
Final Score -265 points

412
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,800
What are you doing here?

413
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,420
Next is Yamada's challenge

414
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,020
Do we have to see Yamada, can we not?

415
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,820
Contact!

416
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,400
Although there was partial contact, he did not fall completely

417
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:39,620
Although he avoided a significant decrease in points, there wasn't much point to watch

418
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,550
Awesome

419
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,200
Next is Shoji's challenge

420
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,570
Lowering the body's weight appears to be a smoother start

421
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,220
Contact!

422
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,270
Picked himself up with his face!

423
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,850
Contact!

424
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,870
His head hit it!

425
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,100
Contact!

426
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,120
Fall!

427
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,120
Contact!

428
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,350
Fall!

429
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,200
Look at his face, he's not faking anything

430
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,700
Because he is trying to win the championship

431
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,770
Contact!

432
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,520
Fall!

433
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,350
That hurts

434
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,300
Grounded and multiple bursts of contact

435
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,400
Contact!

436
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,600
Contact!

437
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,020
Fall!

438
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,250
Two instances of contact!

439
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,500
Contact!

440
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,600
Fall!

441
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,480
Sitting!

442
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,350
So dangerous, so dangerous

443
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,270
So, the results...

444
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,400
So fast!

445
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,550
Contact!

446
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Contact!

447
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,670
The End

448
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,320
Seven falls lead to a large reduction in points

449
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,400
Better than Noda

450
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,650
Yamada is only -40 points

451
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,170
Next, Orakio used his natural sense of balance

452
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:07,120
Like Yamada, there were few deductions and points to see

453
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:14,170
So, Orakio overtakes Yamada for the first place by using the first round score difference

454
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,220
The high score is not very impressive

455
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,460
The guy who wants to win is the most boring

456
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,970
Finally, Darling Honey Yoshikawa's challenge

457
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,470
If he can keep losses within 120 points, he can win the championship

458
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,500
What will happen?

459
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,220
No problem, right?

460
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,170
He's the lightest and looks the most unstable

461
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,100
Contact!

462
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,300
Contact!

463
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,370
Contact!

464
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,720
Not resistant to gravity?

465
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,390
That's how it goes

466
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,790
Contact!

467
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,350
Buses are not Yoshikawa's area of expertise

468
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,570
So with his advantage nullified, he incurs consecutive penalties

469
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,030
Sitting!

470
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,470
He's down
-Sitting down is no good

471
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,700
Ok!

472
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,100
Contact!

473
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:08,510
Fall!

474
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,340
Down, down, down

475
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,200
Only 40 points left

476
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,250
Contact!

477
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,470
You can do it!

478
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,350
Contact!

479
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Fall!

480
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,700
Fall!

481
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,890
It's not the same person as the one on the train just now

482
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,700
In summary

483
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,700
The winner was Orakio

484
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,320
What a way to end it

485
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,350
That's him!
-It's Orakio

486
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,370
The winner of the championship was the least interesting, what is this farce

487
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,270
But the one who had it hardest on the bus was Murakami, right?

488
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,310
I did it six times.
-Every time

489
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,850
You'd want to throw up, wouldn't you?
-It's really not good

490
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,850
So, Matsumoto, could you do it?

491
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,480
No problem

492
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,750
Next time please have a go then

493
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,120
How can there be a second time for this shitty project?

494
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,760
No?
-No second or third time?

495
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,690
Even the winner got cut out!

496
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,460
Here's the thing

497
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,000
As the creator of the game, you're definitely a major weakness

498
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,870
Orakio realized that if you hold on with your hands, you won't fall

499
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,070
The points were saved, but the footage was lost

500
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,470
Too cunning.
-He exploited a loophole

501
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,520
Let's welcome the next presenter

502
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,490
Hello everyone

503
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,340
It's Yoshimura!

504
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,410
What's wrong? What's wrong?

505
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,960
It's okay, right? You still have enough time?

506
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,420
Without further ado

507
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,190
So, did everyone have to show their routines to scriptwriters and show staff when they were new to the business?

508
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,100
Sure

509
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,650
You would have gotten a lot of advice at such times

510
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,240
The theory I bring today is this:

511
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:59,080
If an old man, who later appears as a director on a set, critiques your routine, will you hastily make modifications according to their comments?

512
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,070
It's this

513
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,110
Super interesting

514
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,720
I see

515
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,520
This is it

516
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,120
This situation is rare

517
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,460
It happens in dramas, right?

518
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:07,860
Yes, yes

519
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,140
Yamazaki, what would you do if a strange old man suddenly told you how to improve something?

520
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,300
I wouldn't change it

521
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,200
What if in a few days that person appears as a person of status on the scene of the TV station

522
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,090
Do you mean the current me?

523
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,740
Yes, yes, yes

524
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,570
Or I just joined the industry and am longing for my shot at stardom?

525
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,110
The time of longing

526
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,360
I still wouldn't change it

527
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,640
I wouldn't give in

528
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,650
What about now?

529
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,170
Now i'd change it immediately

530
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,280
What would Downtown do in such a situation?

531
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,390
An elderly gentleman

532
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,620
Just a random elderly gentleman

533
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,230
It'd depend on the situation

534
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,130
If it was a charming old gentleman it'd be fine

535
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,530
It's different if it was just some tootheless old man

536
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,400
That's not a gentlemen

537
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,870
That's just "old"

538
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,940
Is a gentleman's status determined by the number of teeth he has?

539
00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:08,150
If an old man, who later appears as a director on a set, critiques your routine, will you hastily make modifications according to their comments?

540
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:16,630
So the first group called to a coffee shop for the fake program meeting is

541
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,330
Nishkikoi

542
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,650
Seems like they type who'd go with it

543
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:29,610
TBS is expending effort regarding variety shows
-Good

544
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,570
The fake program prepared this time is

545
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,350
A comedy contest

546
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:44,340
If they win, they'll get a regular spot on a show

547
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,150
Set to be a big project that TBS executives attach great importance to

548
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,500
Eyes wide open!

549
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,570
Such a stern expression

550
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,630
Speaking honestly

551
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,140
This is a good chance for exposure

552
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,670
If there is a place for us...

553
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,210
It's that...

554
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,580
The trend of the times, right?

555
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,550
That we can also have such an opportunity

556
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,050
For groups wanting to improve

557
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,490
This is an important program that has the potential for growth

558
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,790
They'll probably change their approach

559
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,090
If possible

560
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,260
Can you perform something now?

561
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,170
Let me film it
-Here?

562
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,970
The store said it's ok

563
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,870
So

564
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,270
Hello everyone

565
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,640
So noisy!

566
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,340
They perform a routine at the cafe while being mindful of the surroundings

567
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,190
And they have yet to notice the object of later concern

568
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:59,540
The old gentleman who will comment on their routine

569
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,540
Ah-

570
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,970
Lots of effort

571
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,290
Really

572
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,740
It's a big opportunity after all

573
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,710
And so, the routine is over

574
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,340
Finally its time for the enigmatic old gentleman to come forward and make some suggestions

575
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,790
Excuse me, I have to take a call

576
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,620
The old guy's gonna appear now?

577
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,030
Once the staff member leaves

578
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,400
The elderly man advances

579
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,930
Excuse me

580
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,500
Eh?

581
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:43,070
I just took the liberty of listening to your routine just then

582
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,320
Good acting

583
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,780
Sorry

584
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,220
Seems like a nice guy at least

585
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,540
Sorry to bother you

586
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,510
Very interesting!

587
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:53,920
But I think a little change would make it more interesting

588
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,230
Sometimes you meet people like this

589
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,630
Impressive

590
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:02,830
When you say "Hello everyone" at the beginning

591
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,830
Stick out your tongue

592
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:17,270
Suggestion 1 Stick your tongue out when saying hello

593
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,530
How about making a funny face?

594
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,780
Hello everyone

595
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,740
Like this

596
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,520
What is this?

597
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,310
Ah...

598
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,280
Facing the random old man sticking out his tongue

599
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,010
The two awkwardly smile

600
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,370
They're nice guys after all

601
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,650
And

602
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,620
When do you that bit

603
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,880
Learn it well!

604
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:40,030
You don't seem to be doing anything

605
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,430
You could also just spit your tongue out

606
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,470
Crazy guidance

607
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,800
He loves the tongue thing

608
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,940
Follow the rhythm

609
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:59,480
Suggestion 2  Both stick your tongues out

610
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,920
Talking so much!

611
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,550
The "wow" at the beginning

612
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,320
Unique taste

613
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,290
Nice people, smiling and listening

614
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:04,840
A suggestion that Watanabe also sticks out his tongue

615
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,280
Then

616
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,660
It's a koi, right?

617
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:20,270
Suggestion 3  End with a leaping koi

618
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,420
After that, further suggestions for improvement are made

619
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,580
Listening closely

620
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,840
It'd be fun to do it like that

621
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
You'll become as famous as The Drifters

622
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,420
Finally, he leaves with the statement that they'll reach comedy heights if they follow his advice

623
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,180
The old gentleman's instruction is over

624
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,060
Really like a weird old granddad

625
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,190
They listened very carefully!

626
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,190
Thank you

627
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,790
What's wrong? What's wrong?

628
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,900
What kind of mood is this?

629
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,570
Scary

630
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,270
It would be off putting, right?

631
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,210
Said it was scary

632
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,080
He instantly...thought of so many pointers

633
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,050
Could he actually be a powerful person?

634
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:09,090
The kind of person you pay for help?

635
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,500
So vulgar!

636
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,180
I see

637
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,160
And very neatly dressed too

638
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,800
A gentlemen

639
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:20,250
An man that's easy to imagine soliciting a fee for his help

640
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,040
A week later, the two will the old gentleman again unexpectedly

641
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,730
It is completely the plot of a TV series

642
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,500
Will they recognize him?

643
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,570
Will Nishikoi actually add a sticking out tongue to their routine?

644
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,330
The second group target is Joyman

645
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,240
Very serious

646
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,360
Of course they are going to perform the usual rhyming rap routine

647
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,130
They put in a lot of effort

648
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,630
So, we fast forward to the advice

649
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:59,440
Excuse me

650
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,710
I just listened to your routine without permission.
-I'm sorry for disturbing you

651
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:12,320
I think you should change it

652
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,820
I think it would be more interesting

653
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,130
Tough to say

654
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,620
Really?

655
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,290
At the beginning "What's wrong with this guy?

656
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,320
Can't say "you're annoying"

657
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,790
That's what you said, right?

658
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,700
The response should be a bit more exaggerated

659
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,430
A bigger reaction

660
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,030
Be more suprised when saying "What's wrong with this guy"?

661
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,440
"What's wrong with this guy?"

662
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,670
Skilled at acting

663
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,390
It's scary

664
00:31:35,440 --> 00:32:06,500
Suggestion 1  What's wrong with this guy~ (Over the top)

665
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,840
This... everyone will be shocked

666
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,890
An exaggerated "what's going on with this guy?"

667
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,520
Right at the start

668
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,920
"Sorry for the sudden appearance. I'm really sorry."

669
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,010
What's wrong with this guy?~

670
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,130
They'll be surprised

671
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,330
Do it to this extent

672
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,370
It's tough

673
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,500
Of course the action should be exaggerated

674
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,930
And for the rap part...

675
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:18,380
"Lemon Tea Milktea The Tokyo Big City"

676
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,750
This place is slightly...

677
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,190
I'm embarassed

678
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,890
Eh?

679
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:29,160
Taking out some notes he made while watching

680
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,460
Rewrite the lyrics

681
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,830
For example
-Are you a rapper?

682
00:32:34,000 --> 00:33:01,290
Suggestion 2  Change rap lyrics

683
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,200
Coin toss

684
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,470
The obverse is lemon tea, the reverse is the corrupt Tokyo city

685
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:49,010
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Endless Donation Party

686
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:49,010
â€»Donation party: A party held for a fee to raise political funds

687
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,820
Why be so controversial

688
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:54,420
Endless parties, save minorities

689
00:32:54,420 --> 00:33:01,290
Save minorities, fallen diversity

690
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,040
Not bad

691
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,470
A powerful message

692
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,090
Very sharp!

693
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,560
The meaning is a bit strong

694
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,800
Is there such a meaningful routine?

695
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,650
Older but aggressive in dissing those in power

696
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,190
Joyman doesn't know what to do

697
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,360
Super interesting

698
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,610
Take this if you want

699
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,600
I can't believe he gave it to them

700
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,870
His notes are passed over

701
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,770
End of suggestions

702
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,080
Will it be changed?

703
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,180
This note is a bit scary

704
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,280
And finally

705
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,530
Men should just shut up

706
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,690
That one...

707
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,100
Nowadays

708
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,230
Equality between men and women is also very important

709
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:49,870
Saying to them that this paragraph emphasizing machismo is no longer in line with the times

710
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,330
This is the reason

711
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,780
Change the part of "men" to "office workers"

712
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:00,350
Suggestion 1  Change "men" to "office workers"

713
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,830
He suggests changing the routine to a work theme instead

714
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,940
A big change

715
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,920
And

716
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,290
After changing to the office worker version

717
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,660
You should wear a suit

718
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:13,560
Suggestion 2   Change to a suit

719
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,970
After indicating to them suits are good

720
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,650
The suggestions end

721
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,830
Then let's change it like this

722
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,050
When the identity of the old man is revealed

723
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,640
Will these three groups scramble to take his advice?

724
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,460
So, a week later

725
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,070
Nishkikoi came to TBS

726
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,290
Go to the TBS managers' lounge

727
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,890
They greet the executives

728
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,000
So

729
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,770
We are Nishkikoi

730
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,870
Very much looking forward to today's show

731
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,230
We'll do our best

732
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,300
Please feel free to play

733
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,070
Thank you

734
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,050
This kind of atmosphere is common

735
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,410
We're full on energy today

736
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,840
Definitely nervous

737
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,440
After the usual greetings

738
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,650
Please say hello

739
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,820
Director Morita

740
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,090
I like both of them very much and highly recommend them

741
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,010
They've noticed

742
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,860
Thank you

743
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,140
The two are surprised to see a familiar face

744
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,630
A look of "it's that guy"

745
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,140
He's worked on many TBS shows

746
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,570
Let's not talk about that

747
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,980
I've seen them all

748
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:38,510
A clear vibe of "it's him"

749
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,310
"It's him"

750
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,930
Go for it!

751
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,680
Please take care

752
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,490
We managers are looking forward to

753
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,930
Not saying anything

754
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,660
They'll surely change

755
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,960
Please take care of us

756
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:55,210
In the face of this miraculous reunion, what does Nishkikoi think?

757
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,270
Surely they'll listen to him

758
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,810
Did you notice?

759
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,710
Hmm?

760
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,580
Did you see it just now?

761
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,610
The last one... the old grandpa

762
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,530
Don't call him an old grandpa!

763
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,150
Did you see
-Yeah

764
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,390
Did you recognize him?
-Yeah

765
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,420
It's that guy, right?

766
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,290
What should we do?

767
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,160
That old grandpa had a lot of comments

768
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:25,760
Don't call him an old grandpa!

769
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,660
I think it's better to...

770
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,000
More or less remember a little, right?

771
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,800
It would be better to add his suggestion

772
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,070
Would it be better to add it?
-Hmm

773
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:34,640
It would be better to add it

774
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,570
Of course it is better to add

775
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,160
In line with the theory

776
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:45,310
Hasegawa hastily proposes to adjust the routine as suggested

777
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,680
But

778
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,350
What did the old grandpa say?

779
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,890
Something about coming out

780
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,380
Don't remember

781
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,930
What was it in the beginning?

782
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,580
Don't say "old grandpa"!

783
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,220
They keep saying "old grandpa"

784
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,600
Sticking out the tongue?

785
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,600
Badmouthing him

786
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
Dancing or something?

787
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,970
Tongue?

788
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,100
I think the old grandpa emphasized sticking out the tongue

789
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,800
Right?

790
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,910
That's what he said back then, right?

791
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:15,080
It seems that neither of them can recall the exact circumstances...

792
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:22,430
Later, a formal video recording of their routine is made in front of the director

793
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,060
What will happen?

794
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:32,240
Will Nishkikoi favor the audience or the powers that be?

795
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,410
How are you?

796
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,790
What would Downtown do?

797
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,550
If someone suggested you to do something

798
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,150
I don't think we would change it

799
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,820
I'd want to but he wouldn't allow it

800
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,590
Really?

801
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,210
Hamada...

802
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,710
He can't be forced to do anything

803
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,010
Will Nishkikoi add the suggestions to their routine?

804
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,210
How are you?

805
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,640
Hello everyone

806
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,000
No manners

807
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,090
Changed it!

808
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,980
Full tongue out

809
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:11,040
Hasegawa sticks his tongue out in an exaggerated fashion

810
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,050
At the same time

811
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,870
Thank you all

812
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,610
I ah...

813
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,530
He's looking

814
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,520
He glances in the direction of the director from time to time

815
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,730
Looking at the powers that be

816
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,210
Confirmation of satisfaction

817
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:24,530
He's laughing

818
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,770
He's happy with it

819
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,830
If dancing to the end means winning the lottery

820
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,960
Later, Watanabe on the side

821
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,630
Please, Aki

822
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,920
I am cheering for you

823
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,970
The recommendations were fully adopted

824
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,700
Almost
-Damn

825
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,510
And finally

826
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,140
Thank you

827
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,680
Very thorough changes

828
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,580
They took all the suggestions

829
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,560
So, we reveal the truth

830
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,520
Eh?

831
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,390
I see...

832
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,390
You'd have to change it

833
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,230
Although I do not know how many sets of data you have now

834
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,300
I'm not sure if it'll be completely verified

835
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,060
Did anyone not change?

836
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,700
Maybe?
-Was there?

837
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,940
Looks like a person caught speeding

838
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,000
Saying "everyone does it, right?

839
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,760
Next is Joyman

840
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,210
Come and say hello!

841
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,720
This is the Director, Morita

842
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,850
We are Joyman

843
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,790
I really like you guys and highly recommend you

844
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,120
Unlike Nishkikoi just now

845
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:48,860
It's unclear whether they recognize the old man

846
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,650
The greetings are over

847
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,310
Did they notice?

848
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,440
Go for it!

849
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,350
A fleeting hint

850
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:11,390
The president with the crutches?

851
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,990
You saw him right? Have you seen him before?

852
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,590
No, right?

853
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,590
Don't you remember?

854
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,460
Maybe i'm misremembering

855
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,700
Just as we were saying hello

856
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,470
He came out

857
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,200
The president gave me a look

858
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,870
Did this

859
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,780
Just a little bit

860
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:37,350
Is it a hint that "it was me at that time"?

861
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,420
Little small movement

862
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,980
You'd notice this kind of detail

863
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,920
I may be wrong about this... but

864
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,230
Very observant

865
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,690
His hand always swung the same way

866
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,120
It was our movements

867
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,530
So that's it, right?

868
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,720
No idea

869
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,510
Pretty impressive

870
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,790
Still has the notes!

871
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,300
The lyrics notes given by the old gentleman at that time

872
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,440
This really is not appropriate to throw away

873
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,140
Takagi has it in his wallet still

874
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,570
The one with deep connotations

875
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:08,200
Will they change their routine as suggested?

876
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,380
Here we go come on

877
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,360
Here we go come on

878
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,390
First is the initial reaction of Ikegaya

879
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:24,510
The advice given was an exaggerated version of "What's wrong with this guy~"

880
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,580
Sorry for the sudden appearance. I'm really sorry

881
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,920
What's wrong with this guy~?

882
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,800
No change

883
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,230
How about a rap?

884
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,740
Lemon tea milk tea...

885
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,870
The next part of Takagi's rap

886
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:50,100
Let's flip a coin to decide

887
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,400
Ah toss a coin to determine with heads and tails?

888
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,040
The obverse is lemon tea, the reverse is maternity

889
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,490
Pregnancy?

890
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,300
No change here either

891
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,880
Sticking to their own ideas

892
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,540
Every Tuesday and Wednesday Produce

893
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,810
So sad

894
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,110
Anteater, eating raw fish

895
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,670
Failure

896
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,200
Bye bye, volcanic ash

897
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,510
Get lost!

898
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,210
Thank you everyone

899
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,710
Awesome

900
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,360
Totally ignored

901
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,220
Ah thank you very much!

902
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,330
The show ended under an unusual low atmosphere

903
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,420
You'd really pity the old man

904
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:30,530
Director

905
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,860
In the lounge waiting...

906
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,860
Still in the lounge?

907
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,530
Ah, you scared me

908
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,030
Scared the hell out of me!

909
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,370
Scary!

910
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,800
What?

911
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,150
Why's he in there!?

912
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.
-It's okay

913
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,440
Thank you for visiting

914
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,300
Has to ask why?

915
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:55,790
I think you can probably guess what i'm thinking

916
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,030
So scary

917
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,860
I don't think its working

918
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,460
We brought the notes with us

919
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,530
Really?

920
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:14,440
Should we have done what it says here?

921
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,840
Well... yeah

922
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,770
Well...

923
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,240
I'm just one person

924
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,880
You can decide

925
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,760
So scary

926
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,940
Super scary!

927
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,490
Please keep up the good work next time!

928
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,850
Terrible, terrible

929
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,520
Sorry, sorry, sorry

930
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,460
This time is a bit of a pity

931
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,960
We at TBS

932
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:43,330
May not be able to provide you with support in the future

933
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:43,900
Eh?

934
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,770
Blacklisted!

935
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,140
Well, keep up the good work!

936
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,910
So scary

937
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,270
Please continue to work hard in the future

938
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,870
Ok ok

939
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,710
He said something very serious to us

940
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,480
Can only say "I'm really sorry"

941
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:09,530
The director who applied the pressure and the one who complained about the power in the rap seem like different pople

942
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,540
Power harassment!

943
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,500
Very angry

944
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:13,970
Angry or not doesn't matter now

945
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,100
Angry...

946
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,900
He even went to the room

947
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:21,570
The truth is revealed

948
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,180
Some light music too

949
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,310
What is this?

950
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,340
Wednesday Downtown

951
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,940
The hell?

952
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,980
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow

953
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,220
Today we were blacklisted by TBS

954
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,550
Blacklisted today

955
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:39,390
And finally, CoolPoko

956
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,390
The magnitude of this change is quite large

957
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,970
Will they wear a suit?

958
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,990
Completely adopted the recommendations

959
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:51,960
It's all changed!

960
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,920
Not good

961
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,660
Hello everyone, we are CoolPoko, back from running in the field

962
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:56,680
Really awful

963
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:03,530
It turned out to be an inexplicable segment of office workers pounding rice cakes

964
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,480
Too much

965
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,320
Minister, let's go

966
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,560
Please

967
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:15,170
In Summary
Some comedians will adopt the suggestions~

968
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,480
That's impressive

969
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,600
This is the result

970
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,200
I didn't expect Joyman to be the most strong-willed

971
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,940
Yes, no concessions

972
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,690
No concessions at all

973
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:33,150
The advice for Nishkikoi was at least still comedy-relevant

974
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,760
Stick out your tongue or something

975
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,280
But the Joyman one was too much, right?

976
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,480
Maybe if the proposal was less serious they'd go with it

977
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,430
Yeah

978
00:45:43,220 --> 00:46:14,780
