00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,620
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown!

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,660
Let's bring out our first presenter.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,400
It's Teruyuki Tsuchida!

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,770
This time I've brought a theory concerning an influential figure from my agency.

5
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,040
So why from my agency?

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,880
Ohta Pro?

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,880
Yes, Ohta Productions.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,700
Do you know who it is?

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,240
It could be Kuniko-san.

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,240
Ah yes. There's Yamada Kuniko-san.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,860
Could be Dachou Club.

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,860
Ah, there's them.

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,780
Those guys aren't influential.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,780
Not influential?

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,320
"Those guys" is inappropriate.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,600
So, the person I want to present is this.

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,260
Ah, Tsuru-san?

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,100
It's Tsurutaro.

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,400
Oi!

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,260
It's Tsurutaro-san.

21
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,950
He's starting to look like driftwood.

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,950
So thin.

23
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,950
That's right.

24
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,570
That's scary...

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,800
So, this time I've brought a theory concerning Tsurutaro's body.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,380
Tsurutaro Kataoka is the #1 entertainer at passing through tight spaces.

27
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,320
Would he be number 1?

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,540
Well, with how he is now, perhaps.

29
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,340
His body really is paper thin now.

30
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,190
And he does yoga, so he's flexible too.

31
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,460
I see.

32
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,080
If you put up him up against other thin people, he'd definitely get through small places.

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,220
No, but that's...

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,620
We looked for gaps that ordinary people wouldn't even dream of.

35
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,620
And these entertainers entered them so fast. This is groundbreaking footage.

36
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,180
I see.

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,820
Coming up, the entertainment world's emaciated all-stars passing-through-gaps showdown.

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,120
Then,

39
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,840
the theory that there's someone over 2 meters that's culturally inclined.

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,600
Then,

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,260
I'll protect you, Rion.

42
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,970
Kuro-chan's reality love project, Monster House episode 2.

43
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,270
Because I have Rion all to myself.

44
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,270
Translations: ShinobiSubs, WDT Project (Shion, Ekiben), CatZombies.  Timing: ShinobiSubs, KannibalKlown, GakiDave.
Assembly and QC: GakiDave

45
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,860
Is Kataoka Tsurutaro really the number one celebrity in the world at passing through tight spaces?

46
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,810
Celebrity passing-through-gaps decisive championship!

47
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,550
Let me introduce the contestants.

48
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,060
First, with a body fat ratio of 7.2% - literally skin and bones...

49
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:47,300
Yabe Taro-san!

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,260
He should be a good challenger.

51
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,040
Progressing away from selling her looks, working throughout the industry...

52
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,240
...a body that is fully-stacked, but scandalously skinny...

53
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,380
...it's Kato Sari-san!

54
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,060
She's thin but has a bust.

55
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,560
Quite the chest there...

56
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,220
This is quite the demerit, eh?

57
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,720
And the one taking her on...

58
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,280
The flat-chested skinny pole dancer Makino Suteteko.

59
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,480
Fatigued from all the mental associates, the "mental bag of bones"...

60
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,000
...from the comedy duo "Impulse", it's Itakura Toshiyuki!

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,720
You're pretty ripped, eh?

62
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,510
You've been working out, I see.

63
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,180
The touch of your hands, Tsurutaro-san...

64
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,740
...is freezing! Are you ok?

65
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,780
Cold, but I'm fine.

66
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,150
And last we have the king of getting in gaps...

67
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,450
...the skinny yoga master, Kataoka Tsurutaro!

68
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,060
He's really showing it off from the side!

69
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,640
It's the easiest to understand.

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,130
I don't really get your feelings of pride, though.

71
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,870
I mean, look.  It's like you're taking on homeless people.

72
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,800
They make their way to the first stage.

73
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,800
Here it is!

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,320
That's impossible!

75
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,060
This is so narrow!

76
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,060
The Level 1 stage gap is...

77
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,660
It can't be done!

78
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,140
...between Yamada-san's house and this restaurant.

79
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,440
That'd be scary!

80
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,760
An opening of just 24 cm.

81
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,000
Is this ok?

82
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,000
This looks too tight!

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,240
That's narrow!

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,770
It's pretty long, too, isn't it?

85
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,010
This is the first stage?

86
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,180
As you can see, if we take this issue box, and place it in the gap...

87
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,580
As you can see, if we take this issue box, and place it in the gap...

88
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,990
It's the same width.

89
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,540
The first challenger is...

90
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,990
...with a body mass of 41kg, Yabe Taro.

91
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,830
The gap the same width as a tissue box - can it be cleared?

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,700
I'm going for it!

93
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,940
I'm a little bit scared.

94
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,000
Ah...scary!

95
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,570
This is spooky!

96
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,340
I can't see anything around!

97
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,880
Ah, ah...I'm in!

98
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,110
Ah, ah...I'm in!

99
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,480
OK!

100
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,830
The first stage is cleared!

101
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,270
Yabe-san, how was it?

102
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,980
It's better if you go through quickly.

103
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,510
Be quick about it, eh?

104
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,620
The next challenger is Makino Suteteko.

105
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Here I go!

106
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,450
Ugh, this is scary!

107
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,820
I'm in!  I'm in!

108
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,060
My voice...my voice is echoing.

109
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,980
Even with walls on both sides she progresses on smoothly.

110
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,600
Yabe-san is waiting for me.

111
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,170
I did it!

112
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,810
I cleared it!

113
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,810
I'm happy for her.

114
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,220
Even though it has nothing to do with me.

115
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,100
There is a real sense of achievement.

116
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,100
Yes there is!

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,790
Next, with a bust of 105cm, Kato Sari.

118
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,690
I can't even get my head in.

119
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,520
Her hair is quite wide.

120
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,820
The bust is problematic.

121
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,640
Watch out!

122
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,480
She can only barely get in.

123
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,480
There is going to be friction on those nipples!

124
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,980
You've gotta be slim for this!

125
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,020
Although the rest fits in, her bust is making it difficult.

126
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,020
Amazing.

127
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,020
But even with her chest chafing against the wall...

128
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,200
...she is able to progress.

129
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,490
I did it!

130
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,970
Kato-san has cleared it.

131
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,390
After this is a succession of clears.

132
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,900
Then it is finally time for the master Tsurutaro to challenge it.

133
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,130
It's pretty intimidating when you see it right before you.

134
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,820
63 years of age and into piercings, the veteran senpai...

135
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,640
...makes his way into the gap.

136
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,220
The yoga master takes his extreme trained body and advances on...

137
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,780
Yogi Tsurutaro has cleared it.

138
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,350
It feels strangely satisfying to make it out, huh.

139
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,190
It's like being reborn.

140
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,330
So here we have level 2.

141
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,800
Where are we?

142
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,530
We're in Atami.

143
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,030
It's really necessary to come all the way here?

144
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,300
No, you see...

145
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
...if we hadn't come all the way to Atami, then...

146
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,400
And so we come to the second stage in Atami.

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,500
Here it is!

148
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,220
Wait wait wait...

149
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,880
...it's narrow and dirty!

150
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,340
Level 2 is situated between two restaurants...

151
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,000
...with a width of 17.5cm.

152
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,760
With a gap that small, it has never been cleaned.

153
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,340
A grimy condition.

154
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,910
Level 1 was the width of the box.

155
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,710
It won't even go in now.

156
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,710
It won't go in?

157
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,200
It won't fit at all.

158
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,200
Because of the pipe.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,700
And thus first is our top contender, Yabe Taro.

160
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,690
There hasn't ever been anyone in here before now, right?

161
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,800
It appears that way.

162
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,990
I'm going for it!

163
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,200
This is tight!

164
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,060
It's tighter than you imagine in here.

165
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,990
It is seriously tight.

166
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,990
Can he get his
head through?

167
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,110
Watching this is making it hard to breathe.

168
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,960
After you get past the entrance it becomes easier...

169
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,660
or so he thought.

170
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,780
Is the wall rough?

171
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,780
Yes.

172
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,730
Not only that, but it's really dirty!

173
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,950
Eww!  What the hell?!

174
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,870
This is super gross!

175
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,760
The dust and grease has been accumulating for ages...

176
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,110
...making it a difficult fight.

177
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,280
It's pretty tight here.

178
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,050
Ah, it's dirty!

179
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,260
Yabe Taro somehow clears Level 2.

180
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,770
Next is Kato Sari with the giant rack.

181
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,230
My breasts are getting crushed.

182
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,410
They're getting smooshed.

183
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,240
He's really
checking her out!

184
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,280
Ah, I'm in!

185
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,840
And so, even with the chafed chest...

186
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,500
...Kato Sari manages to clear.

187
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,100
Even with the tight entrance gap...

188
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,370
...they all manage to clear the challenge.

189
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,400
And so they progress on to the third stage.

190
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,820
What the hell?

191
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,400
Here it is!

192
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,680
That can't be done.

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,560
Level three's hardest point is the opening - only 15cm wide.

194
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,260
Can they fit through the 15cm gap?

195
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,040
This is actually the exit.

196
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,040
The exit?

197
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,300
We have to come from that way?

198
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,140
This time the course is actually an L-shape.

199
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,170
An L-shape?

200
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:58,550
Entrance

201
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:58,550
Exit

202
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,800
This time the entrance and exit are not in a straight line...

203
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,550
...they are in an L-shape.

204
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,150
It won't fit at all.

205
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,820
What about lengthwise?

206
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,620
Lengthwise there is a 1-2cm gap.

207
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,490
This is a bit scary.

208
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,000
Even the yoga master is intimidated by Level 3.

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,900
What happens next?

210
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,800
Going down this part is no problem.

211
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,800
First to challenge is Makino.

212
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,120
There she is!

213
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,920
Up to this point is easy.

214
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,200
I can do it!

215
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,440
This is fine to here.

216
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,800
It's pretty wide there, huh?

217
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,850
It's the last part.

218
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,040
Then she arrives at the toughest hurdle.

219
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,660
It's only 15cm wide.

220
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm so close yet so far!

221
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,520
Really...

222
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,180
...this might actually be impossible.

223
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,000
She is only able to get her head and legs out.

224
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,090
This looks like a joke.

225
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,090
I'm not joking!

226
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,660
This is really tight!

227
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,420
This looks tough.

228
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,440
Ah....crap crap crap...

229
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,930
I wanna get out!

230
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,430
I can't...

231
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,840
It's hitting my spine.

232
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,200
And so Makino falls at the Level 3 boss.

233
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,300
So frustrating...

234
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,280
I can't make it.

235
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,400
I'm so sad...

236
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,540
Next is Kato Sari.

237
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,360
Do you really think, when you look at this gap...

238
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,430
...even one of those great jugs is going to make it through there?

239
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,560
Wait a minute, did you say "jugs"?

240
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,880
It's been a long time since I've heard anyone say "jugs".

241
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,880
And so the big-jugs Kato-san arrives at the exit.

242
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,060
You can do it!

243
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,150
Your head is out!

244
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,790
Is this gonna be ok?!

245
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,000
Should I hold the camera?

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,560
This is a nice shot.

247
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,180
Kato clears getting her head out.

248
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,170
Next is the problematic jugs.

249
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,310
Wait, my belly button piercing is getting caught!

250
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,620
Your belly button ring?

251
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,550
I can't move from here.

252
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,540
It's impossible?

253
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,540
That's bad.

254
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,860
She looks like Hyokkorihan.

255
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,860
T/N: Hyokkorihan is a comedian who always appears on stage like this from behind a wall.

256
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,490
We will have to leave you here.

257
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,890
Can you get your chest out, then your hips?

258
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,660
My pelvis...or should I say...

259
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,390
Where are you stuck?

260
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,160
My belly button piercing hurts.

261
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,160
Your belly button piercing?

262
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,760
And so the staff assist.

263
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,970
Can you take off your mic?

264
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,600
Let's take off the mic.

265
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,700
Staff: But the piercing...

266
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,010
Staff: Hmm...

267
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,920
How did we end up like this?

268
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,310
What should we do?

269
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,080
I'm getting worried now!

270
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,420
Wait a sec...it's pulling tight.

271
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,020
We will have to get a saw and cut it.

272
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,120
I can't go back, either.

273
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,120
You can't go back any more?

274
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,610
An unfortunate circumstance forces her to give up on clearing it.

275
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:41,680
And after 15 minutes of trying...

276
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,220
...she is finally able to return.

277
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,850
And now the ace Yabe Taro steps up.

278
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,890
Here is it!

279
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,900
Ah, the hips are bad.

280
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,370
It's too tight.

281
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,470
You can make it!

282
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,670
But really...to end up trapped here forever...

283
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,170
But really...to end up trapped here forever...

284
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,910
That's dangerous.

285
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,910
It's dangerous.

286
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,270
Yes it is.

287
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,960
The risk of living here forever...

288
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,480
...but then...

289
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,850
If I go up...

290
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,060
By ascending the pole, the gap opens up slightly.

291
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,590
He changes his escape route.

292
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,140
It's a bit wider up there.

293
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,070
It opens up.

294
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,540
He did it!  He did it!

295
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,060
You did it!

296
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
Yabe Taro magnificently clears Level 3.

297
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,060
What are they celebrating? I don't get it.

298
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,700
You really are the ace!

299
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,080
Up! You have to go up!

300
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:16,060
Utilizing the newly discovered technique, the clears continue.

301
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,800
Magnificent!

302
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,420
You did great!

303
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,720
And last is the Yoga Master.

304
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,520
An unbelievable sight for someone who is over 60...

305
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,020
...he makes his way to the goal.

306
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Here?

307
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,200
Kataoka Tsurutaro makes an elegant finish and clears Level 3.

308
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,400
And so these are the remaining three contestants for the final stage.

309
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,560
It's 10pm at night when they arrive to the final gap.

310
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Here it is!

311
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,860
What the heck is this?!

312
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,150
How long is it?

313
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,460
Close to the area of Level 1...

314
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,360
...this is an even tighter 16cm gap.

315
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,560
Not only that, but the exit is also a demonic course.

316
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,100
The remaining contestants take on the final stage:

317
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,900
This mere 16cm opening.

318
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,660
First up to take the challenge...

319
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,620
Wait this is dangerous.

320
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,260
This is the entrance?

321
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,260
But unable to fit his head in the opening...

322
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,630
This is awful.

323
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,840
I didn't think this would be the hard part!

324
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,420
There's no way.

325
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,820
I can't fit in at all.

326
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,620
Unable to enter at all, he forfeits.

327
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,820
Yabe-san, please do your best!

328
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,070
I will go first and research the course!

329
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,070
Do your best, Taro-chan.

330
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,780
And so the next one to take it on is Yabe Taro.

331
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,480
Awaiting him at the exit are the skinny associates.

332
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,360
This is tight as heck!

333
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,690
So narrow!

334
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,740
This guy's amazing!

335
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,430
He's actually in it!

336
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,200
Here I go.

337
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,640
It's clean!

338
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,580
The walls...

339
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,540
The walls are so clean!

340
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,780
But the real challenge is the end.

341
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,880
I've finally arrived to the goal.

342
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,300
But here, blocking his way...

343
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,800
...the demon air conditioner heat exchanger.

344
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,000
Will he be able to overcome this beast?!

345
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,080
It's impossible.

346
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,040
Impossible?

347
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,750
It's impossible to pass.

348
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,490
Ouch!

349
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,930
This is killing me!  My shoulder!

350
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,100
You can make it if you climb up, can't you?

351
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,100
Am I allowed to?

352
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,980
He heads toward the space in the sky.

353
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,940
Ah, I can't do it.

354
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,500
Unable to move freely in the tight space, he reaches his limit.

355
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,850
He is unable to use his lifting power.

356
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,440
You can't bend your legs in a space like that.

357
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,340
It's impossible.

358
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,860
Give...I give up!

359
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,400
The top ace Yabe Taro reaches his limit and retires.

360
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,420
Finally the Yoga Master is up.

361
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,000
T/N: Nauli is a yoga movement involving massaging the internal belly organs in a circular motion.

362
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,000
The expert of nauli aims to clear the final challenge!

363
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,000
This part is only 8cm wide.

364
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,700
But here...my ribs are holding me back.

365
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,300
He slides in with zero effort.

366
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
What is he doing?!

367
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,500
He's over 60!

368
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,500
And then...

369
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,890
He should be able to do it, right?

370
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,290
He makes his move in going upwards.

371
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,080
And so, thanks to his years of expert training in yoga...

372
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,060
...he is able to move his body upwards, even in such a confined space.

373
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,520
Here comes the nauli.

374
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,120
Unbelievable!  He has conquered all of the courses!  Champion!

375
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Kataoka Tsurutaro!

376
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,770
Tsurutaro clears the final course and confirms...

377
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,450
...he is the best at traversing tight gaps.

378
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,320
Give us a winning nauli!

379
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,220
That's an amazing nauli!

380
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,880
So, if you can nauli, you can clear anything.

381
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,800
He proved it true!

382
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,460
How was it?

383
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,400
That old man...

384
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,530
He is a veteran star of our company!

385
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,140
In a place I used to live in a few years back...

386
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,660
...it got burgled by someone, and they got in through a small gap.

387
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,280
It must have been that old git!

388
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,140
He must have known nauli.

389
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,440
Ah, I called him an "old git"...

390
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,600
He is an honorable senpai.

391
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,820
That nauli is something else!

392
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,480
I'm amazed he got out!

393
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,600
Everyone at the company wanted him to refuse, but...

394
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,600
It was better than I expected!

395
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,210
By the way, with the first location in Tsukishima. Downtown, you two...

396
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,970
Do you not remember?

397
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:49,970
Eh?

398
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,540
Eh?

399
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,850
Actually, when you were filming "Downtown Now" out of the studio in Odaiba...

400
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,320
...when Tsurutaro came on as a guest...

401
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,780
...it was that store's gap.

402
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,790
The store on the right.

403
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,490
It's a coinincidence...

404
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,490
A coincidence.

405
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,130
So, on a Downtown program with Tsurotaro-san as a guest...

406
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,630
...if you change the staff, this is what the content turns into.

407
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,660
It's completely different.

408
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,340
Our next presenter is...

409
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,870
Oh, it's Daikichi!

410
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,640
Please welcome Hakata Daikichi!

411
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,380
Thank you for the introduction.

412
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,850
Now, I'd like to ask all of you a question.

413
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,420
Considering all of the people you know, including friends and the like...

414
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,250
...how tall is the tallest person you know? What would you say, Kawakita?

415
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,560
185 cm

416
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,030
A man?

417
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,060
Yes, a man.

418
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,630
Does that person play sports?

419
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,460
He plays basketball.

420
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,460
Ah, so he plays basketball.

421
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,800
What about you, Jinnai?

422
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,870
Well, it would have to be Koyabu, wouldn't it?

423
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,470
He's about...189 cm.

424
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,840
That guy...

425
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,840
No, well, wouldn't it be Onigiri?

426
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,510
Yeah, Onigiri, a younger comedian in Yoshimoto.

427
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,510
It's gotta be Onigiri, right?

428
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,480
A former volleyball player.

429
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,010
He's 190 and...

430
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,920
I found out that he is 193cm.

431
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,920
He's big, ain't he.

432
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,150
So this time, I've brought a tall person theory, which is...

433
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:13,390
There exists someone over 2m who is "culturally inclined."

434
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,760
Now what do I mean by "culturally inclined"?

435
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,800
It means that in school clubs and the like...

436
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,100
...they never played sports or did athletics.

437
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,100
They didn't move their bodies.

438
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:29,410
Really, the theory is that no 2m person is in the "going home club."

439
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,410
They didn't do that, did they?

440
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,810
Actually, I think an important point here is even if you didn't want to...

441
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,280
...the people around you would force you to.

442
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,680
I think that this pattern is common...

443
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,680
...but is it true of all people more than 2m tall?

444
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,520
There's also an image that tall people don't like fighting...

445
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,860
...and cultural clubs don't recruit as aggressively as sports clubs.

446
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,930
I don't know about this...

447
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:58,670
Theory: There exists someone over 2m tall who is culturally inclined.

448
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,240
We come now to Kato Shipping, a logistics company.

449
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:10,250
The boss is so tall that his head can be seen from another room.

450
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,710
What the heck!

451
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,980
Staff: How tall are you?

452
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,820
Expensive suit.

453
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,420
I'm 2 meters tall.

454
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,050
2 meters tall?

455
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,050
Right. 2 meters.

456
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,650
WOW. LARGE.

457
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,820
Staff: Have you been a big guy since you were young?

458
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,990
When I graduated middle school, I was 190cm tall.

459
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,130
I was 2m when I graduated high school, and...

460
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,200
But was he involved
in sports?

461
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,400
I thought I might end up around 220cm.

462
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,600
Well, I used to play volleyball.

463
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,000
Ah, volleyball.

464
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,570
Ah, volleyball.

465
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,130
Right, this is him in 1992...

466
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,610
...appearing at the Barcelona Olympics.

467
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,640
That's the dream, isn't it?

468
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,340
The dream indeed.

469
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:40,180
A former representative on Team Japan, Minami Katsuyuki.

470
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:45,380
So of course he has sports experience.

471
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,590
An absolutely electrifying 2m athlete.

472
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,460
We then come to see the workers at this pharmacy.

473
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,960
With this 2m tall pharmacist, Hanashio Kaga.

474
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,060
A pharmacist?

475
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,660
Staff: Do you have any sports experience?

476
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,430
Indeed.

477
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,530
I did play basketball.

478
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,630
As expected.

479
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,140
I played from about fourth grade until college.

480
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,470
I played for about 12 years, all told.

481
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,640
Staff: Why did you aim to become a pharmacist?

482
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,210
Well, I had no talent, and...

483
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,110
...I wasn't very coordinated.

484
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,180
I was better at studying, plus...

485
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,350
That's too bad.

486
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,220
...I was good at chemistry.

487
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,690
So I decided to go in that direction.

488
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,660
He was originally more culturally inclined...

489
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,760
...but because of his height he played basketball all the way through to college.

490
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:38,300
And now, this 2m+ university student.

491
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,000
Wow, a Benz.

492
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,270
From first grade to my first year of college, I played basketball all the time.

493
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,310
Staff: And did you have a reason to quit?

494
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,010
Well, I got bored of it.

495
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,710
I thought it would be good if I didn't go pro...

496
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,650
...so I quit.

497
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,450
Staff: What is life like at 202cm?

498
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,790
Staff: Do you have any trouble?

499
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,920
It's full of trouble.

500
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,060
For example, you might be with a friend in Shibuya.

501
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,130
It's great meeting up because they can find you easily...

502
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,600
...but I've been used as a landmark for people to meet up.

503
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,240
Something like "There's a crazy tall dude by me in Shibuya!"

504
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,010
"I'll move a little closer to that guy."

505
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,280
"I'll be there"...I've heard phone calls like that before.

506
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,280
He sticks out
like a scarecrow

507
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,780
He is tall.

508
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,150
Maybe it's because I'm narrow-minded...

509
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,280
...but I find it frustrating.

510
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,920
And now this 205cm person working at a construction company.

511
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,090
In 2008, he appeared at the Beijing Olympics.

512
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,260
An ex-volleyball player.

513
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:41,030
Staff: Why do you think you've grown so tall?

514
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,430
In my case, my parents were both tall.

515
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,170
Dad is 185cm, mom is 175 cm.

516
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,240
My younger sister is 186 cm.

517
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,870
Staff: 186cm?!

518
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,480
My great-grandfather was 190cm.

519
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,450
I heard no clothes would fit him.

520
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:02,420
There are basketball and volleyball players over 2m.

521
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,620
Meanwhile...

522
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,990
...in Tottori, we found a soccer player over 2m.

523
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,400
On the Gainare Tottori team...

524
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,200
...a 205cm J-Leaguer: Hatanaka Makito.

525
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,640
Staff) How long have you been playing soccer?

526
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,970
I started in first grade,

527
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,640
I played basketball and volleyball, since I was often invited.

528
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,110
But, you know, I really liked soccer.

529
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,180
Staff: In soccer, what is good about being taller?

530
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,050
In formation, for corner and free kicks...

531
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:42,960
...you have a higher chance when you're in a group of people.

532
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,660
Then we have this 2m soccer player...

533
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,000
...who attends Hosei University.

534
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,130
I'm a goalkeeper, and...

535
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,870
...the ball comes in high.

536
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,010
In terms of taking high goals head-on...

537
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,710
...I think I need the height.

538
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,080
And this survey revealed...

539
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,710
TEXT

540
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,180
...the sports people over 2m do most frequently.

541
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,490
As expected, basketball and volleyball take the lead.

542
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:17,830
Now we'll look at the maximum height of Japanese athletes from various sports.

543
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,800
First, basketball.

544
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,200
Okayama Yasutaka, who was 227cm.

545
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,640
He was also selected for the NBA draft.

546
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:34,480
He is currently the tallest Japanese person.

547
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,910
Is that so?

548
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,450
Then, volleyball.

549
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,420
Otake Hideyuki, 208cm

550
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,650
Currently the tallest person to represent Japan at an Olympic games...

551
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,260
...with the tallest ever height in any sport.

552
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,760
I see

553
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,230
Now, baseball.

554
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,870
Baba Shouhei, 209cm.

555
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,670
Later known as Giant Baba.

556
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,870
Of Japanese pro baseballers over 2m...

557
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,310
...there has only been Baba.

558
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,280
Continuing now with sumo.

559
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:13,150
Akashi Shiranosuke, 252 cm.

560
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,820
Really?

561
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,820
Really?

562
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:18,860
The Japan Sumo Association has recognized him as the first yokozuna

563
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,590
What?

564
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,890
Can't be true...

565
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,690
...but we don't know when he lived, or if he really even existed.

566
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:27,700
There are many unclear parts. It's legendary history.

567
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,630
Did he really exist?

568
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,700
Now, we'll check the maximum heights...

569
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,370
...of some sports where being tall might be useful.

570
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,340
Table Tennis

571
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:43,750
Muramatsu Yuuto, 180 cm.

572
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,720
Gymnastics

573
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,490
Tsukamoto Junki, 178 cm.

574
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,460
Marathon

575
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,230
Horibata Hiroyuki, 189 cm.

576
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,200
Figure Skating

577
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,600
Tanaka Hiroshi, 180cm.

578
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,780
No one here is taller than 2m.

579
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,810
So, if you are looking for someone over 2m who is culturally inclined...

580
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,810
Right, that was
the main topic.

581
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,520
Right.

582
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,580
The person we found with the shortest history in sports...

583
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,820
...was the swimming instructor of this gym.

584
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,960
206 cm Fukazawa Koji.

585
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,560
Staff: Did you always do aquatics?

586
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,170
I started from baby swimming at 0 years old and swam until 8th grade

587
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:43,340
Staff: Is it an advantage in swimming if you're taller?

588
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,040
There is.

589
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,140
When I jump in...

590
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,110
...I can get ahead of everyone because of my height.

591
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,750
My hands are big...

592
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,590
...and my feet are also big...

593
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:02,430
so I can push more water out of the way. It is advantageous.

594
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,900
Staff: Did you do other sports after you quit swimming?

595
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,700
I did basketball.

596
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,500
I had a recommendation to go to Akita Prefecture's...

597
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,140
...Noshiro Industrial High School.

598
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,270
I quit on the court..

599
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,570
...and I dropped out in my second year of high school.

600
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,980
Staff: You dropped out of high school?

601
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,240
I dropped out, yes.

602
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,050
I'm a middle school graduate.

603
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:25,980
Staff: You didn't go back to high school?

604
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,980
Yes, that's correct.

605
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:32,890
Result: There are no culturally inclined people over 2m, but there are 2m tall middle school graduates.

606
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,430
So there really weren't any.

607
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,690
There aren't any, huh.

608
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,690
They don't exist?

609
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,500
He's the one with the shallowest sports history.

610
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,100
I learned a lot of things from this survey of Japan.

611
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,170
Being born with a height of 2m or more...

612
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,770
...decides your life's path, to a degree.

613
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:54,310
It seems you'll always end up doing sports.

614
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,010
We put together a spectrum of different lives...

615
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,850
...and put it into a VTR...

616
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:01,520
...and Hamada laughed a lot at them.

617
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,520
He really laughed a lot!

618
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,980
Here's our next presenter, please.

619
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:17,470
It's Tamura Kenji!

620
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,470
It's a pleasure.

621
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,840
So, everyone...

622
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,840
Aren't you doing "everyone's theory"..?

623
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Not today, Hamada-san!

624
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,140
Don't you remember that fun thing has begun?

625
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,480
It goes on?

626
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,480
It started last week.

627
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,080
Is it really ok to call it "fun"?

628
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,250
What do you think?

629
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,250
I think it's frightening.

630
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,250
You do? I do too actually.

631
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,550
Of course it's this:

632
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:45,900
It's our project about six men and women living in a shared house and experiencing love.

633
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,300
And see if love sparks between them.

634
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,530
That usually happens.
It does.

635
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,320
I said there are six participants...

636
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,610
...but one of them is actually Kuro-chan.

637
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:01,210
So it's actually a love-reality with five sparkling young boys and girls and Kuro-chan.

638
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,810
What love can there be with Kuro-chan?

639
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,450
Everyone's serious about it, right?

640
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,750
They are, and the whole show is still in progress.

641
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,420
From which point of view should we watch this?

642
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,560
By the way, what we saw last time...

643
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,290
...was almost horror.

644
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:24,430
Anyway, if that's the first time you're watching this, here's a quick and easy recap from last time.

645
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:29,040
So, our six participants have started
living together inside this shared house.

646
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,240
On their second day, they had a barbecue.

647
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,110
And all the girls wore swimsuits.

648
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,110
They wore swimsuits, yes.

649
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:40,080
And Kuro-chan looked at them with some frightful eyes.

650
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,790
Kuro-chan also got alone together with a girl...

651
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,960
...and confessed...

652
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,790
Two of them, actually.

653
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,930
That's right, Jinnai.

654
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,500
Even though he knows everything is getting recorded.

655
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,500
That's what he did.

656
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,600
On that day, he went for two of them.

657
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,570
I can't believe it.

658
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,570
He's a monster.

659
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,240
I know maybe I shouldn't say this, but...

660
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,540
...I think that I like you, so...

661
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,210
...I like you the best, for real.

662
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,680
This time I've decided to be honest with my feelings.

663
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,650
You're the one I like the most, Ran-chan.

664
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,620
But Rion-chan and Ran-chan are interested in Taiga-kun.

665
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,230
Taiga-kun is a 20 years old good looking man.

666
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:28,330
But he never actually dated anyone before,
so of course he's never had his first kiss.

667
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:31,030
He's never kissed a girl before.

668
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:35,100
I think if Kuro-chan wasn't there,
everything would have gone so good.

669
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,040
Are you hating on him already?

670
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,040
Kuro-chan? Of course.

671
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,780
Maybe a miracle could happen.

672
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,950
I think... it won't happen.

673
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,190
He did all of that even though he knows he's going on TV.

674
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:53,960
I mean, what are his chances of success?

675
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,960
Yeah, but the girls haven't see it on-air yet.

676
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,960
So he knows they can't find it out yet.

677
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,070
What do you usually have for breakfast?

678
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:05,240
Fruits or a smoothie.

679
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,200
But how?

680
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,200
Just like a model.

681
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,170
Well, I've been thinking about my health and body.

682
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,570
What a great man.

683
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,380
They're trending recently.

684
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,210
He's trying to impress her.

685
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,710
No way he drinks
smoothies.

686
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,020
Wait up, where are you two off to?

687
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,020
"You two"...

688
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,620
To Kawagoe.

689
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,120
Is it a date?

690
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,320
Well...

691
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,720
...something like that.

692
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,190
Have fun, ok?

693
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,190
Thanks!

694
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,290
We're going!

695
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,530
Have fun!

696
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,530
We're going.

697
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,130
They're so excited.

698
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,260
Are you doing something today, Ran-chan?

699
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,130
I was thinking about going to grab a bite with Taiga tonight.

700
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,300
Isn't that unfair?

701
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,770
How come?

702
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,370
Why you didn't ask me out?

703
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,170
You wanted to be asked out?

704
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,480
Well it's...

705
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,480
It's kinda...

706
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,710
Isn't it obvious?

707
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,880
He's really disgusting!

708
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,780
I thought...

709
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,150
You were all about Rion-chan.

710
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,720
He's already fed
up with her.

711
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,320
Nuh-uh, I told you right?

712
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,320
He's being exposed.

713
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,750
Rion-chan is a friend.

714
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,420
He's going for both
of them.

715
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,520
A friend?

716
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,330
And what's the boundary line on who you can call a friend?

717
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,330
A boundary line on friends?

718
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,030
I guess it's about I would kiss them or not.

719
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,340
But if you say it like that...

720
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,540
...even if you don't want to date someone...

721
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,340
...can you kiss them? Can you hold their hand?

722
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,540
Understand?

723
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,480
You meant that?

724
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,480
Yes, yes.

725
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,880
What can I say, if I don't like her, I can't kiss her.

726
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,650
It began.

727
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,650
What the hell is this?
All these flashy images...

728
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,020
It's 'cause they're
fashionable.

729
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,020
It surely is fashionable.

730
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,390
There's not a single time
Kuro-chan appeared here.

731
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,960
Oh, Ran-chan...

732
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,470
At this point it's still good.

733
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,400
This is good.
She's cute.

734
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,100
Oh, nice.

735
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,740
But this...

736
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,140
Is he doing pachinko?!

737
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,280
Don't look at other's
won balls!

738
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,520
What the hell was that
footage of him looking
at the pachinko balls?!

739
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,620
That's Toki-no-Kane (bell of time).

740
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,660
That sounds good!

741
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,930
Toki-no-Kane?

742
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,460
That's amazing!

743
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,760
Look! Hand towels!

744
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,170
That's a nice date.

745
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,730
Oh, towels!

746
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,730
They're so cute!

747
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,700
May I?

748
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,100
This part seems to belong
to a different tv show.

749
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,370
"A different show" what?!

750
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,340
He's fast.

751
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,040
This is so wholesome.

752
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,080
So cool!

753
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,080
These two are nice.

754
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,580
It's a footbath.

755
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,250
Amazing!

756
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,880
This feels good.

757
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,880
It does.

758
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,190
What do you think about Kuro-chan?

759
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:41,760
He's a cute character, I mean, the way he moves around, his high pitch, he's cozy.

760
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,130
I think his personality is really good, but...

761
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,800
...but he really looks like a... middle aged man.

762
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,230
Rion-chan sorry, I was late.

763
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,930
He said he's old.

764
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,070
Thanks for coming.

765
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,070
Oh, you're cute!

766
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,410
You're kinda black-themed.

767
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,240
She clearly did!

768
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,910
Yes, it's because you're Kuro-chan (kuro = black)

769
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,910
Really? For that?

770
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,210
That's why I chose black.

771
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,180
It's a double-Kuro-chan!

772
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,140
They got an appointment?!

773
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,680
You're so cute.

774
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,610
What the hell?

775
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,580
Wanna go to a place? I have it reserved.

776
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,610
Eh? They're on a date?

777
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,220
Oh, I want to.

778
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,680
Let's go, it's over there.

779
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,720
You made a reservation?

780
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,250
Yes, I did.

781
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,160
Here's to Kuro-chan and Rion's first date.

782
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,290
Cheers!

783
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,290
I can't bear to watch
this anymore.

784
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,460
Really, who can?

785
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,100
It's good!

786
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,930
I don't know how
should I watch this.

787
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,130
Yeah, right?

788
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,170
So, I know I was going to meet you today...

789
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,070
...and I thought this could make you happy, so...

790
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,140
If this guy gets drunk
it's gonna be awful

791
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,640
What's that, what's that?

792
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,740
Open it.

793
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,880
Can I?

794
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,750
Oh, it's so cute! What's this?

795
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,550
This is actually cute!

796
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,550
This is so cute!

797
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,180
I'm so happy!

798
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:41,480
It must feel good to
receive one of this!

799
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,680
This is a candy bouquet

800
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,590
Candy bouquet?

801
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,060
They're an "R", is it for "Rion"?

802
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,060
An "R", of course.

803
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,290
Can he do such things?
- It seems so.

804
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,660
I'm so happy!

805
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,560
I've never received something like this before.

806
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,900
This makes me so happy.

807
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,900
So that makes me the first one...

808
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,130
...to ever give you a candy bouquet.

809
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,100
What's his problem?!

810
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,100
Ugh, come on...

811
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,440
Woah, looks good!

812
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,440
It really looks delicious!

813
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,440
Let's eat then.

814
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,070
I don't like this.

815
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,340
So good.

816
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,840
Is it?

817
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,510
But even the lunch you made was good.

818
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,420
He's exaggerating.

819
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,080
You think so?

820
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,780
By the way, since when...?

821
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,620
He's sweating so much!

822
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,820
I mean, when did you start being intersted in me?

823
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,890
To be honest...

824
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,170
The hell is this guy?
He pisses me off.

825
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,860
...when we first met, I thought you were so cute.

826
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,860
Oh, that makes me happy.

827
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,030
And I was like, "I want to ask her out".

828
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,670
Eh? For real?

829
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,900
But he's intersted in
like, all of them.

830
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:34,000
Yeah, because I wanted to make princess Rion happy.

831
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Thank you.

832
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,910
Kuro-chan that's...

833
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:42,110
...a really touching thing to say.

834
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,080
But seriously...

835
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,320
...I really want to...

836
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,090
...protect you, Rion.

837
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,420
Thank you.

838
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,420
I'll protect you for real.

839
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,220
You're really nice, you know?

840
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,060
Protect her from what?

841
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,730
The image I had of you totally changed.

842
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,830
'Cause I've been called a liar since last year?

843
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,600
But you see...

844
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,970
I never told a lie which could hurt other people.

845
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,300
That's true for sure.

846
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,010
Even if you're being tricked often,
you've never tricked anyone yourself.

847
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:14,640
Yeah, that's because I don't want to hurt anyone.

848
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,110
Maybe this girl
is strange too.

849
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,850
Sorry if I'm so blunt.

850
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:16,850
Don't worry.

851
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,520
Let me pat your head a bit.

852
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,620
Geez, you're really cute.

853
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,620
That scream...

854
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,790
Your reaction was really cute.

855
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,190
I don't really know
how to watch this

856
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:32,360
I've never been treated like this before so... I'm kinda happy.

857
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,320
How should I
watch this?

858
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Should I root for him?

859
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,970
Cheers.

860
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,140
Oh, I feel relieved.

861
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,370
This is good.

862
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,640
The big sis is going
after the younger boy.

863
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,640
So what do you think about...

864
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,640
Kuro-chan?
- Kuro-chan?

865
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,850
Well, he's gross.

866
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:56,290
Last time he went and told me like "you're good"...

867
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,780
She said it
loud and clear.

868
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:01,820
I've been told that and I really wish he would stop.

869
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:07,300
He doesn't seem to be
much interested in her.

870
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,460
What about me?

871
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,460
Uhm... I think you're nice.

872
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,460
Really?

873
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,700
For real? Alright! I did it.

874
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,140
He's handsome.

875
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,070
Our dinner was delicious.

876
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,940
It was, right?

877
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:20,880
This girl picked
the wrong guy.

878
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
No need to say
that, right?

879
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,550
Amazing! This...

880
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,950
Beautiful, right?

881
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,950
It's beautiful, so dazzling.

882
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:30,850
Yeah it's amazing, it's a 360 degrees panoramic view.

883
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,220
Rion...

884
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,560
...can I hold your hand?

885
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,490
This is embarrassing.

886
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,930
Too fast, too fast!

887
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:38,910
Hamada-san?
- What?

888
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,700
Do you think he's
gonna assault her?

889
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,900
For real, though
he's really rushing this.

890
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,740
Oh look, we're holding hands.

891
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:48,970
What if... he's actually
good at this?

892
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:51,210
Though you can see everything from here...

893
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:55,340
...all I want to look at is you, Rion.

894
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,650
Amazing, Kuro-chan...

895
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,650
He's drawing closer.

896
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,720
For real? This
is impossible...

897
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,920
So...

898
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,720
He's getting
closer and closer.

899
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,590
I really want to say what I'm feeling, so now...

900
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:13,160
And I think I've come to a point in
which you're to only person I can see.

901
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,100
Way too fast!!

902
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,730
What's that way of
saying it? Creepy!

903
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,500
You know...

904
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,340
Maybe you need some rehab?

905
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,790
The hell is he sayin'?!

906
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,470
I mean, when you meet someone you can feel nervous.

907
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,840
The hell is he
talking about...

908
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,540
So it's really important to look into each other's eyes.

909
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,740
I think we should practice it some more.

910
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,740
He's so creepy!

911
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,380
Practice, you say?

912
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,380
This is unbearable!

913
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,080
Look into my eyes.

914
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,080
I'll give you some rehab.

915
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,380
Oh man, oh man.

916
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,650
The hell is he doin'?!

917
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,020
What are you doing,
Kuro-chan?

918
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,490
- Oh shit.

919
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,490
This is rehab!

920
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,490
I have no idea.

921
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,260
Uwaah! Gross!

922
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,260
See? Too fast!

923
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,260
What is he doing..?

924
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,970
Don't surprise me like that!

925
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,610
By "rehab" you meant this rehab?

926
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,240
I was wondering what you meant by that, heh.

927
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,240
Were you nervous?

928
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,040
I was nervous, yes.

929
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,680
Disgusting.

930
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,020
More like, it caught me off guard, it's embarrassing.

931
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,120
He's really creepy...

932
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,050
You still need some rehab, don't you?

933
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,120
I guess that's it.

934
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,890
I'm actually sweating
right now.

935
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,890
What the hell...

936
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:18,460
It was fun tonight.

937
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,660
I've never been in such places before.

938
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,660
I mean, in such fancy place.

939
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,540
This all revolves
around fanciness.

940
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,110
I'm a bit tired, maybe because I ate so much.

941
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:30,610
Must be the alcohol flowing.

942
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:31,940
Are you drunk?

943
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,080
I don't really know.

944
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,650
I'm a bit drunk myself.

945
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,720
I'm in a good mood.

946
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,550
You know, when I get to...

947
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,690
...have a drink with someone I like or such...

948
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:49,060
...and then I get drunk...

949
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,260
...I start feeling like I want to kiss them.

950
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,660
Ran-chan...?

951
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,200
Is it gross?

952
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,670
Nah, not at all.

953
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,670
Really?

954
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,330
For something like this...

955
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,540
I mean, it's just that and...

956
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,540
What is "that"?

957
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:06,710
Wait, wait!

958
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,140
What's this?!

959
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,580
Hamada-san!

960
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,180
That was his
first kiss, right?

961
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:14,120
I'll hit the convenience store and then I'm going home.

962
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,180
That was unexpected.

963
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,180
He got assaulted!

964
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,320
See you...

965
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,820
What an unexpected
turn of events...

966
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,260
She does that and
leaves like that?!

967
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:24,560
He is perplexed!

968
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,560
This guy's face...

969
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,000
His face was just...

970
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:33,240
What was that? What a huge shock!

971
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,970
He was so stiff like "what just happened?"

972
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:36,970
I mean, that was...

973
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,540
...Taiga's first kiss!

974
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,740
Yeah, it was...

975
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,740
Yes, probably

976
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,340
It was rather awkward.

977
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,340
He was so stiff, yes.

978
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,780
I mean, normal, proper people are like... slower? You know...

979
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,580
...slower, yes of course.

980
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,580
Development-wise.

981
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,390
What the hell is "proper people" supposed to mean?

982
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,860
Things are developing so fast.

983
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,860
Way too fast!

984
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,320
Maybe too fast.

985
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,390
Are you a slow attacker, Hamada-san?

986
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,830
Of course I am.

987
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:00,460
Oh, but...

988
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,460
That may be true.

989
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,630
I think I got it.

990
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:05,730
I mean, if you think about that...
there are just two guys, right? So...

991
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,900
Wait, you're not counting Kuro-chan, aren't you?

992
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,110
You straight up excluded him.

993
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:13,580
I mean, there are only two possible guys for them.

994
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,580
You were saying "gross, gross" too much before!

995
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,740
You've said the harshest things!

996
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,110
But really...

997
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:23,250
I mean, there could be tension between the girls
'cause they may want to aim at one of the two guys.

998
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,990
Ok, but don't you think Kuro-chan
and Rion date felt genuinely nice?

999
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:32,960
We can't know until we watch the rest, she may
never come back to Monster House after this!

1000
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,100
She may be mentally shocked!

1001
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,970
So, how will the love life of our six participants go on?
There's still more to watch now!

1002
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,900
There's more of this?!

1003
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,900
Yes, the second half.

1004
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,240
So, how's the share house?

1005
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,350
Its atmosphere is really great...

1006
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,210
...'cause I get to live with someone else.

1007
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,220
I see.

1008
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,990
You'd know if you were inside it.

1009
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,170
Who's this?

1010
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:57,690
What's this now?

1011
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,760
That's his favorite
junior colleague.

1012
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,720
Rion's pajama were really cute.

1013
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,930
I want to see it again.

1014
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,260
This suddenly
feels like a skit.

1015
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,030
Do you have a photo?

1016
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,060
I do not.

1017
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,360
Why?

1018
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,360
You're right.

1019
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,500
I tried to take one while pretending
to take a selfie, but I couldn't.

1020
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,730
Oh, so you did.

1021
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:13,200
So a pretend-selfie... for sneak photography?

1022
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,840
It's not sneak photography.
I need it as data.

1023
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,170
Data?
- Yes, material.

1024
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,840
So I can remember more clearly.

1025
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,380
For instance, if she changes hairstyle or such...

1026
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:28,880
...I can look at the photo and be like "oh, yesterday they weren't like this". I can tell the difference.

1027
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,320
Is this the girl?

1028
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,320
Yes, look.

1029
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,220
So it's this one.

1030
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,220
That's her in the morning.

1031
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,090
This is seriously
voyeurism!

1032
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:43,600
It even makes sound when I take one, I should set it to mute.

1033
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,330
That's scary.

1034
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,600
That's a crime!

1035
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:48,140
So, is there someone you like in there?

1036
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:52,810
To be honest I'm currently...

1037
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:56,210
...interested in both Rion and Ran.

1038
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:59,520
But which one of them is your first choice?

1039
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,050
He's the worst.

1040
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,720
At the moment it's Rion.

1041
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,450
You see...

1042
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,460
I think I really started to like her.

1043
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,460
Are you sure?

1044
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:12,800
I really want to change her life.

1045
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:14,430
Don't do that!

1046
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,630
I really like Rion's face and...

1047
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:19,440
He should date
this dude instead.

1048
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,070
To be honest...

1049
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,040
...she seems kinda dumb, doesn't she?

1050
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,470
I even went on a date with her

1051
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,270
You did?

1052
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,270
I did, yes

1053
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:32,350
I couldn't make it on my first date, but I think on
our next one I'm positive I'll get a kiss from her.

1054
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:33,550
Is he for real?

1055
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,550
Are you trying to get your hands on both of them?

1056
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,720
If you say it like that...

1057
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,790
- Yeah I mean that, if it goes well...

1058
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,790
I'm more like "they're both good"...

1059
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,390
But what if they find you out...?

1060
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,830
If Rion-chan does...

1061
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:47,060
I think I can manage to find a way out of it by talking...

1062
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,900
...about Ran-chan.

1063
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,830
She really seems to be strong willed.

1064
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,400
This guy is horrible.

1065
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,870
But I think she's softer on such things.

1066
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,170
He's the worst.

1067
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:55,440
For real.

1068
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:58,040
He sucks.

1069
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:58,040
He's really the worst.

1070
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,240
I'm home.

1071
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,540
Oh, hi.

1072
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,650
Are you alone?

1073
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:05,650
Yes, no one's there.

1074
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,650
There's only Taiga, he's watching TV.

1075
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:10,250
Were you playing guitar?

1076
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,250
Just practicing.

1077
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,350
Hey, have you...

1078
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:12,350
What is it?

1079
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,690
...been on a date with Ayu-chan?

1080
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,890
We went to Kawagoe.

1081
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,660
Really, Kawagoe?

1082
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,200
Moreover, about Kuro-chan...

1083
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,400
You had dinner with him?

1084
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,400
I did.

1085
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,230
How was it?

1086
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:31,240
Normal I guess, we had lots of conversation,
he then said stuff like "I'll protect you".

1087
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:35,110
Really?

1088
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:35,110
I think it was kind of... heartening I guess...?

1089
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,250
He kind of made
an impression.

1090
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,750
Was it nice overall?

1091
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,250
Say the truth!

1092
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,120
I don't know, it kinda...

1093
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,750
Did something happen?

1094
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:46,560
Maybe I'm overthinking it, but...

1095
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,120
...it felt like he was about to kiss me.

1096
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,930
She said it.

1097
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,290
And this is difficult to say, but...

1098
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,000
Should I say this...?

1099
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,230
His mouth really stunk.

1100
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,100
Did it really?

1101
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:06,140
Yeah, it was something out of this world... like a rotten egg.

1102
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,640
Come on!

1103
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,980
I had no idea!!

1104
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,210
Like a rotten egg?

1105
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,210
Yeah, kinda.

1106
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,180
But such thing
was so obvious!

1107
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,180
Like those you forgot to dispose of.

1108
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,450
Say, Rion-chan...

1109
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,420
...about Taiga...

1110
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,490
What do you think?

1111
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:21,060
I think he's simply cool, I mean...

1112
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:25,730
...I mean, I think of him like a guy I'd be interested in...

1113
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:30,730
...and I'd like to talk to him alone some more, but...

1114
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,630
...you know...

1115
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,630
Taiga, huh...

1116
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,410
I'm home.

1117
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,970
He's back.

1118
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,280
With a mask.

1119
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,280
It's for his
stinky mouth.

1120
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,710
What are you up to?

1121
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,650
There's an hell
under that mask!

1122
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,250
What about you?

1123
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,080
I had dinner with my junior colleague.

1124
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,580
Oh, I see.

1125
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,580
Say...

1126
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,890
You had dinner with Ran-chan, right?

1127
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,220
I did.

1128
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,430
How was it?

1129
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:57,830
What's his deal?

1130
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,430
I guess...

1131
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:59,830
...it was fun.

1132
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:03,330
Well of course it was.

1133
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,230
Be honest...

1134
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,770
How far did you two go?

1135
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,770
Why does he
want to know?

1136
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,410
I bet you'll tell everyone!

1137
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,740
What are you saying, I mean...

1138
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,910
...I'm not a loose tongue like that.

1139
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,480
His tongue is
loose, we know it.

1140
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,550
Ok but... don't tell anyone.

1141
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,250
It also stinks.

1142
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,850
I won't.

1143
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,360
We... kissed.

1144
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,730
You kissed?

1145
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:32,730
Yeah, it actually came from her.

1146
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,460
He's shocked

1147
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Wait, isn't that unfair?

1148
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,270
Is that true?

1149
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,330
What's unfair?!

1150
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,870
Yes, it's true.

1151
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:44,610
But you said you were interested in Rion-chan,
does it mean you're done with her?

1152
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:48,710
Well, I don't really know it myself yet...

1153
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,640
Understandable.

1154
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,810
It may sound bad but...

1155
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:53,950
...I haven't decided yet, I don't know what to feel.

1156
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,580
Oh, he's puzzled.

1157
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:55,320
Well, to be honest...

1158
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,580
Of course he is

1159
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,920
...I don't think it's good to two-time a girl.

1160
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,920
Hey, hey, hey!!

1161
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,520
If you two-time a girl, you'll end up hurting both of them.

1162
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,160
Are you for real?!

1163
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,530
That's the only possible outcome.

1164
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,130
He's unbelievable.

1165
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,460
About that...

1166
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:10,430
It's true I've dated Rion-chan...

1167
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,840
But you know, it was more of a... light-hearted thing.

1168
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,470
It didn't felt like that to me.

1169
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:21,110
It didn't right? But I went on more dates.

1170
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,580
Is he trying to
toss her away?

1171
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,310
So I think I know better than you.

1172
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,150
I guess you have a point.

1173
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,750
Also, one more thing...

1174
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,920
...but please keep it as a secret.

1175
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:33,920
To be honest...

1176
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,460
...I've...

1177
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:38,930
...kissed Rion.

1178
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:41,230
What the hell!

1179
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,230
- You did not!

1180
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:41,230
Are you kidding me?

1181
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,170
It's true.

1182
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,730
Why is he lying?!

1183
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,170
Is it?

1184
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:46,000
I wasn't planning on telling anyone.

1185
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:46,940
This is absurd.

1186
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:49,240
But I thought "I can't lie to him".

1187
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,840
This guy is insane.

1188
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,840
This guy is
incredible.

1189
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,240
I feel... confused.

1190
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:57,080
Hey, let's keep our two kisses a secret, ok?

1191
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,680
You didn't kiss her!

1192
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,150
Really, Taiga...

1193
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,380
...I'm tight-lipped, you know.

1194
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,380
Don't tell it.

1195
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,250
More than that, I don't trust you, hehe.

1196
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,250
Come on, man!

1197
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,960
This is unbearable.

1198
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,360
Sorry for calling you.

1199
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,690
It's ok.

1200
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:13,160
I kind of...

1201
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,030
...want you to keep this as a secret...

1202
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:20,200
But I thought I had to tell it at least to you, so...

1203
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,390
...apparently...

1204
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:23,870
...Taiga and Ran-chan...

1205
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,640
...kissed.

1206
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,340
They did?!
- Yes.

1207
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,180
What the hell?!

1208
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,180
He really is the worst.

1209
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,150
It's "Monster House" after all.

1210
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,150
It really is a monster house.

1211
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:39,450
This is a real horror movie.

1212
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,120
The monster is on a rampage!

1213
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,590
He really is going berserk.

1214
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,590
He is, really!

1215
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,590
This is incredible...

1216
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,230
How will things go on?

1217
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:53,100
I think he'll consider quitting TV when this will be over.

1218
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,910
How can this end well?

1219
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,910
Yeah, I wonder how things will go on...

1220
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:59,640
I think the staff...

1221
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,450
...is currently digging up a very deep hole...

1222
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,880
...for the ending of this.

1223
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,880
You mean for him?

1224
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,050
Next time, parents and children work together to clear a challenge.

1225
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:14,920
A real parent-child escape room.

1226
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,010
Stop!

1227
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:17,390
Then,

1228
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:21,620
Theory: People are 50/50 split on life in prison or life on a deserted island.

1229
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:25,200
A theory that divides studio members in half.

1230
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,370
Then,

1231
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,240
I'll protect you if anything happens.

1232
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,850
Monster House episode 3.

1233
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:33,010
Because I'll protect you.

1234
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:35,040
I'm crazy into you.
