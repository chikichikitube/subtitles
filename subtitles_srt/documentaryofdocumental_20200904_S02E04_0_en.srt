00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,250
Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!

2
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,260
Open up, open up, open up!

3
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,030
Stop it, stop it!

4
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,600
Stop it, come on, come on

5
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,200
They stood right up!

6
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,830
Thank you so much!

7
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,300
Thank you very much

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,500
Alright

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,700
Huh?

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,710
There was nothing wrong

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,980
Nothing, right?

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,980
Nothing at all!

13
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,230
I'm gonna order some food

14
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,190
Let's get sushi!

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,030
You can order that?

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,130
Here's the list (of menu items)

17
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,770
Calm down! What the fuck man?

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,300
What happened?

19
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,310
He's too rough

20
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,470
I really want some soba, let's order some

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,710
Soba sounds good

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,840
We could also get pizza. You want soba?

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,910
We could get the big one.

24
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,550
Is that just for two people?

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,020
We can eat this?

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,220
We could get Mutsuki
and some soba too

27
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,390
Why soba anyways?

28
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,930
Watch out!

29
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,400
Pull on your chin...

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,730
One, two...

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,240
He's pulling on his chin!

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,510
Ouch!

33
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,980
This is Yoroku Soba!

34
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
Ah, Yoroku Soba?

35
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,310
I'd like to order
some soba

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,020
Understood.
What's your order?

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,620
Also, you guys
have combos, right?

38
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,490
Yes, we do.
We have various different ones.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,590
He's getting closer.

40
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,530
Can we get a tamago bowl combo?

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,860
There he is!

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,800
An egg bowl combo, right?

43
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,470
I do look the part, huh?

44
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,340
But I've always hated that.

45
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,440
You do?

46
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,880
They think I'm serious
but it's just for fashion.

47
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,650
They really think
I'm a genuine soldier.

48
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,820
Is it the way you walk?

49
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,760
They think I'm serious
but it's just for fashion.

50
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,630
I even look the part
right now, right?

51
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,590
Aren't you actually
happy about that?

52
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,630
No, I wear camouflage
just for fashion.

53
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,060
It's just fashion.

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,400
Shut up!

55
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,630
Nadal is so battered.

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,470
You shut up, man.

57
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,310
I didn't understand
what he was saying.

58
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,710
You hung up?!

59
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
Why?!

60
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,180
You had to wait
not hang up.

61
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,550
You suck man!

62
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,310
You can't hang up on people.

63
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,550
Are you a soldier?

64
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,780
I'm not a soldier. I'm really just
wearing this for fashion.

65
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,290
People think
camouflage is always serious.

66
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,160
They think I'm a soldier.
I want it for the style.

67
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,460
But they always
look at me like that!

68
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,630
I just wear it for fashion!

69
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,130
They think I look the part!

70
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,670
I hate it! I've had enough!

71
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,340
It's always like that
for everything!

72
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,600
Nobody sees it as fashion!

73
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,570
It's always the same!

74
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,110
No matter what I wear

75
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,180
You can't combine those

76
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,550
I just want it
for fashion!

77
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,380
But they think I'm a real soldier!

78
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,790
I just do it for fashion.

79
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,360
I wanna wear camouflage like everyone else.

80
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,430
But maybe it's my body
or my appearance.

81
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,760
They think I'm for real!

82
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,930
I just wanna wear camouflage
like everybody else!

83
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,670
So what about me...?

84
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,940
I'm so jealous!

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,040
But when it's this color...

86
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,210
I don't wanna be a real soldier!

87
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,370
A real soldier?

88
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,840
I guess I'll go with
just black then.

89
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,040
Yeah, that'd work.

90
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,250
I'm gonna stop wearing camouflage!
For real!

91
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,920
Nobody told you to, though.

92
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,780
But everybody thinks
I'm a real soldier!

93
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,220
Is there any other fashion
you like?

94
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,620
Nobody's gonna complain now.

95
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,720
You like black...?

96
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,060
No one's complaining now.
No patterns. I'm over that!

97
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,300
I guess so...

98
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,830
Yeah, it's fine.
Looks good.

99
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,030
That works.

100
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,900
You see, I've always
loved camouflage.

101
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,110
I wanted to fit in
with the young kids.

102
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,580
But I guess I'll go
with a simple black then.

103
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,780
Looking completely normal then.

104
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,050
Yeah, looks good.

105
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,120
It doesn't matter what or how...

106
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,490
I always look like
I'm the one in charge.

107
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,130
I just wanted to wear it
for fashion!

108
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,470
I just wanna look trendy.

109
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,570
Well... I don't know about that.

110
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,920
Why don't you show us
how you applaud too...

111
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,020
Like watching something.

112
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,030
I just wear this for fashion.

113
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,430
But I only look normal
with plain black.

114
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,030
So you just
wear that for fun, right?

115
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,830
I just wear it for fun.
You can tell?

116
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,970
-I look like it, right?
-Please clap.

117
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,140
Well, that's just...

118
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,570
Like this, right?

119
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,910
That's not a warm compress, Jimmy-san.

120
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,950
- Huh?
- It's not a warm compress.

121
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,950
That guy loves food, huh?

122
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,750
I have stiff shoulders.

123
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,360
That's cheese, though.

124
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,660
It's not gonna help.

125
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,390
But it cools me, though.

126
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,700
That's insane.

127
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,760
I'm sorry you look the part, though.

128
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,470
I think it's just the general look.

129
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,340
Like the way I move?
The way I look?

130
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Yeah, all of it.

131
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,170
Your gestures too

132
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,640
What about your speech?

133
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,210
Of course not!

134
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,340
-That's it.
-You're wrong!

135
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,540
It's too much.

136
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,980
Look at the cheese.

137
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,250
Private! You don't put cheese
on your shoulders!

138
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,690
This is a warm compress.

139
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,020
That sounded kinda Korean.

140
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,060
Don't put food...
food on your shoulders.

141
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,860
That's not something
you put on your shoulders!

142
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,570
It really sounds kinda
Korean for some reason.

143
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,740
It's not quite right.

144
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,710
I hate it!

145
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,870
What?

146
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,080
What happened?

147
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,050
I also hate... this body!

148
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,590
It's too hard to wear
a damned tank top!

149
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,090
It looks too good!

150
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,460
What's wrong with that?

151
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,260
I look like Bruce Willis!

152
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,860
Bruce Willis?

153
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,960
I look like him in Die Hard!

154
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,930
Bruce Willis was
that ripped?

155
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,300
He was a little jacked, yeah.

156
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,800
Everyone always tells me
that I look like Bruce Willis!

157
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,010
No one says that.

158
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,740
You never change.

159
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,780
They do!

160
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,910
Nope.

161
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,250
It's serious, man!

162
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,580
It is?

163
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,980
It's serious.

164
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,120
What the hell?!

165
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,030
Why did you laugh?

166
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,130
All on his own.

167
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,100
Why did you laugh?

168
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,430
He laughed at himself.

169
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,670
Nadal is too much.

170
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,670
Why did you laugh?

171
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,540
At his face... at his face.

172
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,970
Because he got really mad.

173
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,770
At his sad face.

174
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,310
You thought I really got mad?

175
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,010
You got careless, Soshina.

176
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,180
He made that sad face...

177
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,880
He thought I was angry.

178
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,950
He looked pitiful.

179
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,220
Huh? You did?

180
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,820
I didn't think it was funny

181
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,120
So you laughed at that?

182
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,260
I just felt sorry for him.

183
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,830
It was a strained face.

184
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,560
It's serious, man!

185
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,860
It is?

186
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,370
It's serious!

187
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,500
What the hell?!

188
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,140
No way you did!

189
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,980
Well, I guess so...

190
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,980
I'm fully aware that what I do
isn't funny at all!

191
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:40,980
I think it was me!

192
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,950
What was with that face? Seriously...

193
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,050
It was emotional

194
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,290
It really got to you

195
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,320
I'm too good, sorry about that.

196
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,030
You got intense
all of a sudden.

197
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,730
Soshina, yellow

198
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,200
Okay, gotta get into it.

199
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,070
That was serious.

200
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,140
For real.

201
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,180
That was serious.

202
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,780
It's serious!

203
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,950
What the hell?!

204
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,620
Koba-san is too harsh.

205
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,820
I'm pissed.

206
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,960
Go home already!

207
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,200
Alright

208
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,140
Get out already!

209
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,040
For real?

210
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm serious!

211
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,150
What's with that guy?

212
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,980
Won't you take that off?

213
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,250
Help me!

214
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,550
Help me!

215
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,120
What's wrong?

216
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,390
Help me

217
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,820
They asked me who I belonged to

218
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,190
I said I'm with Yoshimoto

219
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,900
But they put this on me

220
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,060
Huh?

221
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,860
And then lynched me

222
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,470
And they told me
to bring this to you.

223
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,840
What?

224
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,770
That's scary!

225
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,440
Jimmy-san...

226
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,910
That's bad!

227
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,280
Can you take it out?

228
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,150
That's scary!

229
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,480
Huh?

230
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,920
Whoa! It's a head!

231
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,220
Whoa!!

232
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,450
Huh?

233
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,760
They told me to show this to you.

234
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,360
Whoa!

235
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,060
It has a nametag.

236
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,360
What does it say?

237
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,960
Ryo Tamura.

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,570
It says Ryo Tamura

239
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,700
It's just one?

240
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,270
There's more

241
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,440
Whoa! Whoa!

242
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,540
That's super scary!

243
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,810
They cut off everything! Eyes, ears!

244
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,210
It still has a nose.

245
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,950
It's got a tag.

246
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,590
Hiroyuki Miyasako.
That's what it says.

247
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,750
Miyasako-san?

248
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,060
You don't have to...

249
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,290
There's more

250
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,460
Whoa!

251
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
What?

252
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,960
This is too much!

253
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,130
Stabbed with a wine opener.

254
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,330
Wait a second!

255
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,200
He was innocent!
Totally innocent!

256
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,170
Who is it?

257
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,610
Nego6-san...

258
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,910
Nadal smiled, right?

259
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,750
Nadal

260
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,950
It was me?

261
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,490
I didn't smile

262
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,630
Who was it?
Come on, stop this.

263
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,260
I know he mentioned Nego6,
but stop it.

264
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,070
I think it's just
psychological at this point.

265
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,200
That's not it, but...

266
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,540
Nadal?

267
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,810
I think I was just
biting too hard and it showed a little.

268
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,240
That's no good, though.

269
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,850
That's what the contest
is all about.

270
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,690
This is too much!

271
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,390
I think this was pretty bad.

272
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,520
Yeah, kinda.

273
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,190
Wait a second!

274
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,890
He was innocent!
Totally innocent!

275
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,200
Who is it?

276
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,570
Nego6-san...

277
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,870
I think that's it!

278
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,300
It counts?

279
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,940
I think it's
mostly because of the timing.

280
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,040
Second one

281
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,680
But I think Koba may be really pissed.

282
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,550
Looking at him in the monitor.

283
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,590
His switch flipped
since Matsumoto-san left

284
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,320
For sure

285
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,130
I think it's kinda common

286
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,160
Come on, focus

287
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,060
Have you seen me get pissed off
on stage?

288
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,000
-Not really...
He laughs the most.

289
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,440
No more chances, Nadal.

290
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,800
You're right, I know.

291
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,010
Calm down for once, Nadal.

292
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,610
It's been a huge bother...

293
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,150
Wait a second, listen to this!

294
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,680
Listen to me!

295
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,050
This is hell.

296
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,950
He looks so bald
when he bows.

297
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,190
This is hell.

298
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,690
A Masso

299
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,390
A Masso

300
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,960
Their controversy...

301
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,060
They apologized, man!

302
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,330
I asked Anthony
what he thought

303
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,900
I asked him on Line

304
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,010
About the skin color thing, right?

305
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,840
And then he replied

306
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,750
Give it a break
I'm done playing with little kids.

307
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,410
What does that mean?

308
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,720
When I went to visit my
friend's grandma for summer

309
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,020
she gave shaved ice to my friend.

310
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,490
He came back with it
and spilled it all

311
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,060
That's what he wrote.
He's so mentally strong!

312
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,300
Was it used?

313
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,470
This is serious, Nadal!

314
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,000
It's serious!

315
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,040
What the hell?!

316
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,280
To be honest, I've been
slipping up for a while.

317
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,340
My mental strength is waning.

318
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,880
What's Koba-san's
Nadal Reverse Evolution?

319
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,420
Uh... Sasaki Kensuke

320
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,450
Change it!

321
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,280
Like earlier

322
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,550
Wait
you think he's serious?

323
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,690
Change it

324
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,160
Try something else.

325
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,490
Koba-san...

326
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,130
Do devolution

327
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,200
Uh...

328
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,310
Devolution...

329
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,540
Uh...

330
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,640
Maybe...

331
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,320
A devolution for Kenkoba-san...

332
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,850
That's enough!

333
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,730
Everyone's going in

334
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,900
Ouch!!

335
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,910
Are you alright, senpai?!
What's wrong?

336
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,240
-It stabbed me.
-What did?

337
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,110
-This right here.
-You did it yourself.

338
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,010
Don't waste our time.

339
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,580
Why do you do that?

340
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,450
Come out, Nadal

341
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,980
He's still there

342
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,220
The company's driver
really hates you, man.

343
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,160
You called him just to
go buy some porn.

344
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,100
He says you should
stop calling him just for that.

345
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,370
Is that mentsuyu?

346
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,500
Try some

347
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,500
Why don't you drink it then?

348
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,340
It's just that it's good.
Has a good aftertaste.

349
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,440
It's a good aftertaste!

350
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,780
A good aftertaste?

351
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,740
It's a good aftertaste.

352
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,050
Just gulp it down

353
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,220
Make sure you gulp it down.

354
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,050
Gulp it down.

355
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,360
What international bullshit is this?

356
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,930
What kind of retort is that?

357
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,970
What kind of international bullshit is this?!

358
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,170
Wait, what's with that retort?

359
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,440
Drink up!

360
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,210
Just drink it!

361
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,240
Let's make a toast

362
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,510
Ah, don't get pissy!
If you could see yourselves...

363
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,190
Hey, you.
You've sure been quiet...

364
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,920
You know I've been getting fewer jobs
since I won M-1?

365
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,160
Yeah, that happens.

366
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,660
Wait, the fortune teller's here.

367
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,830
Hello. I'm Getters Iida.

368
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,600
I'll read anything
in your future.

369
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,170
Alright then...
How will the Olympics go?

370
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,710
The Olympics?
Let's measure.

371
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,050
Measure?

372
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,610
That's a weird word to say now.

373
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,320
Measure?

374
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,250
UNO?

375
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,350
My fortune telling
reads "Uro's" six stars.

376
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,360
Uro?

377
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,230
The left and right cards are...

378
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,460
going to be turned.

379
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,630
Green, green.

380
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,500
And the ones inside as well
will get turned.

381
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,310
Green, green

382
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,570
No way!

383
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,580
For real?

384
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,210
The center is...

385
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,010
They're all green.

386
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,820
I'm not getting it

387
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,020
The Olympics will succeed

388
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,250
What the hell?!

389
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,800
-It's a bit dark?
-Huh?!

390
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,400
It's a bit dark

391
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,210
Why're you acting all casual?

392
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,980
You're doing it yourself

393
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,880
Like you're one to talk
while fidgeting with your underwear?

394
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,120
Come on, come on

395
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Do something!

396
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,960
I can't do this anymore

397
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,290
What's with that pathetic look?

398
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,960
Huh?
Ina-chan smiled, right?

399
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,400
He did!

400
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,670
Huh?

401
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,140
What?

402
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,470
Ina-san?

403
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,240
Who was it?

404
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,810
Where?

405
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,010
Inada?

406
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,950
Ina-chan just...

407
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,110
So it was him!

408
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,050
He just smiled
like something really good just happened.

409
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,720
Huh?

410
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,990
Like something great happened.

411
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,960
Come on, come on

412
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,700
Do something!

413
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,130
I can't do this anymore

414
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,740
He was smiling!

415
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,640
What's with that?

416
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,770
The whole time!

417
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,840
I just looked at
Nadal's face

418
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,510
He looked so...
it was such a serious face.

419
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,250
I was doing my best you see

420
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,490
This is your first one
Ina-chan

421
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,320
Here we go

422
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,560
He didn't have one?!

423
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,960
I feel like
it was working though

424
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,630
I've been really struggling

425
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,330
I wasn't trying to piss you off, though.

426
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,330
What's with that?

427
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,370
He's kinda scary!

428
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,710
You wouldn't be doing the Uno crap
if you weren't, man!

429
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,510
I think there's comedy
in Uno fortune telling, though.

430
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,050
I think it's just
a solid idea

431
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,650
What're you doing?

432
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,650
I was just about to
get changed when

433
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,620
Are you in disguise like a detective?

434
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,190
He was about to and then

435
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,500
The sushi's here

436
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,370
Sorry for the wait

437
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,880
Sorry for the wait

438
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,240
Excuse me

439
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,050
Thank you so much!

440
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,480
Right here

441
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,050
Read it out loud

442
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,420
Read it?

443
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,490
Someone I'd die to fuck: Zawa-chin

444
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,300
Don't make the sushi guy
say that, man

445
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,760
Thank you very much

446
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,170
Looks great

447
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,600
Akiyama has also been
struggling, huh?

448
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,570
Kubota, sushi rail

449
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,840
Sushi rail

450
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,010
It's really like
on the level of a little kid.

451
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,550
Huh? What's that?

452
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,350
Huh?

453
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,060
Wh-What?

454
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,960
What happened?

455
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,930
Isn't that what Matsuo used to wear
in his Underground years?

456
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,330
The reggae dance?

457
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,900
I'd like you guys to taste
some cocktail I'm going to prepare.

458
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,240
That's what you're doing?
That's it?

459
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,870
Yeah, that's it.

460
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,740
He wore that for the reggae club?

461
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,580
Those are reggae colors?

462
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,750
I'm kinda used to it.

463
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,080
Like bam bam!

464
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,850
What are you gonna do, Matsuo-san?

465
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,050
Can you clap?

466
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,890
-How?
-Just like

467
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,540
Huh?

468
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,140
He's doing it there?

469
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,510
It's spilling!

470
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,680
He's mixing it there?

471
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,010
That's dirty.
He's soaking wet.

472
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,480
We have to drink that?

473
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,980
The lid is open

474
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,150
It's carbonated.

475
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,850
Ah!

476
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,170
Who's drinking it?

477
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,140
Koumoto-san

478
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,690
It's good

479
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Yeah man!
Bam bam bam bam!

480
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,460
Yeah man!

481
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,860
So ridiculous...

482
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,800
There's still some left!

483
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,940
Nadal.

484
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,950
Is it okay, youngsters?

485
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,710
Go ahead.

486
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,320
Isn't it carbonated?

487
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,060
Here I go. Excuse me.

488
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,630
Kubota and Soshina.

489
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,400
I see, yeah...

490
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,540
It feels like diluted
carbonated orange juice.

491
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,080
Huh?

492
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,810
Yeah man!

493
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,980
That's a good voice.
What's your name?

494
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,220
I'm Bob Mario

495
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,120
Bob Mario...

496
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,890
You've heard of him?

497
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,190
Yeah

498
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,090
Um...

499
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,500
He builds something to do with houses...
or something, right?

500
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,700
What are you on about?

501
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,640
He works in-
he builds household things?

502
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,840
Like furniture?

503
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,040
The man sure liked
his incense.

504
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,140
The one that smells.

505
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,780
Incense?

506
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,740
You know incense?

507
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,280
-You don't even know it!
-I do!

508
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,580
What is it?

509
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,450
When your stomach goes

510
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,750
What's with you?

511
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,650
You're not funny.

512
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,060
I know incense.

513
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,990
Kubota is serious man!

514
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,430
Bob-san

515
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,330
Bob-san...

516
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,960
Delivery!

517
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,370
Huh? The delivery!

518
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,900
Hello there!
I came with a delivery!

519
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,000
He's the guy!

520
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,470
Hello there!
I'm from Yoroku Soba!

521
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,880
Here's the egg soba combo
you ordered.

522
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,480
-Soba?
-Wh-Who are you?

523
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,180
Excuse me! I work for Yoroku Soba

524
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,680
What's with your sunglasses?

525
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,890
BKB! Yay!

526
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,220
It kinda hurts.

527
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,890
It kinda hurts.

528
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,190
Are you Gosuke?!

529
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,100
That's right! Excuse me!

530
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,800
He's Gosuke from the
Nadal army!

531
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,670
My name is Gosuke,
excuse me.

532
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,400
Present yourself.

533
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,840
People call me Gosuke rap.

534
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,770
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke!

535
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,240
I wanna be popular with girls!

536
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,140
I extend my hand
to girls in trouble

537
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,910
That's the kind of man Gosuke is sank!

538
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,450
Hello, my name is Gosuke
nice to meet you.

539
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,380
-What's your last name?
-Takasawa.

540
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,420
It's not Gosuke?

541
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,690
Ah, sorry. You mind
if I wear my glasses?

542
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,890
Rap it.

543
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,160
Rap it?

544
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,060
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke

545
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,630
May I wear my glasses?

546
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,530
I get stronger if my eyesight's better.
Way better.

547
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,530
That's the kind of man Gosuke is sank!

548
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,800
What's he saying?

549
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,300
What's that at the end?

550
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,840
That's the kind of man Gosuke is thank you

551
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,310
Gosuke is thank you...

552
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,540
That's right.

553
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,680
It doesn't rhyme.

554
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,750
Ah, excuse me.
You see...

555
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,150
Gosuke rap's strength
is not rhyming.

556
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,820
Nadal, just what...

557
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,850
He can rap,

558
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,290
He can't though.

559
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,090
And he also has
other strengths.

560
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,120
That's right, yes.

561
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,160
Isn't he strong at rapping?

562
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,490
-That's just for the introduction.
That's right.

563
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,190
So he's Nadal's helper?

564
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,360
That's right, yes.

565
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
Something's here!

566
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,130
That's right, we have a gag.

567
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,270
For his presentation.

568
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,970
You okay? Isn't it heavy?

569
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,310
Ah! Let me get it down
excuse me.

570
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,970
What's in there?

571
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,740
It's just...
today, you see...

572
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,810
Can you rap it?

573
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,510
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke
I'm gonna tell you what's inside.

574
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,320
First we have, um... uh...

575
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,250
First we have
this right here...

576
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
I'm Gosuke Gosuke

577
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,850
Gosuke has his computer.

578
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,330
And also this cellphone

579
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,660
Watch out!

580
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,360
Ah, right! This, look at-

581
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,430
I'm Gosuke Gosuke

582
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,670
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke,
my lightbulb broke.

583
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,600
It broke, so I'll have to buy one
on my way back home.

584
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,040
That's the kind of man Gosuke is, thank you!

585
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,340
Wonderful!

586
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,640
It's not wonderful, though.

587
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,210
Nadal? What even is this?

588
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,480
-Gosuke-san...
-Thank you very much!

589
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,480
So that's the real deal.

590
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,920
One, two, three, four!

591
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,120
Wishing for stuff we don't have!
I'm Gosuke

592
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,990
Gosuke dropped out of his graduate program

593
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,060
I failed a hundred interviews and now I'm here!

594
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,100
Please take me already!

595
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,200
Wishing for stuff we don't have!
I'm working at a sushi shop

596
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,740
but I'm also selling soba,
but we don't get any calls.

597
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,140
Why aren't the sound waves reaching us?!

598
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,040
Give me sound waves!

599
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,110
Wishing for stuff we don't have!
Since we don't have waves

600
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,850
I think it's bad, it's bad
that we don't have any waves

601
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,090
but maybe it's my ears that are weird!

602
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,050
Give me more ears!

603
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,160
Wishing for stuff we don't have!
There's a lot

604
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,460
and so now I'm doing this,
but like

605
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,360
it keeps going round and round

606
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,300
and so I wonder what's wrong with me

607
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,500
I don't get it!

608
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,340
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

609
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Wait, wait a second.

610
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,770
Okay

611
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,540
It feels like this is Nadal's fault.

612
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,210
I'm sorry, but...
I haven't heard almost anything.

613
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,980
He's talking about stuff we don't have.

614
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,480
He also said something about waves?

615
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,950
Yes, that's right, that's just...

616
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,890
It's a song about things you want
but don't get.

617
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,020
I see.

618
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,660
It's a little kid gag, kind of

619
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,690
I'm not asking you.

620
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,560
Yes well, let's see

621
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,500
I have a fusion
with the Gosuke rap from earlier.

622
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,670
I wanna see that!

623
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,640
Wishing for stuff we don't have, here!

624
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke
I wanna be popular with girls!

625
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,480
I'll lend a hand
to any girls in trouble!

626
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,580
That's the kind of man that Gosuke is!

627
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,590
This is the Gosuke rap!

628
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,520
Wishing for stuff we don't have, here!

629
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,620
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke,
I dropped out of my graduate program

630
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,530
I studied hard for maths,
but ended up getting it all wrong

631
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,160
That's the kind of man Gosuke is!

632
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,470
I stayed in bed for five whole days
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

633
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,610
Taking it all into account
that's how I got here

634
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,410
Here we go!

635
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,440
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

636
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,480
That's the kind of man Gosuke is!

637
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,510
Thank you very much

638
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,050
Wishing for stuff we don't have

639
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,550
Koumoto-san, what're you doing?

640
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,290
So what changed?

641
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,490
Um...
The rhythm, a little

642
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,560
And you were talking freely?

643
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,360
Like, did the lyrics
get more free?

644
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,760
Yeah... freedom.

645
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,300
Can you rap about Nadal?

646
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,230
Same concept, "wishing for stuff you don't have".

647
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,540
Yes! Excuse me.

648
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,240
Can you wish for something
Nadal doesn't have?

649
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,210
-Can you do that?
-Of course, yes!

650
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,910
That's great.

651
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,710
Wishing for stuff we don't have, now!

652
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,620
You are Nadal, Nadal!
You're a great guy!

653
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,750
You always say awful things

654
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,860
But deep inside, you're a good guy
that's the kind of man Nadal is!

655
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,830
Everyone watch this!

656
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,730
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

657
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,700
You just licked his ass

658
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,500
It was pretty good.
He has like another 50.

659
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,230
Can you say the same?

660
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,870
About myself?
Yeah, of course.

661
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,300
Can you rap it, Nadal?

662
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,400
Do it!

663
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,810
I'm counting on you! Let's go!

664
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,280
One, two, three, four!

665
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,440
Ah, right, right!

666
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,150
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

667
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,220
Everyone plays dumb
acts smart

668
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,520
That's what's great about comedy
and I'm like that too!

669
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,560
Wait, that's not right!

670
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,160
Wishing for stuff we don't have

671
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,160
We have to work hard!

672
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,230
Thank you very much.

673
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,030
That was kinda bad.
Pretty rough.

674
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,400
Go to a school festival with just that
and you'd get murdered by the planning committee!

675
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,770
Do a school festival number.
Can you do it?

676
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,100
A school festival?

677
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,040
I'll be the straight man,
so you start.

678
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,840
Alright, here we go

679
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,710
Wishing for stuff we don't have

680
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,520
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke
school festivals sure are fun

681
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,520
There are many students
and a lot of shops too!

682
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,060
That's the kind of man that Gosuke is, thank you!

683
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,930
This isn't about you!

684
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,560
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

685
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,000
This is awful.

686
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,800
That's an awful retort

687
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Isn't that
what comedy is all about?

688
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,140
Like in Matsumoto-san's style.

689
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,110
And people get laughs
like that.

690
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,080
Really?

691
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,480
Back in Deluxe's time, yeah.

692
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,950
No way, not at all.

693
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,380
Let's go more mainstream.
Ah, right!

694
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,450
It's still going?

695
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,950
Please, if there's something
you'd like to request, go ahead.

696
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,490
Ah, uh...

697
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,660
Then

698
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,930
Do Chikubo

699
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,430
Chikuwa! Right!
Let's go with Chikuwa!

700
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,670
Chikuwa?

701
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,930
Here we go

702
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,670
Huh?

703
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,110
Huh?!

704
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,510
Wha-?

705
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,810
What happened?

706
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,850
Chikuwa!

707
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,950
He didn't say chikuwa at all!

708
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,150
He said Chikubo!

709
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,450
Chikubo!

710
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,120
He definitely said chikubo!

711
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,460
I said chikubo

712
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,190
You thought it was chikuwa
but I said chikubo

713
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,290
No way!

714
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,100
I've never heard of "chikubo"!

715
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,130
Didn't you wanna say something else?

716
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,700
Like "Kubota"! or something?

717
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,970
Me?

718
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,470
No, Akiyama-san

719
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,710
Akiyama laughed out loudly!

720
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,470
And Kubota too

721
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,240
I just saw Akiyama-san

722
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,480
Okay, let's look at Akiyama first

723
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,450
What was your helper called?

724
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,920
I'm Gosuke!
Sorry for my manners.

725
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,420
He kept going for hours, huh?

726
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,060
How experienced.

727
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,360
It was too long!

728
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,960
I'm Gosuke Gosuke!

729
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,960
Please, if there's something
you'd like to request, go ahead.

730
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,630
Chikubo!

731
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,440
Chikuwa! Right!
Let's go with Chikuwa!

732
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,640
Chikuwa?

733
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,810
Here we go

734
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,710
No, I think he definitely did.

735
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,820
Even Akiyama
has accepted it

736
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,980
What card is it?

737
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,390
I already have one

738
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,750
Okay, so
orange then

739
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,590
And Kubota too!

740
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,620
Why?

741
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,930
You laughed!

742
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,190
I was just reacting!
Shut up!

743
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,060
He laughed!

744
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,460
But Akiyama did too...

745
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,930
What are you doing?!

746
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,900
Akiyama kinda invited him

747
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,010
But Kubota also stood out!

748
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,710
I didn't!

749
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,910
I don't even know what
he means by that.

750
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,480
Stop it, man!

751
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,620
Okay, I think this is the part

752
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,190
where Amazon said we became
too vulgar

753
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,160
They even said my name, right?

754
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,160
Okay, take a close look then.

755
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,130
We're pretty far into the show

756
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,140
Jimmy-san, you can't be so
hostile with Gosuke

757
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,770
I mean, he had to look
at this stupid face.

758
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,310
Gosuke did.

759
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,010
He had to be kind after all

760
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,050
You were so cold
despite being older than him.

761
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,210
You talk way too much.

762
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,480
Sorry

763
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,320
Well, it's just that
I don't know much about rap.

764
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,420
You've smoked it all, man.

765
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,090
I can keep going

766
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,660
You're far too lax about that

767
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,330
I do it till I feel numb

768
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,900
My tongue gets numb if I keep going.

769
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,630
That's dangerous man

770
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,040
Are you sure about that?

771
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,710
You've all been
playing with girls a little too much, huh?

772
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,680
Yeah

773
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,550
You use your hips?

774
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,710
Hips?

775
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,050
You shaking 'em?

776
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,420
Well, more than before.

777
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,920
I want you to realize
just how you move your hips.

778
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,920
I'll act as a stand in,
so practice your moves on me.

779
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,690
Whoever can do it the fastest.

780
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,830
I want to find someone like that.

781
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,930
What?

782
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,300
Like the manliest guy?

783
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
Yeah, yeah, manliest!

784
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,900
We'll challenge you then.

785
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,530
Who's gonna start?

786
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,770
You choose, Kubota

787
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,940
Someone strong-looking...

788
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,710
Alright,
let's go Akiyama-san.

789
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,810
Yeah.

790
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,010
Are we gonna go full?

791
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,980
-Full?
-Full cock.

792
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,620
What do you mean?

793
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,020
I just wanna count.

794
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,920
That's the best way to do it.

795
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,990
Okay, give me a second.

796
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,490
I'm feeling sick.

797
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
He's really balding!

798
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,630
I didn't wanna see that.

799
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,900
So Nadal should stand here?

800
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,160
I have to take it out?

801
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,360
Do it

802
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,570
Nadal has to take it out

803
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,300
Take out the red balls

804
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,910
This is the worst

805
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,210
Okay, let's go, one by one.

806
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,580
I'll make sure to let you know
when it's good

807
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,750
Let us know?

808
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,350
With a sound

809
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,150
That's tiny!

810
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,990
You said that?

811
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,150
Stop that!

812
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,290
All ready?
Ready?

813
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,030
Alright! Start!

814
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,900
"Vulgar images not shown on screen"

815
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,760
No way, no way. Come on
"Vulgar images not shown on screen"

816
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:10,790
"Vulgar images not shown on screen"

817
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,200
No man...

818
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,640
Stop!
Alright, 19 times!

819
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,040
19 times!
Not bad!

820
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,380
Not even 15 seconds.

821
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,540
Who's next?

822
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,040
Koba-san.

823
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,480
Tiny!

824
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,380
Stop it with that!

825
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,290
We could turn it back later.

826
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,390
Alright.

827
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,760
Start!

828
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,560
He's fast!

829
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,760
He's quick!

830
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,800
33 times.

831
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,240
This beats the previous record.

832
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,710
Koba-san beat it?

833
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,740
It was Koyabu-san
with 25 times.

834
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,810
You've practiced?

835
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,750
I just won't lose against
a vegetarian!

836
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,350
Anything more?

837
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,990
Ask the senpais to come over.

838
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,290
Ask us to come over.

839
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,590
Why?

840
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,120
Ask the senpais to come over.

841
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,890
Isn't this rough for me already?

842
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,290
So you're not doing it?

843
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,400
So I should go there?

844
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,200
You probably should.

845
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,670
Ready?
Yeah!

846
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,240
Set, go!

847
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,940
Start!

848
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,010
Wait!

849
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,080
He went all the way!
All the way!

850
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,750
More than anyone else!

851
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,560
That's what Kubota-san is saying, yeah.

852
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,930
But it's also the same
as everybody else.

853
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm feeling sick

854
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,200
This is the worst

855
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,840
It sucked!

856
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,440
You're the worst, man!

857
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,680
I take that as a compliment!

858
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,620
Everybody managed to hold on!

859
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,920
So Matsuo

860
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,290
It's his first time

861
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,120
-First time, yeah.
-Huh?! Your first one?!

862
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,090
No way!

863
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,130
He's held on for a long time!

864
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,830
Wait wait wait.
What is it, Kubota?

865
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,830
To be honest I'm feeling
kind of sick at myself.

866
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,700
You did this!

867
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,170
It was far worse for us!

868
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,410
It almost feels like Matsuo
should get more than a yellow!

869
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,040
But, but, well...

870
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,410
Yellow

871
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Come on

872
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,910
Alright, that's it.

873
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,420
Give me a break!

874
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,320
I'm feeling kinda bad as well

875
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,350
Sorry

876
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,560
Here we go!

877
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,900
Let's do it one more time.
It looked good

878
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,200
We can switch

879
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,470
No way

880
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,010
No one will.

881
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,540
This is pretty rough.

882
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
What's your problem?!

883
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,350
I don't understand either!

884
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,450
How did it come to this?

885
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,350
-It's serious!
-What the hell?!

886
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,920
I knew he'd say that.

887
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,720
Don't touch me

888
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,490
Here we go!
Ready to start?

889
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,060
Akiyama-san, say the word

890
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,960
Alright. Come here!

891
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,660
Ready? Go!

892
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,000
Alright!

893
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,970
This is awful

894
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,570
That was pathetic! 16 time-
Huh, What's that?!

895
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,040
That was Nadal, right?!

896
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,280
Jimmy-san pisses me off.

897
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,390
Jimmy-san pissed me off.

898
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,750
But you just-!

899
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,820
What was that all of a sudden?

900
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:00,660
I knew you'd attack me!

901
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,830
What was that?

902
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,700
Why did you have to talk like that
Jimmy-san?

903
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,430
"Jimmy-san pisses me off!"

904
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,240
It was Nadal?!

905
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,970
No, I was gonna hold on, but...

906
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,670
But Jimmy-san went out and...

907
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,710
It's so frustrating!

908
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,510
Why did that go so wrong?!

909
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,250
You're out!

910
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
That sucks...

911
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,360
I think you saved Soshina.
He looked about to laugh.

912
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,390
But this guy was
really in trouble.

913
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,360
So two out!

914
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,630
There are still plenty left!

915
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,940
I'm trying my best

916
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,800
Still eight left.

917
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:48,240
I even practiced holding my laughter.
But there was no way.

918
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,710
It was way too funny.

919
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,610
I think I was in trouble
during the Gosuke rap.

920
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,050
I stayed in bed for five days.
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

921
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,120
Taking things into consideration

922
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,160
Gosuke was supposed to help me out

923
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,690
But he was always
looking right at me

924
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,790
It was like having an enemy

925
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,300
But I guess well...

926
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,930
I felt it again, that...

927
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,200
That I'm just Nishino's puppet.

928
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,300
It felt like that.

929
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,670
None of my gags worked well

930
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,210
It's serious!

931
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,340
What the hell?!

932
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,790
Akiyama-san went all
like this...

933
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,920
It's just the hernia, you know?

934
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,990
You have a hernia?

935
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,790
I thought the energy
and trajectory was pretty good

936
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,090
It was so stable too

937
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,500
Are you going, Matsuo-san?

938
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,760
Ready?

939
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,670
-Okay?
-Yeah!

940
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,640
Ready... Go!

941
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,840
This is actually pretty good...

942
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,910
What does he think he is?

943
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,120
The chief?

944
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,690
23 times. It's a tie.

945
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,590
A tie.

946
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,120
But considering his age

947
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,090
Koba-san did 40...

948
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,260
Seven

949
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,830
I think Koba-san wins

950
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,360
I always move the skin
when I put it in, though.

951
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,370
So like, if you do that...

952
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,900
Ah...

953
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,410
A tattoo?

954
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,980
-A tattoo?
-He has one

955
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,150
-It's too cute.
-It's super cute!

956
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,560
He has a tattoo?
Why d'you have one?

957
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,730
Well, I'm just saying.

958
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,730
I'm curious.
Aren't you curious?

959
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,040
Isn't anyone curious?

960
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,710
You should take a closer look.

961
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:00,870
Look

962
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,710
Then we can talk

963
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,410
You've been keeping
your distance, huh?

964
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,150
-I haven't, at all.
-You're not participating.

965
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,580
I'm here, I'm here.

966
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,550
When did you get that bra?

967
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,060
Take a closer look

968
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,630
Whoa! No way!

969
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,730
Thank you

970
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:20,890
It's talking?

971
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,130
I'm feeling sick

972
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,260
Hello

973
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,460
Hello!

974
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,370
Where did you come from?

975
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,840
Me? Yokohama!

976
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,840
You have to say hi.
Come say hello.

977
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,970
Bro

978
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,710
Hello!

979
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,840
Hello!

980
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,510
Hello

981
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,010
It's nice to meet you!

982
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,780
It's nice to meet you too!

983
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,950
Hello!

984
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,790
Bye!

985
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,390
Hello!

986
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,360
Hello!

987
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,420
Um...

988
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,530
Touch me...

989
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,860
Caress me...

990
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,460
Can I touch you?

991
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,600
Yaaay!!

992
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,410
Yaaay!! Yay yay!!

993
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,170
He did it!

994
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,110
I'm really happy right now!

995
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,750
Yay yay yay!

996
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,550
Thank you! Thank you so much!

997
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,690
What's with his urethra?

998
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:22,960
Looks like a pussy

999
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,290
A cock...

1000
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,830
You've never seen one?

1001
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,060
His peehole
looks like a pussy.

1002
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,060
You haven't even seen a real pussy

1003
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,070
Don't get carried away

1004
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,700
I'm sure you've also
only seen one online.

1005
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,740
I know a good place
to do my own research.

1006
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,810
Though I couldn't find
a clitoris until recently.

1007
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,780
Where was it?

1008
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,450
Right here.

1009
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,650
Correct

1010
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,450
You guys

1011
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:54,220
You don't know about women,
don't get cocky.

1012
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,320
Well... I'm sorry, but...

1013
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,920
You come here first

1014
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,930
Come on, right here.
Let's check if you're strong.

1015
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,260
Come on,
right on my face!

1016
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,630
On the face?

1017
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,670
I feel like I can do it now

1018
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:08,600
Move it this way

1019
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,470
No, that's fine

1020
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,600
You should move it
with your fingers

1021
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,880
Are you Yanagiba Toshiro?

1022
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,720
On the face?

1023
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,620
Yeah, that's what I said...

1024
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,320
Really?

1025
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,360
Can you count the thrusts?

1026
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,690
I'm counting myself too

1027
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,930
Okay, ready?

1028
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,630
Yeah.
Okay. Start!

1029
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,840
That smelled
for like a second!

1030
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,210
Don't do that. That stinks!

1031
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,750
If you hold it in
it kinda smells like farts.

1032
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,950
Sometimes

1033
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,120
-How many was that?
-33

1034
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,120
He's pretty confident.
33 is tied with the champion.

1035
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,460
We're all lined up.

1036
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,060
I really don't think
I could do 33, though.

1037
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,130
Hey, lend me your cheeks.

1038
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,130
I've had enough!

1039
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,370
Ina-chan, keep count.

1040
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,240
Sorry, sorry. It's okay.

1041
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,170
Come on...

1042
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,810
Sorry, really sorry.

1043
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,810
I know it's not great for you

1044
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,380
Come on. Please count.
Here we go. Sorry.

1045
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,450
-Who's counting?
-Ina-chan.

1046
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,080
How did it get to this?

1047
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,420
Ready... Go!

1048
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,620
Alright!

1049
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,190
The blue one!

1050
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,160
It's blue!

1051
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,970
This is against the rules!

1052
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,340
How many times?

1053
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:51,910
19

1054
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,940
Hey, don't...
Alright, I'll kill myself then!

1055
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,040
I'm gonna die!

1056
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,180
I did it so much for only 19?

1057
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,820
Damn it!

1058
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,090
Is he that upset?

1059
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,160
It's fine...

1060
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,130
It's always 19!

1061
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,600
I'm jealous!
You got 30, huh?!

1062
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,540
Why?!

1063
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,270
Why do I always
get just 19?!

1064
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,510
You wanted it so badly?

1065
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,150
I did, I did!
I wanted the 30!

1066
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,420
That's a man's pride!
Not 19!

1067
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,250
It's been three times!

1068
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:42,860
Damn it!

1069
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,530
It's not working?

1070
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:52,170
Where's Gosuke?

1071
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,670
He's not around.

1072
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,700
Time over

1073
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,710
It's over.

1074
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,040
It's finished!

1075
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,410
It felt kinda quick.

1076
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,210
It was pretty quick at the end, huh?

1077
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,090
Alright, the winner by points is...

1078
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:19,630
Kubota!

1079
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,960
Whoa!

1080
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,560
No way!

1081
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:25,930
Whoa!

1082
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,100
Sorry, no way!

1083
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:37,240
It was great.
You had great defense, too

1084
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,250
I'm glad to be alive.
Thank you so much!

1085
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,980
Good job

1086
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,960
Alright, that was it.

1087
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,290
How was it, everyone?

1088
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,790
Well, it was, yeah...

1089
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:57,000
Maybe it was all the nudity.

1090
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,570
While watching, I was thinking
pissing Amazon off is...

1091
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,140
kinda like pissing god off.

1092
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,080
Not just working
but like, as a normal person.

1093
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,050
I wondered it it was okay
for mere humans to do this.

1094
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,480
I'm not gonna say who
screwed up.

1095
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:19,220
But well, leaving that aside...

1096
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,820
What bothered Amazon
the most was...

1097
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:26,130
That they were gonna
release it on Christmas

1098
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,660
And I guess it just wasn't...

1099
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,430
that great as a Christmas present.

1100
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,870
Well, as a Christmas present
to the world...

1101
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,770
I think this might not be
up to Santa's standards.

1102
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,570
So everything before that
was OK?

1103
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,840
It was OK until then, yeah.

1104
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:49,720
I think it was when
Soshina touched the dick.

1105
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:51,020
Matsuo-san's?

1106
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,850
Yeah, yeah, Matsuo's dick.

1107
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,520
But like

1108
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,260
He told me to touch it!

1109
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,090
And it was really cute, right?!

1110
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,430
Hello

1111
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,000
Touch me!

1112
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,630
I want you to caress me!

1113
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,100
Can I touch you?

1114
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:12,610
Yay! Yay!

1115
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,070
It was cute.
I know you may not believe me!

1116
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,510
No, I think it's fine.
It's fine, but...

1117
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,310
But it went in your mouth, right?

1118
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,150
Soshina smashed it
against his face.

1119
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:28,090
But when doing it from the front
it went into Kubota's mouth, right?

1120
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,020
He did it like ten times here
and a couple times in here.

1121
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,630
It didn't go in, though.

1122
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,700
You wanted a mosaic there?

1123
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,070
It didn't go in, man!

1124
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,130
Why a mosaic?

1125
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,140
Come on man!
It didn't go in!

1126
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:47,310
We just can't have someone's body parts
going inside someone else's body!

1127
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,580
So can you cut it with
the whole entering a body?

1128
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,890
Having said that,
Kubota was the winner.

1129
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,220
Thank you very much.

1130
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,420
Ten million.

1131
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,320
Yeah.

1132
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:03,660
You want it?

1133
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,890
Of course I do, yeah!

1134
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,030
"You want it?"

1135
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:09,260
No, no, I mean... yes.

1136
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,800
What do you think?

1137
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,300
To be honest, he's a younger guy

1138
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,770
so I'd like him to have it.
He worked hard.

1139
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,440
But it was pretty heavy, you know...

1140
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:19,970
Come on, don't say that!

1141
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,640
Yeah, like he lost it.

1142
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,510
Yeah, because this
is the opposite of a happy moment.

1143
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,080
Well it's not about happy or sad.
I should go home with the money.

1144
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,680
I'm in this world
because I want money.

1145
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,550
But you got really mad, right?

1146
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,260
No, no. I'm just saying!

1147
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,230
I can take all the money with me
even if it takes a few days.

1148
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,690
Come on, that's dangerous!

1149
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,260
They're not gonna accept that.

1150
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,800
Come on, give me the money!
I want the money!

1151
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,240
So can you do this to
Amazon's big shots?

1152
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,940
I'll do it in their faces, like...

1153
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,840
Then it'll all be over.

1154
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,110
Okay, Kubota

1155
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,880
I'm confiscating the money!

1156
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:01,910
Whoa!

1157
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,150
Come on, Matsumoto-san!
Please don't do that, please!

1158
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,290
For real! Please don't!

1159
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:07,290
Confiscating?

1160
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,990
I wanna give it to you,
but I'm going to take it back.

1161
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,390
Come on, you can't, you can't!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1162
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,430
You have no say in this!

1163
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,460
I'm sorry! Staff guys,
I'm sorry!

1164
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:21,670
This isn't about Matsumoto Hitoshi!
It's just common sense!

1165
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,500
I'm sorry!

1166
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:25,270
Speaking of common sense,

1167
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:28,670
I want to give the money to you.
I really do!

1168
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,580
But it can't be helped!

1169
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:32,380
Don't do this! Please!
Please don't!

1170
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,210
It's come to this
there's nothing they can do.

1171
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,220
Who is in charge?

1172
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,380
(Staff)
That would be me...

1173
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,920
So? What do you think?

1174
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,060
To be honest,
as a project...

1175
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,460
as a business,
this is unacceptable.

1176
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,660
That's how it is.

1177
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,030
Oh wow...

1178
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,030
It was a huge deal, Kubota.

1179
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,700
They're so mad at me?

1180
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,470
He's turning pale!

1181
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,040
That's how businesses get mad.

1182
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,070
I'm just gonna hold on
to those ten million.

1183
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,280
Huh? Hold on to them?

1184
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,680
I'll think about it.

1185
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,050
I don't wanna say much
but maybe...

1186
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,680
it might carry over.

1187
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,220
No, wait... come on, please!

1188
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,220
We might turn it into 20 million.

1189
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:15,320
Whoa!

1190
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,990
We can take these ten million,
and you can participate then!

1191
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,390
Just do the same thing again.

1192
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,100
I'm not so stupid!
Only Jimmy would do that!

1193
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,770
Jimmy, huh?

1194
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:08,250
"Please watch the final hour, from the banned scene onward"

1195
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,150
I'm starving.

1196
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,230
Let's get along, Matsuo-san.

1197
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,700
Sorry,
let's get along.

1198
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,270
What happened? What was it?

1199
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,070
Wait a second.

1200
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,170
You took it?

1201
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,440
Wait a second.

1202
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,680
What happened?

1203
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,240
What happened?

1204
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,580
I don't know, maybe...
Maybe it was me?

1205
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,050
What happened?

1206
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:54,150
No, this is just...
I really don't know.

1207
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,420
Let's wait for Matsumoto-san.

1208
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:59,360
I just saw a normal
grin all of a sudden.

1209
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,390
Who was it?

1210
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:03,800
Two people?

1211
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,600
Just Soshina.

1212
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,500
No way!

1213
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,170
He was smiling.

1214
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,570
For real?

1215
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,040
I guess a lot happened
so he was just giddy.

1216
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,480
Wait a second.

1217
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,880
Let's take a look.

1218
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,580
See?

1219
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:30,990
Let's get along.

1220
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,090
He's smiling

1221
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,460
When he said "let's get along"!

1222
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,160
He did that by himself!

1223
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:39,570
With a face and everything!

1224
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,570
Let's get along, then.

1225
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:44,000
I'm just too lonely,
and I wanted company.

1226
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,370
Damn it!

1227
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,980
Matsuo-san got him.

1228
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,980
We do have

1229
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:00,090
some snacks.

1230
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,320
I want some!

1231
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,720
I want snacks!

1232
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,490
I'm _ _ _

1233
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,590
I didn't get that.

1234
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,000
-_ _ ko!
-We can't hear you.

1235
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,800
-_ ko!
-Huh?

1236
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,730
-_ _ ko!
-Pyakko?

1237
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,170
I'm _ _ ko!

1238
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,000
What-ko?

1239
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,040
Byakko?

1240
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,710
We can't hear you.

1241
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,810
Sorry, Soshina.

1242
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,410
Huh?

1243
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,980
I'm _ _ ko!

1244
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,510
Jaako?

1245
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:27,750
_ _ ko!

1246
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:30,680
He gained weight, huh?

1247
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,350
Was that a broccoli?

1248
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,560
Who are you?

1249
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,320
-_ _ ko!
-Ryako?

1250
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,360
_ _ ko! _ _ ko!

1251
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,090
-What was it?
-I'm _ _ ko!

1252
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,700
-Wanko?
-_ _ ko!

1253
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,970
I really can't understand it.

1254
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,400
He had something right?

1255
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,200
He had two broccoli.

1256
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:52,070
Call him, call him.

1257
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:54,710
Yakko-san!

1258
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,410
Yakko-san!

1259
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,310
I'm _ _ ko.

1260
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:01,180
What's your line of work?

1261
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,180
I'm a delmo. A delmo.

1262
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,380
A delmo?

1263
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,620
Ah, a model.

1264
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,690
What has she done?

1265
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,260
What have you done?

1266
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,630
I'm sure you've appeared
on mags or something, right?

1267
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,360
M and M.

1268
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:17,960
M and M?

1269
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,930
M&M's? The chocolates?

1270
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,400
How old are you?

1271
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,870
A magazine. Magazine.

1272
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,010
What?
It's a magazine.

1273
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:27,570
A pageantry?
A magazine.

1274
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,870
A magazine?
Yes.

1275
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,580
What's with that?

1276
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,210
I don't get it at all.

1277
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,550
A magazine?

1278
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:37,380
Come on!

1279
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:42,190
There it is!

1280
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,090
He's coming here?

1281
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,390
Can you see me?

1282
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,460
That type of body...

1283
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,430
Who are you?
One more time!

1284
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,430
_ _ ko!

1285
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,270
-Rakko?
-_ _ ko!

1286
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:56,870
-Rakka?
-_ _ ko!

1287
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,140
-Rakka?
-_ _ ko

1288
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,410
-Ouch!
-What-ko?

1289
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,140
-Ranko!
-What're you doing?

1290
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,340
-I'm Ranko!
-What-ko?

1291
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:03,910
-Ranko!
-What's he doing?

1292
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,650
Ranko!

1293
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,080
What's that?

1294
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,150
Stop it!

1295
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,650
I'm gonna kill you!

1296
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,490
I'm gonna kill you!

1297
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,620
It's a bazooka.

1298
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:18,720
Kubota

1299
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,830
Don't get any closer!

1300
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:20,990
Senpai!

1301
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,230
He's your senpai!

1302
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,260
I'm gonna kill you

1303
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,070
-Kubota
-Don't get closer!

1304
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:27,370
I can do it any time.

1305
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,470
Ouch!

1306
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,340
Kubota-san. You okay?

1307
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,610
That's a fucking heavy broccoli!

1308
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,770
Broccoli

1309
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,780
Huh?

1310
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080
It wasn't me.

1311
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,950
You were smiling, yeah.

1312
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,410
Smiling a lot.

1313
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:43,820
Smiling a lot

1314
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,390
Me? Me?!

1315
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:50,090
It's a solid broccoli.
You smiled when you said broccoli.

1316
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,790
-No way!
-He's smiling!

1317
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,460
-Who was it?
-I smiled?

1318
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:55,260
You did.

1319
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,330
No way, I- I...

1320
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,700
It was definitely Jimmy

1321
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,900
He did it himself, right?

1322
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:05,470
He was smiling normally.

1323
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,510
He smiled after
saying "broccoli"

1324
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:09,070
All the time.

1325
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,340
For real?

1326
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,350
For real!

1327
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,650
For real

1328
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,920
He's your senpai!

1329
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:21,120
I'm gonna kill you

1330
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,190
Kubota!

1331
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,090
Don't get any closer.
I can do it anytime.

1332
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,260
Ouch!

1333
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,930
Kubota-san. You okay?

1334
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:30,560
It's a damned heavy broccoli!

1335
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,430
Broccoli.

1336
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,200
Huh?

1337
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:35,370
Leave.

1338
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,000
No way!

1339
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,180
For real.

1340
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,840
But you did well today.

1341
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,780
I smiled?

1342
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:50,950
Of course you were smiling!

1343
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,520
All the time!

1344
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:55,020
I was being forgiving, actually.

1345
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:02,700
He can't accept it.

1346
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,800
I don't get what
he won't accept.

1347
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,570
To be honest, this is
the first time I made it this far.

1348
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,340
No, no, no.

1349
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,040
Watch out watch out!

1350
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:18,610
It felt like for a second
I might've done it.

1351
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:22,610
But once I got the orange,
I had to watch out.

1352
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,980
And I was out
before I realized.

1353
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,720
Wanna go on a camping trip,
Maki-kun?

1354
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,620
-I guess so, next time!
-Let's think about it!

1355
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,730
Let's go with zombie time.

1356
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,500
Zombie time!

1357
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:45,970
The zombies are here...

1358
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,770
Watch out!

1359
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,240
Sit down.
You have to watch it.

1360
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:52,540
Watch out!

1361
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,780
What's going on?

1362
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:03,160
That's a tiny face.

1363
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,260
It's way too tiny.

1364
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:20,870
He just walked by.

1365
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,910
It's like a monster.

1366
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:24,310
He walked by.

1367
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,150
That's creepy

1368
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:28,610
The face was way too tiny.

1369
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,050
Where did it go?

1370
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,520
That's not a performance.

1371
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,390
Whoa!

1372
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,660
He went to the back!

1373
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,920
The back?

1374
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:39,090
The strobe?

1375
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:39,530
Strobe?

1376
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,360
Whoa!

1377
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,610
Damn it

1378
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,820
It's not moving.

1379
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,080
What?

1380
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:05,220
It's not moving.

1381
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,660
Whoa!

1382
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:23,250
"Don Frye"

1383
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:42,350
Come on!

1384
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,260
Come on!

1385
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,630
Don Frye? Really?

1386
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:53,900
Don Frye.

1387
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:57,740
That was bad! Move more!

1388
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,470
I was two seconds away

1389
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,840
Move more!

1390
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,310
That was definitely Soshina!

1391
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,880
I did it!
You did.

1392
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,950
I knew I was in trouble
from the beginning.

1393
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,410
Kubota was struggling too!

1394
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,620
I was pretty close

1395
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,650
You held it?

1396
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,650
I was two seconds away, though.

1397
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,130
It's not moving.

1398
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:21,690
What?

1399
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,700
Whoa!

1400
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:43,080
"Don Frye"

1401
01:03:58,430 --> 01:03:59,630
Come on!

1402
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,970
Okay Soshina, you're out!

1403
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,280
That was just...
Move more!

1404
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,810
Okay, let's go Soshina.

1405
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,320
Let's go with Nadal.

1406
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:18,650
Don't come back as a zombie.

1407
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,320
Run away!

1408
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:23,920
It was so fun!

1409
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:30,160
I brought a huge bag.
And I was pretty prepared.

1410
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:33,470
But at some point I...

1411
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:38,770
let people around me attack
and that was fun.

1412
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,640
That's the sound already.

1413
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,370
It's short!

1414
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,280
Don't say it's short.

1415
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,880
It's long!

1416
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:49,450
There weren't many
straight men here.

1417
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,250
So I just adapted to it.

1418
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:54,690
So I watched out
for their attacks.

1419
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:58,320
I think I did that well.
It was fun.

1420
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:01,090
It really felt like a dream.

1421
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,590
Alright.

1422
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,430
I'll get one.

1423
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:46,410
Sorry. Can you take that off?

1424
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:48,010
This?

1425
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,740
It's tight.

1426
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:53,480
Thank you so much.

1427
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,950
These are seven bras.

1428
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,390
It's made with seven bras.
It's great!

1429
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,460
It's so I'm always
thinking about boobs.

1430
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:10,660
Looks warm.

1431
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:13,530
I can put it on easily
with the hooks.

1432
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,470
And it's good practice too

1433
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:17,870
Practice...

1434
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,100
They're all different.

1435
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,710
Yeah, they're all different bras...

1436
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,080
I could've used only a couple

1437
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,250
But I wouldn't let myself.

1438
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,610
What's the criteria?

1439
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,880
No criteria,

1440
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:32,750
but the clothes were good
and they had ribbons.

1441
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,290
It's cute. Pretty cute.

1442
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:36,960
Try putting it on.

1443
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,520
It's soft.

1444
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:45,860
Looks good. Make sure it's
sitting correctly over your ear.

1445
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:47,870
It's really nice.

1446
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:50,440
Right? This part is good too

1447
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:54,440
I'm gonna take it off
and put it again.

1448
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:57,580
I've called it the brahat.

1449
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,280
-How is it?
-It's great!

1450
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:02,610
I know!

1451
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,250
-Wanna wear it?
-Yeah.

1452
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:08,650
Isn't this expensive?

1453
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:13,760
Buying one by one was like...
¥60,000 more or less.

1454
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:15,030
¥60,000?

1455
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,500
I wanted big cups.

1456
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,300
It's warm!

1457
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:20,530
It's good, huh?

1458
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:22,000
This too!

1459
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,140
It's gonna break.

1460
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,540
Yeah, yeah.

1461
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,810
Give it back.

1462
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,950
Huh? I've seen him before.

1463
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,820
Seen him before for sure...

1464
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,000
-Sushi.
-Is that him?

1465
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:59,700
-Sushi.
-Looks like him.

1466
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:03,740
Sorry.
What's your name?

1467
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,550
Sushi

1468
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:09,880
Sushi

1469
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:11,080
Sushi

1470
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:13,390
Sushi?

1471
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,890
The one you eat?

1472
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,390
No. Sushi

1473
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,030
And your name?

1474
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:24,730
It's Sushi.

1475
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,600
He said Sushi, right?

1476
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,840
A song? Can you sing?

1477
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,800
I sing.

1478
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,670
With a band?

1479
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:36,340
We're five.

1480
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,110
So he's definitely...

1481
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:39,910
What was it?

1482
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:40,980
Your group?

1483
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:45,480
Hex-hex-hex Hex Japon.

1484
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:47,350
Hex Japon.

1485
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,220
Hex Japon?

1486
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:50,790
Hex Japon

1487
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:52,220
Huh?

1488
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,030
Hex Japon?

1489
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:58,060
Sing one for us.

1490
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:01,270
I can't sing a song now, but...

1491
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:09,570
This is it for you guys.

1492
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,350
I'm gonna kill you all right now!

1493
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,090
I'm gonna build a school in Africa!

1494
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:24,060
Is he good or bad?

1495
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:26,360
Is he good or bad?

1496
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:27,990
Why do you have to kill us?

1497
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,560
I'm gonna pull out your eyeballs,

1498
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:35,970
and bring water to the Thai people!

1499
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,300
He's a good guy

1500
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:40,870
Is he good or bad?
He's really good

1501
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,840
He does good
and then bad.

1502
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,250
I'm gonna murder your parents

1503
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:48,810
Stop it

1504
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:51,380
And pay for my sister's studies!

1505
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:53,790
He's good

1506
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,620
He's super good

1507
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:58,720
He looks bad, though

1508
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:04,500
I'm gonna pull out all your teeth

1509
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,230
So please be my friend!

1510
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,470
I can't be friends with someone like that.

1511
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:24,150
Now...

1512
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,920
Line up in the first row.

1513
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,190
You've been here before?

1514
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:36,430
Yes.

1515
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:39,530
Okay.
Keep going.

1516
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,870
No, I just
want to buy a ticket.

1517
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,510
He's a good guy.
It makes sense.

1518
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,980
Feel free to come.

1519
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,980
I feel bad for
the fan club guys

1520
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,120
Yeah, thank you.

1521
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,050
What's with you?

1522
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,790
Gaggy! Welcome!

1523
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,620
What's with you?

1524
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:04,760
Gaggy!

1525
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,060
Gaggy!

1526
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:09,490
I came to the village Gaggy

1527
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:14,570
Hello. I came here.
Gaggy village, right?

1528
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:17,140
Long live Gaggy village!

1529
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,910
Long live Gaggy village!
Thank you very much!

1530
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:24,980
I love Gaggy-sama.
That's why I'm here.

1531
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,910
I can do a bit more Gaggy-sama.

1532
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:29,050
This is what I am
without Gaggy-sama.

1533
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:32,980
This is someone else.
We're almost the same. We're twins.

1534
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,520
I'm a twin.

1535
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:38,790
He shaved it?

1536
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,960
I want to be like Gaggy.

1537
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:45,230
I'm almost there!

1538
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:51,970
Kill him.

1539
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,040
Huh?

1540
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,540
Kill him.

1541
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,440
-Kill?
-Please kill him.

1542
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:57,540
Kill him...

1543
01:11:57,610 --> 01:12:00,180
You can't just kill him.

1544
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:03,010
Kill him. That's just it.

1545
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,280
You can't kill.

1546
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,780
Kill him.

1547
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:09,450
You can't kill him. That's no good!

1548
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:12,790
Why did I have this all this time?

1549
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,630
For six hours?

1550
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:17,500
Was there a reason?
It's just...

1551
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:19,460
Look at it.

1552
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:24,740
What's the point, then?

1553
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:44,620
Let's go for another zombie time.

1554
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:46,860
Here we go

1555
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:50,030
Zombie time

1556
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,140
Here he comes

1557
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,440
Huh? Only three people?

1558
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,040
I'm Enu from the youth clinic.

1559
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:07,510
Shu!

1560
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:13,950
I'll do a song about
whatever you guys say.

1561
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,650
Say whatever you want.

1562
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:18,060
-Sushi.
-Please go with other people.

1563
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,190
-People?
-Comedians?

1564
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:23,230
Kubota-san, Inada-san or Matsuo-san.

1565
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:24,860
Ina-chan.

1566
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:26,000
Here I go.

1567
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:29,400
Hey hey, Inada! Hey Inada!

1568
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:33,240
You're close, close, close.
Really close!

1569
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,740
You're gonna keep this up?
For real?

1570
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:39,340
-You're gonna keep it up?
-I am.

1571
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:42,380
The broadcast code?
That's what was close?

1572
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:44,520
Sorry.
You really think so?

1573
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:46,550
No, I'm an idiot.

1574
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:47,790
An idiot?

1575
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,890
Can you do me? Please.

1576
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,290
Hey hey Kubota! Hey Kubota!

1577
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:58,230
Bald fat, bald fat, fat fat
glasses.

1578
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,900
Come on...

1579
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,270
You're just criticizing.

1580
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:04,970
It depends...

1581
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,840
You're just talking about appearance...

1582
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,210
You're just criticizing.
Do something serious.

1583
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,510
He's just being rough.

1584
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,040
Do one more.

1585
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,210
Do Kubota.
But for real.

1586
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:19,720
Hey hey Kubota! Hey Kubota!

1587
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:23,320
You're really funny
when you say the truth.

1588
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:26,390
Huh? What was that?
You making fun of me?

1589
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:28,560
No, he did a 180.

1590
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:30,730
Quiet, quiet.

1591
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,700
We're not being loud.

1592
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,730
Okay, do him now.

1593
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,770
Mat-chan...

1594
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,240
Hey hey Matsuo! Hey Matsuo!

1595
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:43,210
Your skin is a mess
your haircut is weird!

1596
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,540
Stop it, man!

1597
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:49,550
It was more boring than I thought.
I wanted it to be brutal.

1598
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,850
Quiet, quiet.

1599
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,860
Time's almost up.

1600
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,530
What's wrong?

1601
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:13,140
Someone was here?
You talked?

1602
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,410
Good morning.
Good morning.

1603
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,310
What happened?
Did you talk?

1604
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:22,310
Did you feel strange?

1605
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:24,280
No, no.

1606
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:26,950
Where's Gosuke?

1607
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:28,390
He's not here.

1608
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,630
Time over

1609
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:38,600
It's over.
It's over?

1610
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:47,540
It's finished!

1611
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:49,910
That was kinda quick.

1612
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:51,840
It felt quick at the end.

1613
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:57,350
Alright, the winner by points is...

1614
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,850
Kubota!

1615
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,660
No way!

1616
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:07,930
Whoa!

1617
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:09,530
He won five points.

1618
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,400
Here you go

1619
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,360
Huh?!

1620
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:15,030
I'm sorry!

1621
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,500
No way!

1622
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:23,410
It was incredible.
Your defense was awesome.

1623
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,180
Thank you so much.

1624
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,210
You did everyone in.

1625
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,580
To be honest, I had never
sucked so many cocks before.

1626
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:36,290
Let's hope it doesn't count
as porn money.

1627
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,960
He was talking
so much about the money.

1628
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,800
I'm glad to be alive.
Thank you very much!

1629
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:46,700
Good job!
