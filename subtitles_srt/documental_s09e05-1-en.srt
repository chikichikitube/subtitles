Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!

2
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,240
Alright so this is the fifth episode

3
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,710
Of Documental Season 9

4
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,640
But this time

5
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,810
Well, how could I explain it?
We wanted to

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,680
Take a look back with everyone

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,220
Like an performance review

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,620
Why would anyone want to look back
after paying 1 million?!

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,890
I don't wanna get mad at myself

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,630
It's like revisiting trauma

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,130
I really think
that's how it feels at times

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,700
We wanted to do this

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,670
To talk about how it all felt

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,670
And ask each of you

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,340
About your experiences and so on

16
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,540
So that's what we had in mind.

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,350
It's been a few months after recording,
so you might not remember

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,980
That's right!

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,950
So we're going to look back
on the whole show.

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,320
Let's take a look at the beginning

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,090
Alright then

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,690
-That was fun
-Documental

23
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,490
Start!

24
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,030
I had forgotten about this

25
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,530
Absolutely

26
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,700
Do you know Mimio's character?!

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,470
Do you know the character?

28
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:29,840
He's smiling!

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,170
I wasn't smiling at all!

30
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,110
I made something to drink

31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,680
Really?

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,080
So try drinking it

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,450
Ah, this happened!

34
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,680
There's no way...

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,750
That's serious!

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,050
That was so quick!

37
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,850
It was too soon!

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,130
She hated this

39
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,860
There she goes

40
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,300
Everything evil about the sea
in a single place.

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,270
You smiled a little!

42
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,410
I was really mad here

43
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,970
There it goes

44
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,810
So annoying

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,010
It's wet

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
I just... I just washed it, so...

47
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,810
You put your ass here

48
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,680
Right!

49
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,120
That was terrible!

50
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,020
And you two have to
have a live conversation

51
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,760
And the popcorn pops
and the moment it hits your ass

52
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,260
Even if you're talking

53
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,970
You have to shout
a fruit's name

54
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,700
Ikesaki is terrible!

55
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,210
It's always so contrived!

56
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,480
You two have to talk

57
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,010
You use someone's topic
and go with it

58
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,020
But once the popcorn
starts to pop

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,320
It's gonna hit your ass.
When it does...

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,260
What are you talking about?

61
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,330
What step was that?

62
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,160
If it hits you,
you shout a fruit's name

63
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,600
-Once it hits you?
-Right

64
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,470
-A fruit?
-Either a fruit or...

65
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,670
A vegetable's name.

66
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,870
-Which one?
-Whichever's fine

67
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,310
Vegetables too?
That's too broad

68
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,710
Depends on the person

69
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,310
What's he even saying?

70
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,280
Whoa

71
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,480
Right so, Sunshine isn't here

72
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,950
Right

73
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,450
So I have a question

74
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,550
Is he really

75
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,990
That stupid?

76
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,290
Yeah, yeah.
It was very incoherent.

77
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,690
He was speaking for a long time

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,490
He really was

79
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,100
Looking back,
you guys really held it in

80
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,070
I really didn't understand
anything he said

81
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,440
Also, Soshina

82
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Wh-what?

83
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,740
This is something

84
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,440
Many people have said

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,980
After rewatching the whole thing

86
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,110
Ah, I know!

87
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,310
That I'm too soft with you.

88
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,250
-Not at all!
-He was totally smiling!

89
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,520
He was smiling for sure

90
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,490
Absolutely smiling right there

91
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,920
They say Yoshimoto cheats for you

92
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,390
He's getting favors!

93
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,590
-Hey, come on!
-Like favors, yeah!

94
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,190
I've heard that, yeah!

95
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,490
Come on, you're the worst

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,530
-Always defending him.
-I always ignore him.

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,830
That's indefensible, right Kubota?

98
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,700
Completely unforgivable!

99
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,840
Having Matsumoto-san say that
is scary

100
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,470
What if I had been out earlier...

101
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,510
There are people with
more ambiguous expressions

102
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,380
That's how it has
always seemed to me

103
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,310
It's not that I'm covering for you, though.

104
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,650
But some other people could also say

105
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,620
That I was too rough with Soshina

106
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,520
And I didn't want anyone

107
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,520
To say that either...

108
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,330
That being said, today...

109
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,830
We're going to look
at your near-death scenes

110
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,670
Her near-death scene,
chosen by Tsubaki Oniyakko

111
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,240
The first time I felt in trouble

112
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,840
Was at the beginning,
with Osada's toothbrush

113
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,180
I had to hold it in for real there

114
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,210
At the very beginning, right?

115
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,380
I didn't realize you were

116
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,520
-Struggling that much
-Yeah, I...

117
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,790
I was really close back then
with Osada

118
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,250
I made a new
electric toothbrush

119
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,020
Electric toothbrush?

120
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,320
They're so compact nowadays, though

121
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,660
What brand is it?
Phillipps?

122
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,230
This one is SunStar (Editor's Note: 1)

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,160
SunStar makes
such makeshift products?

124
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,900
Can I go ahead?

125
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,070
Whoa

126
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,270
No way

127
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,170
No way, man

128
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,210
Ah, it's true!

129
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,910
I didn't notice at all!

130
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,250
Is your upper jaw okay?

131
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,720
His face is being dragged around

132
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,980
Stop it man!

133
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,150
You should make it weaker

134
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,220
Well I don't really care what you do

135
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,090
But hearing an old man gag
in the morning isn't great

136
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,930
You're right.
I didn't notice at all

137
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,460
I always think people gagging
is hilarious

138
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,560
You were squirming

139
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,770
Well, in my own case
and this is kind of for me

140
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,340
But I have a TMJ disorder
so it looked like it hurt (EN: 2)

141
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,310
That's all I was thinking, and seeing him

142
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,370
It was like empathy, then?

143
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,410
Seeing him go like,
made me want to laugh from anxiety

144
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,650
Makes me think

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,850
I should've kept pressing

146
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,020
But I didn't notice at all

147
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,420
-I think you cut it a little short
-Yeah, it was too soon

148
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,890
Well, so you know...

149
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,300
You can tell this guy
spent an entire day working on that

150
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,430
I know!

151
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,430
So thinking about that

152
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,070
This time it was only four hours, right?

153
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,940
-It was pretty short
-Too short!

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,670
So I just had to go
with everything I had

155
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,040
I was even smiling quickly

156
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,040
Right, it was too soon!

157
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,910
And I laughed at Abareru almost immediately

158
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,310
It was really soon as well

159
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,350
So I wanted to use up
everything I had

160
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,390
The pacing was pretty frantic

161
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,460
Okay now,
Kubota's near-death scene

162
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,730
Mine was Goto with
the popcorn in his balls

163
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,070
That one!
Ikesaki's moment, right?

164
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,900
That was pretty serious!
Yeah!

165
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,170
It was really really bad

166
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,340
It burnt me so bad! For real!

167
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,650
Goto-san, talk, talk!

168
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,110
Mandarin!

169
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,510
What?

170
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,780
That was so funny

171
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,320
It's not for me, though.

172
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,990
Is it coming?
Ve-vegetable!

173
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,590
It didn't even hit him there!

174
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,120
Watermelon!

175
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,420
Talk

176
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,560
Watermelon

177
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,060
Pumpkin!

178
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,700
Please sit down, Goto-san

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,570
Peach! Cucumber!

180
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,940
Everyone was in trouble

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,070
Right, this was pretty bad!

182
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,710
Carrot!

183
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,240
My balls are done for!
Goto-san!

184
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,180
You can do it, Goto-san!

185
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,380
My balls are busting!

186
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,780
My balls are busting
for real!

187
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,120
My balls are busting

188
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,190
Whoa!

189
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,990
My balls are gonna pop, man.

190
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,820
He's so upset

191
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,860
They're popping out, actually

192
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,660
Right? My balls are burs-ping

193
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,830
Bursping?

194
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,260
Bursting?

195
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,830
Popping

196
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,930
I think Abareru
was smiling as well!

197
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,610
That was serious

198
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,740
So I chose this.
Goto-san really watched over me

199
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,110
When I first joined Yoshimoto, right?

200
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,010
But thinking about it

201
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,850
This guy hosts a lot of TV shows,
so you have

202
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,850
A TV host with his balls out
being hit by pop corn

203
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,320
So I thought about
other popular hosts

204
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,090
And I couldn't help imagining Miyane-san
doing something like that! (EN: 3)

205
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,090
I found it hilarious
in my own head!

206
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,330
I didn't think
my balls were gonna be hanging out!

207
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,900
You just told me they were out, right?

208
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,630
It's just that
those briefs in particular

209
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,570
Don't fit well, and they were popping out!

210
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,340
It was purely coincidental!
That makes it even worse!

211
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,510
It was hurting
and everyone was kinda laughing

212
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,480
So when I realized
I felt the shame of exposing myself.

213
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,150
Thinking about it
even I almost laughed

214
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,720
"Oh, my balls are out"

215
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,190
You don't frequently
laugh when you see your own balls

216
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,460
The ballsack
was sagging like hell!

217
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,230
They were being pulled
by indescribable strengths!

218
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,390
It sure was stretching

219
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,860
Since they were being
stretched so much

220
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,500
His balls were also
bizarrely dark, right?

221
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,900
It wasn't just the lighting.
That was so weird!

222
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,500
I can't really stand it, Goto

223
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,600
I can't do anything about that!

224
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,210
The color was the funniest part

225
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,680
-Your balls are black?
-I guess so, a little black yeah.

226
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,410
A little black? What does that mean?

227
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,750
They're bizarrely black.

228
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,580
They looked like the floating stone. (EN: 4)

229
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,990
I didn't really get to choose
what color my balls would be, though

230
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,930
Alright then, let's have a look
at the next digest.

231
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,700
Right

232
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,000
Pretty far into it

233
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,000
This was really funny!

234
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,170
That one!

235
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,070
Who was that?

236
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,440
This is pretty bad!

237
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,680
This was really funny!

238
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,350
His pecs are pretty good!

239
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,050
Master Kiyoshi!

240
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,280
He's smiling!

241
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,220
He should've been out!

242
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,250
Why didn't he go out with this one?

243
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,290
He didn't for some reason!

244
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,260
Ah, I remember this

245
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,200
This was a bit moment

246
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,900
It was pure chaos

247
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,200
I'm dying!
I'm gonna die from old age

248
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,910
What kind of performance is that?

249
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,540
Smells like Currypanman

250
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,380
This was really funny

251
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,350
Like that Okumura-san
from Toho or something?

252
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,250
Yakko-san really made me laugh here

253
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,120
It's Okuyama-san, right?

254
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,190
From the film

255
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,890
I said Okumura-san, but

256
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
It's Okuyama-san

257
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,790
Was it Okuyama-san?

258
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,230
I have these special
cards for playing Karuta

259
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,670
Do you have "re"?

260
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,670
You see, I really love the "re" one

261
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,710
Throw the shrimp away

262
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,810
He definitely laughed!

263
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,580
He laughed!

264
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,280
I see

265
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,250
Yakko-san's Momoi series

266
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,990
That was pretty good

267
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,320
So happy to hear that

268
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,290
I don't really get to talk much as her

269
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,190
As Momoi-san

270
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,600
But everyone was listening to me!

271
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,530
-I was speaking nonstop
-And you played Karuta

272
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
That's right

273
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,030
And also Master Kiyoshi

274
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,740
That was really bad

275
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,200
That was Kubota

276
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,670
I made sure to
properly give him a call

277
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,210
It didn't connect at first

278
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,880
I called his manager

279
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,480
And told him I wanted to make
Kiyoshi-san's face

280
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,620
And he was like
"Um... I don't know..."

281
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,420
It seemed like a no-go

282
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,090
Did you actually
visit Kiyoshi for that?

283
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,290
I gave him a call.

284
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,730
"You see, my reputation is on the line
and I could win 20 million yen"

285
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,430
He wished me luck
and let me do it.

286
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,100
The Master Kiyoshi gag
was hilarious

287
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,840
-It was really bad.
-Kiyoshi was funny

288
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,980
But maybe it was
because of how long ago it was

289
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,410
But I don't remember
anything about the devil's castanets. (EN: 5)

290
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,420
I really don't remember this!
Who's that?

291
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,120
Who was it?

292
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,990
-It's Kubota-san.
-That's Kubota?!

293
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,750
The devil with castanets.

294
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,160
I had to visit an old man
in a bar

295
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,130
to have him teach me
how to use them.

296
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,630
I did all that
for them to barely work

297
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,700
For real

298
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,770
So, Soshina's
near-death scene

299
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,570
It was with Seiya

300
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,680
When he did
the "Suberanai" impression

301
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,880
Ah, right!

302
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,950
And he was just

303
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,050
-So persistent with it.
-He was!

304
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,880
I almost died there

305
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,590
Something's happening

306
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,750
Is that music?

307
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,690
When you slip up with your story!

308
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,400
The best people have gathered together!

309
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,440
We have gathered the specialists today!

310
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,640
It's time to talk!

311
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,440
-That's a pretty nasty impersonation
of Wakamoto Nori

312
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,710
Because of the appearance?

313
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,380
Chihara Junior

314
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,680
Thank you for
always talking with us

315
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,250
Right here
out of the narration!

316
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,460
You're always talking

317
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,990
With these
amazing fellas!

318
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,000
You're not talking!!

319
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,070
You don't talk
when you don't have to!

320
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,470
The man that won't talk
when he doesn't have to!

321
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,940
He can only talk as a presenter.
He won't talk when it's time to.

322
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,280
He doesn't talk when he has to!

323
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,780
And even if you stare at him
he won't talk!

324
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,290
He doesn't talk when it's talk time!

325
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,460
Talk- He won't talk.

326
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,560
He's singing

327
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,060
Talk, he won't talk.

328
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,870
Talk, he won't talk.

329
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,900
Talk, he won't talk.

330
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,040
This guy's not talking either

331
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,380
He's not talking!

332
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,980
He's smiling, though!

333
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,450
Not talking!

334
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,620
This took him down

335
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,750
Right, that happened!

336
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,020
I thought you'd
keep going forever!

337
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,760
It was so long!

338
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,890
Not talking

339
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
That was the character!

340
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,090
"He won't talk
when it's talking time"

341
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
That's what I had in mind!

342
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,630
"He won't talk
when it's talking time"?!

343
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,530
That was pretty serious, yeah

344
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,940
It's the type of gag
that pisses off older people

345
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,240
Depends on the person, but yeah

346
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,410
That's not what I meant!

347
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,440
I just got in character
and went on the offensive!

348
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,550
And I chose Goto-san for that

349
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,710
That was pretty bad

350
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,850
You really didn't know?!

351
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,750
-I really didn't know.
-Among the Shimofuris

352
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,820
I didn't know!

353
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,520
I really didn't

354
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,220
So being with your partner
isn't great?

355
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,860
It really isn't

356
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,060
Because it's lame
if only you laugh at him

357
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,390
It's pretty bad

358
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,960
Yeah, laughing too much
isn't great

359
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,100
That's right

360
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,800
I've never laughed
at my partner though

361
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,400
Of course you have!

362
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
A lot of times!

363
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,370
Not even once

364
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,740
Of course you have!

365
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,840
Stop sounding serious

366
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,810
Not since we were in school

367
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
How many years ago?!

368
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,950
Two hours left

369
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,980
Alright!

370
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,220
Ouch ouch ouch!

371
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,290
Alright, health fortune

372
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,390
The ice house

373
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,590
You're gonna die!

374
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,630
Leave!

375
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,500
-Leave!
-More!

376
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,170
-Leave!
-Thank you!

377
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,070
I really didn't get this part

378
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,100
Wasn't that a smile?

379
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,040
I haven't smiled at all

380
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,440
No, no, no!!

381
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
For real, this part

382
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,780
Ouch!

383
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,820
That hurts!

384
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
I think it broke

385
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,720
I find it hilarious that Abareru-san

386
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,560
finds that funny.

387
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,730
The explosive ice duel

388
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,500
You both get topless
and grab ice cubes

389
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,670
And you have to melt them
on each other's nipples

390
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,670
while attacking with your best gags.

391
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,380
What was that?

392
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,380
Huh?

393
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:39,810
What?

394
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,850
That's too long, man

395
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,020
You lose if you
step away from it.

396
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,290
And you lose if you laugh of course.

397
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,320
They can't laugh

398
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,820
So if you step away...

399
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,560
You lose in Documental
if you laugh.

400
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,860
He's such an idiot.

401
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,860
Aren't those the rules?

402
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,340
Sunshine Ikesaki sure was chaotic

403
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,270
Yakko-san looked really annoyed
by that crow!

404
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,410
The crow definitely hurt

405
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,210
And the sound was
something else as well

406
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,150
That's right,
I tried to protect myself

407
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,380
It was over me

408
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,780
-She was cowering.
-Covering myself

409
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,450
I thought he was pecking me
like a crow would peck at the floor

410
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,990
Like your head was the ground

411
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,190
I got mad

412
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,090
And the sound was something else

413
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,390
It was too long

414
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,230
Like

415
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,500
I never imagined I would be
pecking a random senior's head

416
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,670
Right, that doesn't happen often!

417
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,940
But as time went by

418
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I wanted the crow
to behave like a real one

419
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,980
And in pecking her
I thought she might smile

420
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,740
It was pretty bad

421
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,710
To be honest I got
pretty concerned during the swordfight

422
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,180
Ah, right!

423
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,150
His face started twitching

424
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,390
Right.
I started feeling stressed

425
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,290
It was like

426
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,830
So after around the fifth one

427
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,430
I couldn't do it anymore

428
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,730
That's serious!

429
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,730
You're a great actor!

430
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,700
I wasn't acting!
Not at all.

431
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,170
I'm so jealous!

432
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,640
This happens in manzai sometimes

433
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,010
After getting hit a few times
you go like

434
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,110
Like twitching

435
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,310
Would've been obvious if it were fake

436
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,640
That's serious, man!

437
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,610
Alright so Seiya's
near-death scene

438
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,950
So it was Sunshine

439
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,420
I never understood
what he was doing

440
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,590
He had several games

441
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,260
But the single moment
he stopped the games

442
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,030
I don't know
if you remember

443
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,530
But he was doing shaolin

444
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,600
Something like that...

445
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,100
And he acted like
nothing hurt him

446
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,370
I don't remember

447
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,370
I remember something
about shaolin.

448
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,140
He had a character from Baki

449
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,740
And no matter the attack
he received no damage

450
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,810
No one got that
but I knew that character

451
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,320
So I was the only one in trouble

452
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,720
And then after an attack

453
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,420
His sunglasses fell like that

454
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,060
And his face was super creepy

455
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,130
And I almost laughed back then.
Let's take a look

456
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:11,960
Ready?

457
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,860
This, right!

458
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,900
This, this happened!

459
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,970
This?

460
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,070
Whoa!

461
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,770
It didn't hurt at all.
Shaolin

462
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,310
That's Shaolin

463
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,370
Ready? Ready?

464
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,840
In the face?

465
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,980
You sure?
Ready? In the face

466
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,480
This happened yeah

467
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,590
Shaolin

468
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,690
It doesn't hurt.

469
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,320
That's what he says

470
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,590
Abareru-kun, you do it

471
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,890
It did look like it hurt, though.

472
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,190
Shaolin

473
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,430
This is shaolin

474
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,800
In the face, Abareru-kun

475
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,600
-It came off!
-Watch out!

476
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,900
That's creepy!

477
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,570
So creepy!

478
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
That's creepy, man!

479
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,910
I was in big trouble here!

480
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
For real!

481
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,180
That was pretty serious

482
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,750
That was bad

483
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,880
What the hell was he doing?!

484
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,320
For real, what was that?!

485
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,760
I had to hide my smile

486
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,860
What was that?

487
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,930
That's right

488
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,270
And he was talking about shaolin
and then at the end

489
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,240
His face was creepy!
What the hell?

490
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,670
But no one understanding

491
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,840
Is what made it funny!

492
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,310
That's true.

493
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,480
The fact that no one got it

494
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,780
Of course
he wasn't going to smile

495
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,820
That's right
I mean

496
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,790
I got a sudden call
from Ikesaki a few days later

497
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,760
"I couldn't do anything"

498
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,290
But I think he did a lot!

499
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
He did a lot of stuff!

500
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,030
He did a lot, but

501
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,960
It did feel
like he did nothing

502
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,730
I think he'd be happy to hear that

503
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,040
I was in serious trouble back then

504
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,340
Alright, Osada's
near-death scene

505
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,380
I struggled when Yakko-san

506
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,920
did that pachinko film
performance thing

507
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,190
It went on for a while

508
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,490
But I was wondering what I was watching

509
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,330
I was wondering
if you had worked hard to do it

510
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,560
With Daisan

511
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,800
And that was pretty funny

512
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,830
But in the end nothing happened

513
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,730
And Yakko-san self destructed

514
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,570
I think I might've laughed

515
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,840
If she hadn't
self destructed.

516
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,640
It was an own goal, right?

517
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,010
I didn't get that at all

518
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,480
It makes you
feel motivated to do things

519
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,910
CR...

520
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,520
A pachinko?

521
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,150
Alright, here we go

522
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,880
CR

523
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Tsubaki Oniyakko

524
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,820
There it is!

525
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,720
That was pretty long

526
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,020
It's hand-made. Pretty cute

527
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,890
You did this yourself, right?
Sound and everything?

528
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,700
A new line

529
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,800
This is pretty funny

530
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,740
I think it's charming

531
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,210
The performance

532
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,150
She looked so thin there

533
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,420
-I'm Gijiren!
-What?

534
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,560
There's a lot of stuff happening!

535
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,870
The yakitori
is completely unrelated as well

536
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,410
The handwriting is thin!

537
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,250
What the hell's this?

538
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,350
Super hot

539
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,420
She said "super hot"

540
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,020
-Freeze!
-There it is!

541
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,050
Freeze?

542
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
Something on the screen?

543
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,490
Everyday life
in April 2020

544
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,860
We have some foreshadowing

545
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
There it is

546
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,960
That's Chinchirorin

547
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,500
What's going on?

548
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,170
I think he has to pile them up

549
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,370
There we go

550
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,470
There it is

551
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,010
No

552
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,340
What?

553
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,110
But I thought...

554
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,910
What's that?

555
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,080
So he made it?

556
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,180
He's smiling so much

557
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,720
Show us! There it is!

558
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,780
There it is, there it is!

559
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,250
That's good enough

560
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
So long

561
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,460
It's too long

562
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,130
That was pretty bad

563
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,530
Pachinko takes time!

564
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,700
What now?

565
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,510
That's enough

566
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,010
Not at all

567
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,910
Oni rush! Break in!

568
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
What's that?

569
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,980
There we go

570
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,180
This is serious

571
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,850
That was... seriously

572
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,720
I didn't need
to watch this twice in my life!

573
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,360
That was fun

574
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,930
That was really long

575
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,960
The full thing, yeah

576
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,670
That's enough

577
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,570
We don't need all this

578
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,740
I thought it was
just too good

579
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
Horyuuren?

580
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,380
I didn't really get it.
Why was it so long?

581
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,580
We have long shorts lately

582
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,920
The Chinchiro part was too long

583
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,750
Huh?

584
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,920
It stopped
Wait

585
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,220
It's over

586
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,030
I couldn't believe
that was all

587
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,400
There really was nothing at all

588
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,700
I couldn't believe
we had to watch literally nothing

589
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,310
I didn't want the ending
to be so long

590
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,880
But the whole crowd reaction

591
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,710
I mean, I think
it was way too long

592
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,710
I was expecting
some kind of punchline

593
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,880
Looking at it now
it was funny

594
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,150
It's really funny

595
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,290
I remember smiling, yeah

596
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,760
I really wanted it to reach

597
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,790
Pachinko players, actually.

598
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,090
That works, yeah

599
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,700
Alright then, one last hour

600
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,400
Let's look at the digest

601
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,510
I prefer my pork

602
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,280
Roasted

603
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,420
There it is!

604
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,490
Pretend that that's Yoshihide

605
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,360
That was funny

606
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,730
And you want to smell
Yoshihide's farts

607
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,430
You always throw me out!

608
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,670
-I think it's the shape
-I got it

609
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,070
What?

610
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,500
I'm parsley

611
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Weren't you green peas?

612
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,910
Isn't he a pepper?

613
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,340
He's green peas

614
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,910
I thought he was green peas

615
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,610
He's too thick for parsley

616
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Who are you?

617
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,720
I'm green peas

618
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,820
No way

619
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,720
Ouch!

620
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,690
Huh? What was that?

621
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,920
Okay, the last one.
Anyone wants it?

622
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
Okayuta-san

623
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,830
I struggled with this one

624
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,330
This one was pretty rough!

625
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,640
And he hit the wall
like Bomberman

626
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,410
He was like Bomberman

627
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,440
One cat, two cats

628
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,510
Madame cat

629
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,380
One cat, two cats

630
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,850
Madame cat

631
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,420
If only we had song, dance
and a performance!

632
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,360
That's right, but songs
can't change the world!

633
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,390
You know, right?

634
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,500
No, I don't

635
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,630
What?

636
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,900
What? What?

637
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,080
I don't get this at all

638
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
Musicals are

639
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,680
What was that, Soshina?

640
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,050
Your weakness, right?

641
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,050
He said it broke him

642
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,850
Do bicycles stop
at the Tokyo Teleport Station?

643
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,390
They don't

644
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,960
Also make sure your wife knows

645
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,390
I saw her take her tit out
on the airplane!

646
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,060
I thought
you left

647
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,300
But you were looking
at my wife's tits, huh?

648
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,100
That's right
and I fucked her later!

649
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,270
You should thank me

650
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,340
What was that?

651
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,840
And it rings with decibels!

652
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,110
It goes like peep beep!

653
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,410
Ouch I'm fainting shaolin

654
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,740
There he goes again

655
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,950
I'm gonna lick
like you've never seen before

656
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,310
Lickity lick boom!
Lickity lick boom!

657
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,150
Lickity lick booom!

658
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,350
That's insane

659
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,850
It's completely insane!

660
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,120
Right, right

661
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,360
That was the final self destruction

662
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,600
Why are you
taking up time now?

663
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,700
Everyone made it
pretty alright!

664
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,870
What now?

665
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,540
Is that the most
survivors ever?

666
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,510
Kubota wins!

667
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,170
No way!

668
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,540
He's good

669
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,950
The fire of passion

670
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,250
He was crying

671
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,380
First time I've cried

672
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,690
No, that happened before

673
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,360
Congratulations Kubota!

674
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,690
Nice championship

675
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,160
Great championship

676
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,730
That was pretty good, huh?

677
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,370
It was really good

678
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,270
We had survivors before
but this is the first time

679
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,940
We've had so many at the end

680
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,710
That's just
how fierce it was

681
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,010
And Kubota even cried

682
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,050
Well, we had
the 10 million from last time

683
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,920
So I just
cried without thinking about it

684
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,090
So what were those tears?

685
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,590
You cried from happiness?

686
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,530
Like all of a sudden?

687
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,960
That's right
I just started crying

688
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,800
I was trying to hide
just how happy I was

689
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:21,040
Well, I was also
so tired, twitching like

690
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,170
Again?

691
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,840
Stress again?

692
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,310
Performing is scary

693
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,480
Winning should've fixed that!

694
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,680
It was 20 million!

695
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,550
No way, really

696
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,220
So I was expecting

697
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,890
To get scolded
since Kubota won again

698
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,720
From all kinds of people

699
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,330
It's fine.
Lately I've seen

700
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,490
Seeing a lot of that on YouTube

701
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,660
And getting rid
of anyone who complains

702
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,430
Unexpected behavior!

703
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,770
You should say something
as well, Matsumoto-san!

704
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,700
Tell all the news articles
and journals online!

705
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,440
Like, here's the video, take it

706
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,640
Is that some kind of revenge?

707
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,910
So anyways, Goto's near-death scene

708
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,080
This is Soshina again

709
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,120
It was with Soshina's comedian chips

710
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,660
And the comedian cards

711
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,990
Right, right

712
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,960
Mine's holographic as well

713
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,390
Lots of holo ones

714
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,230
Narumi-san

715
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,130
Suddenly?

716
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,570
Choice is...

717
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,330
Narumi's holo

718
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,470
Here's where it started

719
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,740
This was pretty bad

720
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,310
Fujii Akira!

721
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,580
What's this?

722
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,520
Lots of funny moments

723
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,650
Sideways Narumi

724
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,820
Another Narumi version!

725
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,530
And it was Junior

726
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,130
Not Sideways Narumi!

727
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,630
A new version! Sideways Narumi!

728
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,000
I was looking this way,
but like

729
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,970
I saw someone running

730
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,340
It was Junior-san

731
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,110
I think that's
when Junior-san realized

732
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,380
And he was running
at a great speed

733
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,180
He realized

734
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,980
He was done for!

735
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,980
I knew it was great

736
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,220
I was done in

737
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,650
Besides,
the pictures were just terrible!

738
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,190
No, no, no

739
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,420
They were awful!

740
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,830
I got permission
from Narumi-san herself

741
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,660
And so, I asked Narumi-san

742
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,600
If I could use a picture of her.

743
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,230
And she asked me which

744
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,500
So she checked the pictures

745
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,170
I sent her about six

746
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,810
And she told me
to use that one

747
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,040
That one in particular

748
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,040
The white one
with the tiara

749
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,450
I had never seen that one!

750
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,750
So Narumi-san chose it herself!

751
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,350
That's right!
I sent her a lot

752
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,890
And she wanted this one!

753
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,420
I think I would've laughed
even harder then

754
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,860
She told you to
not use some of them?

755
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,860
Kind of, yeah

756
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,730
This one was the best

757
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,130
Narumi-san said so?

758
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,860
The one with the tiara, yeah.

759
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,400
You got permission
from Piroki-san?

760
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,100
I think the people at the office
checked it out

761
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,310
I don't think Piroki-san
has an office, though

762
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,110
Of course he does!

763
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,680
He does!

764
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,880
It's a public picture anyway

765
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,710
Alright, so that's Season 9

766
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,780
This is the first time
we've done a rewatch!

767
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,590
And 20 million!

768
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,920
Thank you very much

769
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,220
So last time

770
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,090
We got a scolding
from Amazon

771
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,230
Right

772
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,730
And they told us
to not show genitals

773
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,960
Right, right.

774
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,430
I showed my balls, though

775
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,630
Right

776
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,670
And I had a penis helmet as well

777
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,970
It was very realistic

778
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,940
That's not a good compromise!

779
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,940
He was walking like this!

780
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,310
With it on!

781
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,440
And it was supposed to shoot stuff, right?

782
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,910
It was like glued!

783
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,410
That's right.
I had a spray built in

784
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,650
Inside the urethra

785
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,250
And it was supposed to shoot

786
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,090
But that got destroyed
and it didn't come out

787
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,020
There might not have been
any 20 million if it had

788
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,130
No way! That's scary!
