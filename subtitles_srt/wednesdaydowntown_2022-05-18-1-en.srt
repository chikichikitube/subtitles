00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,710
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,890
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,150
Who is it?

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,550
It's him.
-It's him, the competent man

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,350
It's Kawashima
-Hello everyone

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:28,250
Thank you all, today we bring you a special episode

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,010
This is it

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,880
All Counter-Prank Special!

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,020
What is this
All?

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,090
When it comes to Wednesday Downtown, there have been a number of prank projects that can be called masterpieces

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,460
This time, we have chosen some very popular style pranks to perform some counter pranks

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,470
Counter prank?
-What masterpiece projects of Wednesday Downtown come to mind?

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,130
Masterpieces...

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,310
You're taking too long to think

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,560
Is it impossible?

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,140
I don't even watch it
-You must have seen some of it

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,990
By the way, the target of these counter pranks are those who have been the instigators in the past

18
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,160
I see.
-Yes, we called them in again to re-do old projects

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,030
They will think, "It went down well, they asked me to do it again," and come to participate

20
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,390
They'll be more energetic than before.
-Thinking "Yes, let's do it!"

21
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,070
Then they'll be metaphorically punched in the face

22
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,020
In other words, for Hamada-san, it's a great VTR.
-Why?

23
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,180
One full hour
-It's true!

24
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,760
It's like Hamada-san's children's meal

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,450
Today is all stuff Hamada loves to watch

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,100
And so, the All Counter-Prank Special!

27
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,650
What will happen?

28
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:13,880
"I'm coming over now, wait for me!" If an angry person turns up, no matter how strange they look, the other won't say anything

29
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,710
A very interesting one

30
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,830
Last time was

31
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:21,050
Even thought you're a junior, you say bad things about me, I'm angry!

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,490
Diane's Tsuda ranted on the phone to Rice's Sekimachi

33
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,960
I'm coming to find you now, dammit, i'm so pissed off!

34
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,500
Tsuda acted quite well

35
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,440
With such anger, he went to Sekimachi barefoot

36
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,670
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?
-How are you?

37
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,770
What do you want?

38
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,110
Why do I have to hear this stuff from you?
-What's wrong with you?

39
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,210
You're barefoot

40
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,610
Don't worry about barefoot, damn you!

41
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,410
It's over in a flash

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,140
Failure in just 13 seconds

43
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,250
So,

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,020
Thank you for having me

45
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,990
He said it

46
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,690
This time, Tsuda will attack Yojou in a strange costume

47
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,900
But he will be waiting for Tsuda in an even stranger costume as a counter prank

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,770
So that's how it is

49
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,130
What is your relationship?

50
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,070
I have a Tsuda Legion

51
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,800
He is a member of the Osaka Tsuda Legion

52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,810
Tsuda Legion?
-Tsuda Legion?

53
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,120
Tsuda Legion?
-Tsuda Legion, yes

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,980
Tsuda Legion...

55
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,090
The disguise that this Military Chief will use is...

56
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,100
How many times does he have to say it?

57
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,420
Ah, all wet, all wet, right?

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,700
Last time the soaking wet Yamauchi was a success!

59
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,630
So this could be doable

60
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,100
And more extreme than a full layer of moisture is Yojou's disguise...

61
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,660
A doppelgänger doll in the style of the Hall of Civilization, famous for its "honey cake first"

62
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,580
Waiting like this?
-Just like this

63
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,280
It is difficult to ignore

64
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,550
So, it begins immediately

65
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,880
I'm calling him now

66
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,350
Here we go

67
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,950
Calling

68
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,550
I'll take it

69
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,760
Hello?
-Hello?

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,990
Hello

71
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,230
Tsuda
-Ah, hello

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,800
I was in Osaka last month, around the 10th

73
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,000
He starts lecturing about ignoring an invitation to drink

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,540
Are you looking down on me?
-No, no, no, no

75
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,440
Because it is me it doesn't matter, is that it?

76
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,880
No, I don't think that, really

77
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,850
Why do I have to be so embarrassed by you?

78
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,650
I'm sorry
-The alcohol doesn't taste good anymore, you bastard!

79
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:41,450
Not knowing that the other side has diverged, Tsuda's angry reaches its limit

80
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,390
Well played

81
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Where the hell are you? Where are you now?

82
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,070
I'm at Yoshimoto headquarters.
-Headquarters?

83
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,640
I'm going over there now, you wait for me!

84
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,470
Hey, wait for me, you bastard!
-Yes, I'm sorry

85
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,080
He's scared to death

86
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,280
What the hell is this guy doing?

87
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,180
So disgusting looking

88
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,850
It will work. This will work

89
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,320
So, on the other side the body begins to be soaked

90
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,890
Why is it cold water

91
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,350
He departs

92
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:23,230
Can Tsuda maintain this anger even in front of the doppelganger?

93
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,720
The expression is very good

94
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,700
Very good, very good, the expression should be maintained

95
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,180
What will be the result?

96
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,490
He does seem to be reflecting

97
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,640
Oi!

98
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,780
What the heck are you doing?

99
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,220
I'm sorry

100
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,720
What the hell are you?

101
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,690
Ah, that...

102
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,220
Today I came to Tokyo to attend the meeting of an event and shoot a VTR

103
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,600
This kind of thing does happen

104
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,120
Yoshimoto really has such jobs

105
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,930
You damn...you damn, why...

106
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,460
Don't give up!

107
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,730
Why couldn't I get in touch with you?

108
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,570
Said it, said it

109
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,340
Why couldn't I get in touch with you?
-Sorry

110
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,920
Already laughing!

111
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,750
All out to apologize

112
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,380
What the hell?

113
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,180
You'd want to say, "What the hell?"

114
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,850
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry

115
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,980
Why couldn't I contact you?

116
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,180
Go, go, go!

117
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,910
With the appearance of the junior exceeding expectations and the weird situation

118
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,850
Both sides seem to be reflecting each other

119
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,240
Tsuda couldn't help but laugh out loud

120
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,870
Why the hell are you dressed like this, ah?

121
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,730
It was really not intentional

122
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,510
Why are you dressed like this ah?

123
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,710
I'm sorry, it's because to shoot the event VTR

124
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,640
Why couldn't you be contacted until today?

125
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,250
I'm sorry

126
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,030
Three people apologizing together

127
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,420
You look...look down on me, right?

128
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,070
No, there is absolutely no disrespect

129
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,920
Already looking down

130
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,390
What the hell do you want to do?
-I don't want to do anything

131
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,830
I'm so angry
-I'm really sorry

132
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:02,520
In the face of the trio's total denial, Tsuda was completely KO'd

133
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,500
Laughing out loud is not an option

134
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,920
The truth is revealed

135
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,420
Three on one

136
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,570
What is this...?

137
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,510
Enough! What is this?

138
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,110
Do you understand what's going on?

139
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,110
Who can understand this?

140
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,450
This time, it is a project to counter a previously tested theory

141
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,520
I couldn't figure out what happened the moment I came in

142
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,150
But I thought I had to go on

143
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,060
I was really looking forward to this project!

144
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,660
Once in a while, let me be the undercover person

145
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,790
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry

146
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,230
That's enough of you, you piss me off

147
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,260
I see.
-Indeed

148
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,910
But it's true that there are cases like that, as a comedian

149
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,380
Being scolded when having dressed up and waiting to shoot

150
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,080
There are really cases when the other person comes over when they are free in between work

151
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,100
I'd still want to say "Why are you wet?

152
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,720
Just another sentence
-Yes

153
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,450
The great thing is that Tsuda gradually dried up

154
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,860
Because he was weaker, right?

155
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,570
Probably went home like that

156
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,430
What I find particularly funny is that, at the beginning, Tsuda was so happy to be chosen

157
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,450
Even happier than last time

158
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,440
The difference was very clear

159
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,510
He's really a very good object to make fun of

160
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,510
So, the rest is even more enjoyable so let's watch the next VTR

161
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,240
What is it this time

162
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,520
Next on the All Counter-Prank Special is...

163
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,620
Celebrity family members can accidentally be fooled by a bad impersonation of the artist

164
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,110
A very old project, this one

165
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,720
The last validation performed was...

166
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,830
Hello?
-It's me

167
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,500
What's wrong?
-My phone number has changed

168
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,830
You can save this number

169
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,700
You're not buying a smartphone, are you?

170
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,200
The quality of the imitation is very high at first, but

171
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,350
I got offered work as father and daughter

172
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:01,190
I was wondering if I should take it, I'm thinking about it

173
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,190
What do you think?

174
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,920
Father and daughter on stage together?

175
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,190
Um, no...hey?

176
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,030
Wait a minute. Something doesn't seem right.
-What's wrong?

177
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,930
The topic of "father and daughter on stage together" arouses suspicion

178
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,440
This time, the counter-prank is targeting Haraguchi

179
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:31,940
IMALU, who supposedly thinks the real Sanma is calling her, says something that cannot be revealed

180
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,950
And this matter is...

181
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,230
I am going to tell him that i'm having an affair

182
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,530
Hello everyone, i'm Haraguchi

183
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,270
Haraguchi thinks he will be taking revenge for the failed verification

184
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,520
The "It's me" mimic phone call beings

185
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,340
I'm going to call

186
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,040
Here we go, here we go, here we go

187
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,320
Hello?
-It's me

188
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,350
Oh, okay.
-I've changed my number. Save it

189
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,920
I've changed my number again, please.
-OK

190
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,690
This is a new number?

191
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,560
It's a new number. You can save it

192
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,770
Ok
-And...

193
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,200
What do you want for your birthday?

194
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,580
Ah, I'm still thinking about it

195
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:38,930
IMALU, of course, acts as if there is no suspicion

196
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
What are you hesitating about? Tell me

197
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,190
Thinking either a stereo or a vacuum cleaner

198
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,590
Why these two?

199
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,830
Pretending to be father and daughter for five minutes

200
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,490
Great. Very similar

201
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,830
Vacuum cleaner...

202
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,600
Dyson ... buy a Dyson

203
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:07,150
As the other believes the trick has been completed, the counter actually begins

204
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,380
That... sorry

205
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,790
Although it was you who called, this is a bit bad

206
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,720
There's something I want to tell you

207
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,920
What's wrong? I don't have much more free time

208
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,330
That...

209
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:29,130
There is a person, I often talk to this guy

210
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,470
What...what are you talking about?

211
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,080
The relationship with him slowly changed

212
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,980
I started to become attracted to him
-Oh

213
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,720
That...

214
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,620
It's a little hard to say

215
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,800
It's really the same expression that Sanma would have

216
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,660
That person actually already has a family of his own

217
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,590
Oh... oh...

218
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,000
Well...that...

219
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,110
Get off the phone!

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,940
Well to be honest it's an affair, right?

221
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,700
Danger, danger

222
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,010
It's better to hang up, right?

223
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,230
Upon hearing the word "affair", he quickly informs the staff of the emergency situation

224
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:21,740
But the staff didn't give any instructions, so Haraguchi continues the call

225
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,590
Is everything okay?

226
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,890
No, um, it's fine

227
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,160
Nothing at all

228
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,870
That...that...how...how...where...

229
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,270
Ah...

230
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,490
In the end, he couldn't even say anything

231
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,930
It's not right to give advice

232
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:48,230
At this point, IMALU adds another piece of info

233
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,720
Not only has it become an affair, but that person is also a bit strange

234
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,120
He said that if he broke up with him, he would expose it

235
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,290
If he says something bad, it'll affect you too...

236
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,730
You don't want reporters to start sniffing around

237
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,100
So I thought it would be better to talk to you first

238
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,670
I'll do something, don't worry, it is not a problem

239
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,940
But I still have to consider everything

240
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,880
At this point, it becomes impossible to reveal the truth

241
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,880
Can't discuss this!

242
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,950
And so, Haraguchi continues to maintain Sanma's manliness

243
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,560
The smile from a few minutes ago is nowhere to be found

244
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,710
And he's become distraught

245
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,300
Now... now... now is not the time to talk about this

246
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,640
So what should I do?

247
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,010
What should we do? Hang up the phone first, then we can talk about it

248
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,070
You wait first

249
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,040
Ah, I see

250
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,750
Then I'll contact you if there's anything.
-Okay, okay, okay

251
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,010
So, he hangs up the phone forcibly

252
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,010
This can not be broadcast

253
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,920
Is it the end?

254
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,230
Should I have said it? That I wasn't him?

255
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,900
An evil smile

256
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:18,250
As he failed to realize, there's more

257
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,800
So bad

258
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,470
The agent will go and explain what happened

259
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,410
Could you please wait a moment?

260
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,750
No matter what...
-No matter what we have to confess

261
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,750
Absolutely not to broadcast it

262
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,120
I feel like it's over...

263
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,660
Can you hold on a second? I'll make a phone call first

264
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,500
After the staff leaves,

265
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,270
I'm screwed...

266
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,540
Ah…

267
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,160
What's over?

268
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,600
He feels responsible

269
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,750
Yes, he's heard things he shouldn't have heard

270
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,460
IMALU's agent has talked to her

271
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,590
She's a little annoyed

272
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:19,100
She may complain to Yoshimoto and Sanma

273
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:27,070
Yeah... talk to Sanma...

274
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,170
It's a problem

275
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,610
Haraguchi has become super depressed

276
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,620
That's for sure

277
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,950
Normally such a cheerful person

278
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:43,890
I'll take full responsibility for it, and that's how it should be

279
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:52,160
But I still have to consider the worst case scenario...

280
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,070
We're being contacted. Please wait a moment

281
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,690
A big shock!

282
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,270
Damn

283
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,990
Teeth, at the dental office

284
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,490
Holding the teeth
-Incisors

285
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,710
"Are we going to be separated?" He thinks, looking at the dentures in despair

286
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,980
Farewell to the teeth

287
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,480
And so, the truth is revealed

288
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,420
Do it!

289
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,590
Whoa...

290
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,600
Worked it out?

291
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Thanks for your hard work
-Thanks

292
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,400
How do you feel?

293
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,030
Ah wait a minute

294
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,070
Wait a minute!

295
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,140
What does "how does it feel" mean?

296
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:45,780
Haraguchi hadn't understood the situation, so we explained

297
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,860
Haraguchi's counter prank

298
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,870
Relaxed all of a sudden

299
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,920
That's great!

300
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,830
That's great!

301
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,630
Finally tricked you!

302
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,930
Seriously...

303
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,240
I really thought it was over

304
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,200
When did it start to feel like it was all over for you?

305
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,340
Don't remember anymore

306
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,740
But maintaining the imitation until the end...

307
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,580
I wanted to say right away that it was me

308
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,150
I also thought you'd say it

309
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,950
But it becomes harder when you hear things you shouldn't

310
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,460
I really wanted the staff here to carry the burden too

311
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,160
Ah really too frightening, don't do this

312
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,130
You took out the teeth like this

313
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,370
Kept staring at the teeth

314
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,570
I just had it serviced.
-The teeth?

315
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,970
First job just after maintenance

316
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,840
"Oh, it's all over."

317
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,380
I was thinking "I'll never get it serviced again"

318
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,940
His teeth require a lot of care

319
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,720
Can't imitate him for the rest of your life
-I'd never imitate him again

320
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,470
Next on the All Counter-Prank Special is...

321
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:18,480
A person who is angry won't be corrected when using non-existent words

322
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,070
It is also the benefit of Soho, right?

323
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,750
But how? I still hope you can make an effort

324
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,290
In the end, it will not become a graveyard of the earth, no matter what happens in the end

325
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,330
This theory was tested by Morita last time

326
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,980
The next set of people are...

327
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,670
Thank you for having me

328
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,170
He seems the type to do it

329
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,500
Viking's Kotoge

330
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:56,650
He will lecture Darlings' Oda, a junior who he is close with, by using words that do not exist

331
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:05,020
But little does he know, the other will counter with non-existent words

332
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,390
What'll happen?

333
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,060
It's like aerial combat

334
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,170
It begins

335
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,090
Don't laugh!

336
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,060
King of Conte

337
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,470
Have you started yet? Or not?

338
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:20,000
First stage was probably at the end of June

339
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,640
How's it going? Are you ready?
-Well...

340
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,010
No sense of "this is it" yet

341
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,820
So what, it's not going well?
-It's not good. And there's anxiety

342
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,460
But everyone's familiar with your work

343
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,130
What about now?

344
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,760
Everyone thinks "Ah, Darlings are so funny"

345
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,970
Just a little

346
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:54,940
So you have a bit of "naked armor", I think

347
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,160
"Naked Armor"

348
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,380
You're not a frog at the bottom of the well anymore

349
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,910
You definitely have this kind of "naked armor"

350
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,420
But to not have anything prepared at this point is...
-It's true that...

351
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,650
It's not good

352
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,620
It's not like you have an "old woman's killer weapon"

353
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,600
What's that?

354
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,530
No, it's not.

355
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,890
So you have a bit of "naked armor", I think

356
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,200
It's not like you have an "old woman's killer weapon"

357
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:30,570
At the beginning Kotoge uses fancy words

358
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,150
Interesting is important

359
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:37,620
But in addition to interesting, you have to have impact

360
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,390
You have to have a grave-eating joke to do it
-Well, it's true...

361
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,490
Otherwise it's impossible

362
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,230
You have to shake it up like an "apache's earthquake"

363
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,900
Otherwise you can't do it

364
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,530
You'll just stop in the semi-finals

365
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,530
All the way to the semi-finals, semi-finals, semi-finals

366
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,600
But just can't get into the final

367
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,540
That's like a "three-and-a-half gauge struggle"
-Yes

368
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,770
At worst, you have to reach the final

369
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,750
Didn't your parents say anything? About this
-On the parents' side...

370
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,380
Haven't said anything to them for a while

371
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,080
They don't oppose, but originally didn't really support me

372
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,220
Neither for or against

373
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,130
"Hachigaya riot," neither opposed nor supported

374
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,900
Indeed

375
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,930
What about your wife?

376
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,530
She's always supported me

377
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,470
What a good woman.
-Yes, I'm really thankful for her

378
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,810
A "pero"-like woman

379
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:43,080
She's really a "pero"-like woman

380
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:51,950
If this was a real verification, Kotoge's weird words would surely arouse suspicion

381
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,090
At this point, the counter prank begins

382
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,450
Oda also begins responding with non-existent words, what will happen?

383
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,370
How do I put it? It feels like your style

384
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,510
It's "traditional Mexican", you know?

385
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,630
Talking shit

386
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,580
Speaking of which,

387
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,750
The skits, there aren't many highlights, more down than up

388
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:25,460
Now it's become a case of "not taking the lid off the pot", I'm kind of feeling that
-Yeah, yeah, yeah

389
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,390
When we were on "Golden Sma" before

390
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,440
We had good conversation with Nakai, right?
-That's right

391
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,960
We chatted back and forth

392
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,310
There weren't any obvious laughs, right?

393
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:41,510
I felt I was a bit lax

394
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,710
It was a bit tingly too.
-We can't give up though

395
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,480
It's a rung on the ladder, right? A step up

396
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,250
Now it's become a case of "not taking the lid off the pot", I'm kind of feeling that

397
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,880
It was a bit tingly too

398
00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:01,890
Darlings Oda's two counterattacks slip by unnoticed

399
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,530
In my own words...

400
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,870
Because i'm rarely called, so no matter what the program is

401
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:14,870
We went with the mood of "three years of killing ghosts", and if we had any chance, we'd go

402
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,440
This sentence is also ignored

403
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,260
"Three Years of Killing Ghosts"

404
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,820
But,

405
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,950
Because i've been around you all this time, I also feel...

406
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,190
That awareness is not enough
-Well, awareness isn't enough

407
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:36,560
I also want to be able to "nail the heart" to move forward
-Yeah, yeah

408
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,800
Is it about to be exposed?

409
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:42,000
It would be nice to be more "commitnation"
-Hmm...

410
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:50,540
I won't be able to deal with myself if I become a "jackson sermon"
-Well...yeah...

411
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,260
"Jackson sermon"?

412
00:23:51,150 --> 00:24:01,450
With three consecutive rounds of strange words, Kotoge seems to be suspicious

413
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,890
But this state is basically...

414
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,130
"Technocut syndrome"
-Indeed.

415
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,830
Indeed it's exactly the same

416
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,430
When I returned home and reflected, I also felt

417
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,870
It's just "technocut syndrome"
-Yeah...

418
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,240
Copied for use

419
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:22,040
I also think it's "American bike syndrome"
-Well...

420
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,880
As the saying goes, "mackerel are the same when fried"
-They are indeed the same

421
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,170
Frantically thinking

422
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,820
It's like "sucking on a ribeye"
-Yeah, it is

423
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,160
Frantically thinking

424
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:37,620
It's like "sucking on a ribeye", and it's like "eating a ribeye"

425
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:43,590
It's a "bone marrow bath", right?
-Yes, it is

426
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,620
Bone talk

427
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,360
Kotoge's words today are really very

428
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,920
Not even making eye contact anymore

429
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,130
"Cranial nail"

430
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,270
It's like "skinning a hot girl"
-Yes

431
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,740
The theme has changed

432
00:24:52,270 --> 00:25:00,760
As they both exchange non-existent words, Kotoge has obviously come to a realization

433
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,850
This is a good thing

434
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:06,750
I'd like to "steal a stone like I did at the fire station and hold on to it"

435
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,800
It's become a game of who laughs loses

436
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,790
"Dumpling Festival" is working!
-Yes, it is

437
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,080
Thinking about what to say now

438
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,820
It feels like if that's all

439
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,440
Just making up words and saying them

440
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:21,500
Then, as a man, "I'm turning into a jellyfish"
-Hmmmmmmmm

441
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,700
It is true that there will also be a zombie escape

442
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,210
I agree

443
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,510
There will be times when "you can't see your back when you look in the mirror"

444
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:35,010
It's so nice to talk to you in such a heartfelt way
-Yes, thank you very much

445
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,480
Really a surprisingly constructive day
-Agreed

446
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,620
It's no longer working

447
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,200
Already obvious

448
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,530
What was that, seriously

449
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,490
What the hell

450
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,660
So painful

451
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,800
How do you feel?
-How do I feel...

452
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,200
I really did not realize with the first few words this guy said

453
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,910
But halfway through I suddenly thought "huh!?"

454
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:07,310
When there was a few a row, I thought, "Ah, this...must be it"

455
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,720
But I can only keep attacking, as can he

456
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,450
What could I do to end this?

457
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,520
No, it was really terrible. It was really terrifying

458
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,020
Terrifying?
-Terrifying

459
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,030
Next on the All Counter-Prank Special is...

460
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,510
Tough work

461
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:31,100
It's impossible to avoid being thrown by a sound engineer

462
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,500
Kasuga, please come over here for a moment

463
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,530
How can this be countered?

464
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,840
A fighter with judo experience pretending to be a sound engineer

465
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,780
Sorry, I'll adjust it a little

466
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,780
Can you lower your head a bit?

467
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,920
What?

468
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,280
This theory was thus exhibited

469
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,200
After that, the inescapable theory was repeated

470
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:09,410
The move was verified in different settings

471
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,900
This time at a social dance, the target's inner thighs will be attacked

472
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:22,460
However, the opponent will instead receive a counterattack

473
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,600
And this time the object of the counter prank is

474
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,390
Thank you for having me

475
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,180
A week before this shoot, she won the Rizin championship belt

476
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:39,220
And was a top three finisher in the national judo collegiate tournament in high school

477
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,140
Female Mixed Martial Artist Izawa Seika

478
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,640
It's not long been long since the match ended

479
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,810
But my body was recovered well

480
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,150
And my stomach's not bulging today

481
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,650
So i'm lucky

482
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:57,250
To challenge the reigning queen is...

483
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,650
Hello everyone

484
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,870
This guy practiced judo

485
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,740
Jungle Pocket's Ota, who was the judo champion of Aichi Prefecture in high school

486
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,330
No matter how I think about it, I think i'm in a good position

487
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,470
I'll be on the alert that it's coming, right?

488
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,800
I will throw even the current champion

489
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,470
This is almost like a match, right?

490
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:25,560
Afterwards, we rehearsed carefully to confirm the angle of attack, the timing of the attack, etc

491
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:34,730
Rizin Queen Izawa vs. Ota, the counter prank is about to begin

492
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:38,300
Golden Sma's Social Dance Department

493
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,500
So, he pretends to be a new dance partner for Golden Sma's social dance project

494
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,260
The two first practice the dance steps seriously

495
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,910
Finally, the official start of the counter prank, what will be the result?

496
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,420
So here we go, please

497
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,840
1 2 3

498
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,960
2 2 3

499
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,880
3 2 3

500
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,220
Will it work?

501
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,080
4 2 3

502
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,280
5 2...

503
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,340
Can't do it!

504
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,820
Locked firmly

505
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,670
It didn't go as promised

506
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,170
The result is completely different

507
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,030
Dangerous!

508
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,820
It's not at all what I thought it would be

509
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,720
Damn it!

510
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,820
Scared the hell out of me

511
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,320
Damn

512
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,620
Are you okay?

513
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,150
Worthy of being Rizin's current champion

514
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:49,500
Although the inside of the thighs were opened, she immediately put her foot in front of Ota to prevent him from throwing

515
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,390
Ota struggled

516
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:56,880
Then, when attacked by Otazato, she fought with beautiful body balance

517
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,800
Wonderful

518
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,150
Finally, a flying guillotine

519
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,890
Flying guillotine

520
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:08,780
Another roll and Ota was locked up perfectly to end the match

521
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,400
What is this theory again?

522
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,420
Gave up

523
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,780
Why'd you give up!?

524
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
Awesome

525
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,530
So interesting... awesome!

526
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,640
Winner

527
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,100
Eh?

528
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,930
You ok?

529
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,600
So strong

530
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,810
Sure enough

531
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:34,080
Even if you don't know anything, you can still do the guillotine

532
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,710
You ok?

533
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,410
No, no, no. How can I be okay?

534
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,100
He's gone crazy

535
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,120
Seriously, like the old TVs

536
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,620
My eyes are flashing when I look at things

537
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,770
At this time, Izawa explained the real plan to the target

538
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,530
I was supposed to counter your attack by going for your inner thigh

539
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,300
Inner thighs...that's why you resisted so hard!

540
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,200
Seriously, people who don't know anything shouldn't start a war like that, right?

541
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,240
However do you remember? A few minutes ago

542
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,410
It must be a subconscious reaction

543
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,080
You came and locked my neck

544
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,880
Great
So awesome!

545
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,200
These three counter pranks all became impressive duels

546
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,920
Three good plans!
-Impressive duels!

547
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,460
Kobayashi, what did you think?

548
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,270
The one with Kotoge
-The angry one

549
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,950
Oda's words are quite, how to say,

550
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,370
For example, "I can't see my back when I look in the mirror" and so on

551
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,630
They're all pretty much the same thing. I can understand their meaning at all

552
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,590
It's quite impressive.
-Kinda touching

553
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:42,490
It is true that when you look in the mirror you can not see your back

554
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,430
And Haraguchi was very professional from start to finish.
-Very good

555
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,890
※Yamaguchi Momoe placed her microphone on the stage at the end of the concert to signal her retirement.

556
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,880
Took his teeth and put them down like the microphone of Momiji

557
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,590
Moving on
-Retreated

558
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,480
That part was quite tough, I wanted to cry

559
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,630
After all, staff are important but you can't hurt family members either

560
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,470
He showed Sanma's manliness

561
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:08,680
In the middle, he clearly said "I will protect"

562
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,650
How are you going to protect?

563
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:16,580
If the confession was actually to Sanma it might go a different way

564
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,820
Possibly so

565
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,690
I think that's how he removes his teeth, too.
-Why?

566
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,570
His teeth can't be freshly maintained, right?

567
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,460
Next on the All Counter-Prank Special is...

568
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:37,270
Can you eat a lot of food when you are on a serious phone call to discuss something

569
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,710
This, this

570
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,200
Last time

571
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,900
My wife doesn't want me to go home

572
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,810
Please let me stay at your house for a few days

573
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,680
It's not impossible...
-Is it possible?

574
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,600
Nadal made a phone call to his senior Fujimoto while eating throughout

575
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,520
What are you doing?

576
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,850
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are you doing now?
-I'm not doing anything. I'm not doing anything. What's wrong?

577
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,190
No. What is that clicking sound?

578
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,600
This guy is so stupid

579
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,010
Exposed in a flash

580
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,210
This will definitely be exposed

581
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:12,540
So this time, Nadal will again make a phone call to Fujimoto

582
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:18,160
But in fact, Fujimoto will be on the other side of the phone also eating a lot of food

583
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,640
Please finish everything here during the call

584
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,610
Wait...eh?

585
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,940
Simply eating and talking at the same time

586
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,050
A little too much, isn't it?

587
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,060
Is this another counter prank?

588
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,450
No, no, no, no, no. Wait a minute

589
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:32,990
The rule on Nadal's side is he also has to finish everything

590
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,260
So finish it before he does

591
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,160
Finish first, before Nadal

592
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:48,670
Will Fujimoto be exposed faster than Nadal can eat all the food above?

593
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,740
Hello everyone

594
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:56,080
Nadal, who knew nothing, finished preparing in another studio

595
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,210
What if I succeed?

596
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,120
Do you have any requests?

597
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,350
I think success should lead to a little something

598
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,590
This is him asking for money

599
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,690
The motivation to work well... is completely different

600
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,460
I want...

601
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,300
We have prepared a bonus
-How much? How much?

602
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,370
50,000 yen
-Yeah!

603
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,270
50,000, yes!

604
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,270
A bonus is at stake

605
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,140
I will do my best to avenge my disgrace

606
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,840
It's mostly about money, right?

607
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,480
Wow so boring

608
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,010
So annoyed by this

609
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:33,590
Fujimoto is able to observe Nadal throughout

610
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,150
So, the two-way telephone feast begins

611
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,730
Will this work?

612
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,590
Hello

613
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,620
Thanks for your hard work, Fujimoto
-Hey, what's up?

614
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,860
It's Nadal. Sorry
-Yes

615
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,580
The tone of voice is so angry

616
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,030
What is it?

617
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:54,300
Fujimoto takes the tuna and onion sushi just like Nadal, and then

618
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,310
Fujimoto can see the other side

619
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,480
I'm gonna go to Bunshun (newspaper)
-Eh?

620
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,350
What what What's up? Were you caught doing something?

621
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,240
Matching the timing of each other's eating

622
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,080
A strategy to make the other side not know whether the chewing sounds are their own or not

623
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,860
In the theater

624
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,870
Fujimoto has the advantage

625
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,830
Yes, can see the other

626
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:21,300
Well, I cheated on my wife

627
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,430
What did you do?

628
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,770
With whom?

629
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,570
Who?

630
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,850
Mikitty

631
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,410
Seriously?

632
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,750
What a load of nonsense!

633
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:45,450
Fujimoto almost laughs at loud at the unexpected cheater

634
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,440
Seriously?

635
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,620
But

636
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,290
Recently

637
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,230
They're not even talking

638
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:05,420
After 20 minutes, Fujimoto takes the lead

639
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,280
The food is also out of sync

640
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,550
Tell me what you think

641
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,090
I want to apologize to Shoji... and to my wife

642
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,560
What the hell?

643
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:25,750
Both sides use the strategy of eating whilst the other talks

644
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,330
I'm sad, really

645
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,370
Really sad

646
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,660
Answered with the sound of chewing

647
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,810
I'm really sorry

648
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,710
It's sad

649
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,370
This man is stupid, right?

650
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,870
And then

651
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,120
What should I do?
-Hey, it's really sad

652
00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:00,680
Both sides are waiting for the other to speak and freeze together

653
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,260
But just at that moment

654
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,080
How come you don't listen to people at all?

655
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,730
Nishino just cheated
-I'm the one who wants to cry. Don't talk about Nishino

656
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,030
Eating?

657
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,600
Eating?

658
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,650
Silent protest

659
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,470
Eating

660
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:41,310
Nadal sensed that Fujimoto was also eating

661
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,970
I just said it, didn't I?

662
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,650
Completely exposed!

663
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,100
The performance is too bad

664
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:57,630
However, it appears he doesn't suspect a counter prank

665
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,690
As Fujimoto realizes

666
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,840
He takes advantage of the opportunity to sprint ahead

667
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,570
He can really eat

668
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,990
It's hard to eat so much

669
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,880
Sorry

670
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,380
Are you listening to me?

671
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,350
Listening

672
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,710
You're not even listening

673
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,050
Crying crying crying

674
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,150
Wait a minute. You're being weird

675
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,660
So, one hour after the start

676
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,420
Fujimoto is so powerful

677
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,900
Hey

678
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,370
Simply eating

679
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,030
Hey

680
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,240
Hey

681
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:55,250
No matter how loud the food is, the other party does not mention it at all

682
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,220
Nadal also accelerates

683
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:10,040
It has completely turned into a big appetite competition with one hand being an inconvenience

684
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,750
Ah, that's bad

685
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,350
That hurts

686
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,180
Nadal you can not do this, call someone else

687
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,780
What is this horror movie

688
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,030
The winner of this competition is

689
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:35,970
Finished

690
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,590
Fujimoto wins
-Good...

691
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,340
Impressive

692
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,570
I'm happy, but it was a tough win

693
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:53,440
So the truth was revealed

694
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,240
I really don't understand

695
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,040
I won

696
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,450
WIN

697
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,420
Confused

698
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,120
Okay, okay, don't do that

699
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,190
No one remembers your curry rice ad

700
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,730
It's a counter prank

701
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,100
Counter prank?
-Yes

702
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,360
Did you eat it too?
-Yes

703
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,230
Eating the whole time

704
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,870
Always... eh?

705
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:27,170
Why didn't you say anything?

706
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,740
No, I thought it's okay for my senpai to help me while he eats

707
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,490
It's not good for a 51-year-old person to eat this amount you know

708
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,780
Was it the same amount?
-The same

709
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,380
It's so pathetic.
-What's "pathetic"?

710
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,950
You don't feel shame at all, do you?

711
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,160
It took a long time to realize

712
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,650
But in the end it became an eating contest.
-Yeah

713
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,290
Those that watch it will surely feel sick

714
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,960
Even though its just two people on the phone eating a lot

715
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,400
Next on the All Counter-Prank Special is...

716
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:07,240
As long as your appear polite, you can say anything and get away with it

717
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:15,540
So far, Kasuga has challenged a variety of greetings, starting with "Thank you for your hard work"

718
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:21,060
Its success rate was a staggering 89 percent

719
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,090
Hello

720
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,890
Thank you so much for your help earlier.
-It's okay

721
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,400
Yonagashima is the southernmost island of Kagoshima
-Yeah

722
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,830
Yonagashima is the southernmost island of Kagoshima
-Yeah

723
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,390
It's Hamada that has the problem, right?

724
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,160
And so

725
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,570
Hello
-Thanks for coming

726
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,670
Thank you

727
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,040
Bye (please)

728
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,280
The theory that will be challenged is...

729
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,580
You can replace anything with "good morning"

730
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,130
"Good morning?"

731
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,240
So the first sentence is

732
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,880
"I'm going to take a shower"

733
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,700
"I'm going to take a shower?"

734
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,120
This is the first sentence?
-This is the first sentence

735
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,700
Level 1 is already high

736
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:06,020
And the target of this challenge is

737
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,900
A bit scary

738
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,410
Kimura Yuichi

739
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:18,020
This time, Kasuga will greet with "I'm going to take a shower!"

740
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:26,460
However, Kimura will by asking about what he said, and thus countering it

741
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,860
This can't fail, it's only level 1

742
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,860
Yeah, let's go

743
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,070
How will it turn out?

744
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,700
Excuse me

745
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,210
I'm going to take a shower. Please take care of me.
-Why?

746
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,640
Please take care of me today
-Why? Why? Why?

747
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,780
Ah, today...that show together...
-Hey, is it always like this?

748
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,410
Eh?

749
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,880
What floor is it on?

750
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,720
How many floors?
-Didn't you just say

751
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,150
You said, "I'm going to take a shower."

752
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,190
No, no, no...
-Said it

753
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,060
No, no, that... Good morning

754
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,590
No, you said "I'm going to take a shower", right?

755
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:07,030
No, no...
-I was wondering why you were taking a shower now

756
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,770
Well, that... recording the show together...
-You said, "I'm going to take a shower."

757
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:11,770
No, I said "good morning"

758
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,870
No...you said "I'm going to take a shower"

759
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,940
No, good morning...good morning.
-Then say it again, like you just did

760
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:23,450
"I'm going to take a shower."
-See, "I'm going to take a shower."

761
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,210
No, good morning...I said good morning

762
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,820
Stuttered?

763
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,020
Well, it was...right...yeah

764
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,820
You're not going to take a shower, are you?

765
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:34,660
I'm not going to take a shower.
-I was surprised when you suddenly said, "I'm going to take a shower."

766
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,600
Yeah? Go take a shower. Take a shower

767
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,130
Eh?

768
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,130
Hey...shower...hey...
-Sorry, sorry

769
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,770
How does this feel?
-Huh?

770
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:51,010
Failed? Failed?

771
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:58,250
As Kasuga didn't realize it was a counter prank, we explained the plan

772
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,180
Thought it had failed

773
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,350
That was scary.
-Is it scary?

774
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,690
Yeah, it' was really scary.
-You're scared because you were exposed?

775
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,660
Because I was exposed and also suddenly asked "why?"

776
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,690
It's the "why" question about something...
-That's it!

777
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:14,100
It is very rude to say hello like this as a junior

778
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,630
That's why he asked "why"...

779
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,170
But you don't usually ask "why" in return, right?

780
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,170
Then followed by

781
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:23,370
I was also asked, "What floor is it on? The bathing place"

782
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:27,610
Only at that point did I realize "i've been caught!"

783
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,150
I asked you if you were stuttering, and you said, "Yes, I was stuttering."

784
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,550
Too cunning, right?
-It's so embarrassing...

785
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,190
I see

786
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:44,830
Nadal and Fujimoto's matchup, both sides knew the other was eating, right?
-Yes

787
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:49,000
Sometimes the two sides only use chewing sounds to communicate, grunt grunt, that kind of thing

788
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,340
It would have been nice if someone had made it clear first

789
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,010
Yes, if Nadal had said, "What are you eating?

790
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:58,110
Then Fujimoto would be disqualified

791
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,220
But after all, you're calling, and the other party just happens to be eating

792
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,140
I think it's okay for seniors to eat and talk on the phone at the same time

793
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,480
But no matter what, this type of thing would only go one way, right?

794
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,150
Is it true that Nadal and Mikitty had an affair?

795
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,190
How would it be possible

796
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,710
If it's true, we'll all have to bear the cross together

797
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,970
We all know

798
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,980
So what does everyone think?

799
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,830
It's like a stalemate

800
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:30,350
However, the supposed instigator can't bring everything to a halt

801
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,900
Yes
-They can't give up halfway

802
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,650
In the end, it can only become a stalemate

803
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:42,860
Instead of counter prank special, it's more of a no defense sparring special

804
00:45:42,860 --> 00:46:14,850
