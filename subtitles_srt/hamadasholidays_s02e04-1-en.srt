1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,300
Hamada and his juniors have arrived
in Pattaya, Thailand.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,760
Let's go.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,600
They check out Hamada's suite.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,360
Let's have a look.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,300
What a view.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,830
-This is amazing.
-It's beautiful.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,760
I'm not from here, but welcome to Pattaya.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,400
Thank you, Pattaya!

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,260
Look at this bath.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,460
There's no privacy.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,630
This is awesome.

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,600
It's...wait, what's he doing?

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,560
Who's in the bath?

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,700
Nobody's used it yet.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Seriously?

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,930
Who...? Oh, it's him.

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,420
Hey! What are you doing?

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,200
It's great. I was sweaty.

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,260
Don't get my towels wet. They're unused.

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,280
The bath towels?

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,300
Don't get them wet, I said.

22
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,200
Turn off the shower.

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,330
Don't take a dump!

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,280
You're butt naked!

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,050
He'll be mad.

26
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,280
This is comfortable.

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,880
What are you doing?

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,760
You're dead.

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,860
It's comfortable.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
Drain that filthy water...

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,230
What on earth are you doing?

32
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,830
Is he for real?

33
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,250
You've gone too far.

34
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,120
The bathroom's soaked.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,830
It's like a sinking ship.

36
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,660
They were still gaining their footing.

37
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:07,200
Six young comedians
gave presentations on Pattaya to Hamada.

38
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,430
They really tried this time.

39
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,230
In past seasons, they were really sloppy.

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,430
They relied too much on the staff.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,260
This time, they took more responsibility.
I'm relieved.

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,180
I'm seeing their individual strengths.

43
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,900
They're now at the starting line.

44
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,830
The past seasons were dry runs.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's see who came in fourth place
for their presentation.

46
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,650
Fourth place, for 200 bahts, goes to...

47
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,600
Seshita!

48
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,730
He did a great job.

49
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,180
Thank you.

50
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,250
He actually fought for it.

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,130
That was incredible.

52
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,860
I'm really happy.

53
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,900
I didn't think you'd actually fight.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Neither did I.

55
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,430
I thought we'd just observe.

56
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,920
Was three minutes long?

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,600
It was. I couldn't believe it.

58
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,600
Let's see Seshita's presentation.

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,800
It's Seshita's turn.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,500
Isn't it hot?

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,480
It is.

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,260
So let's go somewhere indoors.

63
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,830
Sounds good.

64
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,100
It's a mall called
"Central Festival Pattaya Beach."

65
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,600
It's the biggest mall in Pattaya.

66
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,700
A shopping mall?

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,200
-We don't really have time to buy souvenirs.
-True.

68
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,130
And I know that you have family,

69
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,220
so you can get them gifts there.

70
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,800
-It's the biggest mall?
-Absolutely.

71
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,120
But shopping malls are common.

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,700
Plu's, it's close to our hotel.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,400
Then whoever wants to can go after we wrap up.

74
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,020
But we'll hang out in your room then.

75
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,940
Why?

76
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,100
We need to keep that time.

77
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,480
There's a fruit market nearby.

78
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,980
Sounds great.

79
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,200
We can try tropical fruits and fruit juices...

80
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,300
...that we can only get in Thailand.

81
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,230
When we tried tapioca juice,

82
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,800
we were all so happy, right?

83
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,430
Here's the video.

84
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,330
Stick to your presentation.

85
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,980
Everyone was so happy then.

86
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,000
You're presenters, not editors.

87
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,020
It's just that it was so fun last time.

88
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,530
He's a real pro.

89
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,560
Anyway, there's juice.

90
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,740
And fruits?

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,750
And there's another thing near there.

92
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,200
When you think of Thailand, you think of Muay Thai.

93
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,330
It's a must-see.

94
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,950
This is Thailand, after all.

95
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,800
-The K-1 fighter, Takeru...
-Yes.

96
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,420
He went to that gym to train during high school...

97
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,960
...and became the K-1 fighter he is today.

98
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,450
I see. What can we see there?

99
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:49,300
-We can watch professional boxers train.
-I see.

100
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,960
They're there, and we can also train with them.

101
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,150
You can try Muay Thai.

102
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,500
-No way.
-It's too dangerous.

103
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,200
You've never done a Muay Thai kick, right?

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,580
I don't want to, but I do want to observe.

105
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,660
You can experience Muay Thai
at this gym, so how about it?

106
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,050
I'd be interested in observing.

107
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,260
-Not fighting?
-Exactly, I won't fight.

108
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:28,730
Then do you want to see me,
a former street punk, fight?

109
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,150
Seshita, don't be reckless.

110
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't talk crazy.

111
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,530
I really want you to come.

112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,320
-Look at his eyes.
-He's dead serious.

113
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,430
I might even win.

114
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,960
-You?
-Yes.

115
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,900
You're so confident.

116
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,950
That's unlikely.

117
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,430
Street fighters always win.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You work out, but...

119
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,730
I've been training extensively at a fitness gym.

120
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,580
I guess it would be interesting to see Muay Thai.

121
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,860
Yes, to see it live.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,930
It's all nearby, so let's go.

123
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,360
The gym and the fruit market?

124
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,340
Let's go.

125
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,160
Fine then.

126
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,350
-You'll go?
-Yeah.

127
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,150
-Let's go.
-OK.

128
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,200
Let's go.

129
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,360
Seriously, Muay Thai?

130
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,280
We can see it live.

131
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,760
Sure, but why must Seshita fight?

132
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,100
-You'll win?
-Damn right.

133
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:41,160
And so the group heads out
for Muay Thai and the fruit market.

134
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,130
They go first to the gym.

135
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,540
This way.

136
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,030
-It's this way.
-Camera's over there!

137
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,930
Sorry. That's a great punch.

138
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,780
-You're warming up.
-I'm not.

139
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,700
This way.

140
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,330
What is this?

141
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,800
It doesn't seem like a gym, does it?

142
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,880
It's like a hotel.

143
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,800
It is a hotel.

144
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,520
It's a hotel?

145
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,140
-The gym is over this way.
-Next to a hotel?

146
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,460
This is one of the reasons why
it's popular among foreign kick boxers.

147
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,500
They stay here and train here.

148
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,150
There's a gym. It's really a hotel.

149
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,260
Yes, there's a normal gym, too.

150
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,360
This is really the place for sports.

151
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,130
Just past it is our destination.

152
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,450
Wow.

153
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,830
It's so clean.

154
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,860
Look at the sandbags.

155
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,260
-Look.
-It's huge.

156
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,000
There are so many boxing rings in here.

157
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,050
Look at those fighters.

158
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,300
They're training. See?

159
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,030
Wow.

160
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,660
That's Muay Thai?

161
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,530
Look at them go.

162
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,000
-Wow, he got it right in the jaw.
-Is he alright?

163
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,100
Hello. Excuse me.

164
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,270
Sorry.

165
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,350
-Hello.
-Hello.

166
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,350
Tell us your names.

167
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,660
I'm Semapet.

168
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,700
I'm Chawalit.

169
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,530
What titles do you have?

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,230
I'm a Channel 7 Champion.

171
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,530
Champion?

172
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,000
Champion? Wow.

173
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,850
I'm the champion of Pathum Thani Province.

174
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,880
The provincial champion.

175
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,800
Can you train with the sandbags?

176
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,760
They'll kick and punch?

177
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,030
This is incredible.

178
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,100
They're preparing.

179
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,360
We get to see all of this.

180
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,760
His shorts are really high.

181
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,460
It doesn't matter.

182
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,200
Stop, sir. Let's go back to your room.

183
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,630
-Sir...
-I'm not senile.

184
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,830
Sorry. He's kidding.

185
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,660
There are so many types.

186
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,080
How do you use them?

187
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,460
You kick down here, I guess.

188
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,860
That's the head, or not?

189
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,140
Really?

190
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,060
They kick there, too.

191
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,880
It's really heavy.

192
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,000
It's heavy.

193
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,030
This is incredible.

194
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,880
There's a ring for cage fighting.

195
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,350
-That one?
-Yes.

196
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,730
-This gym is huge.
-It is.

197
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,600
I wonder if it's ever full.

198
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,430
There must be many boxers.

199
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,360
Apparently, it becomes packed at times.

200
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,850
On TV, you see gyms in dirty garages.

201
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,330
This is really clean.

202
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,930
Look at him.

203
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,700
Wow.

204
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,360
It's amazing.

205
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,900
Wow.

206
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,760
What do you think?

207
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,830
Can they use their elbows?

208
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,100
Yes you can and even grab the opponent.

209
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,500
-You can?
-Yes.

210
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,830
Wow.

211
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,000
Thank you!

212
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,080
They're amazing.

213
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,400
Isn't it intense?

214
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,860
Yes, watching them up close like this.

215
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,930
This sandbag is heavy,
but they kick it like it's nothing.

216
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,560
-That was amazing.
-He's a champ, yeah.

217
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,250
Let's see them spar a little.

218
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,400
Really?

219
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,960
Please start.

220
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,700
That looks painful.

221
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,020
He keeps going for the head.

222
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,600
The red one.

223
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,330
Did you see that grab?

224
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,700
-That's allowed?
-Yes, in Muay Thai.

225
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,300
He goes for the head.

226
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,800
Watch out!

227
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,330
Don't kick in the head!

228
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,320
He's supposed to.

229
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,160
Are you his coach?

230
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,300
He's telling him not to kick.

231
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,420
A body blow.

232
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,900
Ouch.

233
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,200
He grabs him!

234
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,530
That's karate.

235
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,940
Thank you.

236
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,500
Incredible.

237
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,460
That was incredible.

238
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,560
That was really intense.

239
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,760
Amazing.

240
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,260
Shall we go?

241
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,600
-Incredible.
-What?

242
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,400
Aren't you forgetting something?

243
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,630
-He is.
-That's not what you presented.

244
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,100
You want me to fight?

245
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,880
You said that you would.

246
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,030
That's why we came.

247
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,430
It's a let-down.

248
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,250
Ask him to fight with Seshita.

249
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,720
Would you spar with him?

250
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,500
-Sure.
-He agreed.

251
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
That's settled, then.

252
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,360
That was quick.

253
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Please tell him Seshita is saying,
"I'll kill you."

254
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,260
Wait...

255
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,130
OK.

256
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,050
Come on.

257
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,800
What was your nickname again?

258
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,330
My old nickname? The Red Devil of the South.

259
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,400
How lame!

260
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,850
Go on, Red Devil. Tell them who you are.

261
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,330
Hey! You may be Muay Thai boxers, but...

262
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,100
What are you doing?

263
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,450
Quit doing that or...

264
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,030
What did you say?

265
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,230
Look.

266
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,900
Go do that.

267
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,330
Go, Seshita! Put that down and go.

268
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,260
Let's go.

269
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,220
-Come on!
-Let's go, Seshita.

270
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,530
You can win, Seshita.

271
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,560
That's a punch? Give me...

272
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,730
Time out! Time out!

273
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,400
He's hilarious.

274
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,000
How is it, Seshita?

275
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,460
A piece of cake.

276
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,150
-Liar!
-You were on the floor.

277
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,060
He can also try receiving kicks.

278
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,650
Yes, to see how strong it is.

279
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,400
It's worth trying.

280
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,160
Kick, kick.

281
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,180
Let's go!

282
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,830
He can aim for the chin, too.

283
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,500
Be serious.

284
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,130
Where? Like this?

285
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,900
Impressive!

286
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,920
How's his kick?

287
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,200
It's impressive!

288
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,030
I'll keep my guard up.

289
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,860
Ouch! That hurt!

290
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,630
Ouch!

291
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,900
He's strong!

292
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,100
-How is it?
-A piece of cake.

293
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,450
-I'll win for sure.
-Really?

294
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,800
I used to be a delinquent.

295
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,960
Go, Red Devil!

296
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,300
Now for Seshita versus
the Muay Thai Champion.

297
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,480
Fight hard for one round, three minutes.

298
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,880
Stare him down!

299
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,750
A Japanese glare!

300
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,350
Here he goes!

301
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,630
He's intimidated!

302
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,360
You can do it!

303
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,620
Go, Seshita!

304
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,960
One round. Ready, go!

305
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Get in a kick!

306
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,960
Kick him!

307
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,400
Good one!

308
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,160
Keep your eyes open.

309
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,320
Come on.

310
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,160
Punch him.

311
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,460
Go! Go!

312
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,780
He's losing stamina.

313
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,260
He grabbed him!

314
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
What's that?

315
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,630
What move is that?

316
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,200
One minute.

317
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,230
Two minutes left!

318
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
You can do it!

319
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Seshita!

320
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,960
Seshita, Seshita, Seshita!

321
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,860
That was a clean hit.

322
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,600
Come on!

323
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,760
You can do it, Seshita!

324
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,200
Come on, you can do it!

325
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,030
He got a knee kick.

326
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,260
Seshita, come on!

327
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,800
Are you giving up?

328
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,550
No!

329
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,700
Then fight!

330
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,100
Go!

331
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,460
Seshita!

332
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,680
Oh no!

333
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,230
Technical Knockout!

334
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,330
That was amazing.

335
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,650
Champion! Champion!

336
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,280
It's over.

337
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,350
Good job.

338
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,100
Shake hands.

339
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,900
Let's end with a handshake.

340
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,100
He's down!

341
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,860
He got a low kick.

342
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,630
He's done.

343
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,800
End of Match!

344
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,660
Great job!

345
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,960
Thank you!

346
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,050
-It looks like a toy.
-You fought hard. You should be proud.

347
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,430
It's a training belt, not a winner's belt.

348
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,080
He's so strong.

349
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,530
You did well.

350
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,060
-I lost.
-Please thank them.

351
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,730
Thank you.

352
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,940
Thank you.

353
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,700
That was great.

354
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,560
Thank you.

355
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,640
Good game.

356
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,480
What's wrong with your leg?

357
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,050
You're limping.

358
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,380
I'm impervious to pain.

359
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,200
-Really?
-Absolutely.

360
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,930
Good job!

361
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,360
Muay Thai's interesting!

362
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,700
I hope our viewers visit too.

363
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,200
That's it for my presentation.

364
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,250
It was good.

365
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,020
Yes, it was excellent.

366
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,820
Great job, Seshita.

367
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Thank you.

368
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,360
Wait, what about the fruit market?

369
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,230
After the Muay Thai gym,

370
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,360
you skipped the fruit market.

371
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,280
Oh yeah, he did.

372
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,920
"That's it for my presentation."

373
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,400
-That's right.
-We didn't go.

374
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,750
I didn't think I could add any more value.

375
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,050
-That's your decision.
-Yes.

376
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,900
Someone is about to get
a scolding from Hamada.

377
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,350
-Shame on you!
-Huh?

378
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,600
-Here we go.
-What? Me?

379
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,630
You fought with a martial arts fighter for years.

380
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You should have volunteered to fight
after Seshita.

381
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,000
Honestly, when I saw that cage,

382
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,200
I thought I'd have to fight.

383
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,400
Then, when Seshita started sparring,

384
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:16,600
I was relieved it wasn't me.

385
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,420
I had two choices: asking to fight...

386
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,320
...or avoiding getting hurt this time.

387
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,820
I was torn.

388
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
And you chose...?

389
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,530
Staying safe.

390
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,750
Shame on you.

391
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,750
I stayed silent, and tried to be invisible.

392
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,450
That's true, he was quiet.

393
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,100
All of a sudden, yeah.

394
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,950
-It was your chance.
-We were already there.

395
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,860
The staff prepared gears for you.

396
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,260
I have a lot to learn.

397
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,460
You should remember that.

398
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,360
Of course. You're right.

399
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,030
They had lunch at Krua Nha Bann,
a restaurant famous among foodies.

400
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,600
He has one.

401
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,260
Let's start eating.

402
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,430
This dish is on the house.

403
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,560
Really?

404
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,270
Thank you.

405
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Try it. We have one here.

406
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,430
Their specialty, full of green chili,

407
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,630
is a Thai dish called Gapao.

408
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,320
The spiciness can be adjusted,

409
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,400
but since they're there,
the group is given the spiciest version.

410
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,700
Hey, that's too much.

411
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,230
Let's dig in.

412
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,600
It's spicy!

413
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
What's wrong?

414
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,860
Oh crap.

415
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,260
I'm sweating.

416
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,230
What's that?

417
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,460
Milk.

418
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,900
Seshita... give me some!

419
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,530
What's with you?

420
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,000
Give me some! It's spicy!

421
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,780
Be nice.

422
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,550
We need more.

423
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,600
One more milk!

424
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,820
Taiki, try some.

425
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,150
-It sneaks up on you.
-Yeah.

426
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,020
Taiki.

427
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,380
No thanks, I know it's spicy.

428
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,200
You have to eat it.

429
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,600
You don't want any rice?

430
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,560
It's spicy! It's spicy!

431
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,760
It's spicy... give me some!

432
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,900
I said it's spicy! Give me some milk!

433
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,260
It's that spicy?

434
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,430
Wow.

435
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,030
-Seriously?
-Inomoto, try some.

436
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,100
No.

437
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,600
-No?
-No.

438
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,580
Make him!

439
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,600
Really?

440
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,800
He has to try this.

441
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,050
-Why me?
-Hold him.

442
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,200
What do you think you're doing?

443
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,500
Are you serious?

444
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,500
Oops.

445
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,900
Maybe you should try some too, Hamada.

446
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,660
Give me that. You eat.

447
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,200
I'm not a poison taster.

448
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,030
Poison taster?

449
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,930
That was spicy.

450
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,600
That was spicy... so spicy...
