00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,760
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,760
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,680
Who's there?

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,940
It's Fujimon!

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,940
FUJIWARA's Fujimon

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,940
Monfuji
-I am Monfuji

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,240
People love Monfuji

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,710
I am the most beloved
-Monfuji senpai

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,710
Today I bring you the second edition of a competition project
-What is it?

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,680
Please take a look

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,620
The 2nd Street Bingo Competition

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,760
The first edition was 3 years ago, do you remember?

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,590
I guess so

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,820
You do?
-Yes

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,370
Last time my subject was age

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,740
Sanshino Komiya's was weight

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,170
Morita's was rent

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,850
It was these  themes

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,420
Morita was wasting away

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,350
Morita finally got bingo after finding a 800,000 monthly rent

21
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,450
It took 18 days

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,680
Wasn't it 18 hours?

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,940
Long-term shoot
-18 days

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,150
Bingo finally after 18 days

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,500
Street Bingo Competition!

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,410
Everyone seems slightly tired already

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,050
That's for sure.
-Yes

28
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,780
We all know that it will not end for a while

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,850
Is a long time a bad thing?

30
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,450
You mean, like a lot of time to get footage?
-Yeah

31
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,060
That's really putting it mildly.
-Is that so?

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:58,870
Grip Strength

33
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:58,870
Phone battery

34
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:58,870
Residential Floor

35
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,720
This time we have prepared 3 themes for 3 people as above

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,740
They need to find passersby who match the corresponding number of squares to complete BINGO

37
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,000
Ready?
-Let's go

38
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,380
Whoa!
-Great

39
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,680
Yes, I phone battery power

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,930
Not bad

41
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,220
Grip strength

42
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,580
Ok, Minamikawa is Morita this time around

43
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,380
It's you. 18 days.
-Please, not 18 days...

44
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,260
It could be longer

45
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,430
No, no, I won't exceed it.
-Maximum number of days

46
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:28,770
So, this time also they can't go home until they achieve bingo

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,750
Can't go home?
-Yes

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,300
The staff arranged a hotel

49
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,600
Fujimoto, what is your plan?

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,170
First of all, the first stop, let's see

51
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,180
Go to Sugamo

52
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,910
I'm in "Pressure Battle!!!", and popular for haiku

53
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,250
Many older people in this area like my haiku

54
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,320
So it'll be easier to do this sort of location shoot there

55
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,060
Shoji went to Shinjuku, where men, women, and children gather

56
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,810
Minamikawa went to Omotesando in search of wealthy high-rise apartment dwellers

57
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,380
The three men were divided into three groups

58
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,040
Sugamo, i'm coming!

59
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,030
Its Sugamo

60
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,670
Everything's going smoothly so far

61
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,520
The first one is the best

62
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,480
First, we found this man

63
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,970
The clothes fell off

64
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,880
We are surveying everyone's cell phone battery

65
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,850
Can I see your phone?
-Yes

66
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,190
Let's take a look

67
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,760
75% 75 75…

68
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,520
No
-No

69
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,230
No

70
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,330
Sorry, thank you

71
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,400
78 and 72 are available

72
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,760
3% difference

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
Pity

74
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,070
Ah, come here, come here, come here, come here

75
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,600
Can you be on camera?
-Yes, no problem

76
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,370
Your voice is so high pitched!

77
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,870
Who cares?

78
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,980
I get mistaken for my mother on the phone
-A misunderstanding

79
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,110
We are asking people about their cell phone battery

80
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,880
Can I see yours?
- Yes

81
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,490
69, it's there!

82
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,200
Surprisingly easy

83
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,450
Thank you

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,150
Next is this lady

85
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,830
Here we go. Okay, 85, there we go

86
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,660
In addition

87
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,600
88%
-88

88
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,870
The one right in the corner!

89
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,770
It can be done!

90
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,310
Super fast

91
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,900
I'm very confident

92
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,810
I want to get as many as possible so I need to hurry

93
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,980
Its still the morning so people wont have used their phones that much yet

94
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,120
On the other side in Shinjuku is Shoji

95
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,080
Can I measure your grip strength?

96
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,250
Please start

97
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,290
Oh!

98
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,930
46

99
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:49,670
Rule：Decimal point is omitted

100
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,180
Awesome!

101
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,750
Corner! Thank you!

102
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,700
Adult men are generally in the 40s
-Yeah

103
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,030
The next one found was this father and daughter

104
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,020
The target is the only single digit 9

105
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,110
Seems like a 9

106
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,240
What is the result?

107
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,780
How much will she get?

108
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,350
Good

109
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,980
9.
-Yes?

110
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,690
Thank you

111
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,750
Is it 9?

112
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,750
Oh, great!

113
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,840
5

114
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,770
5

115
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,030
Next is Dad's grip strength

116
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,130
Come on, let's measure

117
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,050
About 40

118
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:22,010
42. Great. Thank you

119
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,690
So, Minamikawa

120
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,080
Where do you live?

121
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,580
Meguro

122
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,750
What floor do you live on?

123
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,420
I live on the 7th floor

124
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,420
There you go. A good location

125
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,390
In one hit!

126
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,960
Oh yeah

127
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,190
In the next few days

128
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:50,400
Rule：Only confirmations count

129
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,400
Is it possible for the staff to confirm you live on the 7th floor

130
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,100
Is it possible?
-Yes

131
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,170
Yes, yes, thank you

132
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,510
Sorry, we're playing BINGO

133
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,040
Please take a look

134
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:08,720
This is the 2LDK on the 7th floor of the Meguro area that we took afterwards

135
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,520
The house is so nice

136
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,400
Next are these three young people

137
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,360
What floor do you live on now?

138
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,330
2nd floor

139
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,230
What floor are you on?

140
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,870
I live in a single house

141
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,140
Rule：Detached don't count

142
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,140
But yeah, it's pretty good

143
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,570
What floor are you on?
-3rd floor

144
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,720
3rd Floor 3rd Floor

145
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,050
Awesome! Faster than expected!

146
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,480
Here we go

147
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,680
3 in the first 15 minutes

148
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
A good sign

149
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,350
Subsequently

150
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,660
What floor is your home on?

151
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,690
I live on the 2nd floor.
-2nd floor

152
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,450
I live on the 4th floor

153
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,260
4th floor

154
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,150
Minamikawa smoothly covers the low floors

155
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,800
5th

156
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,300
Everyone agreed to shoot

157
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,470
Is he faking this?

158
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,710
A fake location shoot?

159
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,750
After 1 hour, the bingo stands as is above

160
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,910
Initially, Minamikawa is in the lead

161
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:24,390
At this point, Fujimoto is eager to obtain big numbers

162
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,930
We are surveying people on their cell phone power

163
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,230
Can I see yours?
-My battery is quite full

164
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,700
Full charge... that's a good thing

165
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,580
Quite full is good

166
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,640
Is it time?

167
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,740
This one is also fine

168
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,680
Don't say it first!

169
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
100

170
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,780
Looks like a full charge

171
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,160
What's wrong with these people? They don't do anything

172
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,180
Not only that

173
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,320
What percentage
-100

174
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,120
100... don't you use it?

175
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,350
Why?

176
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,790
100%. Sorry.
-What the hell?

177
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,640
I'd want to ask why

178
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,900
You can use it a little bit, Saito-kun

179
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,640
On the other hand, Shoji in Shinjuku

180
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,300
Please start

181
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,980
22

182
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,220
There's 22

183
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,280
Got it, great!

184
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,270
So lucky!

185
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,870
Shoji's begins to obtain numbers one by one

186
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,620
40

187
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,140
34

188
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,150
At this time, Minamikawa

189
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,750
Met 2 girls coming out of a Mercedes

190
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,470
Where do you live? Tokyo?

191
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,030
Right
-Yes

192
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,070
Do you live in Tokyo?
-Yes

193
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,140
Is it an apartment or a detached building?

194
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,870
Apartment

195
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,410
What floor of the apartment do you live on?

196
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,410
31
-Great!

197
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,620
31?
-Yes

198
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,620
31st floor

199
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,390
Sorry, how old are you?

200
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,420
12 years old
-12 years old

201
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,260
Where's mom and dad?
-Over there

202
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:11,270
Can the staff film your house in a few days?

203
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,580
Can I ask?

204
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,910
Thank you for your help

205
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,030
Just 3 minutes of shooting

206
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,480
Go go go!

207
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,650
OK？

208
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,320
Go go go

209
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,020
No problem

210
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,190
OK!

211
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,040
Nice people

212
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,000
31

213
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,130
Thank you

214
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:49,160
This is the 4LDK on the 31st floor of Minato Aoyama

215
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,520
Rich

216
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,880
13 and 19 would be very realistic

217
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,040
Indeed

218
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,310
That's a win

219
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,030
And Fujimoto is one step behind

220
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,650
Only got 3

221
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,550
What percentage
-55%

222
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,090
55 55… it's there!

223
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,090
Yes, yes, yes

224
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,800
Oh, yes!

225
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,270
What percentage
-92%

226
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,130
Here we go!

227
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,580
At this point he gets several numbers

228
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,190
No problem.
-Great!

229
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:32,180
On this side, a group of 6

230
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,090
Out of 6 people I should get at least one, right?

231
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,270
What percentage are you?

232
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,330
88% 46% 80% 62% 90%

233
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,600
None, what's going on?

234
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,870
6 people
-How can it be?

235
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,640
The last one, please!

236
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,370
What percentage are you?

237
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,800
39

238
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,400
Got it!

239
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,860
It's almost there!

240
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:20,050
After 2 hours and 45 minutes, Fujimoto is the first to be one step away from a line

241
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,700
Still got a 5

242
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,180
I've asked a lot of people, but there's no single digit yet

243
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,160
Have to wait until the evening

244
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,810
5 is indeed difficult

245
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,650
Sorry, hello

246
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,350
Then please start

247
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,250
Mikitty!

248
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,070
Making fun of him

249
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,330
50

250
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,330
Say something instead

251
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,410
Got 50!

252
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,120
Yes, 50, great!

253
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,490
Line!

254
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,830
10 minutes later than Fujimoto, Shoji is also one step away from a line

255
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,700
Can you find 63?

256
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,570
Hello, we are Wednesday Downtown

257
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,340
What floor do you live on?

258
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,340
1st floor

259
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,710
3rd floor

260
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,250
7th floor

261
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,450
2nd floor, 1st floor, 2nd floor

262
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:20,520
The floor bingo's difficulty suddenly becomes apparent

263
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,180
As Shoji gets numbers non-stop

264
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,870
Triple!

265
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:35,550
This is the status after 5 hours

266
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,980
At that time, Fujimoto came to Akihabara

267
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,580
Lots of cell phone users

268
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,170
Fujimoto is so smart
-Smart, right?

269
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,380
I'm here

270
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,750
There are a lot of people in Akihabara who use cell phones, right?

271
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,680
Looking for low power, Fujimoto soon found his target

272
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,060
He seems to be quite addicted to cell phones

273
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,860
He locks on to this backpack wearing man

274
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,970
We are investigating the phone power, what percentage are you?

275
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,870
I am 7%

276
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,210
7%?

277
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,480
This is close to 7

278
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,380
My God, it would be nice if we could wait a bit

279
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,010
More than that

280
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,090
I am 15%

281
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,420
I'm at 19%

282
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,020
I am 23%

283
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,320
As expected, there are many people with low power

284
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,770
But he just can't find the right number

285
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:41,510
On this side, Shoji needs big numbers

286
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:47,680
Can I go to the gym?

287
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,450
Okay, let's go to Gold's Gym

288
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,420
That's the top place in Japan

289
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,520
There must be a lot of people there who can get over 50, right?

290
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,920
A bit crafty

291
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,790
What's wrong with that?

292
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,360
At the same time, this man's bingo game has halted

293
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,230
I'll go directly to a high-rise apartment neighborhood

294
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,340
Smart

295
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,830
Go to Toyosu. Toyosu

296
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,100
A bit crafty

297
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,770
It's still a street. It's fine

298
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,770
Each of the three men rush to their destination

299
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,730
Hello, I'm sorry to bother you

300
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,360
We are surveying people on their cell phone power

301
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,770
Do you have a cell phone with you?
-Yes, I do

302
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,040
A flip screen!

303
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,770
You use the flip-top one?

304
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,710
Yes, I bought a new one

305
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,410
A new flip-top?
-Yes

306
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,580
Why not use a smartphone?
-This is more comfortable to use

307
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,880
Smooth. Always used it
-Yes

308
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,780
How much power is left?

309
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,120
47

310
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,930
Wow, flip-top 47!

311
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,270
Totally unexcited

312
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,330
Did my excitement not reach you?

313
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,000
Two different temperatures, these two

314
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,430
I'm so excited that I got the number

315
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,830
Do you know me?
-No, not at all

316
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,500
Not at all?

317
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,970
And do not know what my profession is?
-No idea

318
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,240
Do you know Downtown?

319
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,190
I'm sure you know!

320
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,070
I think I know
-Just "I think I know"?

321
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,780
Do you know their names?

322
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,580
The straight man is

323
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,380
Not so sure

324
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,890
Don't know?

325
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,950
Hamada!

326
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,650
You don't know the idiot either?
-Yes, I'm not familiar with them

327
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,250
Not familiar, even familiar with me
-Yes

328
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,660
This Galapagos man breaks new ground

329
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,660
※The Galapagos phenomenon is a Japanese business term that refers to the phenomenon of isolated market environments in which adaptation optimization is carried out alone and interchangeability outside the region is eventually lost.

330
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,080
I am 22%
-22

331
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,660
The following three numbers were obtained one after another

332
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,680
Fujimoto is now waiting on these 4 single digits

333
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,870
Want single digits

334
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,710
But it's going well enough

335
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,010
I've arrived

336
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,550
Gold's Gym East Tokyo

337
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,050
And so

338
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,660
Hello

339
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,400
Looks strong

340
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,570
A muscular man appeared as if he came out of a painting

341
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,930
How old are you?
-52 years old

342
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,530
52 years old, you have a good body.
-No, no, no, no

343
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,580
Doesn't look like 52

344
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Beautiful

345
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,160
So, please start

346
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,170
It's coming. It's coming

347
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,240
43

348
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,480
What's wrong with you?

349
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,150
Probably just finished practicing
-I see

350
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,320
Only the muscular comedians understand
-Who?

351
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,440
At this time, Minamikawa arrives at the new location

352
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,030
Now living on the 15th floor

353
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,610
After arriving he gets 3 middle floors in a row

354
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,920
More than that

355
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,940
Hello, we are Wednesday Downtown

356
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,740
What floor do you live in the apartment?

357
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,540
I live on the 32nd floor

358
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,480
No 32...

359
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,690
What floor do you live on?
-42nd floor

360
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:23,220
As he expected, all he encountered were high-rise apartment dwellers

361
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,930
At this time

362
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,360
What floor do you live on?

363
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,910
I live on the 43rd floor.
-43

364
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,000
So high, you live so high

365
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,240
It's on there!

366
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,160
I never thought i'd get numbers like this

367
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:46,580
7 and a half hours into the game, Minamikawa finally almost has a line

368
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:52,190
And the 43rd floor 1LDK looks like this

369
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:01,700
And has a great view of Odaiba and Rainbow Bridge

370
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,400
At this point they are all very close

371
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,580
One moment, please

372
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,580
Why did you take it off?

373
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,440
Then please start

374
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,360
What's happening?

375
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,520
Quite high

376
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,210
Wow, there it is. 57

377
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,700
Great. Look at this. 57.
-Good

378
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,150
5 lines!

379
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,680
Can you come over here?
-Yes

380
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,100
Excuse me, come over here and line up

381
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,210
How much power is left in your phone
-59

382
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,110
What percentage
-41

383
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,910
What percentage
-49

384
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,010
49 also, what happened?

385
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,970
What percentage
-66

386
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,920
66, no

387
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,140
Similar battery of these guys

388
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,550
How much power is left
-8%

389
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,840
There's an 8

390
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,940
8

391
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,300
Didn't expect it

392
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:13,700
BINGO!

393
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:20,480
8 hours after the start of the location shoot, BINGO is achieved!

394
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,480
Hello, this is Minamikawa

395
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,450
I'm done!

396
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,220
You did it first!

397
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,720
What're you eating?

398
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,290
Crepes, I'm eating a strawberry banana crepe

399
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,660
Really tired...

400
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,830
I'm super tired

401
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,960
Ok, bye bye

402
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,200
Thanks for your hard work

403
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,620
I'm home!

404
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,340
Remaining power is too easy

405
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,010
He's shit talking now

406
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,010
Anyone can find

407
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,080
Looking for 52

408
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,010
Sorry

409
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,320
Can I measure your grip strength?

410
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,020
Come and see these hands

411
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,430
I'm expecting a lot now

412
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:14,430
The goal is 52 60 or 63

413
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,900
Then please start

414
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,720
More than 60 is quite remarkable

415
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,420
What is the result?

416
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,710
Looking strong

417
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,770
Hasn't exercised yet, right?

418
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,470
25

419
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,810
What, why?

420
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,020
You lying? Stop it!

421
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,720
Sorry, we're Wednesday Downtown

422
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,390
What floor do you live on?
-50th floor

423
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,590
Eh eh eh?

424
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,490
50

425
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,800
It's really the 50th floor

426
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,960
Thank you so much!

427
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:59,320
The view from the window of the 50th floor, the highest floor of BINGO, is like this

428
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,490
So great!

429
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:08,910
The Rainbow Bridge under the twinkling lights, the beautiful Tokyo Tower, a great view

430
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,320
More than that

431
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,990
What floor is your home on?

432
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,810
18th floor
-18

433
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,880
Really?
-Yes

434
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,830
18, there's also a 22

435
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,840
Minamikawa now also gets 4 almost-lines

436
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,840
Let's end it right here. I mean it

437
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,060
However

438
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,750
A call came in.
-Give me a break

439
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,170
Is it possible...?

440
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,680
Hello?

441
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,890
What're you eating!?

442
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,820
Hmm? Chicken breast

443
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,080
Muscle care

444
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,080
Protein

445
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm done with BINGO. Thanks.
-Wow! Damn!

446
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,430
Actually, 15 minutes ago

447
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,890
Gold's Gym, good choice

448
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,970
Grip strength...
-Eh? Uh, Japanese not so good

449
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,810
Grip strength
-good

450
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,970
Power
-Good. No problem

451
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,210
OK? Short interview？
-No problem

452
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,890
63, great!

453
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,260
Wh-what?

454
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,230
A punch would be great

455
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,010
Dammit!

456
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,170
It's dark

457
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,040
I thought I could do it

458
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,140
Victory was in sight!
-4 in a row

459
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,080
I lost

460
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,140
Yeah, it was close

461
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:51,890
However, whether we win or lose, the planning rule is that we can't go home without BINGO

462
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,720
Look, there's almost no one left

463
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,530
Places where there are people + rich people

464
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:05,270
Roppongi and Azabu, let's go!

465
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:10,040
So Minamikawa went to Roppongi

466
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,110
What floor do you live on?

467
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,540
2nd floor
-2F

468
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,440
What floor do you live on?
-4th floor

469
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,450
What floor do you live on?
-2nd floor

470
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:24,150
5th floor 4th floor 4th floor 10th floor 3rd floor 3rd floor 4th floor

471
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,190
What's up
-What's going on

472
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,900
Residents above the 20th floor are hard to find

473
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:39,740
It's been 13 hours since the start and already 11:00

474
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,200
It can't be ended

475
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,860
People are going home

476
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,070
The crowds have become thin. Will he have to go the route of accommodation?

477
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,520
However, at this time

478
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,220
Excuse me, do you live around here?
-Yes, I do

479
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,420
Please, what floor do you live on?

480
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,820
28th floor

481
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,960
28

482
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,680
It's done!

483
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,210
Thank you 28

484
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,140
There are dogs

485
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,370
What's wrong with having a dog?

486
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,670
So i've finally got BINGO
-BINGO

487
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:26,490
After 13 hours and 15 minutes, Minamikawa finally gets BINGO

488
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,580
Awesome

489
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,150
What do you think?

490
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,720
There's not much to see here.
-Please don't say anything unnecessary

491
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,130
Not much to see but still very interesting

492
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,020
Also interesting? I can be satisfied then?

493
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,340
How about other themes?

494
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,510
Sight?

495
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,910
Sight

496
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,400
Too detailed, right?
-So much trouble

497
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,470
Take that C-vision chart

498
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,550
How many teeth are left?

499
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,440
Yeah remaining teeth

500
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,680
It was exhausting, they edited it a lot

501
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,320
I asked more than 200 people

502
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,760
So hard
-Exhausting!

503
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,290
It has a bit of a fake feeling to it

504
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,980
What do you mean?

505
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,360
How is that possible? Don't say that

506
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,390
The excellent point of this program is not to fake

507
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,060
I have not faked anything here, not even once

508
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,870
Not even 1 time?

509
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,800
Just once

510
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,200
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

511
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,280
Magical Lovely!

512
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:41,320
So, without delay, this time we bring the second edition of a theory about duos

513
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:50,630
The 2nd 'The person who doesn't write skits has no right to complain no matter how boring the segment written by his partner is'

514
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,220
I see, that's true

515
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,970
We verified it last time

516
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,670
This is really a combination of things that will happen to those who write skits and those who don't

517
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:05,610
Relationships
-The relationship between people, but there are no rules about who should write the paragraphs

518
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:10,380
No contract
-Because there is no contract to skits its essentially done for free

519
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,320
That's true

520
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,000
Why must we write skits?

521
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,080
That's true. That's true.

522
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,900
I watched Matsumoto's manzai talent in the previous "Legendary Day" show

523
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,910
After the end of the skit was there no discussion about thoughts on it?

524
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,440
No, no, no. After that, there was no dialogue.

525
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:31,270
Also, I have never felt the feeling of having done something just myself

526
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:35,520
But Hamada is actually thinking "Thank you, Matsumoto" in his heart, right?

527
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,610
When its a good performance, certainly I think so

528
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,400
But as far as that performance is concerned

529
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,550
It's just a few random words

530
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,940
After it was over, he left without saying anything

531
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,650
Left immediately, right?

532
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,530
Not even any pillow talk

533
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:57,630
When performing manzai

534
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,680
When Matsumoto shares the ideas

535
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,450
What were your thoughts?

536
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,050
Would you just go along with it or...

537
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,870
I basically just told him all of them verbally

538
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,040
Have you ever had a conversation like "this doesn't feel right"?

539
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,370
No no

540
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,380
But I think there was a "huh? reaction

541
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,340
A "huh?"

542
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,610
Did I say "huh?" Did I?

543
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,630
Yes yes, you have

544
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,330
People who write the skits should be able to feel it

545
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,320
The feeling that the other person wants to say something

546
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,020
You'd have to be very careful and say "I feel that the line here isn't quite right"

547
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,900
Ah, that happened

548
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,720
I've been told, "Well...I do understand, but..."

549
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,540
"The audience may not be able to understand it."

550
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,970
It was said with respect, right?
-Yes, yes, that's what it is

551
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:47,980
After that, 3 duos will be tested to see if they have respect for the partner who writes the skits

552
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:58,790
The person who doesn't write skits has no right to complain no matter how boring the segment written by his partner is

553
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,150
So the initial duo is

554
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,230
M-1 Champion Magic Lovely

555
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,650
Hey, stand up. Stand up

556
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,100
Known for their unique segments

557
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,120
I didn't take your umbrella
-This seems to be going round and round

558
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,290
Are all penned by this man

559
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,850
After writing skits, Murakami is the first to hear them

560
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,190
Because it is the initial audience will observe the reaction

561
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,830
If it doesn't seem interesting

562
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:37,270
He'll say "well, let's not do this segment first," and then propose other segments

563
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,680
Murakami is not very direct words?

564
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,940
There will be a little grunt like "Hmmm..."

565
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,440
Same as Hamada

566
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,770
But won't say anything directly

567
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,660
Because he doesn't want to shoulder the responsibility of after the change

568
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,490
Like Hamada, super happy

569
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,380
It's a case of not saying
-Can't say, and although he can't say it he'll make a noise instead

570
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:58,440
Let's see Murakami's reaction to Noda's boring skit

571
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:05,830
The show "Best One" wants us to do some new segments, and short ones are fine

572
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,360
Seems very real

573
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,700
A few minutes
-2 minutes

574
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:15,180
For example, I start by saying, "I've started using dating apps," and "Oh, yeah?"

575
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:22,440
With that, Noda immediately verbally explains the content of the segment as he had done before

576
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:31,640
This time, Noda wrote a boring skit on purpose with the theme of registering for a dating app

577
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,990
Which will allow Murakami to perform super exaggerated retorts

578
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,150
The most annoying

579
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,100
"First enter your name and birthday"

580
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,540
"Oh, that's right... you have to state these."

581
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:55,210
"Then enter your body fat percentage and your calorie intake for the day."

582
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,350
"Oh, you have to enter this?"

583
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,640
The theme is that that the dating software is actually workout software

584
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,100
Murakami, who has been listening quietly

585
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,660
Then finally write the exercise history

586
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,200
"Workout Software!"

587
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,260
I hope you can move a little more

588
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,870
Then on the contrary, I will not move at all

589
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,970
Hmm...
-Your side keeps moving, that's all

590
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:20,700
Hmm...

591
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,180
In light of the super exaggerated retorts were not suggested until now

592
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,420
No particular opinion is clear

593
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,150
So, they start rehearsing

594
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,960
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

595
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,640
This

596
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,080
It's not a dating app, it's a workout app!

597
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,410
Ah, it's so boring...

598
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:07,120
Murakami, whose face was slightly red, retorted with all his might as requested

599
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
Became very red in a flash

600
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,610
Also

601
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,870
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

602
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,520
It's not even in their style anymore.
-What is this?

603
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,790
You! You!

604
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:29,940
That's not dating, its workout software!

605
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:36,480
For no reason, he is told to do it while lying down

606
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,110
He said "do it like a fish"

607
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,890
Yes,like a fish

608
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,040
Super hard work!

609
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,350
At this point, the skit develops even more fascinatingly

610
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,180
More?

611
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,630
I said you. I said that... Hey...

612
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,310
Not a dating app!

613
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,570
I'm hungry, I'm going home

614
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:14,230
And so it ends with a naked tirade that seems to reignite the "talented manzai" debate

615
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,220
But... can deal with undressing?
-Deal with it?

616
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,430
I don't think it's necessary to undress

617
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,990
Ah, he said what he thinks!

618
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,070
Here he shows resistance to nudity for no reason

619
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,480
But Murakami still basically accepts all of it

620
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,820
So, we reveal the truth at this time

621
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,470
What?

622
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,290
No... great

623
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,890
This is not a real skit, right?

624
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,190
Not like our style, it feels...

625
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,770
As expected, the content of the skit felt incompatible

626
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:12,640
No complaints. I'm really disappointed

627
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,440
Eh?

628
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,410
It's not ok to do just anything

629
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,750
Exactly

630
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,180
I think it is better to be grateful

631
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,650
So, the next one is

632
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:27,090
A threesome that has been together for 15 years

633
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,440
This is going to be messier

634
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,830
Jungle Pocket

635
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,420
A group who is a regular finalist in the King of Conte

636
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,350
This time its Ota, who is in charge of all skit creation

637
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,660
We asked him about his partners

638
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:54,170
Surprisingly, Saito is the type to go along with everything

639
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,090
The randomly written lines, he memorizes them exactly as they are written

640
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,220
Otake though, he's basically not interested in skits

641
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,920
This is not "good", right?

642
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,460
It's all "bad"

643
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:09,740
So I don't think Otake will say anything

644
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,980
This time, Ota wrote the following skit

645
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,900
A cheesy set-up in which someone falls suddenly in on a plane

646
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:22,670
With absolutely no chances to "play the fool"

647
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,270
This will definitely be said, right?

648
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,590
Immediately, the two of them read the boring script

649
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,000
Then

650
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,490
That's it

651
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,990
This will still be said, right?

652
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,430
Hmm...

653
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,430
Is there anything you care about?

654
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,600
It's just like a skit, right?

655
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,240
Well, although it's a corny beginning

656
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
There are still some...

657
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:57,170
Can't find any funny parts at all

658
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,400
Saito immediately shows hesitation

659
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,120
This will definitely scare you

660
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,380
Must be a little strange

661
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,960
As expected, Motake feels nothing

662
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,680
Already started to memorize it

663
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,660
Where are the parts to get a laugh?

664
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,560
A place to get a laugh?

665
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,830
The jokes

666
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,330
What do you mean?

667
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:22,370
To say where, including the wording...

668
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,480
Sure enough, because he hasn't written it, there is no way to forcefully express an opinion

669
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,840
Instead, Saito shows a little bit of "what the hell is this?

670
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,680
Are you angry?

671
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,320
Although its a bit cliche there are jokes

672
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,950
Is "intestinal obstruction" the funny part?

673
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:44,060
Yes, "appendicitis," "peritonitis," and finally "intestinal obstruction"

674
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:52,590
Using of the 3 diseases inferred from the patient's symptoms as jokes

675
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,790
A difficult order

676
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,410
The name of the disease is a little nasty

677
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,740
There is no discrepancy

678
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,110
However, the language sense of the words

679
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,180
Because "appendicitis" and "peritonitis" are the groundwork

680
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,690
Otake, what do you think?

681
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:16,190
"Appendicitis," "peritonitis," "intestinal obstruction."
-Yeah

682
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,530
To put it bluntly, "intestinal obstruction" is the final push

683
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,330
"Appendicitis followed by intestinal obstruction."

684
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,970
What does it mean?

685
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,280
The idiot next door, however, is motivated

686
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,400
Saito's dilemma is clear to see

687
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,840
Saito will say it of his own accord

688
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,990
Then, the rehearsals reluctantly started

689
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,190
In this area, there are 3 possibilities

690
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,890
3?

691
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:54,230
Appendicitis, peritonitis, or intestinal obstruction

692
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,400
Intestinal obstruction?

693
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,230
Finally

694
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,340
No, this is not quite right

695
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,930
He's said it

696
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,470
No, Ota, there's not really any joke here

697
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,620
He said it

698
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,910
That's it, right? This new...

699
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,280
That's not true, and there's no such new...

700
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,720
Don't you feel its a little off?

701
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,380
Otake has completely accepted the awful script

702
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,550
But Saito's irritation could not be concealed

703
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,730
Intestinal obstruction can not make you laugh

704
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,700
I wouldn't be amused by intestinal obstruction

705
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,030
Working in Tokyo, for example, here is...

706
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,570
Intestinal obstruction, its not the right feeling, right?

707
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,170
Well, not at all.
-It's not like that, is it?

708
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,440
I think it's just plain speaking with ordinary lines

709
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,940
And just like that, the intestinal blockage session with Jungle Pocket begins to heat up

710
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:54,520
Thank you for using Gibbon Air Flight 482 today

711
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,650
Always memorizing

712
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,720
Otake, its a mistake

713
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:03,500
Otake quits the meeting in the middle to learn the laughless lines

714
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,270
Is there a doctor, please?

715
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,700
You don't need to practice yet

716
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,570
We're talking about here, not your part

717
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,610
This guest seems to have a very painful stomach

718
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:17,110
This is too different from the skits you've written so far
-3 types? 3 types?

719
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:24,090
Even in the past, there are obvious jokes, but here there isn't

720
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,990
Although it may not be appropriate to say

721
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:31,890
But this skit will also cause you to suffer because you wrote it

722
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,830
This time, Saito, who has never complained about a script

723
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:40,830
Explicitly negates the content

724
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,860
Here we reveal the truth

725
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,480
Still practicing

726
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,530
What?

727
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,680
What's wrong? You two were both in on it?

728
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,090
Eh? I don't know. What?

729
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,550
Seriously!?
-I really don't know what's going on

730
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,760
I really don't know what... what's going on

731
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,860
What, what, what, what? Wait, I don't get it.
-Okay, you don't have to say anything

732
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,290
It's too hard to understand what it means

733
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,130
What's "too hard to understand"? It's super easy, right?
-What? What? What?

734
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,070
Beautifully done

735
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,230
And then finally

736
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,170
Although it is often forgotten, a former winner of King of Conte

737
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:22,020
Korkochikichiki Peppers

738
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,310
This is dangerous

739
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,850
Staff, come here!

740
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,700
As opposed to Nadal, whose job is mainly to show a bad attitude on TV

741
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,710
So nostalgic!

742
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,120
All the skits are created by Nishino

743
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,430
What'll happen?

744
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,940
If we did this sort of thing

745
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,450
Jiro would become silent

746
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,650
This time, Nishino created a skit

747
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,560
With Nadal playing a variety of roles at a festival

748
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,150
Performing multiple low quality fake-outs in a row

749
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,150
What'll happen?

750
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,860
A little acting?

751
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,900
It'll be performed in 4 days time

752
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:24,650
This time is the preparation for a looming live show

753
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:29,010
It was a marriage proposal skit

754
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,880
But I want to change it

755
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,010
Are you listening properly?

756
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,360
So annoying

757
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,590
From the very beginning, there is no respect at all for skit creation

758
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,930
It's Nadal!

759
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,000
If you want to drink, drink it properly

760
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,490
Instead, its a music festival

761
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,100
Shout "Arena!"

762
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,500
Like Ayumi Hamasaki?

763
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:57,510
Good evening, I'm Koda Yumi

764
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,010
Like Koda Kumi

765
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,510
Koda Yumi means...

766
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,110
"Good evening. I'm Koda Yumi"

767
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,480
Good evening, I'm Koda Yumi

768
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:17,930
Thumb, middle finger, pinky and ring finger, index finger will be coming out soon

769
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:23,230
It's coming out! It's coming out! The index finger is coming out!

770
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,000
It's a thumbs up

771
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,670
What does this mean? I'll just show my head, right?
-Yes, yes, yes

772
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:36,970
So, they sing about Koda Yumi's fingers and perform each finger with expressions

773
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:40,750
Somewhat difficult conditions

774
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,310
Difficult is indeed quite difficult

775
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:44,320
That's how I come out, right? And then what?
-Yes, yes, from behind the table

776
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:48,020
My knee hurts!

777
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,230
I'll try it

778
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,520
Then

779
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:58,130
Thumb, middle finger, pinky to ring finger

780
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,800
I don't know what expression to use!

781
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,100
Suddenly said a thumbs up expression

782
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,440
Just now the ring finger expression is the little thumb, right?

783
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,610
What do you mean?

784
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,110
Then you try it. I don't understand

785
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,540
Here Nadal is right

786
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,010
"What do you mean" indeed

787
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,450
What is the middle finger? What is the little finger? I don't know

788
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,650
I don't know, that look

789
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,950
Not at all like the tone of the duo that does not write the skits

790
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,860
Nadal starts to complain

791
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,430
The other one i've done before

792
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,830
This is too much trouble.
-The one about the proposal?

793
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,860
Eh?
-Proposal skit?

794
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,570
Yeah
-No, but...

795
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,970
I don't understand this one

796
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,770
You wrote this at night, right?

797
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,970
Not at night, but on the road

798
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,310
You sometimes just write some super boring skits

799
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,210
This guy is terrible, they're gonna break up

800
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,420
When they're good they're good

801
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,720
At those times I can trust you completely

802
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,960
But in times like this

803
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,190
This time...

804
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:00,730
If I wanted to do it, I wouldn't say anything
-Because I have to plan 6 segments

805
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:08,300
Although Nadal still at least has respect for Nishino who wrote the skit

806
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,710
I don't get the thumbs up expression

807
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,280
What is the correct answer... you say what expression to do

808
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,140
Perform the thumbs up expression

809
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,580
I don't know it

810
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,480
Feels like it's about to get interesting

811
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,650
In the end what is the expression, you do it, I do not understand

812
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:24,490
What the hell is that expression? I can't understand it!

813
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,720
I said you do it cause I don't understand it

814
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,680
Fury mode begins due to discussions about a thumbs up expression

815
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,860
Then I'll do it, won't I?
-Let's do it again

816
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:44,910
The thumb, middle finger, pinky and ring finger, index finger...

817
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,410
What about the index finger?

818
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,640
This is already a paragraph skit

819
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,410
It's a type of skit

820
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,600
At this point, they move onto other characters

821
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,020
I'll try it, but I don't think it'll be very funny

822
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,990
Where are you going?

823
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,560
Then you come out

824
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,530
I am Nadal A Dream
-Nadal A Dream?

825
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,790
Flashlight
-Eh?

826
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,440
Hey!
-Ya!

827
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,640
Then your crotch has gotten smaller.
-It's too bad

828
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,770
See you next week

829
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,780
Where's the fun in that?

830
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,190
Straight criticism

831
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,410
It's good to evolve this together, right?

832
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:26,150
I think it is quite interesting

833
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,580
But I don't want to do it

834
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,820
Then change the Nadal A Dream

835
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,840
Because the bad mood can't be stopped

836
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,460
We reveal the truth here

837
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,560
Always drinking water

838
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,740
The theory is will someone complain about a super boring skit if they aren't the writer

839
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,440
I will

840
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,670
Sometimes they're really not good

841
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,510
Of course I trust you. Of course

842
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,280
But occasionally they suck

843
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,780
I don't get it, let me make the thumbs up face

844
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,750
Is a thumbs up expression so cramped-looking?

845
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,420
That's it. Is this the little thumb?

846
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,060
This is the little thumb
-Where is it?

847
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:14,230
In summary
Nishino's tolerance is unusual

848
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,790
What do you think, Matsumoto?

849
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:21,570
Comedy is incredible

850
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:25,350
Even this became somewhat funny, so humor is difficult to understand

851
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:29,340
I actually think it's okay to act like this, a new genre

852
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:34,080
Jungle Pocket's one could become somewhat interesting

853
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,690
Nadal must have drunk 2 gallons of water

854
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,180
It's a gallon, right?

855
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,520
That one can be measured in gallons

856
00:45:42,520 --> 00:46:24,790
