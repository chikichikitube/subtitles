00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,810
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,460
Let's get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,040
Please welcome FUJIWARA!

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,050
Hello everyone, we are comedians
-Welcome

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,150
We are a comedian combo, thanks for having us
-It's a combo!

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,280
This time we bring you the second instance of a five-year-old theory

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,280
The theory is this:

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,780
The 2nd "You won't realize something is your own possession if its in the hands of someone else"

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,890
Here it is!

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,030
It has been done before

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,960
There are many copycats of this theory on youtube
-Really?

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,800
Yes, quite a few

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,070
Must have good reviews

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,100
Then its possible that our program is the one copying it

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,680
Possibly, possibly, this program could do such a thing

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,070
No one will find out if we copy something anyway

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,080
So then,

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,810
Will the subject notice the items have been taken out of their house?

19
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,840
Huh?

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,100
And

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,920
Verify that all comedians have their own "Asakusa Kid"

22
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:35,250
Once again, we will verify whether or not people can tell items are theirs when they are in the hands of others

23
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,500
So, with the assistance of their managers

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,310
The personal belongings of the subject are taken from their home

25
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,720
And presented to them in different scenarios

26
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,320
Semi-thief behavior now

27
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,500
The first target is

28
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,370
Morita

29
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,970
Good morning

30
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,540
Fake meetings are set up to test the targets

31
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,220
The first items are set up in this cafe

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,450
Recently, Morita moved into this 2LDK apartment

33
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,050
In the living room is a poster of Muhammad Ali

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,720
Just saw it

35
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,540
Seems easy to spot

36
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,690
However, it was hard to notice because it was behind him

37
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,050
During conversation, the topic of interior decoration comes up

38
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,430
The poster seems to match this cafe's style

39
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,470
A framed photo ... I did buy one

40
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,480
Ah he's spotted it

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,990
He's noticed it

42
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,510
Ah, this one

43
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,280
Huh?

44
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,810
You don't think it's your own, do you?

45
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,820
It's this one

46
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,190
Yes, it is
-Just seems like a coincidence

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,920
I recently bought this one

48
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,620
Ali?
-I recently bought it

49
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,390
Yes, this one of Ali

50
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,060
Mine is probably a little bigger

51
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,630
No, no, it's the same it's the same

52
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,240
Shameful
-Feels different in different spaces, right?

53
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,530
Bigger than this one?
-Bigger than this

54
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,240
Yeah, at home it seems bigger

55
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,970
Muhammad Ali
-Yeah, this

56
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,210
There is obviously no subtle difference in size

57
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,970
In short, Morita did not realize the item was his own

58
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,330
The next item is a sofa

59
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,130
That's bold!

60
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,120
I'm most interested in furniture, especially furniture stores

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,280
It's integration into the environment is too good

62
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,930
Since I moved place I thought I'd buy a load of new stuff

63
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,430
There's sofas and ...
-How much did the sofa cost?

64
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:43,840
Sofa... uh, I think ah about 400,000

65
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,570
What's a 400,000 sofa like?

66
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,450
Actually it's nothing special, doesn't look very high grade or anything

67
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,820
It's a corduroy sofa

68
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,020
Just like that one over there, pretty much the same

69
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,680
It's huge!

70
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,090
Is that one corduroy?

71
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,490
It's really similar to this

72
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,380
Doesn't it just feel like his own home?

73
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,930
Its not the kind of thing that looks very high grade

74
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,500
Not very extravagantly made

75
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,380
Hasn't realized it's exactly the same

76
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,040
They bought a similar sofa

77
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,380
Similar

78
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:21,240
Having your home and a new trendy place like this set up the same feels really good

79
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,430
Didn't realize

80
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,550
Although it looks exactly the same,

81
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,640
He fails to think "The items are actually exactly the same"

82
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,060
After that, he ignores the mannequin placed at the entrance

83
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,190
The store owner and I really have the same taste

84
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,940
Later on, a fake gourmet report

85
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,300
It's not too late, let's go in and take a look

86
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,750
Inside...

87
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,440
Hello

88
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,710
I'm Morita, thanks very much for having me

89
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,560
T-shirt...

90
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,210
It'll get oily, so annoying
-It's going to smell

91
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,230
And then,

92
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,320
So you like American casual too?

93
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,690
Yeah, although I don't only wear American casual

94
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,720
I also like to buy vintage stuff

95
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,490
Yeah yeah yeah, I actually have the exact same t-shirt

96
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,190
Really?
-Yeah

97
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,430
Is this vintage?
-Yes, it is

98
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,300
The same, exactly the same, really, probably

99
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,580
The fumes are so annoying!

100
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,500
Really alike

101
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,270
Even so, he still didn't realize it's his own possession

102
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,870
So, we set an even bolder trap next

103
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,840
The pork face and beef tongue is tossed with soy sauce

104
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:42,730
An individual dressed entirely in Morita's clothes

105
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,220
Liver and diaphragm are flavored with miso

106
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,370
Welcome, one?

107
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,480
Full body

108
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,730
Please sit here

109
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,990
So they're open for business!

110
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,980
And...

111
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,970
It's pretty crowded

112
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,510
A couple dressed in Morita's clothes

113
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,780
A girl too?

114
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,310
Awesome

115
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,240
Two new customers

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,310
Morita finally begins to awaken due to an unmistakeable feeling of familiarity

117
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,780
However, after that too

118
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,780
Still no reaction?

119
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:18,400
More female customers dressed in Morita's clothes

120
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,930
Way too many people!

121
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,910
Girls

122
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,640
This store is so popular!
-Yes

123
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,270
Excuse me, here is your potato salad, please enjoy your meal

124
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,340
Ok

125
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,520
A response so cold that one wouldn't think he was on location for a food review

126
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,440
And then,

127
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,860
Regulars who like American casual...

128
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,560
So many!

129
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,960
We all know each other pretty well
-Yeah seems like it

130
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,380
Welcome

131
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:59,740
A whole group of guests resembles Morita

132
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,980
Please sterilize over here. Three of you, right? Please sit here

133
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
Can't take anymore

134
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,910
They're all American casual...

135
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,220
That's not the point

136
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:11,850
Faced with such an unusual situation, Morita's state no longer reflects that of an on-location shoot

137
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,050
Here we add the tenth person

138
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,360
American casual again

139
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,130
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

140
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,300
Give me a minute. Hey, what the hell is this?

141
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,300
Realized

142
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,670
I have all the same ones, hey!

143
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,540
Thus, the truth is revealed

144
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,580
What is this, seriously!?

145
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,010
No, you guys almost got... ah

146
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,380
It's all mine!

147
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,760
They're all wearing my clothes

148
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,690
"You won't realize something is your own possession if its in the hands of someone else"

149
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,460
No, no... if you say so, I guess

150
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,000
I only realized because you did it to this extent

151
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,770
Which of these clothes is the most expensive?

152
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,040
That, that, that
-How much is it?

153
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,270
110,000

154
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,710
So old and expensive?

155
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,200
What did you do before this?

156
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,270
Before coming here?
-Yes

157
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,250
I had a meeting before coming here

158
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,790
The Muhammad Ali poster!

159
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,090
Ah ah ah ah

160
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,820
Ah, sofa!?

161
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,450
From my home!

162
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,980
It is indeed unexpectedly difficult to realize

163
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,960
But anyway, all of you get out of here!

164
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,370
Don't suck up the fumes in here

165
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,940
Don't let my American casual absorb the smell here

166
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,180
The next target is...

167
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,770
Good morning, Sakai here

168
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,520
Good morning, I'm TBS' announcer Yasumi

169
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,160
Will Sakai realize?

170
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,980
This time the stage is a thrift store

171
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,390
The store is currently selling a lot of Sakai's personal items

172
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,010
Can he realize?

173
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,390
After all, there are many items around

174
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,330
Not long after the shooting started,

175
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,920
Eh? There's have CUTRATE stuff

176
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,540
Eh? Just 100? Really?

177
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,690
I have the exact same thing
-The exact same thing?

178
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,510
When I bought it it was expensive

179
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,050
This is even cheaper than in the Philippines

180
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,970
Next...

181
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,010
Eh?

182
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,680
I think I also have this

183
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,090
You have this at home too?
-Eh? Yeah...

184
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,600
Being faced with a prepared product that is very much to his taste

185
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,790
The Switch is so cheap!

186
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,330
Sakai becomes very excited

187
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,360
Seriously?

188
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,000
All the things I like!
-It's great

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,140
Next, in the appliances section,

190
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,620
Sakai's TV and refrigerator have been placed

191
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,230
Even this is for sale?
-Impressive

192
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,380
This... seems

193
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,680
Isn't that what this is? It's...

194
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,880
Ahhhhh, this is it!

195
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,160
And,

196
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,850
AQUOS, ah!

197
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,890
Eh? It's so cheap!

198
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,230
I bought it for about 80,000
-Eh?

199
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,660
Still hasn't realized

200
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,000
I should've come here first

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,600
Should just moved into the store and live here

202
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:22,110
Actually, Sakai just moved from his hometown in December of last year

203
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,290
King of Conte

204
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,340
This time, we took advantage of his absence and removed all of the belongings

205
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,610
So messed up

206
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,130
A big project!

207
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,120
And put them up for sale in the various sections of the thrift store

208
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,420
Wow, there's a bed!

209
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,830
How is it?

210
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,330
Wait a minute.

211
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,180
It's about time to realize

212
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,870
Eh？

213
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,140
This is too similar

214
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,810
Is it similar to yours?
-Yes

215
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,920
But it's not possible!

216
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,790
It's true that it can't be exactly the same
-Yes

217
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,270
Safe

218
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,450
Next,

219
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,730
They also sell teeth
-Wow so disgusting

220
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,830
What's this?

221
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,460
What's going on here?

222
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,540
Although this item seems unexplainable

223
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,010
These are actually Sakai's baby teeth from his home

224
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,540
Baby teeth?
-Who the hell knows?

225
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,980
Who would be impressed by this?

226
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,410
Teeth

227
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,450
I want these teeth

228
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,280
It's someones personal belonging, right?
-Yes

229
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,290
You want to buy the teeth?
-I want it

230
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,670
Unbelievably, he buys it without realizing it's his own teeth

231
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,770
He won't realize?
-So interesting

232
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,060
This must be a global first

233
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,640
Purchasing your own milk teeth

234
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,910
Lastly, the clothing area

235
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:04,000
About half of the clothes hanging on the shelves here belong to Sakai

236
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,820
Surely he'll realize now

237
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,510
Wow, so stylish!

238
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,640
Eh? Eh?

239
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,220
What is it?
-Eh?

240
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,420
Huh?

241
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,820
Am I at home?

242
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,190
What's the matter, Sakai?

243
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,590
You can't be at home

244
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,260
Eh？

245
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,390
Why do I have the impression that I have all of these?

246
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,190
Gross...

247
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,230
I bought this for, like, 60,000

248
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,140
But it can't be the exact same thing...

249
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,510
The size is also the same
-The size is appropriate?

250
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,230
He pulled something out?

251
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,850
Red LARK, that's what I smoke...

252
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,890
Even the cigarettes are the same?

253
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,890
Why'd you put it in the pocket anyway

254
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,420
This is too much of a coincidence

255
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,330
It seems that you and the previous owner have the same interests

256
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,490
This kind of thing...

257
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,170
Even the cigarettes you smoke are the same, right?

258
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,070
Can such a thing happen?

259
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,910
Unfinished cigarettes in the pocket?

260
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,410
Actually took it out

261
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,290
But I don't think it's possible that it is yours...

262
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,480
Yes, yes, indeed

263
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,890
But... the apartment I moved into has a lot of bad people around

264
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,220
You mean someone stole from you...?

265
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,480
If that's the case, it's too gross

266
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,500
But isn't it strange that it would be sold here?

267
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,280
Sakai realizes he may have been the victim of a crime

268
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,780
Finally, we added more significant items

269
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,240
That is...

270
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,280
A 20-year-old sweatshirt autographed by Ogura Yuko

271
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,590
I see

272
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,120
And then,

273
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,010
He is particularly fond of Yuko

274
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,850
What's going through his mind

275
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,900
What's up?

276
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,370
Really...really?

277
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,370
What's going on?

278
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,380
What is it, Sakai? Do you like Yuko?

279
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,680
You like her?

280
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,720
Isn't that good?

281
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,650
Good isn't... it's not good

282
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,690
Eh? Why?

283
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,390
Eh? Why is it here?

284
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,060
How much is it?
-2400

285
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,960
I don't get it, this is a bit scary... I'll buy this one first

286
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,920
No, this is your own

287
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,840
Buy... I bought... I don't get it

288
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:53,330
Sakai falls into a state of confusion and begins pacing back and forth

289
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,690
Scary scary scary!

290
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,080
Where is this store located?

291
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,380
It's in Ayase

292
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,050
Ayase, right? In Adachi...

293
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,120
Adachi...

294
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,690
What's wrong?

295
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,940
Does it matter where you are?

296
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,160
No... Adachi....

297
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,860
No, it's not, how should I... eh?

298
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,470
Not good
-Don't say what you shouldn't say

299
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,970
This kind of thing also happens, right?

300
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,970
It'd be strange if it did

301
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,480
This is not what businesses in Adachi do

302
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,450
And so, the imagination begins to flood the brain with negative thoughts

303
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:28,100
Just in case, Sakai purchased back all the clothes he could with the cash he had on hand

304
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,140
Yep, I bought a load of stuff

305
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,920
All of this only cost 9,000

306
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
So cheap!

307
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,820
An hour later...

308
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,420
You couldn't not be scared
-Completely empty

309
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,630
Eh？

310
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,030
Eh？

311
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,870
One hour after the end of the on-location shoot

312
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,480
You couldn't not be scared
-Completely empty

313
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,690
Eh？

314
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,090
Eh？

315
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,760
Eh?

316
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,660
Scary!
-Scary!

317
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,490
Nothing...

318
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,860
Nothing...

319
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,770
Eh?

320
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,470
Eh? What's going on?

321
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,470
Eh?

322
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,540
This is my house, right?

323
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,510
How would you have gotten in?

324
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,680
Faced with this radical change,

325
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,640
Sakai doesn't seem to be convinced that this is his place

326
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,990
Thought you were in the wrong house?

327
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,390
So scary

328
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,890
What's going on?

329
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,860
Huh?

330
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,030
Haaah...

331
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,370
Oh, no. Is he okay?
-Sitting down

332
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,440
Eh? There's nothing left

333
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,990
At last, we finally told him the truth

334
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,080
Absolutely nothing. Who are you? What are you doing?

335
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,050
What is this? How...what the hell is this?

336
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,050
This is my house, right?

337
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,890
This is my house, right?

338
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,290
What do you think?

339
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,460
Maybe not. Eh?

340
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,630
This should be my home

341
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,160
Because I used the key to get in

342
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,900
Ah, wait, eh?

343
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,700
Eh, no way! So gross!

344
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,100
Is this really the case? Huh? Because just now

345
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,000
I thought it was strange

346
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,440
I just went to a very strange place

347
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,640
It's not a strange place

348
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,710
Yuyu Market

349
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,290
Its not a strange place

350
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,650
Did something happen?

351
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,650
Ah, they all took it away?

352
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,880
The whole place is empty?

353
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,790
Sold it all? Sold to a thrift store?

354
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,720
Wait, that's weird...then I have to buy it back!

355
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,130
No, no, that's not the point

356
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,390
Why is your brain wired different to ours?

357
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,660
I need to buy it back quickly!

358
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,370
Oh but thank god, I thought i'd died

359
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,130
You thought you were dead?

360
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,540
When I was shooting on location, I thought, "Oh, I'm dying"

361
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,480
I thought I had died and someone was helping me sort through my belongings

362
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,350
In summary
you'll think your stuff has been stolen or you hung yourself

363
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,600
What nonsense are you talking?

364
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,330
So that's how it is

365
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,890
What do you all think?

366
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,830
A girl should be able to realize right away, right?
-Yes

367
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,660
One's taste and the feel of the clothes

368
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,060
Especially when wearing a jacket, the clothes would change according to their body type, right?

369
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,960
With this it should be obvious

370
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,970
You'd definitely realize
-Ah really?

371
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,430
Sakai is abnormal

372
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,670
Generally, you'd think seeing LARK cigarettes would be enough to realize it
-Yes

373
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,340
There are many strange aspects, right? Like buying his own baby teeth

374
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,440
It would be understandable if you knew that it was your own milk teeth

375
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,890
But he bought it thinking it was someone else's teeth

376
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,120
People don't generally buy other people's teeth, do they

377
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,690
What's he gonna do with it?

378
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,050
"I thought I was dead."
-"I thought I was dead."

379
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,750
Thought someone was helping him sort out his belongings
-On the way to the afterlife

380
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,680
Shouldn't have told him the truth and just kept watching

381
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,950
How he'll live after having already died

382
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,530
Let's welcome the next presenter

383
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,740
Who is it?

384
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,940
Please welcome, Football Hour's Goto!
-Thank you for having me

385
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,480
"Koching" isn't it, "Koching"

386
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,780
"Koching" has arrived

387
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,520
What the hell...

388
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,750
First of all, Hitori

389
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,990
Congratulations on "Asakura KID" being a huge hit!

390
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,990
※Film based on Takeshi Kitano's autobiography, released on Netflix last December and topped the popularity charts that week

391
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,720
That's awesome

392
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,530
Thank you everyone

393
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,890
Matsumoto-san also watched it
-Yes

394
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,860
It's wonderful

395
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,590
I think it only left out one thing

396
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,200
I wanted to see the whole thing with the axe

397
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,900
※Last September, Takeshi Kitano's car was attacked by a man with an axe, but fortunately, only the window was broken and the occupants were safe.

398
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,900
That would have to be a very long shot

399
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,630
How much longer do you want it to be?

400
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,110
Sorry...

401
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,940
It's a really outstanding piece of work

402
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,430
And there's a song that is featured in the movie

403
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,980
Also known as "Asakusa KID"

404
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,320
And so, this time I bring you a related theory:

405
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,720
Every comedian has his or her own "Asakusa KID"

406
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,520
This time, we found a few groups of struggling comedians

407
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,490
And encouraged them to compose lyrics pertaining to their current situation

408
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,100
To sing their own version of "Asakusa KID"

409
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,480
I see

410
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,280
For comedians, especially when they are young, it is common to experience hardships

411
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,730
Even Downtown, who quickly became big stars, also suffered, right?

412
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,680
Of course,

413
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,420
For about four years...

414
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,620
Three or four years of our lives were not great
-Yes

415
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,000
The period where you can't make enough to live on

416
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,380
That's right, that's right

417
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,120
And having to do part-time jobs on the side

418
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,720
Was there a period when you live on borrowed money?

419
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,810
We had to borrow money from ours seniors and so on
-Yeah

420
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,100
We borrowed from Momoko

421
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,300
Ah, Momoko

422
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,970
And Tomiiz helped us find work
-Ah yes, yes, yes

423
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,970
I didn't know what I was doing, but I just kept pressing a button

424
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,110
Inventory

425
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,880
It was probably sending Morse code to North Korea

426
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,640
No, it's not!

427
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,670
Now that's working for a living

428
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,720
The salary for a job like that should be pretty good

429
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,680
Oi!

430
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:09,820
Verify that all comedians have their own "Asakusa Kid"

431
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,090
For this theory, we assembled three groups of artists with more than 20 years of experience

432
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,170
A group of hilarious entertainers that still can't make a name for themselves

433
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,490
Firstly,

434
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,220
With 25 years of experience: AL-Shalaqani

435
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,560
Waiting for a bus next to you

436
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,800
Next sentence next sentence
-Pretending to be a clock

437
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,880
That's not something you can pretend to be!

438
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,480
Ten years ago, they were finalists in "THE MANZAI" for two consecutive years

439
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,700
They had stepped on the ladder to stardom

440
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,220
Please allow us to make an appearance on stage first

441
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,790
The work they get as comedians today

442
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,940
Is just a few stage performances each month

443
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,170
Do you have any work scheduled after this?

444
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,670
There is no more work

445
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,400
No more today

446
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,370
I should say there is no more after today either

447
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,670
We used to have about 20 shows each month

448
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,410
Now only 10 left

449
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,720
Or maybe less

450
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,420
Of course, we don't have any TV work

451
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,250
Although i'm not sure if it can really be considered income

452
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,560
What a place to do a close-up

453
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,120
About ten or twenty thousand

454
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,760
In all honesty

455
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,060
Mine is about three...four...less than 50,000

456
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,670
Formed in 1997

457
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,220
Even gonna shoot this?

458
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:40,280
Looking back, it's clear they've entered the later stage of life

459
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,270
Rent is 25,000

460
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,190
For these comedians who only earn tens of thousands of yen each month

461
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,120
Life is difficult

462
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,270
Meanwhile, Seiwa, who is in charge of writing, is already married

463
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,460
So, to secure a living

464
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,850
He acts as a lecturer to earn a meager income

465
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,970
Barely getting by

466
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,640
If the income could increase then of course i'd be very happy

467
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,210
But if it really worried me I wouldn't be with him in the first place

468
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:22,380
As long as I work a little harder to fill in the gaps, it is not a problem at all

469
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,380
Really nice wife

470
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,990
The main source of income for Shiro Aikata is part-time jobs

471
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Working at a bathhouse

472
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,640
From about 4:00 am to 8:00 am

473
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,970
Three to four days a week

474
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,640
I make about 60,000 a month from it

475
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,630
Because it is impossible to live like this

476
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,170
I also work in a curry restaurant

477
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,020
Opened by the comedian Makio

478
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,420
I'm the store manager of the Shinjuku branch of his curry store

479
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,430
A hard-working life

480
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,000
I once had to take out a very large loan

481
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,300
In total about 12 million
-The sum total

482
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,030
Total

483
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:17,670
Shiro owes a large amount of a large loan due to his exposure to pyramid schemes during his early days

484
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,870
When the loan had accumulated 4 million in interest

485
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,610
I cried and asked my parents to pay it off for me

486
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,560
Your parents sold a mountain, didn't they?
-Yes, they did.

487
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,950
50 years-old and still waiting for their big break

488
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,380
Although not an impossible task

489
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,530
Our lack of progress in the past few years is clear

490
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,930
And we're getting on in years

491
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,900
What exactly is the reason?

492
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,270
And what helps them to persist in a world which offers no guarantees?

493
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,080
To repay the kindness of those who have taken care of me, I just can't give up

494
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,250
We must also repay the kindness to our partner

495
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,090
Being finalists in THE MANZAI for two years in a row

496
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,190
That's entirely due to my partner

497
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,930
Not having been able to progress any further is my problem

498
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:16,290
I think it's because we haven't proven how interesting our style is

499
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:20,570
As long as my partner is still writing performances, I won't give up as a comedian

500
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,040
Sometimes I would like to say "why don't we just quit"

501
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,440
I think giving up before making it is unacceptable

502
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,380
25 years of total dedication to manzai

503
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,600
Step by step, they continue toward the future on the road of uncertainty

504
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,730
So, please enjoy this song by the two members of AL-Shalaqani

505
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:48,630
That performance where I met you

506
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:56,810
A layman named "Shiro"

507
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:04,150
You who were supposed to be the audience

508
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:11,120
You acted like an idiot for me

509
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:18,990
In a silent hall in Shinjuku

510
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:27,140
A performance hall with only nine audience members

511
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:39,210
Knights, Audrey and even Ujiko

512
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:46,220
Guys of the same generation have all made their mark

513
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:53,230
Thought there was no longer a place for us

514
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,810
As we were overtaken by Nishikigoi

515
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:08,240
Witnessed the reversing success of two fifty-year-olds

516
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:16,950
Although we always held the dream of "Someday"

517
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,490
I can't keep letting my wife...

518
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,390
Work six or seven days a week

519
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:28,100
You have to carry the family on your shoulders

520
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,600
This idea is deep-rooted in my heart

521
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,270
Rent...I'm really sorry for not being able to pay on time

522
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,900
I haven't been in touch with you
-Don't say that. It's okay

523
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,340
I'll definitely pay it off when I hit the big time

524
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,710
That would be great!

525
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:50,720
Don't say we aren't young anymore

526
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,490
That we've never had a taste of fame

527
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:06,230
Don't say we're worn out

528
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:14,840
That we've never had a taste of fame

529
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,600
What...what?

530
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,820
You want to win an award, or something?

531
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,090
I don't particularly want to win an award
-This show

532
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,960
It's pretty "eh----"

533
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:38,920
The next two artists who couldn't scale the heights of popularity are these two

534
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,630
With 29 years of experience, Nichokenju

535
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,780
Who's idea was it to perform this segment?

536
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,830
In recent years, if they've had the opportunity to appear

537
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,030
It's almost always with one of their wives, Yukiko Nonomura

538
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,500
However, in actual fact

539
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:10,360
The two of them were popular at Osaka's 2-chome theater

540
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,570
Super popular
-Yes

541
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,740
Unimaginably

542
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,710
Iconic and harmonious stars with an overwhelming power to attract support

543
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,010
People say we were fast for our generation

544
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,820
"You can't walk without causing a riot in the street," Jinnai used to say

545
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:33,120
"That's what popularity is" was commonly said

546
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,060
As long as we were on the performance list, the audience was almost all there to see us

547
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,820
So the two rode this momentum all the way to Tokyo

548
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,350
And even appeared once on the stage of the M-1 final

549
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,840
They were on track to become household names...

550
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:56,010
Although they are a year below me, I was really impressed by them

551
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,720
It's not over the top to say that they were the pillar of the 2-chome theater

552
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,250
After all, without them there would be no one to see

553
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,720
Thanks to their popularity, our generation is what it is today

554
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,330
Why didn't the two of them make a splash in Tokyo?

555
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,800
I think its down to pressure

556
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,530
"I don't have anymore strength, but I have to keep rushing ahead"

557
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,740
The popularity at the time was so high that they were forced forwards

558
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,610
Both Yoshimoto and the fans egged them on

559
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,140
If you enclose that with a circle...

560
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,910
Now, in terms of their current work

561
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:38,310
They have only a handful of stage performances left in a month

562
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:49,400
Manager

563
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,230
How much of their total work currently is comedy?

564
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:49,400
Comedy just accounts for about 30 percent

565
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,860
Kohori is the group's writer

566
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:00,860
His attitude toward manzai started to change about ten years ago

567
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,080
In response to this situation, his partner said

568
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:14,460
Kohori said "I'm here to entertain the public, so I need to try many things"

569
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,620
Although I understood his feelings

570
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,360
He puts equal effort into all of them

571
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,560
Manzai 1, music 1, rakugo 1, like this

572
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,300
Manzai 5, music 1, rakugo 1

573
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,600
If it was like this then l wouldn't have had a problem

574
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,410
Recently the number of people coming to see our performances has been decreasing

575
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,600
Armed with just a microphone to determine victory and defeat for 20 to 30 years

576
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,150
Kohori's heartfelt feelings are...

577
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:51,160
If only performing manzai was enough then i'd be very happy

578
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,660
But...

579
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:59,160
The reality is very different, I have four children and must rely on other jobs to support my family

580
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,770
Honestly, that's it

581
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:09,080
So...it's ready for today, right?

582
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,010
No... what do you think manzai is?

583
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,850
The reason why they won't give up manzai is...

584
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,700
The reason why I sometimes put them on the same stage with myself is

585
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,000
They're kind of in a transitional state

586
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,600
So I want to help give them the motivation to continue to work

587
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,510
It's like "I'll take the lead first"

588
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:46,850
Currently, his wife, Nonomura, who is active on television, is mainly responsible for the household

589
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:55,320
Letting Nonomura work alone

590
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,830
I think it is not a long-term solution

591
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:04,670
What she wants to see the most is for me to achieve something in manzai

592
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,240
So i'm am a bit anxious about this point

593
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,770
I don't hate Kohori

594
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,940
And I really like Nichokenju

595
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,210
If there's less and less opportunities

596
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,020
If you can't get on TV

597
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,820
Instead of becoming like that

598
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,890
We should take advantage of the time when people still know and remember us

599
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:36,500
Anything is fine, just do it, I think

600
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,440
I really hope that in the New Year he won't be at home

601
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,910
But instead, I can see Nichokenju on TV

602
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,750
Do you have any goals for the future of Nichokenju?

603
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,850
After all, we started our manzai career once already, so we need to restart once again

604
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,680
We must rely on our manzai talent to conquer everyone

605
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:01,390
Nichokenju's work is really interesting

606
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,820
But I think it's important to get the word out on the street

607
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,660
The two of us just really love manzai

608
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,030
However, our talent alone hasn't led to popularity

609
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,470
It's been 29 years

610
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,780
That's right, right? You want to conquer everyone with your manzai talent, right?

611
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,400
A once iconic group come back to face the upcoming half-century

612
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,760
With hope that one day their manzai talent will help them conquer

613
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,820
Please enjoy this song by Nichokenju

614
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:39,530
Met you at NSC

615
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,860
※Yoshimoto's Academy for the Nurturing of Comedians

616
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:45,870
With a playful outrageous attitude

617
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:53,140
Bit the bullet and reluctantly became a combo

618
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:59,280
And your scripts drew me into a vortex of laughter

619
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,290
After a while, we were already a regular member of the "Super Alloy" team

620
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,290
※Yoshimoto Super Alloy popular variety show that aired from 1997 to 2000

621
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:11,730
Double pistols with 100 rounds of laughs

622
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:24,070
Rode the wave to Tokyo

623
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:29,810
Pretentious and annoying

624
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:35,820
The idiot neither making a sound nor playing dumb

625
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,690
To be funny, "manzai is enough"

626
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:48,400
I believed that one day I could get ahead

627
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:55,300
However, the number of our performances is declining

628
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,740
By the 29th year

629
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,240
I still think "these two people are really cool"

630
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,780
Making people laugh brings happiness so I think it's a great job

631
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,650
Nichokenju are really great

632
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:14,060
I really hope I can keep watching them forever

633
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,520
In a large venue

634
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,960
Where I can't believe so many people came to see Nichokenju

635
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,500
I really want to create such a scene

636
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:31,170
Rakugo and the band, don't be too enthusiastic

637
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:38,580
On the stage, two people standing side-by-side

638
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:46,450
Don't stop writing

639
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:59,130
Of course, I still love your words the most

640
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,810
You really want to win an award?

641
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,580
It's not like that!

642
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,860
Next is the last group

643
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,000
Good morning

644
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,400
Good morning

645
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:17,560
26 years' of experience: BlackPinnerSOS

646
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,920
I've known them for a very long time

647
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,770
What do you think?

648
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,690
I intend to support them from now on

649
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,700
Starting now?
-Yes

650
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,600
Starting now...

651
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,290
Its also fine not to

652
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,870
Then why don't you just lie and say you're already supporting them?

653
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,910
How dare you say such a thing!

654
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:40,610
The third group of struggling comedians are BlackPinnerSOS

655
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:48,900
26 years ago, a 16-year-old high school duo suddenly appeared

656
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,350
Our live performances were very popular at Ota Production

657
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:56,020
It was hard to even get a ticket

658
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,430
"I called at the same time as the sale started but couldn't get through" or something like that

659
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,460
And there were unimaginable amounts of screaming

660
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,270
After the show, there were 20 to 30 people waiting outside

661
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:12,370
Girls followed us all the way from the performance venue to the station

662
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,850
1 2 3 Black…

663
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,070
With the advantage of youth and appearance

664
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:26,670
They flew head-first into the battlefield called "comedy"

665
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,630
Really evil location

666
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,230
That's it!

667
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:39,700
※VOCABULA Heavenly Kingdom - A super popular variety show hosted by Tamori from 1992 to 1999

668
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,700
Once VOCABULA ended

669
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:45,740
The number of programs featuring work like ours began to decrease

670
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,080
Later on, it became impossible to muddle through with a lack of momentum

671
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:56,700
After that, their high school student status disappeared and their popularity dropped

672
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,570
And they faded into media obscurity

673
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:06,630
The only weekly show left now is Mache Variety

674
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:06,630
※Live stream

675
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,660
Is it a webcast?
-Yes

676
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,970
Any work in theaters?

677
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:17,210
Performances are basically none now

678
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,960
The two men are now 42 years old

679
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,860
I'm coming!

680
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,500
You brought friends

681
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,020
Yes, friends have come over

682
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,810
Naito is the father of two sons

683
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,380
To protect his family

684
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,730
I am a professional mahjong player

685
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:49,900
Playing this game is my job

686
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:56,340
I play four-player mahjong on the internet, and when I log in this comes up on the screen

687
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,450
I play against players from all over the country

688
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:05,820
On the other hand, Aikata Yamano works part-time at an izakaya

689
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:10,660
At the same time he assists the running of his family's cosmetics store

690
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:18,170
I'm also preparing to take the judicial exam

691
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,470
A lawyer comedian,

692
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,670
I don't know if there is a precedent, but it seems to be unheard of

693
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,110
I wouldn't be a proper lawyer

694
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,760
But if the party is absent I would be able to get involved, saying "I object" and so on

695
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,980
Although i'm not sure yet...

696
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,680
"Caught vandalizing public property." "Caught and sentenced to how many years in prison."

697
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,020
Although it is not very clear...

698
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:43,260
But I hope I can use it in some way to help our comedy progress

699
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,160
The world of comedians clinging to their dream at all costs

700
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:55,770
Although I am considered to be a comedian

701
00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:01,880
But as i'm not so famous, when people ask, "What is your profession?" I can't answer "I'm a comedian"

702
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,450
Our writing or whatever has never really been acknowledged

703
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,720
Only we think we are comedians, but no one sees us as comedians

704
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,090
If you want to be a comedian...

705
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:25,070
I hope that one day I will be able to say "I am a comedian" without hesitation

706
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:29,470
After debuting at the age of 16, they fell back to earth after only four years

707
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:34,910
After that, they continued to lurk for the next twenty years, living a hard life as comedians

708
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,810
So, please enjoy their song

709
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:45,390
Met you in the first year of high school

710
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:52,290
The two weird guys in the same class

711
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:59,770
Caught the attention of TV shows

712
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:06,970
Became "high school stars" overnight

713
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:14,750
Signed by Ota Productions and became a favorite on VOCABULA

714
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:21,360
In the summer of 18 years old, the peak of life

715
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:34,840
After taking off our uniforms, our value plummeted

716
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:42,040
Abandoned by TV and banished by theaters

717
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:49,750
Now humbly playing on the turf of newcomers

718
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:56,520
And lived a life of being teased by Miyashita Kusanagi...

719
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:03,830
Living a life of of part-time work

720
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:12,140
In the spring of 42 years old, I lost my home

721
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:18,110
Because of their age, there's no way to participate in competitions

722
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:24,250
It would be nice if he could inherit this store that I have worked so hard on

723
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,360
After all, it's not good to say you're an comedian at 42 years old

724
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:33,360
If you're a professional mahjong player, then people think you're the type of a person that can hold down their job

725
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,930
That's what I say, but I always add a little note

726
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,800
That he's "also a comedian"

727
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:46,170
Even if the family worry

728
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:52,850
Please wait until I can be called an "comedian"

729
00:43:52,850 --> 00:44:00,250
One day I will be able to say it with a clear conscience

730
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,390
"Who are you?"

731
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:12,370
"We're comedians, you asshole!"

732
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,870
Thank you for watching!

733
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,480
That was a long one

734
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,140
Hamada-san has some thoughts

735
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,370
He kept saying "No, no, no" under his breath

736
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,790
The video was very well done

737
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,490
I just don't get why its quite often like this when you come

738
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:42,800
I don't know if you're trying to win an award or what

739
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,500
Just want to win an award, you asshole!

740
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,680
You think of me in such a way?

741
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,110
So, Hitori,

742
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,500
How do I say this...

743
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,840
Although I thought i'd feel very emotional

744
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,010
I actually wasn't really moved by it

745
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,210
No resonance at all

746
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,270
The last one, BlackPinnerSOS

747
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,010
We are really good friends

748
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,670
Met at the age of 16

749
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,550
I'm going to meet Naito later

750
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,230
We do a radio show together every week
-Oh really?

751
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:14,760
He's speaking as if he only has one live performance left every week

752
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,900
Why doesn't my broadcast count?

753
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,130
Its every single week!

754
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:23,410
Maybe they want to focus on how much it has decreased
-Show that they're having a hard time

755
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,540
So because of this I wasn't moved by it

756
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:29,000
But these three groups have been selected for this, so...

757
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,680
Very true
-Actually, it's...

758
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,580
They're very lucky

759
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,880
So they have some star power, right?

760
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,530
There are so many groups like them

761
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,400
So I hope more of them can get opportunities such as this

762
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,850
Indeed

763
00:45:42,850 --> 00:46:14,780
