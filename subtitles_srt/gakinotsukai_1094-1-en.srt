47
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,880
Well, it might not be a "big on thing..."

48
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,690
He really knows his stuff about iPhones.

49
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,990
Does he?

50
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,990
Yeah, he does mess around with it a lot...

51
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,960
Yeah, he does.

52
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,030
I get it, games...

53
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,060
Time for the answer.

54
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,030
He's always playing on it

55
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,260
I think seriously...

56
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,170
Matsumoto is in a different location and cannot hear what the 4 are saying

57
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,930
I'm counting on you...

58
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,130
What are you real big on right now?

59
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,940
Big on??

60
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,240
Just answer seriously.

61
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,240
This is tough for a first question.

62
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,880
Come on, Matsumoto-san.

63
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,310
Big on...?

64
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,650
Come on, answer seriously.

65
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,650
Please say "muscle training."

66
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,550
I wonder...
Well I guess,

67
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,350
muscle training.

68
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:53,960
-----------------------

69
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:53,960
A: Muscle Training

70
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,750
Alright!

71
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,750
You wrote "muscles."

72
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,950
No, of course I get the point.

73
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,950
Fantastic!

74
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,520
He's big on that? He's big on muscle training?

75
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,520
Yep, that's right

76
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,060
He was a bit embarrassed to say that though, wasn't he...

77
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,460
Yeah he was, it's probably because he does it so much.

78
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,630
I think it's (bleeped)...

79
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,930
Damn, he sleeps loads!

80
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,340
I know...

81
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,610
(bleeped)

82
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,770
He's answering so seriously...

83
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,770
He really is.

84
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,840
What...!?

85
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,010

Eh, what?

90
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,490
A complex?

91
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,790
I haven't got a clue.

92
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,890
Ah, I've got it!

93
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,520
Eh, a complex?

94
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,860
I have no idea...
Like "what he's self conscious" about?

95
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,900
Ah, yeah, yeah.

Endo: Chin    Tanaka: Thin Legs

99
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,400
Like when they draw those
mangas of him, he always has that.

100
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,000
That's true, his chin is always exaggerated.

101
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, they do exaggerate it.

102
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,740
Tanaka, what's yours?

103
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,970
Thin legs.

104
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,970
Thin legs...

105
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,910
You really do look at him, huh?

106
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,910
Well, yeah, that's what I thought.

107
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,340
I kind of get it.

108
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,650
Yeah, it's just my image.

109
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,650
You really are observant, Tanaka...

110
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,880
Time for the answer

111
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,650
I get you.

112
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,920
Matsumoto, what do you have a complex about?

113
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,490
I have loads, I really do but, what is it...

114
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,530
Tell us the most obvious one.

115
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,530
Right.

116
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,530
Yeah.

117
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,930
My educational background?

118
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,900
Well, I mean yeah that's probably it.

119
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,900
You're kidding!

120
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,870
Surely it's your chin.

121
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:20,440
-------------------

122
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:20,440
A: Educational Background

123
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,640
So that's how he's going to answer, huh...

124
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,640
Surely, your chin first...

125
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,770
He thought his educational background was...

126
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,610
What's with that?

127
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,440
His educational background?

128
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,440
He's never said that before...

129
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,080
What is Matsumoto's favourite type of pasta?

130
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,850
What is Matsumoto's favourite type of pasta?

131
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,090
I have no idea.

132
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:59,250
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

133
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:59,250
Q5: What is Matsumoto's favourite type of pasta?

134
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,550
I have no idea, Yama-chan has such a huge advantage here.

135
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,190
Right, Housei-san.

136
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,190
You go out and eat with him a lot, right?

137
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,260
God, this is annoying...
I have no idea in the slightest.

138
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,400
A pasta he loves?

139
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,430
I think Hamada-san, you might also
know what pasta he might like the most...

140
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,730
I do.

141
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,730
No, I'm not sure about that.

142
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,040
I get you...

143
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,200
Because, we used to eat and stuff together.

144
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,800
We haven't done anything together for decades...

145
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,740
Well, I guess.

146
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,740
Like we've not eaten together at all.

147
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,810
Like, you wouldn't eat pasta either now...

148
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,610
Well, I guess...

149
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,050
These kinds of things, I have no idea.

150
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,250

151
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,250

154

* Squid Ink Pasta

155
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,690
There was a time he would only eat this.

156
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,690
Really?

157
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,690
Really?

158
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,020
Time for the answer.

159
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,630
What would you do if it was some fancy-ass pasta...?

160
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,630
Matsumoto, what's your favourite type of pasta?

161
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,630
Yeah, like something we've never eaten or something.

162
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,300
Yeah, something we've never heard of.

163
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,070
This is really embarassing but probably meat sauce...

164
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:29,550
-------------------------------------

165
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:29,550
A: Meat Sauce

166
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,140
Alright!!

167
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,510
Huh?
I've never seen him eat that!

168
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,410
What's up with that?

169
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,040
Squid ink is a bit off...

170
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,040
Meat Sauce!?

171
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,550
Aren't you a bit embarrassed?
Saying like, "Oh, definitely squid ink."

172
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,550
You were so confident you were right...

173
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,150
Matsumoto, if you could only bring 1 item
to a deserted island, what would it be?

174
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,220
Matsumoto, if you could only bring 1 item
to a deserted island, what would it be?

175
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,460
What...?

176
00:04:38,220 --> 00:05:21,730
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

177
00:04:38,220 --> 00:05:21,730

1 item to a deserted island, what would it be?

178
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,490
What do we do?

179
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,400
I don't know how he'll approach this question.

180
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,600
We do talk about this kind of thing
when we drink together as well...

181
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,600
Yeah, right?

182
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,400
We do...

183
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,740
Yama-chan has an advantage...

184
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,740
Yeah, he does...

185
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,170
He probably does tell you these kinds of things...

186
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,610
There are things he says like, "Probably this..."

187
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,480
I see.

188
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,480
What was it again though...?

189
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,250
It goes through one ear
and leaves through the other...

190
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,280
You don't listen to him at all then...

191
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,280
Yeah, it seems like that.

I don't know...

196
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,790
I don't know either...

197
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,060
A pillow...?

198
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,930
I thought maybe he was one of those people
who can't sleep unless he has his own pillow...

199
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,400
That's it.

200
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,400
Time for the answer.

201
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,000
Geez...

202
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,270
It's a tough one, huh?

203
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,580
You know...

204
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,850
This is...
Is it OK if I

205
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,950
answer this question brutally honestly?

206
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,290
What the hell?

207
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,190
Like honestly honest...

208
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,290
What is he on about?

209
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,930
I wouldn't take anything...

210
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,190
That's...

211
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,700
I mean, it's not the time to be thinking that...

212
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,700
The question is, "What would you take...?"

213
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,800
No, no...

214
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,440
He's way too serious, what's up with this guy?

215
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:04,440
------------------------------------------------------

216
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:04,440
A: He would take nothing

217
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,270
He's so serious!

218
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,270
What the hell?

219
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,070
He's way too serious.

220
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,340
The question is "What would you take?"

221
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,610
He could have said something.

222
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,840
So, our answers are pointless to start with.

223
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,080
The question was "What would you take?"

224
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,350
Right.

225
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,850
He's taking everything into
consideration when answering...

226
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,520
Yeah, that's true.

227
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,990
He's really serious.

228
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,990
That's true.

229
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,630
Question 10.

230
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,400
At what time has Matsumoto been going to sleep recently?

231
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,700
At what time has Matsumoto been going to sleep recently?

232
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,570
As if I would know...

233
00:06:26,700 --> 00:07:11,840
------------------------------------------------------------------------

234
00:06:26,700 --> 00:07:11,840
Q10. At what time has Matsumoto been going to sleep recently?

235
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,570
No idea...

236
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,340
I have no idea...

237
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,870
Yama-chan has such a huge advantage.

238
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,140
He really does, he's with him
like the whole day sometimes.

239
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,150
He has such a huge advantage.

240
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,310
You guys must talk about it loads.

241
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,520
Back in the day, he would sleep real late.

242
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,580
Yeah, yeah.

243
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,190
But now, he's got a kid and all...

244
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,080
Yeah.

245
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,720
But I think around this time probably...

246
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,260
Reveal answers.

247
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,560
It should be about this, right?

-------------------------------------------

249
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:11,840
Housei: 11pm    Hamada: 2am
Endo: 1am    Tanaka: 2am

250
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,260
It should be.

251
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,300
Yeah, about this.

252
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,300
Yeah, I think 1 am.

253
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,470
No way, he has
dinner at like 7pm now.

254
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,540
Eh!?

255
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,370
But even so, there's no way it can be 11pm...

256
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,370
I honestly think he gets sleepy around this time.

257
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,840
Time for the answer.

258
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,180
Seriously?

259
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,180
Yeah.

260
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,950
About 2am right...?

261
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,950
This is like...

262
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,080
The time I sleep is the same.

263
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,750
Back in the day, I used to stay up a lot and stuff.

264
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,460
Now, usually...

265
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,660
1am.

266
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,660
2am.

267
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,190
about 2am, I think

268
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,760
OK!

269
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,760
Alright!

270
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,330
I think 2am would be right.

271
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,370
Yep!

272
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:41,400
----------------------------

273
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:41,400
A: 2am

274
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,370
Right, got it!

275
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,200
That's way too early.

276
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,500
11pm...

277
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,500
Do you think?

278
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,940
Yeah, that's a bit too early.

279
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,570
I'm usually fast sleep about this time.

280
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,540
I sleep at like 10pm.

281
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,140
At 10pm??

282
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,180
Yeah, 8 hours no matter what,
I have to sch-eep...

283
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,510
Sorry?

284
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,280
So close to saying it correctly...

285
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,280
What did he say?

286
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,450
At what time does Matsumoto wake up?

287
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,590
At what time does Matsumoto wake up?

288
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,160
Oh come on...

289
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,190
Well he sleeps at 2am right?

290
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:21,610

Q11: At what time does Matsumoto wake up?

292

Sleeps at 2am...

293
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,600
But you've got to think about
the fact he has a kid.

294
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,740
Yeah, but even so,
she's not at kindergarden yet...

295
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,370
I want to get this one right.

296
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,140
I get you.

297
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,610
It's got to be around this.

299
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,850
It has to be.

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,850
It's got to be, right?

301
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,180
Either one of these two.

302
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,180
9 or 10 o'clock.

303
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,290
Time for the answer.

304
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,190
Umm, this actually...

305
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,160
changes from time to time

306
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,160
I see.

307
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,800
But recently...

308
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,030
10am!

309
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,030
9am!

310
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,530
10am I guess.

311
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:52,740

312
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:52,740

313
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,170
Alright!

314
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,170
He sleeps so much!

315
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,410
Get in!

316
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,010
He does, 8 full hours.

317
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,010
True.

318
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
Who's Matsumoto's favourite young comedian(s)?

319
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,520
Who's Matsumoto's favourite young comedian(s)?

320
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,220
Eh, hold on, this is really difficult...

321
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:46,900
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

322
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:46,900
Q14: Which young comedian(s) does Matsumoto think is funny of late?

323
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,220
Wow yeah, this is real tough, huh?

324
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,520
Yama-chan, hasn't he told you
these kinds of things recently?

325
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,720
Yeah, he has...

326
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,630
Even if I know, I don't know if he still does...

327
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,030
I know right?

328
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,930
He did tell me this,
he told me recently in fact...

329
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,430
Ah, really?

330
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,430
Damn, you have a huge advantage.

331
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,340
Oh man, who did he say it was?

332
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,370
I can't remember at all...

333
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,880
Oh damn, what should I do?

334
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,740
I have no idea...

335
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,780
Who was it??

336
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,610

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,390
Peace is...

342
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,260
Nobukobu and Peace, he said..

343
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,430
I guess the point is
what he means by "funny."

344
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,130
He said like, "They're good, right?"

345
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,900
I see...

346
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,900
Oh, like that?

Matsumoto, who's your favourite young comedian(s)?

348
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,100
This is a such a tough one...

349
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,810
Well...

350
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,780
Wow, he's going to answer so quickly?

351
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,780
Like jokes wise...

352
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,180
It has to be Jaru Jaru.

353
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,180
Oh shit, it was them!

354
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,850
I got it!

355
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,950
That's who he said, he said them!

356
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,080
He likes Jaru Jaru's jokes?

357
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,720
When it comes to "stand up,"
I'm not so sure...

358
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,190
He did say it,
he said it last week...

359
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,260
Ah, really?

360
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:18,960
A: Jaru Jaru

361
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,420
You got it.

362

00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,730
So jokes wise, Jaru Jaru.

365
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,560
I got it.

366
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,760
It was at the Osaka's "All That's"...

367
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,500
Right, right.

368
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,870
Umm...

369
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:28,170

from rookies to veterans.

370
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:28,170
All That's Competition

371
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,100
At the end of the year?

372
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,700
Yeah, he was coincidentally watching it lately...

373
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,700
------

374
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,700
I see.

375
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,740
Hosei-san, you had a huge advantage.

376
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,740
So you knew this...

377
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,410
I did...

378
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,410
What's wrong with you...?

379
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,280
Oh damn, I'm so bad...

380
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,440
That one just now was a bit, yeah...

381
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,410
You should get more of these correct.

382
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,850
I was so wrong...

383
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:50,390
Sugi-Chan

384
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,820
Sugi-Chan.

385
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,950
Hamada-san thought it was him...

386
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,620
Like totally...

387
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,290
You were totally wrong.

388
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,390

"It has to be this size"...

394
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,270
That's true.

395
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,840
We have had these kind of conversations...

396
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,340
Probably about this...

397
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,880

Time for the answer.

410
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,200
Ah, geez, well...

411
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,700
I don't feel like anything
even if they had like F size...

412
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,700
Yeah, we know that much...

413
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,410
Well, I think it's got to be...

414
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,310
D.

415
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,410
I think.

416
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,410
It's D?

Well yeah obviously, but let's just
hurry up and answer the question...

449
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,610
Right, right.

450
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,410
Why...?

451
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,410
Why Ino Tadataka?

452
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,880
Let's ask him why...

453
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,880
Yeah, please do.

454
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,950
Please tell us, why do you
respect Ino Tadataka the most?

455
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:57,720
Well I don't understand anyone
who doesn't respect Ino Tadataka the most...

456
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,390
No, that kind of reply won't do.

457
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,020
I mean if you didn't

458
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,020
That kind of reply will not do...

459
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,260
we wouldn't have car sat navs...

460
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,330
I mean, his stoicism.

461
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,500
No, no, no...

463
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,570
The courage is amazing...

464
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,580
Isn't it Van Gogh...?

Does he not have a wallet or something?

534

have my wallet," and took money out of his pocket...

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,140
Bit much?

544
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,140
Time for the answer.

545
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,080
I just counted lately coincidentally.

546
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,650
Err, well...

547
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,120
about 180,000 yen...

548
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,720
Damn.

549
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,720
something thousand yen...

550
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
Damn, he carries a lot of money around with him

551
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,260
He really does.

552
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,960
Is that OK?

553
00:15:52,760 --> 00:16:01,870
------------------------

554
00:15:52,760 --> 00:16:01,870
A: 180,000 yen

555
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,860
Like 180 thousand...

556
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,770
I feel so pathetic...

557
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,140
He does have a lot of money on him though...

558
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,140
being so wrong

559
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,540
Who does Matsumoto think is most lame among the other 4?

560
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,310
Who does Matsumoto think is most lame among the other 4?

561
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,550
"Lame"?

562
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:21,260
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

563
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:21,260
Q24: Who does Matsumoto think is most lame among the other 4?

564
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,650
But I think this has to be...

565
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,580
I don't know...

566
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,580
I'm going to go for this...

567
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,890
Yeah, in actual fact...

568
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Reveal answers.

569
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,020
Eh, seriously!?

570
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,600
---------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

571
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,600
Housei: Yamasaki    Hamada: Hamada
Endo: Housei-san    Tanaka: Yamasaki-san

572
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,790
Like last week, he said.

573
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,600
He said last week.

574
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,600
Oh man, just say me...

575
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,660
Yamasaki.

576
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,170
Yes!!! I mean I shouldn't be happy about it...

577
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:37,670
---------------------------

578
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:37,670
A: Yamasaki Hosei

579
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,130
Come on, you can't be serious...

580
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,440
I wonder if he really thinks that.

581
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,010
But why you?
Let's ask him.

582
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,580
What is it about Yamasaki you find "lame"?

583
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,450
Hmm, well...

584
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,420
What is it?
There's a lot of things.

585
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:55,260
He got married and as he aged,

586
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,130
just became an ordinary old man...

587
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,800
Well, umm...

588
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,200
He's just got that "so normal" feeling...

589
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,970
I see.

590
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,740
Apparently Hosei-san.

591
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,740
Uwah, scary.

592
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,910
He's so pissed... Look at that face.

593
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,910
Uwah, woah...

594
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,780
After this

595
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,780
What does Matsumoto lack?

596
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,780
I don't want to be "lame."

597
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,750
How many pull-ups can Matsumoto do?

598
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,150
How many pull-ups can Matsumoto do?

599
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,660
I don't know...

600
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,660
Whaa...

601
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:34,160
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

602
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:34,160
Q27: How many pull-ups can Matsumoto do?

603
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,800
I think he can do that, but will he be able to right there...?

604
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,160
Reveal answers.

605
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,900
--------------------------------------
-----------------------------------

606
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,900
Housei: 20    Hamada: 12
Endo: 21    Tanaka: 13

607
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,470
I think he will go 10 and just want to stop there...

608
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,470
Potentially.

609
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,270
I think he will go 20...

610
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,270
Time for the answer.

611
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,180
Matsumoto is in a seperate room so cannot hear them

612
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,670
He looks like he's good at pull ups...

613
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,670
I see...

614
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,580
Oh, like this?

615
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,680
Ready, start...

616
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,710
His head has to go above, right?

617
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,790
Go...

618
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,790
It's tough.

619
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,130
Why can I see the white in his eye...?

620
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,130
I know...

621
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,800
He looks so stupid.

622
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,800
He really is.

623
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,930
He's doing well though.

624
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,240
He's starting to struggle though.

625
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,370
Look at his eyes...

626
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,010
His head isn't rising above the bar.

627
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,550
You better not count that one...

628
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,350
The right answer was 25.

629
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:36,420
--------------------

630
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:36,420
A: 25

631
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,160
Amazing, huh?

632
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,620
Sure is impressive.

633
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,960
Can't help that.

634
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,530
Question 30.

635
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,200
What does Matsumoto have a lack of?

636
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,100
What does Matsumoto have a lack of?

637
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,370
Doesn't he say something like this...?

638
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:54,110
--------------------------------------------------------------------

639
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:54,110
Q30: What does Matsumoto have a lack of?

640
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,370
I think it's this.

641
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,110
I think.

642
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,110
Reveal answers.

643
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,910
I think even at this stage...

644
00:18:54,110 --> 00:19:00,650
--------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

645
00:18:54,110 --> 00:19:00,650
Housei: Stature    Hamada: Money
Endo: Knowledge    Tanaka: Nothing

646
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,910
Really...?

647
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,050
I think he might say that.

648
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,050
I see.

649
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,490
Umm...

650
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,060
Probably that...

651
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,960
The ability to, like...

652
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,730
moderate...

653
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,830
Such a serious answer...

654
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,830
That's so deep...

655
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,170
I just can't do it.

656
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,900
The ability to moderate...!?

657
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:29,950
-------------------------------

658
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:29,950
A: The ability to moderate

659
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,900
That was so deep

660
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,510
Would you really answer
that seriously here?

661
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,980
Damn, that was so serious.

662
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,980
I mean, come on...

663
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,410
The ability to moderate?
I would never be able to write that down...

664
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,480
You've got to be kidding me.

665
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,120
I see...

666
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:42,690
Q32: What are
Matsumoto's
good points?

667
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,520
Probably the fact I don't have any bad points.

668
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,690
A: He has
no bad points

669
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,690
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

670
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,690
Housei: Finishes what they start    Hamada: Kindness
Endo: Impulsive    Tanaka: ??

671
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,220
I mean...

672
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,990
I would never get that...

673
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,060
Geez...

674
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:51,030
Q35:
What's Matsumoto's favourite fruit?

675
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,730
Peach.

676
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,900
You're kidding me!

677
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:51,030
A: Peach

678
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,030
The 4 didn't know anything about Matsumoto...

679
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,340
I've never seen him

680
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,200
----------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------

681
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,200
Housei: Mango    Hamada: Pear
Endo: Orange    Tanaka:Pear

682
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,170
eat a peach ever...

683
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,940
No way...

684
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,940
Not once...?

685
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:13,550
Q37: What is
Matsumoto's habit?

686
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,880
One after another, Matsumoto answers the question.

687
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,850
Like shaking my feet like this, both of them...

688
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,680
Apparently I do it in my sleep too.

689
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,550
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

690
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,550
A: Shaking his foot

691
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,550
Housei: Touching his nose    Hamada: Picking nose
Endo: ??    Tanaka: Always touching chest

692
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,720
I had no idea.

693
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,790
I had no idea.

694
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,790
I have no image of him doing that.

695
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:27,600
Q39: A show Matsumoto
must watch every week?

696
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,660
I mean right now, it would be...

697
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,200
Burari Tochu Gesha no Tabi.

698
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:27,600
* Travel show visiting places near public transport lines (1992 - Present)

699
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,600
A: Burari Tochu
Gesha no Tabi

700
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,170
I guessed it would be a travel show...

701
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:42,420
Q42: What's the most hurtful thing
a woman said to Matsumoto?

702
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:35,810
Like, "Oh I'm not interested in comedy...

703
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:40,350
God, when you make this person say normal things, he ain't funny at all!

704
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:42,420
A: "I've no interest in comedy"

705
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,750
He's too serious.

706
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,090
Even though he's funny when he makes jokes...

707
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:57,930
Q45. What is
Matsumoto's favourite street?

708
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,260
Who truly understands Matsumoto out of the 4?

709
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:57,730
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------

710
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:57,730
Housei, Hamada, Endo: 246 (Aoyama Street)
Tanaka: Old Yamate

711
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:57,930
A: Old
Yamate Street

712
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,930
And then the person to get the punishment will be...

713
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,870
What color attracts Matsumoto most for women's underwear?

714
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,940
What color attracts Matsumoto most for women's underwear?

715
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:17,550
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

716
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:17,550
Q47: What color attracts Matsumoto most for women's underwear?

717
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,750
I think...

718
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,820
I'm going for this.

719
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,990
Split, black or white...

720
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:26,030
-----------------------------------
--------------------------------

721
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:26,030
Housei, Hamada: White
Endo:, Tanaka: Black

722
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,320
Yama-chan, you're confident?

723
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,560
I am.

724
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,560
Really?

725
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
He loves it.

726
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,030
Really?

727
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,030
Time for the answer.

728
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,030
Yeah.

729
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,570
Well this has to be definitely...

730
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:38,040
not black or red.

731
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,070
Damn it, we're out.

732
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,340
Yeah...

733
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,640
But like weirdly...

734
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,410
I like beige.

735
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:53,390
A: Beige

736
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,390
--------------------------

737
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,990
Excuse me...

738
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,620
Come on man...

739
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,620
It wasn't white...

740
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,620
Beige??

741
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,620
---------------------------------

742
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,730
After this

743
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,730
What part of his daughter
does Matsumoto think is cutest?

744
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,620
I mean, beige, really...?

745
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,730
Beige...?

746
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,160

00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,170

751
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,340
What does Matsumoto think is cutest about his daughter?

752
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,950
What does Matsumoto think is cutest about his daughter?

753
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,220
I mean...

754
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:30,630
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

755
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:30,630
Q48: What does Matsumoto think is cutest about his daughter?

756
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,020
I haven't a clue.

757
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,630
Reveal answers.

758
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:38,500
------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

759
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:38,500
Housei: Eyes    Hamada: Smile    Endo: Smile
Tanaka: Welcoming him at the door when he comes home

760
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:37,430
Oh, Tanaka it might be...

761
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,500
I thought so.

762
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,440
It could be if he's going to be specific...

763
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,770
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

764
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah, like the whole "missing him."

765
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

766
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,270
Time for the answer.

767
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,270
Well, let's see

768
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,450
What do you think is cutest about your daughter?

769
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,190
Just answer normally.

770
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,190
I know, right?

771
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,390
You ask very difficult questions...

772
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,330
Just answer normally...

773
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,700
I don't think this is OK,

774
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:15,000
I should probably change this...

775
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,770
It's not good for a kid to do this but she does this...

776
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:25,150
And I know I should tell her off.

777
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,150
Yes, you should.

778
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,280
But it makes me laugh...

779
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,280
Seriously?

780
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:35,090
A: When she blows a raspberry

781
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,220
I have never seen it...

782
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,090
I guess even Yama-chan hadn't seen it before...

783
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,490
What did Matsumoto say to propose to his wife?

784
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,190
What did Matsumoto say to propose to his wife?

785
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,190
Next week!

786
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,260
Next week, the 2nd part of 100 questions about Matsumoto.

787
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,470
What an idiot!

788
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,800
Amazing!!

789
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,710
Alright!!

790
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:55,640
And something unbelievable happens...

791
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,510
I see...

792
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,520
And who will be bottom?

793
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,650
Finally, the conclusion!

794
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,550
Your complex?

795
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,550
My educational background?

796
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,660
You're kidding!
