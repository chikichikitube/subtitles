00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:07,480
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai: World Famous Heipo's - Comedian's House Sleepover!!

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,000
Yay!

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,550
So, today is about our Heipo

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,250
Known as World Famous Heipo,
30 years of experience as a producer

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,620

Yamazaki Hosei

12
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,960
He's not producing jack though

13
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,740
Well, that's true
- 30 years already?

14
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,620
Even the others told me it feels odd to have the producer here

15
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,620
Really?

16
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,280
I think he's been odd from the very beginning!

17
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,980
And I think we have to fix this oddness somehow

18
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,980
I see...

19
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,820
We'll have him stay for a night in a comedian's house

20
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:43,080
Heipo will stay for a night in a comedian's house
so he can learn how today's comedians are thinking

21
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:43,080
PLAN GOAL

22
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:43,080

23
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Are you kidding? We've done that?

24
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,960
It's true

25
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,120
I'm not kidding, that's true
- You know what? I want him to appeal more to our audience

26
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,120
Oh, I see

27
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,120
Makes sense

28
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,320
Do we really want to see him die a midget?

29
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,320
I'm not a midget!
- We don't

30
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,620
Sleepover in a comedian's house!!

31

And today, Yamada Yoshi from the duo "COWCOW" is going to make this Heipo plan happen

38
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:10,750
A certain place in Tokyo

39
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,980
Heipo, dressed in a tuxedo, heads towards Yoshi's house

40
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,520
staff) it's here

41
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,520
This one
- Again?

42
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,780
Is he inside this messy house?

43
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,480
Don't say that

44
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,620
We arrived at Yoshi's apartment

45
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,320
No it's fine, it's ok

46
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,820
You're always complaining

47
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,280
That's true, he complains a lot

48
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,900
Should I ring it?
- Please

49
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,480
Why shouldn't you?

50
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,740
Excuse me?

51
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,120
Aaaah! Sorry!!

52
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,760
You had a dog?!

53
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,400
Nice to meet you--

I'm-- going to stay here for a night, but...

56
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,080
- Oh, sure

57
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,280
I hate dogs...

58
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,780
I'm Yamada from CowCow

59
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,350
I'm Heipo, the World Famous

60
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,350

61
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,150
Is that his surname?

62
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,760
Thanks for having me for today

63
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,520
Excuse me

64
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:02,450
From this moment on, we'll film with the cameras set inside the house

65
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,020
From now on, we'll monitor Heipo with the cameras we set in Yoshi's house

66
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,650

Such a nice house

69
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,120
Nah, it's really small
- Whoa, two dogs?!

70
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,280
Is someone else there? Like, your wife?

71
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,280
Right now she's...
- Groceries?

72
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,150
She went out to pick up our son

73
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,150
Ah, you have children?
- Yes

And Heipo will live with them all, until tomorrow morning

88
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,680
That's incredible

89
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,250
It's just a normal house, is it ok for you?

90
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,820
- No it's fine, I'm sorry for disturbing you

91
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,020
Aaaaah!! Dog! Don't get close to me!

92
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,020
- What's wrong with you?

93
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,320
Oh my, I don't like them

94
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,080
Do they know that?
- They did

95
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,520
You sure it's ok for you to stay here?

96
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,950
Yes, I want to see the stuff you comedians are hiding

97
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,360
- Sure...

98
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,880
The stuff? What?

99
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,420
What was that? A dirty joke?

100
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,520
That's not it
- That sounded suspicious

101
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,280
Woof

102
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,360
Ah!

103
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,350
Oh, good morning

Thanks, so pretty!

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,280
She's Mayo, my wife

110
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,820
And you little miss... boy? Miss or boy?

111
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,120
I'm a boy

112
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,120
I thought he was a girl!

113
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,500
His name is Sakuharu

114
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,450
Sakuharu (4 yo)

115
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,180
Nice to meet you, Sakuharu!

116
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,950
He's so cute

117
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,050
I'm glad he doesn't look like you

118
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,050
That's rude

119
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,900
You're such a dick...

120
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,820
He looks like his mom

121
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,950
What was that for?

122
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,760
Sorry for the disturb
- Don't mind

123
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,080
Off to a bad start

124
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,120
Your wife is so young

125
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,520
She turns 29 this year
- In her 20s, huh...

126
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,880
I'm single so... she looks so fresh to me

127
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,880
Kids' room

128
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,120
Do you like kids?

129
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,950
That's a tricky question

130
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,420
- Oh, is that so?

131
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,720
A tricky question?!

132
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,420
To put it simply, he hates kids

133
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Don't say that!

134
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,960
They get really mischievous as they grow up

135
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,620
That's true

136
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,050
Aah, seems like he's having fun... ooh, so much fun...

137
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,440
The hell are you sayin'?

138
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,250
That's what a kid does
- In kansai dialect, too

139
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,120
He really likes soccer

140
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,120
A lot of kids do, actually

141
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,920
Wanna play soccer with him?

142
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,250
Soccer? How do I play it?

143
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,920
Saku-chan, let's play soccer

144
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,920
- How do we play it?

145
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,320
Go there, Saku-chan

146
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,850
Kick it over here

147
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,850
Like this?

148
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,260
Oh shi-- it flew!

149
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,240
Amazing! What a nice kick!

150
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Come on man, it's from a 4-years old...

151
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,240
- I'm ready here

152
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,160
Eh? What's this?

153
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,550
This is our cat's...

154
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,620
It's our cat's toilet

155
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,620
- You have a cat too?!

156
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,220
It rarely shows up

157
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,450
Do you like having pets? I'm no good at all

158
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,450
I used to be a pet groomer

159
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,020
I see... a pet groomer... and what is that?

160
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,550
Come on...

161
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,280
It's like a barber for dogs

162
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,680
Ah, a barber for pets, I see

163
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,680
- For dogs, cats and such

164
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,320
This whole day ain't gonna be easy!

165
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,580
So hot!

166
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,450
What?

167
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,770
And I jumped over it...

168
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,580
Woof

169
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,500
I'm home

170
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,020
Welcome back
- Hi

171
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,020
Right, his daughter

172
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,180
Nikori (6 yo)

173
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,520
She's Nikori

174
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,040
Miss Nikori?

175
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,180
I'm Heipo, nice to meet you

176
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,980
*nikori = smile

177
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,980
Nikori-chan? Eh? she's not nikori-ng that much!

178
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,780
- That's her

179
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,820
What the hell, man?

180
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,240
Haha, she's just tired
- She's nervous

181
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,720
I bet she hates him

182
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:38,920
The entire family is now together

183
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,720
And now, CowCow Yoshi's family is all together

184
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,650
He made such a bad first impression

185
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,650
- I had no doubts

186
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,350
Can he spend a whole day with his children and dog!?

187
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,690
But can Heipo spend a whole day, surrounded by things he dislikes?

188

Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

190
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,880
World Famous Heipo:
A major accident while taking a bath with the kid!

191
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,680
And that you do this...

192
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,420
Now that the whole family is reunited, Heipo starts to communicate with the kids

193
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Heipo establishes a contact with the children

194
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
What's this?

195
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,280
You use it like this

196
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,780
I must say, it's a wholesome view

197
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,380
Like this?

198
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,380
Yes, true
- Mh

199
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,450
Mayo appears holding a cat

200
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,680
He's irritating

201
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,820
Oh, here's the cat
- Here it is

202
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,580
Ooh!

203
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,880
That scared the hell out of me

204
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,420
Are you kidding me?

205
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,220
It's just a cat!

206
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,780
No way, it's just a cat

207
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,180
What's wrong with this house?

208
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,260
There's nothing wrong with it

209
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,020
stickers

210
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,780
Wait for me

211
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,520
Aaah!! That scared me

212
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,150
Eh?! What-- what's that?

213
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,450
Is there something? What? Eh? Wha-?

214
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,120
It's just a sticker

215
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,120
Ah, a sticker...

216
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,880
I thought it was a bug or something...

217
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,680
She likes stickers

218
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,680
I see, she likes to place stickers around

219
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,320
It's fine

220
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,120
You two should get closer, don't you think?

221
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,020
He's so cute!

222
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,460
You really think so?

223
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,460
You're lying, aren't you?

224
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,050
She's so cute too! They're both so cute!

225
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,320
Did Heipo overcome his dislike for kids?

226
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,320
A victory over his dislike for kids?

227
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,950
Excuse me...

228
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,380
Can I smoke a cigarette inside here?

229
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,380
- Actually here...

230
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,550
We don't smoke inside

231
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,840
It's dangerous

232
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,120
Should I just go outside then?

233
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,120
Of course, you dumbass

234
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,450
Alright then, I'm going for a quick smoke

235
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,450
stickers

236
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,660
He's full of stickers!

237
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,750
I'll be back soon

238
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,480
Just a few minutes

239
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,820
He ran away

240
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,750
I wanna go to Heipo's house!

241
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,960
- Whaaat?

242
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,620
He's interested in Heipo

243
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Heipo's house...
- What a turn of events

244
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,880
Heipo is having a smoke break in the waiting room for the staff, in the same building

245
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,450
Cigarette break in the staff room

246
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,920
Oh man
- He looks tired

247
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,980
Man, I'm beat up, this is gonna be long

248
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,760
Always complaining...

249
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,350
Can you stop filming for a bit?

250
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,350
Over and over

251
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,420
- As always
Sure

252
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:24,250
hidden camera footage

253
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,620
I'm gonna be fed up with it if it's gonna last for that long

254
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,480
We're talking about someone's kids here

255
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm already thinking I want to go home

256
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,880
staff) for now just stay for a night

257
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,250
A night!? That's so long!!

258
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,950
As expected, he doesn't like kids

259
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,960
Heipo's dislike for kids won't be cured so easily

260
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,680
(staying since 3 hours)

261
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,680
And it's barely been few hours
- Right

262
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,650
Do you guys play games more than you watch TV?

263
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,480
Well, we play a lot

264
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,780
So that's how it is when you have kids...

265
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,800
Hey, you want me to help?

266
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,380
What's wrong?
- It's fine, I'm almost done

267
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,020
It's time for dinner

268
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,020
Come sit here

269
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,780
Dinner menù

270
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,780
stir-fried meat and veggies, sweet & sour burdock root, meat & potato stew
salad, boiled black soybeans, miso soup, white rice

271
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,900
Looks delicious

272
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:57,200
The table is full of hand-made delicacies made by Mayo

273
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,000
Looks really good

274
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,340
Why are you holding a Mitsuya Cider?
- It's 'cause I like to drink it when I eat

275
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,820
But why a cider?

276
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,720
No one drinks it when eating
- I do

277
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,720
- It's time to eat!

278
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,320
Did you all eat already?

279
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,320
Not yet, we're about to

280
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,950
We're all eating together

281
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,950
Let's dig in

282
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm so hungry

283
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,020
Take as much as you want

284
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,020
- Sure

285
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,850
This is handmade, right?

286
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,850
- It is

287
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,830
Doesn't seem to be enjoying it...
- He's so irritating

288
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,880
I'm sorry to say this but...

289
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,980
If there's an animal nearby I can't eat at all!

290
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,720
I'm afraid their hair is going to fly around...

291
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,720
- Don't worry about it

292
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,320
Will you-- p-please, I'm-- I'm going--

293
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,080
I'm going for a quick smoke

294
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,080
- Sure, but, the food...

295
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,520
He barely eat anything and leaves

296
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,520
Are you kidding me?

297
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,620
You can't do that!!

298
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,280
I wonder why, huh?

299
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,280
What?

300
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,750
I wonder why

301
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,250
I dunno...

302
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,880
The staff goes to see Heipo

303
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,450
You ruined the atmosphere

304
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,450
- He's right

305
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,550
I can't eat in a place with so many pets around!!

306
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,980
Let's go back to Yoshi's house real quick

307
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,880
- No way, I'm done

308
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,280
He's heading to the staff room,
shaking off the staff's orders

309
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,720
He goes back to the smoking room, ignoring everyone

310
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:26,680
hidden camera footage

311
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,280
This is unbelievable!

312
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:26,680
Let's go eat at a ramen place or anywhere else,
I'm not eating anything in that house!

313
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,620
Heipo refuses to eat inside Yoshi's house...

314
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,620
Heipo firmly refuses to eat in Yoshi's house
because of his pets

315
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:42,650
hidden camera footage

316
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,950
He stuffs his stomach with some cup-noodles

317
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,200
- Really?
No way...

318
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,920
This is unbelievable

319
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,650
The kids are so lively too, how can I sleep in there?

320
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,940
Cup noodles and onigiri?

321
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,680
(staying since 4 hours)

322
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,640
It's 7:30 PM

323
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,960
And she made all of that...
- I like those

324
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,920
Heipo returns to the room, full thanks to the cup noodles

325
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,920
Back home with a full stomach

326
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,730
He won't let go of his Cider

327
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,040
He's making me so angry

328
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,520
He joins them without eating anything

329
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,400
Are you ok? You sure?
- Poor family...

330
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
It's so pitiful...
- Really

331
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,280
He didn't even help putting stuff in order

332
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,780
Niko-chan does her homework

333
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,300
Time for homework, huh

334
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,520
Heipo, if you want you can go take a bath first

335
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,740
- Oh, sure

336
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,450
Can I go first..?

337
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,820
- I've prepared a change of clothes for you

338
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,050
Heipo is the first one to take a bath

339
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,220
So disrespectful...
- He should have refused

340
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,780
Why before the others?

341
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,220
Hot!

342
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,650
I don't think it is

343
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,680
Don't cool it down
- But it was hot!

344
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,380
Really?
- Yeah

345
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,300
That mark is so small!

346
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,120
Guess it does the job
- So small

347
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,180
He gets inside the bathtub
without washing himself first

348
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,750
- Take a shower first!!
- So filthy!

349
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,220
Why did you get in like that?!

350
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,850
That's not how it works

351
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,850
I hate him!!

352
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,020
Careful--

353
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,050
I live alone,
that's how I do it
- It's not the same here!

354
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,850
So hot...

355
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,620
Come on, give me a break...

356
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,320
Look how much it's overflowing

357
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,580
Stop it already!

358
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,320
Oh!
- What's going on?

359
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Saku-chan joins the bath

360
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,740
It's hot here, you're ok with it?
- Let him in

361
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,680
Hot, isn't it?

362
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,280
It's hot...

363
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,280
Right?

364
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,630
You want me to cool it down a bit?

365
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,080
Oh! What's wrong?
- What now?

366
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,970
Whining

367
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,750
Everything ok? Saku-chan?
- Too hot?

368
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,370
Is it hot?

369
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,820
It's too hot for him

370
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,180
Mama? He says it's too hot

371
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,250
Is he ok? Ohh no way...

372
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,250
- It's fine, don't worry

373
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,250
Take it easy over there

374
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,280
Too hot for him, huh?

375
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,550
A 56-yo man at his wits' end

376
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,920
What was that for?

377
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,880
Are you ok, Saku-chan?

378
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,350
Wanna put some ice in? Sure

379
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,880
- I see what he's doing

380
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,880
Makes sense, right? Since it's so hot

381
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,880
Saku-chan comes back again

382
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,000
Let's pour some cold water in

383
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,550
It's a bit slow

384
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,550
Can you wash Saku-chan for me?

385
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,780
Sure thing
- I'm counting on you then!

386
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,580
They choose to censor Saku-chan too

387
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,220
Saku-chan's mark is bigger than Heipo's

388
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,350
See?
- You're right

389
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,050
Is it good now? Do you usually do this with your dad?

390
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,650
How is it? Are you ok?

391
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,420
He said it's good now, it's fine

392
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,580
Is that a toy gun?
- It's a toy

393
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,720
Gimme that

394
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,080
Doesn't that camera break if it gets wet?

395
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,220
It does, don't get it wet please

396
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,220
- Like this one here

397
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,250
I'll shoot it over there, ok?
- What is he talking about?

398
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,150
As a producer, he's
concerned about the cameras

399
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,850
Over there
- I'll aim there

400
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,380
Ah! You wet that other camera!

401
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,680
Oh shi-- swipe it up, please! It's a camera!

402
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
- You're an idiot!

403
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,920
What the hell are you doing...

404
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,460
I didn't see that

405
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,920
What are you doing?

406
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,920
It wasn't on purpose

407
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm sorry, but we can't wet that

408
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,480
But you're the one who did it!

409
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,480
- Well... right

410
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,080
Trying to blame someone 50 years younger

411
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,080
Sorry for that

412
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,480
Feels nice, huh?
- What now?

413
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,720
Now I wash it, like this
- That's right

414
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,050
Good boy, well done

415
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,960
- What am I watching?

416
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,220
Now we do the shamboom

417
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,220
What now?

418
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,880
I don't know anymore
- This is fun

419
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,520
No, on my head

420
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,570
On your head?
- He's saying he wants a shampoo

421
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,620
You want me to use the water gun?

422
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,250
No!

423
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,250
- No?

424
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,900
Of course not that
- He's dumb

425
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,220
Use this one

426
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,380
Really...

427
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,220
A 56-yo man making a
4-yo kid angry

428
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,220
Hurry up and wash his face!
- It's not hard

429
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,050
I'll do the head now

430
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,400
Here comes the shampoo! Close your eyes

431
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,300
Not inside his nose!
- That hurts

432
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,880
You made him cry again
- What are you doing...

433
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,420
Crying out loud, again

434
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,080
You can't just do that

435
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Something's wrong!
- It's so obvious

436
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,380
How many times are you making him cry?!

437
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,150
- It wasn't on purpose!
- You're the worst

438
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,420
I'm sorry

439
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,280
The same scene again

440
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,070
Sorry for that

441
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,280
- He hasn't cleaned up the camera yet
- Heipo made him cry again

442
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,850
You're right

443
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:10,050
But that brought a change inside Heipo's heart...

444
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,320
What now?

445
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,780
(staying since 5 hours)

446
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:21,320
Changed into home clothes borrowed from Yoshi

447
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,220
Let go of that, Saku

448
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,640
I didn't wash his head properly

449
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,920
'Cause that was a shower

450
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,950
I wanted to splash it from above, but...

451
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,620
You didn't even try

452
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,080
Excuses...
- All inside his nose

453
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,650
Wife and husband go out for a while

454
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,320
Yoshi and Mayo go out, leaving the three at home

455
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,080
I'd be worried
- Me too

456
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,680
The size of this is so big...
- Mom and dad...

457
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,880
Heipo and the kids

458
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,950
Said they went out to get a futon
- A futon?

459
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,130
Yes

460
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:47,850
But you were taking a bath before

461
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,080
Juice, please

462
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,540
This?

463
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,850
This one
- You want it cold?

464
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,080
Be careful, ok?

465
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,880
- I'm coming

466
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,220
Is it good?

467
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,400
Is this yours?
- Probably

468
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,650
You can have it, it's ok
- Hey

469
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,050
What's your futon, Heipo?

470
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,250
She said mama and papa went out to get it

471
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,620
Do you know AKB?

472
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,620
I know them!

473
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,750
I wanted to meet you, I wanted to ♪

474
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,280
No time to rest here, huh

475
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,750
- I love you, I want you ♪

476
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,420
I need you ♪
- Incredible

477
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,520
They're getting along, though
- Yeah

478
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,080
I wanna drink the chilly one

479
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,080
- Sure

480
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,450
Here's the chilly one

481
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,380
That can't be good for him

482
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:37,420
♪ Heavy Rotation

483
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,520
Here comes

484
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,420
Wanna dance? Come on, show me!
- She's not dancing

485
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:49,650
The pounding love in my heart is a heavy rotation!!

486
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,780
Haha, cute, very cute

487
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,780
Quick intimacy with the kids

488
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,280
Heipo is slowly shortening his distance with the kids

489
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,630
- Doesn't look bad now
- He's doing great

490
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,650
Scary

491
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,580
Eh? Is it?

492
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,380
Woof

493
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,360
Oh! Ah!! What--

494
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,720
Husband and wife came back

495
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,720
Oh it's you, sorry

496
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,180
I'm going to bed...
- Goodnight

497
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,280
It's bedtime for the kids

498
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,860
It's time for the children to go to sleep

499
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,950
I'm going out for a bit, ok?

500
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,480
Heipo goes for a cigarette break

501
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,080
Again?

502
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,620
What's his deal...

503
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:43,180
hidden camera footage

504
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,150
Oh boy, I've grown attached
to them in many ways

505
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,050
It happened

506
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,980
It's such a nice family!

507
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,360
His human side is showing
- It happened

508
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,180
Heipo's statements have changed

509
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,180
That's nice of him

510
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,220
(staying since 7 hours, 30 minutes)

511
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,260
It's now 11:00 PM

512
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,920
Heipo came back in the room without complaining, and not only that...

513
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,250
What's wrong? Aren't you sleepy? Come on, sleep

514
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,140
Oh! He's touching it
- I got used to it

515
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,920
He overcame his dislike for pets

516
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,920
He doesn't hate pets anymore
- Amazing

517
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:07,720
Now I'm completely fine
- And while Mayo arranges his futon...

518
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:07,720
While Mayo arranges his futon...

519
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,050
He checks Niko-chan's homework

520
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,180
This should be fine, but raise the
bar a bit and I have no clue

521
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,750
Are they sleeping with me? Oh, so cute

522
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,780
It's fine, I'm used to them by now

523
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,780
- Are you sure?

524
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,720
- He's really fine by now

525
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,080
Sorry for that, and thanks for everything

526
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,580
It's our pleasure

527
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,280
Goodnight!
- 'Night

528
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,080
Do you wanna come here in my futon?

529
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,580
Can they come here?   - Of course!

530
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,520
I see
- With you?

531
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,280
Look, they want to

532
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,280
- You're right, incredible

533
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,650
Take care of them, ok?

534
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,320
Ok but--

535
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,680
They took my place now

536
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,280
Really?
- Yes

537
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,380
- Didn't you hate that?
- It was fine

538
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,080
I guess I'll sleep here

539
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,360
They're following him

540
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,750
What? Now you're coming up?

541
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,800
They love him

542
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,800
Do you wanna be with me?

543
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,220
Here it comes, how lively

544
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,950
You're so friggin' clingy~ so cute~

545
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,950
Pick one!!

546
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,150
That's so un-cute!
- The hell?

547
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,880
A sudden change in Heipo!!

548
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,880
coming up

549
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,880
It's just disgusting!

550
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,880
(staying since 15 hours)

551
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:11,920
After sleeping surrounded by dogs,
it's time for Heipo to wake up

552
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,320
Saku-chan woke up early

553
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,120
Huh? Oh

554
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,520
Everything ok, Saku-chan? You woke up?

555
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,320
So early!

556
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,650
When is kindergarten time?

557
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,650
- Do you know?

558
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,920
I dunno

559
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,920
Ah, you don't...

560
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,400
Oopsie daisy
- Oh my

561
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,850
Pure love

562
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:42,380
The two spend some quality time
together before saying goodbye

563
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,580
I haven't taken a bath

564
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,580
- But you did yesterday

565
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,220
I did not

566
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,880
You did, with Heipo! Remember?

567
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
- And you said "it's so hot!"

568
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,280
Right?

569
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:59,420
The look of a father

570
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,280
His smile is the same smile a dad would have

571
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,480
(staying since 16 hours)

572
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,480
Only a few minutes left until it's time to go

573
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,420
Sorry for not eating with you yesterday

574
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,680
It's fine

575
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,450
And why you're ok with it today?

576
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,750
I'm ok now

577
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,220
Eating just fine

578
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,080
How does he eat?!

579
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,580
You're ok now?
- I am, yes

580
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,120
Heipo is going home after breakfast

581
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,380
Are you ok with it?

582
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,920
If so, come back tomorrow too

583
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,880
Maybe tomorrow I can't

584
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,680
What? Unexpected

585
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,850
And when it's time to go
an unexpected turn of events...

586
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,850
And now it's finally time

587
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,520
Time to say goodbye...

588
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,520
Goodbye kids!
- It's time for him to go

589
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,480
Saku-chan, you're going to school?
- Not yet

590
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,620
Nico-chan, a squeeze and smooch?

591
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,900
Sure

592
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,700
Let her hug you

593
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Squeeze and smooch?

594
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,450
- It's getting wholesome
- Oh my

595
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,450
Squeeze'n'smooch

596
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,080
It's Saku-chan's turn now

597
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,840
- Incredible...
- These kids are so nice

598
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,120
Here goes

599
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,650
Oh my god

600
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,680
Thanks so much for having me

601
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,150
Come back anytime you want

602
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,780
Thanks, I'm kinda moved to tears

603
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,530
Thank you for coming
- Thanks to you

604
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,440
Bye bye!

605
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,280
Oh boy

606
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,650
Bye bye!! They're all there--

607
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,180
This feels good

608
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,950
Heipo!!
- Bye! Be nice!

609
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,950
It's incredible

610
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,650
It's heart-breaking

611
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,580
I had no idea I would feel like this about it

612
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,620
What is it? Those kids were so... adorable

613
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,320
How should I say it...

614
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,650
I really want to have kids now!!

615
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,780
