WDT Project

4
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,690
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown everybody!

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,490
Okay, here is our first presenter, please!

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,330
Daikichi Hakata

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,330
Hello everybody!

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,370
I'd like to start by saying congratulations for today

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,110
An extremely good project was completed

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,110
Really?

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,180
The neck of this program has support from children

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,810
which is why it's been good

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,280
We're not really receiving support from children right?

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,250
Well then, where do you think it is?

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,250
There isn't any really

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,760
Well there should be a Junior Corner

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,960
where a small mixture of laughs are happening

18
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,960
That'd be hard

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,830
This time we'll be focusing on Elementary school students

20
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,230
We've been wanting that

21
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,070
Well let me ask you, have you every done a ding-dong ditch when you were small?

22
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,510
Ah, I've never done it before honestly

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,810
There wouldn't be many people who have

24
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,210
Well you say no, but how about if you pressed the doorbell on your friend's house and ran

25
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,750
You've definitely had those experiences, correct?

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,720
This program will be looking at ding-dong ditchers

27
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,950
but with an addition of mixed rules included

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,950
Mixed?

29
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,890
Here it is!

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,830
On the run from a Ding-Dong Ditch

31
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,900
This looks good for kids

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,600
The idea of an escape game was something

33
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,870
we thought of borrowing from a popular program

34
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,870
Just like that?

35
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,570
Could you do something properly yourself?

36
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,210
This was really aimed for children however

37
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,380
The neighbors will become Hunters and have 5 rules to them

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,620
The homes will have a doorbell

39
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,550
So the people inside the houses

40
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,550
They can't run away right?

41
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,090
As to whether there is someone there or not

42
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,560
There's a lot of game rules for that

43
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,560
So that's how it is

44
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,560
Coming up, will they be able to escape from the neighbor hunter?

45
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,830
The escape from Ding-Ding Ditch

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,570
Also..

47
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,740
The London Boots 1&2 as a duo name is lame, isn't it?

48
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,470
We'll look into the theory of the

49
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,080
lamest duo names, London Boots 1&2

50
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,580
Determined by the rankings of lame duo as chosen by young comedians

51
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,850
And then, Sachiko Kobayashi

52
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,590
will become Karashi Kobayashi, and we'll see if people will notice

53
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,590
in this installment of easily mistakable misread characters investigation

54
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,010
The escape from Ding-Ding Ditch

55
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,550
This time, the stage is a 3-story

56
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,450
99 room student dormitory

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,720
Amazing

58
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,620
all occupied by university students

59
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,620
All students

60
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,290
The occupants whose rooms are rung up will become the Hunter

61
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,260
who will chase down the Challenger

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
That's tough

63
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,830
On this day, about half of the residents were home, and the other half absent

64
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,910
This means that half of the rooms that will be rung

65
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,570
will not produce a Hunter

66
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,710
If you manage to escape the Hunters

67
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,880
If you are able to ring the doors of all 99 rooms

68
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,150
Would this even be possible?

69
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,150
you have surpassed the challenge

70
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,320
And now, the challengers

71
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,280
Ah, these people look right for it

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,280
who are confident they can run and escape

73
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,620
are these 5 people

74
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,320
In this escape, the plan was to go wait and hide

75
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,760
until the coast is clear

76
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,260
But eventually the number of people will increase right?

77
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,260
Exactly

78
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,000
Do you want to have a look inside?

79
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,000
I want to try and see

80
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,600
This challenge will be done individually, one by one

81
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,070
Everyone will get a preview of the architecture of the building

82
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,910
so that they can formulate a strategy

83
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,450
There's not a lot of blind spots, is there?

84
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,650
There isn't, right?

85
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,820
Once the hunters get their eyes on us, they'll have a habit of chasing after us, correct?

86
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,090
It'd be wrong to aim for the fences

87
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,520
You'll definitely be seen

88
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,290
Hey, this straight alley is really good, ain't it?

89
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,290
This alleyway

90
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,760
Not sure if it is good

91
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,760
You'll be able to get a lot of bell rings here

92
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,130
I'm counting on you to go first

93
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,130
I'll do it

94
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,900
Who..

95
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,130
How long does it take you to cover 100m?

96
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,400
Currently, it's about 10.6 seconds

97
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,400
Eh, this person?

98
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,400
That's so fast!

99
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,210
Appearing in a fake program

100
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,740
The former athlete and model

101
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,380
Moses Yume, from Amagasaki

102
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,680
For this fastest comedian

103
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,420
Oh, he's from Amagasaki?

104
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,120
who's undertaking the challenge in this building

105
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,990
There are few hiding spots, and room after room could be a trap

106
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,900
Our first challenger will be Sanshiro's Komiya

107
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,400
What's your plan?

108
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,470
My plan is to do the alleyway on the ground floor first

109
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,100
and do the sides straight after

110
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,640
Komiya will attempt to do the straight line section on the ground floor

111
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,750
Will his plan work out, or will it be a struggle for him?

112
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,680
This is so scary, but I have to go for it

113
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,490
This is impossible

114
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,890
I'll start from the end here

115
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,060
That's why you really should stop blundering

116
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,060
Yeah

117
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,160
So scary!

118
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,600
Ah I'm so terrified

119
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,370
It's too scary

120
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,040
Is doing that okay?

121
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,040
This might be good!

122
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,870
Wait, what's this now?

123
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,980
Oh no!

124
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,210
Ah that's impossible!

125
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,320
So fast! That one person was too fast

126
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,520
Isn't the hunter too fast?

127
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,690
Komiya, who had gone for the straight path on the ground floor

128
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,260
had quickly ran into a fast running hunter

129
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,360
There was no way

130
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,560
The first round recorded 7 rooms rung

131
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,000
Sorry, sorry, so sorry

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,440
That hunter in room 104 or something is unnaturally fast

133
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,830
He was fast

134
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,610
Is he the fastest out of the residents?

135
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,670
But they're just students

136
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,940
When I looked behind me, my eyes went bloodshot

137
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,080
Ordinary people will be able to tell from the TV

138
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Hey, you didn't even bring back any data for us

139
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,080
We can't use that

140
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,290
That why, I'm sorry

141
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:20,590
The next challenger is someone who has an established reputation in running, Non Style's Yusuke

142
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,190
Hey now

143
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,590
He must be fast

144
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,590
Awesome

145
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,690
Is that what he gets called?

146
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,930
I will, just from observing Komiya's run

147
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,730
do things a little differently

148
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,870
I'll head up to the second floor to press the button, then fall back to the first floor

149
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,010
then press a button on the first floor, and head down to the ground floor

150
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,610
If I separate the floors like that, I think that I'll be safe

151
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,510
That sounds great

152
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,510
Doing that method sounds good

153
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,480
So in other words, you're pushing the button and running away?

154
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,480
Stop that, you idiot

155
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,750
So brave

156
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:51,620
Going with the plan to separate the floors, and hiding from the Hunters on separate levels

157
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,590
This time, will he be able to escape the Hunters this way?

158
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,890
Just this time?

159
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,360
Then it doesn't matter if he gets caught

160
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,300
Ah, he's going for it

161
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,900
Ah, that's great

162
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,100
It's going great

163
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,750
First, he pressed on two of the rooms on the second floor, and quickly came down to the first floor

164
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,010
This might be good, really

165
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,350
He still has more to go

166
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,580
Then, returning to the second floor..

167
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,580
99 rooms, correct?

168
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,790
Oh, that's good

169
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,220
No one's there

170
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,690
He is able to get 2 more rooms

171
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,200
No one's home

172
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,200
No one came out, right?

173
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,870
They must be running away from home

174
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,340
It's amazing that there was no one home

175
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,340
I'm a bit tense that I'll have to run soon

176
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,170
As planned, the effectiveness of operating between floors for Inoue,

177
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,840
now moving onto the ground floor..

178
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,850
This area is dangerous

179
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,020
There's definitely gonna be one here

180
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,720
Ah there's one

181
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,940
Wow, he's fleeing

182
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,530
The hunter is a bit slow, maybe

183
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,670
This is.. eh?

184
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,670
That hunter's going very fast

185
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,670
There's already one on the first floor!

186
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,680
What happened to the one from before?

187
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:24,050
Shaking the hunter off, he is somehow able to hide underneath the staircase

188
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,620
They'll be looking for him..AH, like that

189
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,220
However, these two Hunters have their sights on Inoue

190
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,420
They're getting around

191
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,420
This is so bad

192
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,330
Ah, he's just walking around easily

193
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,260
He's not running at all

194
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,700
It's impossible

195
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,700
They're there! On the first floor!

196
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,200
The number will increase

197
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,710
Here, Inoue hides again underneath the staircase

198
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,680
However, a Hunter comes down from those stairs where he's hiding

199
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,790
Keep hiding, stay hidden!

200
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,320
This is bad

201
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,400
He must've heard him nearby

202
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,960
No way, no way!

203
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,800
Even with his skill of running and hiding during the Ding-Dong Ditch

204
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,070
he leaves with a record of 6 rooms

205
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,780
The next challenger will be Nana Suzuki

206
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,980
It's scary, really it's so scary

207
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,820
I can't press it, I'm so scared, what do I do?

208
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,550
Nana Suzuki's special skill is "Being filmed the longest"

209
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,990
I'll press it and run

210
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,960
It's there, it's there!

211
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,070
She's more troublesome than the Ding-Dong Ditch

212
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,370
She's a nuisance

213
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,370
Following on..

214
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,440
Yes, yes, keep running

215
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,480
It's fine

216
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,740
Where did she run off to?

217
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,010
After pressing the doorbell just once, and running far away while screaming

218
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,290
This is Nana Suzuki's 'Hit and Away' strategy

219
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,890
What the heck..?

220
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,420
And then, going back up a floor

221
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,460
This one shouldn't come out

222
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,290
That one should be empty

223
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,930
I'm scared.. AHHH!

224
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,300
No, I'm scared

225
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,500
No one came out

226
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,770
There's no one

227
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,240
Good

228
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,210
She's doing good

229
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,870
She's going back?

230
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,940
Staying near the stairs

231
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,110
I'm scared, should I press it?

232
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,310
AHHH!!

233
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,690
Ah, hide. Go hide!

234
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,490
That's scary, very scary

235
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,040
No, no way, get away

236
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,440
Secured

237
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,840
Why did she press it?

238
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,710
It was terrible, I was blocked off there

239
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,740
No more!

240
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,250
Chased away by the hunter

241
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,480
and on her way back, Suzuki Nana gets trapped

242
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:17,120
lastly, pushing another button

243
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,360
It was terrible, I was blocked off there

244
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,260
And now looking at the three challengers so far

245
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,460
It's still so bad

246
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,430
the aim for highest record is still anyone's game

247
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,240
And now, our next challenger is Shoji Tomoharu

248
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,070
Consolidating all the information from the three unsuccessful attempts

249
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,180
they aim for the homes that are absent of Hunters

250
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,650
The plan to empty out the nest, how will he succeed?

251
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,090
This one is okay, there's no one in there right?

252
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,090
No one

253
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,760
There's no one

254
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,920
He can do it

255
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,930
Just in case, he went away anyways

256
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,990
He's getting startled

257
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,230
The next target is the empty residence at the end of the second floor

258
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,580
Ah this one is safe

259
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,980
Yes, good good

260
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,550
Having the information compiled up to now as a basis

261
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,250
Shoji stacks up points from the absent houses

262
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,520
Yes, relying on this

263
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,760
This one is fine

264
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,600
However, this young man

265
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,500
A hunter had come out from the room he thought was absent

266
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,340
So there was one

267
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,610
However he is able to pass through the hunter to the first floor

268
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,580
And then..

269
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,640
He's good

270
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,310
This one will have one too

271
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,480
So scary, cool

272
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,450
There was one in there, run, run!

273
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
She's coming

274
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,550
So there was one there

275
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Geez, what were you doing?

276
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,300
There was one there!

277
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,500
Not noticing the hunter that he was defeated against, he had soon been captured when he turned back around

278
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,170
So there was one there

279
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:18,010
However his record, now sitting at the top, is 18 rooms

280
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,650
Who captured you, the girl?

281
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,650
The girl

282
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,750
So that must mean that I was, probably here

283
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,750
I can't calm down anymore

284
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,820
Exactly

285
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:33,620
And lastly, the final challenger, who's gotten the most experience about the hunters, Moses Yume

286
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,660
Ah, so he knows about Hunters

287
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,660
Experience with Hunters

288
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,090
I'll try my best, there's 5 I know for sure I can securely ring

289
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,500
And then, I'll get all the hunters to traffic each other

290
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,530
You'll create some traffic?

291
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,530
Yeah, I'll be trying that

292
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,500
I'll be going at it like a Black Panther

293
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,140
"Going at it like a Black Panther", What kind of situation has him imagining such things?

294
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,050
"In any case, I'll try my best" he says. What will be the result of this?

295
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,650
In any case, I'll try my best

296
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,920
Starting from the corners

297
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,620
They are..

298
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,590
Not home

299
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,860
If they come out, it'd be pretty bad. He's being too light-handed about this

300
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,860
He's being too light-handed

301
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,160
He's confident about his running abilities

302
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,160
This one is not home

303
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,800
This one was tried out previously

304
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,800
Not home

305
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,970
Starting off with the homes he's got a grasp of,

306
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,240
Moses clears 5 homes

307
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,840
It's scary how calm he is

308
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,970
All right, after this I am unsure of

309
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,940
Shall we do this?

310
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:32,050
From here on, we will see the fastest man in the world of entertainment

311
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,650
The result?

312
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,390
No one's pressed this one yet

313
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,930
They came out

314
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,160
It was a girl, right

315
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,160
It's a girl

316
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,600
That's a dangerous place to be

317
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,970
If he takes a look behind him, they'll be chasing him

318
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,570
If one comes out, it'll be dangerous

319
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,570
He's pressing it

320
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,440
He's coming, danger!

321
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,780
After this, I'm just gonna rack it up

322
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,480
He's being carefree

323
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,220
As expected, he's fast

324
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,450
So fast!

325
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,590
He's quick!

326
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,770
He's going quickly

327
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,670
Is he pressing it? Oh, no way

328
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,040
That's good. he can do it

329
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,040
This area is big

330
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,180
The man who would not lose to anyone in a one-on-one

331
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,110
Moses Yume

332
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,880
Currently, with 19 successful rooms rung

333
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,950
And with merely 4 Hunters released

334
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,120
A big record is expected to appear

335
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,460
Oh no!

336
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,990
However..

337
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,230
This is bad

338
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,060
It's bad, it's bad

339
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,270
You're gonna get caught between them!

340
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,470
Oh no

341
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,270
It's terrible

342
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,080
That's not how I imagined you'd get caught

343
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,680
Just like Nana Suzuki, who was caught up in a dead-end

344
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,120
He finishes with a 22-room lead

345
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,220
This is just impossible

346
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,260
True to the Black Panther, he was quick

347
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,960
That's cruel

348
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,860
But his head was a bit slow to bring around

349
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,890
Don't say such silly things..

350
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,230
With all the data we have on this side

351
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,900
you didn't use it just now?

352
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,770
I only remembered this side

353
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,240
Ha ha, I don't have a brain

354
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,840
What did you even mean when you said "I'll traffic the hunters"?

355
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:40,680
As expected, with all the might of one person, going for all 99 rooms proved to be impossible

356
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:46,580
So, while we're here, we'll have the 5 people take on the challenge at once

357
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,220
Shoji, Inoue & Moses will start on different floors

358
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,590
and take on the straight line approach

359
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:57,930
while the remaining two, Suzuki and Komiya take on each of the other sides

360
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,140
Will the 5 people be able to clear the 99-room challenge?

361
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,840
Get ready..

362
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,610
Start!

363
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,440
I don't know, I'll press anyways

364
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,010
Oh no, no way!

365
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,120
Don't press it, don't press

366
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,520
Gotcha

367
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,230
No one comes out of those rooms

368
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,670
Wow, it's paying off

369
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,640
Ah, he's hit a dead-end

370
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,640
Oh no, oh no!

371
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,010
No way out of it

372
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,820
Ah they came out

373
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,460
There's quite a few there now

374
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,830
Without noticing the Hunters from the other floors, Suzuki Nana is captured where she stands

375
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,230
The only one's left are Moses and Shoji

376
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,840
Run, run!

377
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,440
Ah so bad

378
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,680
Impossible

379
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,880
Caught like this again?

380
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,980
There was no way to escape

381
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,010
Definitely doesn't have brains

382
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,750
Soon after..

383
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,760
In total, you pressed 40 rooms

384
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,760
About half

385
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,430
21 rooms on the second floor,

386
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,960
9 rooms on the first floor,

387
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,260
and 10 rooms on the ground floor

388
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,630
I really wanted you to do more

389
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,470
My blood was burning up, I'm sorry

390
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,540
What even..

391
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,570
But really, what kind of blood do you have?

392
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,040
Carnivores, the blood of carnivorous hunters

393
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,040
Ah, so only running?

394
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,380
Oh, shut up

395
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,080
Ah, so that's how it is

396
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,250
It was a little bit too difficult, right?

397
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,020
It was difficult

398
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,450
Maybe not 99-rooms, but setting about half as you goal

399
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,390
and having the residents that come out from the rooms

400
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,630
be seniors

401
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,830
Exactly

402
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,060
Like, grandpas and grandmas

403
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,700
Our next presenter is..

404
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,580
It's Kotoge from Viking

405
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,150
What's so funny?

406
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,890
I didn't think of anything

407
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,620
Please think of something then!

408
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,090
Start thinking, and we'll get along

409
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,030
So we can enjoy each other, you should give me a welcoming

410
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,360
Are you a soybean?

411
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,360
No I'm not!

412
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,930
Just a one-off thing, sorry

413
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,500
What's with you coughing right after making such jokes?

414
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,100
Sorry

415
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,100
No big deal

416
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,970
Today, I bring you a theory about

417
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,640
the names of comedy duos

418
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,180
Here it is!

419
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,250
Theory: The lamest comedy duo name is "London Boots a-1 a-2"

420
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,850
That's not true! (Note: That's his comedy duo name)

421
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,850
It's true.

422
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,690
That's not true at all.

423
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,340
Consider it for a moment.

424
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,650
A comedy duo called "London Boots a-1 a-2" is lame as hell!

425
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,420
It's tacky!

426
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,050
So dated it's from the Stone Age.

427
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,390
You don't think it sounds cool?

428
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,430
I kind of get a feel for what you mean.

429
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,430
Right?

430
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,470
Even just the "London Boots" part is tacky.

431
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,470
Uncool.

432
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,560
On top of that they have to say it like "And a 1, and a 2"!

433
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,510
London Boots 1 2 has to be the lamest duo name ever!

434
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,510
Shut up already.

435
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,580
You think "Viking" is that much better?

436
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,520
The "VI" part is in katakana and the rest of it is hiragana. Wth?

437
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,290
Ah, yeah, that's lame innit?

438
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,280
So lame!

439
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,700
Look at your own name for lame!

440
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,790
No, no, you're wrong.

441
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,790
He's right.

442
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,080
Yeah, it's true.

443
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,260
There is a meaning to it and before "Viking" WAS all in katakana

444
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:57,770
but my partner Nishimura said, "'Viking' could also sound like 'bike', isn't that nice?"

445
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,880
So that's why.

446
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,980
So there IS a reason to it, lame as it is.

447
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,540
"London Boots and a 1 and a 2" has NONE.

448
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,710
Everyone is saying so.

449
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,200
Why are you so quick to agree?

450
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,020
My own mother is always saying the same thing.

451
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,040
Are you kidding me?

452
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,740
With that said, does anyone here have a comedy duo name they think is lame?

453
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,660
"King of Comedy"

454
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,200
Oh, King of Comedy! Right.

455
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,940
Why that name?

456
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,500
It's quite lame.

457
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,040
Sorry! It's all I could think of.

458
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,420
That's perfectly fine.

459
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,810
I think the television broadcast wanted to hear that

460
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,800
The lamest comedy duo name is London Boots a-1 a-2

461
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,980
This time we asked 200 young comedians to answer a survey asking for the lamest comedy duo names

462
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,040
This is how the ranking was made

463
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:14,320
Will London Boots a-1 a-2 really top them all?

464
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,640
First up is #10 on the lamest comedy duo name ranking

465
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,640
ANZEN Manzai

466
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,260
This duo is currently popular thanks to Miyazon's airheaded character

467
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,780
Looking at the surveys from young comedians

468
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,100
"Simply put, 'ANZEN Manzai' is just a lame name"

469
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,700
Manpukufu-fu Matsumara Hormone

470
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,280
Who the hell is that?

471
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,710
"Why would you put 'manzai' in the name of your duo? Uncool."

472
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,140
Shining Stars Hirota

473
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,480
"I've never seen any comedy duo desperate enough to announce they do comedy in their name"

474
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,960
Kagishippo Sachi

475
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,690
Everyone commenting have tacky names themselves!

476
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,540
We went to tell the actual duo the results...

477
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,360
In a survey of "Lamest Comedy Duo Names"

478
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,510
ANZEN Manzai ranked 10th

479
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,620
ANZEN Manzai ranked 10th

480
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,270
Why's that?

481
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,200
It's in upper case letters even.

482
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,470
Isn't using two alphabet systems cool?

483
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,810
There isn't another comedy duo that does that.

484
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,110
Why is it bad?

485
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,450
You felt it was cool?

486
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,450
We did think it was cool...

487
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:29,920
We can't go wrong with English letters and kanji together..

488
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,960
It's kind of like food, I guess?

489
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,890
Why did you guys go with the name "ANZEN Manzai"?

490
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,560
We thought it sounded great at first

491
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,130
The sound that starts from the "N"

492
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,230
Like "Downtown"

493
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,230
We thought having the same pattern would help us sell

494
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,840
Then added Anzen(safe) to "Manzai" like it's a brand.

495
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,080
Since we wanted to be a 50-60 type bet with our manzai

496
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,750
It's a safe bet and good fun

497
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,320
We wanted to give off this kind of feeling.

498
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,720
A wonderful explanation. Coming up in the lame comedy duo ranking in 9th place

499
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,020
Ameagari Kesshitai (Post-suicide rain squad)

500
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,300
The surveys from the young comedians that came in say...

501
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,500
"Since they are popular everyone got used to the name, but it still sucks."

502
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,370
- Mikazuki Manhattan's Nakamine

503
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,240
That's certainly lame.

504
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,380
"I don't understand the meaning and it's difficult to say."

505
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,580
"If one of my juniors had this name I'd encourage them to change it."

506
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,620
- Tokyo Haco Club's Boutique Ayumi

507
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:37,660
There were people who said it was good the duo is popular, but the name is lame.

508
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,280
And in 8th place?

509
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,630
Ushiro City (Back City)

510
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,220
"Trying too hard to be romantic just makes them sound lame."

511
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,360
- Semi-Retire Itou

512
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,840
"Their choice of expression is lame."

513
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,470
- Crab party's Nakayama

514
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,340
"Their choice of expression is lame."

515
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,660
- Crab party's Nakayama

516
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Onto the 7th place in the ranking

517
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,650
Saraba wa seishun no hikari (Gone is the light of youth)

518
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,240
"Higashiguchi used to be my senpai in a university club."

519
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,990
"I remember when the duo picked their name. Everyone in our club's faces turned pale."

520
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,300
- Charming fried rice's Kawahara

521
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,400
Onto the next one. Who is at 6th place?

522
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,540
London boots a-1 a-2

523
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
6th place!

524
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,540
6th place, really?

525
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,780
Hey, 6th place is still bad.

526
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,440
And just like that the theory was disproven.

527
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,650
"[And] a-1, a-2 is the lamest thing ever omg."

528
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,720
- Tokkibutsu's Ota

529
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,240
"Who is 1 and who is 2? Asking who's who is lame."

530
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
- Tsukurokun

531
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,920
Well, there are cases like that..

532
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,080
It troubles them.

533
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,000
Other information we have regarding this matter are..

534
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:01,810
"When you come out asking Who is 1 and who is 2? there is no incentive to answer."

535
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,920
Semi-limited Express' Kubota

536
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,680
Next on the "Lame Duo Names Ranking" in 5th place is...

537
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,420
Fruit Punch

538
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,050
Fruit Punch unfortunately ranked 5th

539
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,220
We've done it.

540
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,200
Of course "Fruit Punch"
is a lame name!

541
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,220
Whaat? No way!

542
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,530
We have a written comment

543
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,160
"It sounds like something you tack onto a festival name as an after thought"

544
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,240
The person who wrote this

545
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,640
was Secret Sniper's Mr. Fujiko.

546
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,480
From Secret Sniper..???

547
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,080
Fujiko did??

548
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,410
His portrait looks like a wanted poster.

549
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,480
What is the meaning behind the duo's name?

550
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,050
We thought it was nice how fruit punch can make kids smile.

551
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,860
Like at a birthday party when there's
fruit punch, there's smiles all around.

552
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,730
Do you get what I mean?

553
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,920
In the Lamest Comedy Duo names Ranking, next on 4th place is

554
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,620
Koro koro chiki chiki Peppers

555
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,370
4th place

556
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,740
That's quite high

557
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,010
So what's the origin?

558
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,180
What it means is

559
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:18,050
We kind of thought that "Red hot chili peppers" were cool...

560
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,790
We thought it was a long but a catchy name.

561
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:26,220
Now we're being called korochiki but

562
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,230
I kind of like it though.

563
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,800
We kind of disputed over what name to pick.

564
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,400
Nishino won a rock-paper-scissors game with "korokoro chikichiki peppers"

565
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,570
What name did you want us to have again?

566
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,640
"Mitarashi" (Seems to be)

567
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,640
Hella lame!

568
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,460
We have finally reached the top three of "Lamest Comedy Duo Names Ranking", However, before that...

569
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,340
Young performers picked the top 10 Coolest Comedy Duo Names.

570
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,260
Below the top three are as shown.

571
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,840
At 9th place is "Gone is the light of youth" who ranked 7th in the lamest.

572
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,100
We wanted to show them the results.

573
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,620
And when we did..

574
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,640
Oh really?

575
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,240
It's kind of like a "lame but cool" scenario, huh?

576
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,170
This is a new genre for sure.

577
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,510
What is the origin behind your name?

578
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,550
The origin is that

579
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,610
From Peamans' Standard comedy duo,

580
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,280
I get along with with Minamikawa.

581
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,150
When we got together to form our duos,

582
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,760
he said, "I'll make something for you."

583
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,400
"Write down 2 movies you saw yesterday and choose 1."

584
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,800
"Gone is the light of youth" and "For me to take revenge"

585
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,040
Through elimination, we were left with "Gone is the light of youth."

586
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,720
Coming in at #3 on the Coolest Comedy Duo Names Ranking

587
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,460
Tokyo03

588
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,020
#2 was

589
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,420
Chidori

590
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,020
due to the names' simple & smart sound

591
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,780
And so, the #1 comedy duo that young performers voted as having the coolest name

592
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,700
Good morning.

593
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,820
Mornin'.

594
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,660
Yasei Bakudan (Wild Bomb)

595
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,370
In the Coolest Comedy Duo Name Ranking, you guys were #1.

596
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,640
Why's that? No one else was cooler?

597
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,940
Whaat? It's that cool?

598
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,850
"THE PUNCH" seems like a cooler name, I feel like.

599
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,380
"THE PUNCH" sounds hecka cool.

600
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,580
What the heck are you saying, Rosshi..

601
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:40,990
With that said, how did you guys come up with "Wild Bomb"?

602
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,090
When we were around... 15 years old?

603
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:49,200
For our school's cultural festival we wanted to do a skit.

604
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,540
We were practicing the skit by Lake Biwa

605
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,510
and an old man we didn't know came to us.

606
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,870
He suddenly pointed,

607
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,740
saying, "Wild Bomb."

608
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,110
So then, when we returned home

609
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,810
I thought, "What a weird guy.."

610
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:08,790
Then 5 years later I was watching Yoji Desu Yōda

611
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:13,060
and the guy that was hosting it was Matsumoto Hitoshi-san

612
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,360
So we're like the duo that Matsumoto Hitoshi-san picked

613
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,230
Then about 15 years later we met,

614
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,880
He's lying so much

615
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,070
he was like "Oh you came back home"

616
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
"You came back home"

617
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,240
Matsumoto-san said "You came back home"??

618
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,540
This guy really pisses me off

619
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,750
Returning to "Lamest Duo Name Ranking",

620
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,320
At last, we announce the top 3

621
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,620
First, #3 is

622
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,960
Ari to Kirigirisu

623
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:49,360
A veteran duo that made

624
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,560
a breakthrough on Vocabula Tengoku in the 90s

625
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,430
I don't like that they used "to"

626
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,200
If they used "to" (in hiragana), then it wouldn't have been bad

627
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,500
says Metro Tengu Miyama

628
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:05,840
Others have also chimed in about the lameness of the "to"

629
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,980
The duo has since ended

630
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,780
and are working successfully as individuals

631
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,450
The "to" that caused a commotion no longer exists

632
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,920
That's an unfavorable way of expressing that

633
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,960
Now, #2 in "Lamest Duo Name Ranking" is

634
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,230
Batsu Gun

635
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,670
The way we have to read the "X" as "batsu" is lame

636
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,970
Says Kaoiro Yoroshi Waroshi Tsuzuki

637
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,910
It's hard to understand at first

638
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:38,680
The fact that we have to read it as "batsu" is asking too much

639
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,680
Says G-pan Panda Ippei

640
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,780
"Batsu" and "to" put aside,

641
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,390
On to #1 in "Lamest Duo Name Ranking"

642
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,590
Doubling 2nd place's score

643
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,720
Is this duo

644
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,090
Lamest duo name that the younger comedians chose

645
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,060
#1 doubles 2nd place's score

646
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,570
is this duo

647
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,470
Hello, good afternoon

648
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,470
Non Style

649
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,580
Non Style-san, you guys got #1 in "Lamest Duo Name Ranking"

650
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,680
Why??

651
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,650
You guys shone through all the others

652
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,190
I don't think we're #1 in that...

653
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,650
Pretty lame

654
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,850
I guess so, it can't be helped

655
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,920
The reason why they think it's lame

656
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,660
"For having a name that insinuates

657
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,230
not having a style and being open-minded,

658
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,330
the comedy skits are very structured and obstinate"

659
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,300
Said Onion Gorilla's Hosono

660
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,070
Who is that?

661
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,340
The most popular sentiment was

662
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,640
"I don't like how they use English to act cool"

663
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,210
Using English can be pretty lame, yes

664
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,280
Said Dog Rhino Beetle's Adachi

665
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,220
Okay so who is that? He has a weird name

666
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,990
That's actually clever!

667
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,390
What was the name's back story?

668
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:04,130
I had a band that I really liked at the time

669
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,430
called "Hi-STANDARD"

670
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:12,040
I really liked them. They were called "HiSta" for short

671
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,970
So I wanted to make it "Something-something- sta"

672
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,840
If it were to be abbreviated

673
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,910
Then, after doing some research

674
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,650
We read that having "N" in the name will be successful

675
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,950
Then let's have something that has a "N" and ends with "-sta"

676
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,120
Then we came up with NON STYLE

677
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,760
Ugh, That's all so lame

678
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,530
Therefore, NON STYLE's name and back story was super lame

679
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,600
Non Style huh...

680
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,370
Now that you mention it...it's pretty lame

681
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,910
By the way, What was going on with "Wild Bomb"?

682
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,780
Those guys seriously need to watch what they say

683
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,940
They kept lying SO much

684
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:58,580
Who the hell would take a stroll along Biwa Lake?!

685
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,880
What did you think, Ryo-san?

686
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,050
6th place, huh

687
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:07,120
I was wondering if we were going to be in there somewhere

688
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,690
I just had a feeling somehow

689
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,690
I actually understand Ameagari(Post-suicide rain squad)

690
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,600
Ameagari is terrible

691
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,870
To me, they're #1

692
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:20,340
They're comedians but have the word "death" in their name!

693
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
That's crazy huh

694
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,570
The "Suicide squad" is just so disgusting

695
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,840
Now that you mention it..

696
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,680
And that he has a bowl cut...

697
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,310
Up Next

698
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,420
Gathering theories from around the world

699
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,020
It's "The viewer's Theory Corner"

700
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,520
Tonight's presenters are

701
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,160
Daiyan!

702
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,160
We've come to leave our territorial scratch marks

703
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,430
You guys both have irritating faces

704
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,140
We have good faces

705
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,210
We have good, comedian-like faces

706
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,610
It's rare to see a duo with both mono-lids

707
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,510
No I have double eyelids

708
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,280
Who cares

709
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,580
I have double eyelids

710
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,750
No one cares!

711
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,520
What do you mean no one cares!

712
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,520
You're the one that brought it up

713
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,920
Everyone, last time we had the

714
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,160
"No one would notice if the word "Sagami" got switched to "Sumo" Theory

715
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,230
Takeyama-san was-ah the one-ah that presented that

716
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,130
Why are you talking like a baby?

717
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,430
I'm always like this

718
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,270
That's pretty problematic if you're always like that

719
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,170
I'm always like this

720
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,170
Yeah, the usual

721
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,980
Takeyama-san presented this

722
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,710
But I disagree

723
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,750
Takeyama-san, you're wrong. There's more than that

724
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,650
Tonight, we bring you this theory

725
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,220
"No one would notice if Kobayashi Sachiko got replaced with Kobayashi Karashi (Mustard)" Theory

726
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,360
Urg....I don't know

727
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,090
This is it!

728
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,100
This is for sure

729
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
This one is more probable

730
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,930
I often write her name wrong like this too

731
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,800
You write it?!

732
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,000
Kobayashi.

733
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,000
Where would you need to write her name down?

734
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,310
Even she herself wouldn't notice

735
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,510
The opposite might happen too. Trying to write mustard, but writes Sachiko instead

736
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,210
I bet that happens

737
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,020
Like when I try to write "Ou Yang Fei Fei" but write "Ou Yang Nira Nira" instead*

738
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:17,620
*Ou Yang Fei Fei is a Japanese Taiwanese Singer

739
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,020
That doesn't happen

740
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,520
Now, let's see the VTR

741
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,690
VTR..

742
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,490
Now, let's take a look at the VTR

743
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,260
VTR GO GO !

744
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,640
Theory: No one would notice if Kobayashi Sachiko got replaced with Kobayashi Karashi (Mustard)

745
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,570
Theory: No one would notice if Kobayashi Sachiko got replaced with Kobayashi Karashi (Mustard)

746
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,910
With that said, this time

747
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,320
Kobayashi Sachiko team has fully cooperated with us

748
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,550
Seriously?

749
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,920
Helping us change concert programs and posters

750
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,830
from Kobayashi Sachiko, to Kobayashi Mustard

751
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,360
Oh, I see

752
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,800
Would the customers notice?

753
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,800
Wow they really helped us

754
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,100
That's an actual poster

755
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,500
Ehh but this is...

756
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:07,800
Senior citizens start to arrive minutes before the concert

757
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,610
But these people are all fans!

758
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,140
However..

759
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,240
It IS her name

760
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,110
Is this for real?

761
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,820
They probably only look at her face

762
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,620
They don't show any signs of noticing

763
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,650
And among those fans,

764
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,590
So low, low!!

765
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,530
there are some that don't even see the poster entirely

766
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,200
Completely out of their peripherals

767
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,130
This is really bad ya know

768
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,540
So now, we try

769
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,810
directly asking the fans

770
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,240
Are you a fan?

771
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,740
Yes, I'm a fan

772
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,380
A fan of whom?

773
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,350
Kobayashi Sachiko-san of course!

774
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,820
There's a poster behind you

775
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,250
Nice, isn't it?

776
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,220
See, she's only looking at the face

777
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,490
Sacchan is so nice

778
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,360
Is there something odd about this poster?

779
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,860
Weird? No there's nothing weird about it. It's amazing

780
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,430
I've been watching her ever since I was little

781
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,770
Even for someone that's been a fan since her younger years,

782
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,800
she doesn't notice the "Karashi"

783
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,570
We continue to investigate

784
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,480
Looking at the poster, do you see something off about it?

785
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,180
Nothing odd about it, still the same as before

786
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,020
As she is, beautiful

787
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,990
What do you think about this poster?

788
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,650
It's so amazing, Sacchan. So beautiful

789
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,160
It doesn't say Sacchan!

790
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,590
What do you think about this poster?

791
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,690
It's very nice, I kind of want it

792
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,230
A person who has noticed has not been found yet

793
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,730
Now, we try to give them a big hint

794
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,700
What do you think about the letters?

795
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,710
Letters?

796
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,340
Letters....

797
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,110
Is it like... written with a spray?

798
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,450
Not one person has noticed the "Mustard"(Karashi)

799
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,090
At this point, the theory was quickly confirmed

800
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,720
Ah, that's true

801
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,790
Just in case, we tried the opposite situation

802
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:16,000
"Karashi Mentaiko"(Roe and mustard) at an onigiri store

803
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,540
was changed to "Sachiko Mentaiko"(Roe and Sachiko) to test the theory

804
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,000
Now this has some awkwardness to it

805
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,210
Yeah, this feels more weird

806
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,740
Would they notice?

807
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,450
Welcome~

808
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,960
Karashi Mentaiko Cheese..

809
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,790
It goes unnoticed

810
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,160
And further,

811
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,060
Karashi Mentaiko Cheese

812
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,570
Karashi Mentaiko Cheese

813
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,670
It's selling so much

814
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,410
The cheese is bringing all the popularity

815
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,740
However, no one notices "Sachiko"

816
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,040
What does this one say?

817
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
"Fresh and tasty,

818
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,250
spicy mustard cod roe...

819
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,200
Is what it is, yes

820
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,480
Is this something different?

821
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,620
We figured no one would notice if

822
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,690
"Karashi Mentaiko" got changed to "Sachiko Mentaiko"

823
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,780
Oh you're right!! It's Sachiko Mentaiko!

824
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,530
Did Sachiko-san make this??

825
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:28,280
This Sachiko has nothing to do with it

826
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,870
And after this,

827
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,910
we validate additional word changes that can go unnoticed

828
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,960
And now,

829
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,940
we test other phrases that can go unnoticed when changed

830
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,730
First up,

831
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,580
No one would notice if "Toilet"

832
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,000
got changed into "Tray"

833
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,220
And when we open the "tray" door, inside

834
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,480
you see a bunch of trays

835
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,040
Are they stupid

836
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:16,560
Will people really notice?!

837
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,890
It actually says "tray" huh

838
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,430
Completely passes by, and goes into "tray"

839
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,820
And then,

840
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,630
Tray?

841
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,680
She completely read it, but mistook it

842
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,470
Tray?

843
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,130
Where were you headed?

844
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,800
Tray....

845
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,940
A bunch of trays...it looked like "toilet"

846
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,600
And next,

847
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,030
Trays huh...

848
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:15,560
As suspected, the level of difficulty of "toilet" to "tray" is extremely high

849
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,020
Tray huh..

850
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:21,880
The success rate was 100%

851
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,680
Misread Series: Up next is,

852
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,090
"budou" (grape)

853
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:32,490
turns into "hofuku" (crawl)

854
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,560
"Yamanashi Hofuku" and,

855
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,300
"Seedless Hofuku"

856
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,370
Will there be anyone who notices?

857
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,410
I'll have two of these small grapes over here

858
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,960
It went unnoticed

859
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,020
And further,

860
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,180
Which one did you purchase?

861
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,710
These over here

862
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,020
What are they called?

863
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,220
"seedless grape"

864
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,490
Which ones were you thinking of?

865
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,490
These "grapes"

866
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,440
I was thinking of buying them

867
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,500
"Grapes"?

868
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:00,500
Yes

869
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,640
This kanji says "budou"

870
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,590
Right? It says "budou" right?

871
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,490
It says "Hofuku"

872
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,400
Ahh so that's what it is

873
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,030
There's the "army crawl"

874
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,600
What does that have to do with grapes?

875
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,880
We were thinking no one would notice

876
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,210
if we changed up the words

877
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,320
That's it?

878
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,520
That's it??

879
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,250
She has a point

880
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,880
She really told us

881
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,900
We just ended up disappointing her

882
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,320
Either way, no one has noticed the "hofuku"

883
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,650
And yet,

884
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,390
2 young men lingers around "hofuku"

885
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,160
we inquire them for further information

886
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,250
We're from Taiwan

887
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,250
Taiwan?

888
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:57,210
A Taiwanese person who only uses Chinese characters

889
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,020
Surely, would these people notice?

890
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,680
Can you tell us what this says?

891
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,140
Yes, we can

892
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,820
"Budou"

893
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,820
"Budou"

894
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,000
The same

895
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,350
The same kanji

896
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:16,170
A prank that works even for Chinese people

897
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,010
Now trying the opposite,

898
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:22,720
would people notice if "Hofuku" turned into "Budou"?

899
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,560
This time,

900
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:29,560
newbie comedians that were called to simulate Lincoln's annual Sports Tournament

901
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,660
challenges in an obstacle course

902
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,880
And what awaits them at the end is

903
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,460
"Budou Zenshin"*

904
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:48,760
*Supposed to be "Hofuku Zenshin" which means Army Crawl

905
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:46,080
The objective is to reach the grapes at the end of the course

906
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,780
in this simple prank

907
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,990
Will they read it as "hofuku" as we suspect?

908
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,530
They wouldn't think anythings going on

909
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,270
Hofuku?

910
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,960
Hofuku? Oh okay okay

911
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,230
Army crawling!

912
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,730
As expected, it was impossible

913
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,300
What was that last thing you guys did?

914
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,160
Army crawl

915
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,720
What did the sign say?

916
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,090
It says "hofuku zenshin"

917
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,920
Eh, what?

918
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,770
Well it actually says "grape crawl"

919
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,500
It's a new activity where a grape is the goal to the obstacle course

920
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,290
We just got super dirty

921
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:39,980
for like no reason!

922
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,370
The black guy was like "It says grapes"

923
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,840
Black guy...

924
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,160
You should be the #1 person to miss it

925
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,010
Did you notice that?

926
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,910
Yeah it clearly says "grapes"

927
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,770
You should be the one to not notice!

928
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:54,260
Where are you from?

929
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,260
Uganda

930
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:58,640
In conclusion, Ugandans are very sharp

931
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,870
What did you guys think

932
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,870
The guys didn't notice huh

933
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:04,630
It even says in such big letters

934
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,600
Do you have anything else where people might mistake words?

935
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,300
You know the F-Liner Train?

936
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,220
F-Liner, yes

937
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:16,350
The Fukutoshin Line

938
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:19,160
That always sounds like "Ukraine" to me

939
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,950
Oh it sounds like it

940
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,950
Yes, it sounds like it

941
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:22,650
Not, it looks like

942
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,500
We're doing the ones that "looks like"

943
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,070
Sounds like is something different

944
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,070
We wanted something where you can misread it

945
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:29,490
Well...

946
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,410
It's better than not saying anything

947
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,510

00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,060
And then,

960
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:13,790
Theory: Even if someone is wearing your belongings, you won't really notice it

961
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:19,450
We test this theory by bringing many personal items from homes

962
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,600
and also, Theory: Mr. Osu says "osu" even when he's sleep-talking
