00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,600
Aw man, I'm stuffed

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,960
Alright, let's go! Get in

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,720
Oh yeah!
- Wait a second, you

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
What?

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,090
Can't you see this?
It means you can't park here

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,440
Oh, my mistake...
- This isn't ok

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,960
I'm sorry
- What were you...?

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,000
We were having breakfast
and now we're off to kindergarten

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,060
And that's fine, but this is no place to park in
- It was only for 30 minutes

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,540
It was 30 minutes, right?
- Forgive us

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,020
Rules are rules, show me your license

13
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,680
I see...

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,360
Can't we do something about it?

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,460
I don't think we can
- Aw, don't say that

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,160
Don't let me say it again, your license

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,060
Let's see...
- Bang!!

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,240
Don't kill her!

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,220
It's just a joke! A joke
- Quiet, kids

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,160
Check that out

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,530
Can I have it back?
- Here's your fine

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,460
Make sure to pay it within the next 2 weeks
- Shut up, ugly

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,040
Quit it, and make sure to pay up

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,380
Alright, got it
- Just do as we say

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,860
By the way, do you wear seatbelts?
- Of course, everytime

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,780
Is that so? Good
- Yes

27
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,760
Ok, shall we go?
- Oh, wait

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,760
The US president will land soon nearby
Can you show me what's inside your trunk?

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,130
Can you...?
- Huh?

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,130
Can't we just... go?

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,610
After you show me what's in your trunk

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,540
Alright, I'll open it

33
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,210
No, no, I didn't ask to see your engine

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,450
That won't help us
- Oh, I see...

35
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,180
What we want to look at is your trunk

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,230
Mister, you're sweating a lot
- It's nothing

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,200
Can we see your trunk?

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,110
What now?

39
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,490
May I...?
- Ah! Don't take my key

40
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,500
We're only checking your trunk

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,420
Ah-- wait--
- Are you hiding something?

42
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,470
No, I've got nothing in there...

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,090
Looks like you got something big here, huh?

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,330
Huh?

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,360
Something big, huh?

46
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,440
Not that much...
- What's this?

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,070
It's Hamashou
- You have Hamashou, huh?

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,220
Look at this and tell me what it is

49
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,560
It's... Hamada Shogo

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,400
Hamada Shogo, am I right?

51
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,200
And why are you carrying this around?

52
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,560
Huh?

53
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,260
Sorry for making you cry, lady
- It's my first time seeing it...

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,980
How can you say that about
a person in your trunk?

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,820
He's not that kind of guy...
- Lady...

56
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,820
This is stuff violent gangs do!
- I'm sorry

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,920
Do you know that?
- I know

58
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,090
Enough with your excuses

59
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,760
Can't believe you got this...

60
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,020
Hey, excuse me...

61
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,360
We just found a Hamada Shogo
inside someone's car trunk

62
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,820
Alright, got it

63
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,200
Please, sing your famous line

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,710
Dom Perignon
- We confirmed it

65
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,440
We have no doubts, it's him

66
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,760
We did what we had to

Not only that... you got yourself
a cheap Hamashou, didn't you?

70
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,720
Was it worth it, really?
- I'm sorry

71
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,280
Sorry but, I'll have to arrest you
- No way

72
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,940
Daddy!

73
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,200
It's fine

74
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,220
It's not fine at all, lady

75
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,200
It's a crime to put that thing in your trunk

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,580
You take care of the car, ok?
- Got it

77
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,940
You're all coming in the patrol car with me

78
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,180
No way...

79
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,100
I didn't know, really
