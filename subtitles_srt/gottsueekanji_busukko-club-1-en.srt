Well, I am sorry but..

91
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,550
I didn't request a foreigner.

92
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,390
Why..

93
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,060
I'm sorry but I am not very good with foreigners.

94
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,890
Oh really..

Thank you for requesting me.

109
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,020
What?

110
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,550
May I use these slippers?

111
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,460
Shall we take a shower?

112
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,120
Well..

113
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,230
Or just my mouth today?

114
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,930
Shall we get started?

115
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,730
Wait a sec...Eh?

116
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,230
Who are you?

117
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,900
Oh, I am from Busukko club.

118
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,500
What?

119
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,310
You want to release it right? I will do it for you.

120
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,980
Yea, I want to. But...eh...Busukko club?

121
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,980
Certainly yes.

122
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,090
You're an old man..

123
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,990
Can't wait, huh?

124
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,690
No no no...wait!

125
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:09,930
What's wrong?

126
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,960
No, that's fine. Just let me change.

127
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,730
Eh?

128
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,730
Well.. please change.

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,510
Oh... You got me there... You want to change.

130
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,340
Yes.

131
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,940
To be honest, I am upset.

132
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,120
I was changed 4 times today.

133
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,520
Don't be upset.

134
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
But sill change, right?

135
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,760
Can't you rethink?

136
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,160
I don't have the feeling at all...

137
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,090
Please.

138
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,990
I can't..

139
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,030
I am a respectable adult with a full time job.

140
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,830
I'm just doing this on the side to make some money to play.

141
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,540
And end up with 4 changes a day.

142
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:00,350
You keep saying "Change", but ...may
I ask you what is "Change" to you?

143
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,720
Well...

144
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,720
Ok, I am leaving then.

145
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,950
Sorry for the trouble.

146
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,390
Can I tell you one more thing..

147
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,630
If... we didn't meet like this...

148
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,100
Do you think you would have held me?

149
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,010
What!

150
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,780
Here is Mr. Ball!

151
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,880
Get out!

152
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,090
Are you from Busukko club?

153
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,120
Yup.

154
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:41,750
Go home.

155
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,590
Play ball!

156
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,430
I said to go home!

157
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,300
What the..

158
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,400
Mr Ball is here!

159
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,270
Cut it out and get out of here!

160
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,540
Get out. You guys are all freaks.

161
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,820
Give me a break..

162
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,860
Here is Mr. Ball!

163
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,630
Leave!
