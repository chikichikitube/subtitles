76
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,130
They're waiting, just make up your mind

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,130
Maybe 1,000 yen and 1,000 yen..

78
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,160
So 2,000yen?

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,440
Only 2,000?!
- Yes

83
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,310
Is that so? Then,

84
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,040
Here is 10,000 yen bill.

85
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,610
Out of 10,000 yen

Ah, excuse me

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,600
I only got 6,000 yen

110
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,240
I gave you a 10,000 yen bill, so

111
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:20,870
Yes

112
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,340
I am short of change

113
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,780
Is that so? Just a moment, please?

114
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,710
Why is that?

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,380
You fill the shortage

116
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,410
I don't have any more

117
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,550
Why is it always me!?

118
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,580
Don't be so loud! I will give it back to you later!

119
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,650
Just give me the money!

120

Don't put it on here, stupid

123
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,260
You, shut up! Don't talk so loud!

124
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,260
You dropped money, what are you going to do?

125
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,140
Is that..

126
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,140
Oh, this is nothing

127
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,140
Why did you use coins?!

128
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,140
I said bills!

129
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,210
Now I don't know how much I got

130
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,180
Wait..one, two, three..

131
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,180
I gave you like 6,000 yen

132
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,720
If you give me a 1,000 yen bill,

133
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,890
I'm short 5,000 yen!

134
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,820
I used some of mine, too!

135
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,520
You..you!

136
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,220
What about me

137
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,790
What?
- I'll take it back

138
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,690
Yeah, take it back

139
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,000
I am sorry, just a moment please?

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,770
How much did you give me?

141
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,300
I gave you like 6,000 yen

142
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
No, you gave me 4 bills not 6

143
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,010
Excuse me, we need to leave..

144
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,170
Just a moment, please

145
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,380
Where is my coins?!

146
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,110
Never mind about that!

147
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,480
We can't pay back with coins!

148
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,380
Give me that!

149
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,150
You gonna take my money away again?!

150
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,690
Don't say it loud!

151
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,120
All good if we pay back 8,000 yen

152
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,620
We need to pay back 8,000 yen

153
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,760
Here's your change

154
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,590
I'll take the 10,000 yen bill

155
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,500
Excuse me.
- Yes?

156
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,630
I'm short 2,000 yen

157
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,740
You're hiding money aren't you?

158
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,970
I'm not

159
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,340
..ah.. here it is!

160
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,870
You were keeping it

161
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,940
You don't have to push me, let's do it later

162
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,310
Ok

163
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,780
Here's 2,000 yen

164
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,950
Thank you very much

165
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,620
ah..but we had a bottle of wine

166
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,620
A bottle of wine?

167
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,890
Why didn't you remind me

168
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,960
I don't have money
- Me neither

169
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
So we just charge for the wine

170
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,960
How much..how much?
- How much?

171
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,440

He's surprised!

176
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,580
I have no idea

177
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,820
We made him surprised, what do we do?

178
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,950
I have no idea..I don't know

179
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,890
You should check all of the prices!

180
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,290
How old is the 60,000 yen wine?

181
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,500
