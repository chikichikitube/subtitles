00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,460
Cocorico

00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,460
Downtown

3
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,460
Endo Shouzo

4
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,460
Hamada Masatoshi

00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,460
Matsumoto Hitoshi

6
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,460
Tanaka Naoki

7
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,700
Yamazaki is late today

8
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,700
Yeah, it's not like him

9
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,600
That's a first time

10
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,600
Excuse me

11
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,300
Something's up if he's late

12
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,660
Director

13
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,660
Komurasaki Kouzou (Komu)

14
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,180
'Morning

15
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,660
'Morning

16
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,860
Yamazaki-san told me

17
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,500
To call all of you guys

18
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,500
To come here

19
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,100
Couldn't he just come here instead?

20
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,740
I mean, he was really in a bad mood

21
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,860
Again...

22
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,060
So he told me to call you in his place

23
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,860
Bad mood again

24
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,260
He's in a bad mood?     - He is

25
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,140
Where is he?

26
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,540
I'll guide you there

27
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,940
What is he planning now?

28
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,380
He's waiting for you

29
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,700
How irritating...

30
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,660
Are we going?

31
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,500
Please

32
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,780
Geez

33
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,140
He called us, it better be something good

34
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,180
You're right

35
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,380
Why is he looking so shocked?

36
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,660
Yamazaki Housei

37
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,380
Good morning

38
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,700
Good morning

39
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,740
What's wrong?

40
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,860
You see

41
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,820
There are lots of comedians popping up on tv, recently

42
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,180
And none of them seem to feel nervous at all

43
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,860
And none of them seem to feel nervous at all

44
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,500
And none of them seem to feel nervous at all

45
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,540
And none of them seem to feel nervous at all

46
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,980
They're filling space

47
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,860
It makes me wonder if we're
increasing or decreasing our regulars

48
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,500
Are they regulars?

49
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,420
What?

50
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Is there any regular member?

51
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,020
Well, that's up to them I mean, if they say it's ok to...

52
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,600
You shouldn't wait for them to say it's ok

53
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,180
Are you an innovator?!

54
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,100
Are you an innovator?!

55
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,260
Try to be an innovator

56
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,260
You all should try to be one

57
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,420
Back then there were
comedians like Kanbi-san or Yassan

58
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,220
They were innovators! And comedians too!

59
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,220
They were innovators! And comedians too!

60
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:17,900
Yes

61
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,340
I see

62
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,140
Comedians nowadays aren't innovative at all

63
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,340
They don't even feel nervous at all

64
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,220
So I've decided I'll become unsparing myself!

65
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,660
So I've decided I'll become unsparing myself!

66
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,940
So I've decided I'll become unsparing myself!

67
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,500
I really don't understand why you're angry     - Yeah...

68
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,100
"I'll become innovative",

69
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,460
That's what I'm trying to say to you!

70
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,460
"I'll become stoic",

71
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,900
Now, move!

72
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,060
It's time to show you how one can be

73
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,100
A real comedian between comedians

74
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,060
A real comedian between comedians

75
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,340
What is he mad about?

00:01:49,340 --> 00:02:01,140

00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,340
Comedians don't bring any innovation at all

81
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,340
Yamazaki said that today's

82
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,980
But what will

83
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,980
This true comedian he's talking about be?

84
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,740
What is this?

85
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,300
Come on, this song?

86
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,220
I open up the window facing South~♪

87
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,220
note: he's singing "Love Is Calling Me" by japanese singer Judy Ongg

88
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,180
And I gaze at the ocean's hue by myself~♪

89
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,700
It's so beautiful it's frightening me~♪

90
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:56,940
And I let its mirage touch my bare skin~♪

91
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,500
Huh? Was this part of the lyrics?

92
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,500
note: it wasn't

93
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,600
Wind is blowing from the Aegean~♪

94
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,260
And this woman is missing you~♪

95
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,700
(manager)

96
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Miyamoto!

97
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,940
Yes

98
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,860
Manager

99
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,860
Miyamoto Yuu

100
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,300
Here

101
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,860
Let's see...

102
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,660
How much should I...?

103
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,060
1000 yen here...

104
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:25,220
Yamazaki suddenly starts paying everyone for some reason

105
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,020
What the-- what's going on?

106
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,540
What the-?      - 1000 yen here

107
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,300
What's the money for?

108
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
What's going on?

109
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,260
That's...

110
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,260
Because I didn't make you laugh

111
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,940
What?

112
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,940
What?

113
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,060
Please, accept it

114
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,500
We can't take the money

115
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,500
We can't take the money

116
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,500
We can't take the money

117
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,900
After all it's all about 'em, right?

118
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,220
What?

119
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,820
It's all about the money, right?

120
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,340
I failed hard, so I'll pay for it

121
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,140
This makes no sense

122
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,380
When you fail to make someone laugh, you pay them!

123
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,380
Yamazaki's way of a true comedian

124
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,460
This is too weird

125
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,380
It's not weird at all, really

126
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,180
What?

127
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,540
Then tell me, was that funny to you?

128
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,940
I'd say that

129
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,540
That wasn't funny at all

130
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,380
That's why you should take this

131
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,460
It wasn't funny, so you all get 1000 yen

132
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,140
It wasn't funny, so you all get 1000 yen

133
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,380
Man, I failed...

134
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,060
Huh?

135
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,380
You know, actually...

136
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,260
I've been criticized a lot and felt lost

137
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,300
Then there's Judy Onng

138
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,300
Which in a way is another person who felt lost

139
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,860
That's the connection

140
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,060
Alright?

141
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,060
I'm sorry, though

142
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,940
About what?

143
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,180
I've prepared another one

144
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,980
Enough--- I mean,

145
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,180
We'll see that      - Yes

146
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,060
Komu!

147
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,860
We'll see that, but let's cast this money thing aside

148
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,860
That's right      - Yeah, let's not make this about money

149
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,780
That kinda...

150
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,260
Lets out an unpleasant vibe to this

151
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,660
It makes no sense

152
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,420
You're changing here?!

153
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,140
I don't get it I mean, he's spoiling that to us

154
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,660
Maybe it's 'cause that's something comedians don't show

155
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,600
Yamazaki changes for his next skit right in front of them

156
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,540
Oh, I see

157
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,660
Like, background

158
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,940
Something like an "offstage face"

159
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,220
Well, that's kinda innovative in a way

160
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,860
I was thinking

161
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,660
We too have to think of something new from now on

162
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,660
Is he ignoring us?

163
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,060
He's totally ignoring us

164
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,820
He's gone

165
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,020
He's going? Huh?

166
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,980
Please!

167
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,540
There's a red poppy over the hill~♪

168
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,060
note: he's singing "Hinageshi no Hana" ("red poppy flower") by Agnes-chan

169
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,980
Telling the fortune of that person~♪

170
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,660
And today too~♪

171
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,940
I'm alone~♪

172
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,940
Memories of love~♪

173
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,980
Are overflowing from my chest~♪

174
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,260
Tears of love~♪

175
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,420
Will fall down today too~♪

176
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,220
I don't have many 1000 yen bills...

177
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,820
Wha-?

178
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,600
When you fail to make someone laugh, you pay them!

179
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,600
Yamazaki's way of a true comedian

180
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,980
To be fair I laughed a bit

181
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,380
I laughed a bit at the beginning, take these back

182
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,420
There's no need--    - No, no

183
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,420
I didn't make you laugh

184
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,300
But I laughed a bit first

185
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,780
I completely failed

186
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,940
Me and Endo laughed a bit

187
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,540
We did

188
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,460
Yeah, but you two laughed when you saw me

189
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,260
Yeah I did laugh

190
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,380
But I

191
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,500
I think you should have laughed more

192
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
I think you should have laughed more

193
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,700
There's still no need for us to receive 2000 yen

194
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,420
That's because I sucked!

195
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,420
How many times do I have to tell you?

196
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,540
I don't really want these 3000 yen from what I saw

197
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,980
It's just crappy money

198
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,060
Should we head back?

199
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,900
Let's go    - Yes    - Wait a moment

200
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,220
Wait a moment

201
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,460
Please just wait

202
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,740
Man, he gave us a 2000 yen bill too

203
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,740
Yeah, I'm giving them back

204
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,540
No way I'm taking these

205
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,740
Paying forciblly someone is lame too    - You're right

206
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,900
I think he's taking it too far with this money thing

207
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,940
Yeah...

208
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,420
Why going through all of this?

209
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,780
Isn't it impressive?

210
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,100
It's Yujiro!

It's gonna affect my kids' future school exams

230
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,180
But I did laugh

231
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,220
I laughed, I swear     - It was funny, yes

232
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,780
When you fail to make someone laugh, you pay them!

233
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,780
Yamazaki's way of a true comedian

234
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,020
No need for that

235
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,460
Please don't---      - It's fine

236
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,660
That's a 3000 yen one

237
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,820
I insist to pay 3000 yen, I thought I could succeed

238
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,420
I insist to pay 3000 yen, I thought I could succeed

239
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,340
To think I set up this thing...

240
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,660
It's so strange I couldn't make you laugh

241
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,060
What are you doing?

242
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,220
This...

243
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,740
Well,

244
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,600
I thought it would make a "shiii~ng" sound

245
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,660
I thought it would make a "shiii~ng" sound

246
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,660
It's not making any sound

247
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,900
So, 3000 yen... no, I'll pay for that, I have to

248
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,020
What?      - Come on...

249
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,060
In return

250
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,180
If you laugh blatantly, I'll take them back

251
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,600
If you laugh blatantly, I'll take them back

252
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,340
Anyway...

253
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,860
Would you consider stop

254
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,860
Singing the whole full chorus?

255
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,700
Yeah...

256
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,380
Right

257
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,420
It's just too long

258
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,420
It's just too long

259
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,140
He's not doing anything

260
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,460
He's not hitting himself

261
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,940
He stopped 'cause it started to hurt

262
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,420
He stopped 'cause it started to hurt

263
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,300
Must be that

264
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,340
He only lasted for the beginning

265
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,780
Komu?

266
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,980
Yes?

267
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,060
Tch

268
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,940
Yamazaki gets angry because noises from outside ruined his skit

269
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,060
That's not the problem

270
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,140
Trust me, it's not that

271
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,420
You chose to do it here yourself     - Exactly

272
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,420
Tch

273
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,380
Can't help it

274
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,380
Can't help it

275
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,540
It's an hallway, people pass by

276
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,340
Different people pass by

277
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,600
No, wait, we're good, really, stop that

278
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,600
We all laughed

279
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,540
Sakari Takami, right?

280
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,540
note: Sakari Takami is a 1976 born japanese sumo fighter

281
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,740
Yeah it's him     - We figured it right

282
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,740
I wasn't satisfied at all by your reaction

283
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,740
It was no good to me

284
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,180
But...

285
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,600
I bet if Hamada-san did it, everyone would laugh

286
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,540
No way I would     - Everyone would laugh

287
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,900
But because I did it, it's

288
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,540
100% certain I couldn't make you laugh

289
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,900
100% certain I couldn't make you laugh

290
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
How can I put it?

291
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,660
It's like I got bald

292
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,660
After an hair transplantation surgery

293
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,860
What do you mean bald? Hair transplantation?

294
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,020
Like, getting bald freshly after it

295
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,180
You really suck at inventing metaphors

296
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,180
It would be best if you don't make any

297
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,600
Who cares about that?

298
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,600
I mean, Endo over there is wearing a

299
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,380
I mean, Endo over there is wearing a

300
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,380
Beret, but still...

301
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,420
That's not a beret

302
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,860
It's not a beret, it's a casquette

303
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,180
A casquette !?

304
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,420
Yes

305
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,180
The hell is that?

306
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,740
I don't have any money left

307
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,780
Yamazaki already used all the money he prepared for this meeting

308
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
It's fine that way

309
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,460
Don't sweat it, really

310
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,220
Say, Komu...

311
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,220
You had some matchsticks, right?

312
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,380
What?

313
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,220
Each one of these is worth 1000 yen

314
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,220
Each one of these is worth 1000 yen

315
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,940
Come on, enough of that

316
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,060
We're fine without it, really

317
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,420
What's the point of this?

318
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,700
For now this... 2000 yen for Hamada

319
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,740
Don't lose them, ok?

320
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,220
'Cause if you happen to lose them, you won't

321
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,220
Be able to claim the money

322
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,740
Alright, now, wait a sec

323
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,700
Huh?

324
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,700
Huh?

325
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,820
There's still more...?

326
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,340
Yeah there's much more

327
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,260
Much more?!      - There's still much more?

328
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:16,060
note: Yamazaki isn't actually saying anything. Just pseudo-english gibberish.

329
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,980
A fiendish creature appearing in the movie "The Lord Of The Rings"

330
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,980
