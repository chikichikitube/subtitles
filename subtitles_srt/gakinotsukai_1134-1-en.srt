1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,640
First Gaki no Tsukai ya Arehende bet it all on one
mouthfull for the 100 thousand yen prize.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,920
Kiki Castella!

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,220
Matsumoto-san, this is the 32th entry.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,620
I'm surprised we haven't done this already.
It was about time already.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,280
Why the hell are you laughing?
-Why are you laughing?

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,100
No, I was surprised we haven't done this already,
it's what I thought... Sorry.

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,110
Here it comes!

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,710
The staff wanted us to try 12 kinds of castella but...

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,720
Idiots! They only found 10 types!
-Really?

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,720
Who will be first?

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,320
Everytime Endo goes first...
-Every time.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,960
How about Hamada-san?

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,980
Should I?

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,840
Hamada-san could win this right away.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,840
If this guy wins they won't know
where to put the star.

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,350
Because he can't do anything else!
He couldn't even build with lego!

17
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,820
www.gaki-no-tsukai.com  -  subs by H

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,060
Kiki Castella, first up is the six time winner Hamada.

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,200
The one chosen is Izumiya's Nagasaki Honey Castella

20
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,060
Ah, Well... This...

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,460
His nose is so bloody clogged, huh?

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,360
For some reason I'm getting a cold every year.

23
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,560
He ate it.

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,460
How about it?

25
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,120
Somehow, there is this firmness, right? This...

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,300
It had this quite firm feeling, like, springy.

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,500
I'm not sure that makes sense.

28
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,660
The last part of it tasted quite sweet.

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,320
So maybe I'll focus on the bottom sweet part.

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,560
I see. Quite sharp, huh?
-But aren't all like that?

31
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,980
Yeah, all he did was say the most basic thing about it.

32
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:34,200
This is my intuition but it's either one of these two.

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,980
Just the two?
-One of these two.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Why is that?

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,040
Because there was a sweet bottom... feeling.

36
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,380
Sweet bottom feeling?
-Sweet bottom feeling.

37
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,580
I wonder why he narrowed to those two.
-Amazing.

38
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,260
First I'll try this one.
Japan's best Nagasaki Egg Castella.

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,960
I don't know, as I thought they are identical.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,100
Try to remember, wasn't there various things about it?
-The sweetness in the end and so.

41
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,320
I know that, now I want to try this one!

42
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,720
It's gotta be one of them.

43
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,940
One of the two?
-Why only the two?

44
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,460
Which one is it?

45
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,140
He said "which one".
-Amazing.

46
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,360
No, no, I'm sure.
Because of the bottom part.

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,540
Bottom part?
-The crunchiness of it.

48
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,860
I should just go for it.

49
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,320
Really? He's so confident.

50
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,660
It would be cool if I got it right, huh?

51
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,500
Very cool.
-Would be awesome.

52
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,800
But I could go "Maybe it's that one!"
and turn out to be right...

53
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,820
Well, there are still nine of them to choose, so...

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,060
When I said "One of these two"
weren't you surprised?

55
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,160
You narrowing down to only two
was the reason we were surprised.

56
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I see.

57
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,020
I'll go with this one, then.

58
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,920
The one I ate was...

59
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:33,560
Japan's best Nagasaki Egg Castella...

60
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,260
Wrong!

61
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,700
You should have tasted some more.
-True, you should have.

62
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,640
But I said-
-Look, a man from Holland.

63
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,480
Only to the castella... It remains... $%&@!!

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,540
What?
-I didn't understand.

65
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,540
That works I guess.
-It's a punishiment after all.

66
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,920
Wait! Scary! Scary!

67
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,700
Did it hurt?
-The impact is very scary.

68
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,140
Which one was it?
-This one, the other one you chose.

69
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,420
The one I said?
-Yes!

70
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,980
How did you know?
-It's easy.

71
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,040
I just looked for the ones with crystal sugar.

72
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,020
The others didn't have it.
-What!? How did you know yours had it?

73
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,120
What? It's there.
-But this one also has, and this one...

74
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,840
So those the only two that had visible sugar.

75
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,400
Here, see? It's sticking out.

76
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,180
I'm so thankful for this!

77
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,300
I see...
I think we can do this!

78
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,940
Now the staff will start looking out for this.

79
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,010
You all win we'll take 400 thousand yen from them.

80
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,080
I haven't looked yet to see how the staff faces are.

81
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,080
They don't look so happy.

82
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,220
Next is Tanaka.

83
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,020
Found on convenience stores,
Sweet Factory's Moist Castella is selected.

84
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,240
Is it fluffly?
-Yes! And there is no crystal sugar.

85
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,770
Ah, sorry!
-You're the worst.

86
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,500
We can't pick it up for you now.
-That's the rule.

87
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,920
That rule was just created.

88
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,040
I kinda feel bad for him.

89
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,360
First of all,

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,040
I'm trying to figure out which
one to choose, by their looks.

91
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Is that so?
-Yes.

92
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,760
Should I go for the most expensive one?

93
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,520
The one in the golden box.
-Yes, it costs 3800 yen.

94
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,000
Here I go.

95
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,280
Completely wrong!

96
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,540
Maybe because of the hint I can tell,
but it's completely wrong.

97
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,540
It was way fluffier.

98
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,600
Also moist.

99
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,520
Somewhat... Heavier.

100
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,260
Because this is different, immediately...
I can say it is different.

101
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,560
You said it already.

102
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,640
"Because this is different
I can say it is different."

103
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,880
The one I ate was...

104
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,320
...not Nagasaki Honpo Castella!

105
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,380
Now the opposite!
The cheapest one, 150 yen.

106
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,660
It'll be completely different.

107
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,460
Huh?

108
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,100
Which kind was it?
-"Which kind was it?"

109
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,100
Is this it?

110
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,680
The smell and feel...
Are exactly the same.

111
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,840
The entire feeling when eating it...

112
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,160
Even the taste is the same.

113
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,800
This nice feeling...

114
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,340
Was it honey?
It was honey!

115
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:45,770
The sweet flavor I felt
was from the honey!

116
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,440
Well, that's obvious.
It's how they make castella.

117
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,200
This is it!

118
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,600
Until now, when we did this,

119
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,380
a lot of times I went "This is it!".
But honestly I knew I could be wrong.

120
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,890
But this time,
this is really it!

121
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,420
I really think so.

122
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,880
What confidence...
-There is no doubt!

123
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,380
The one I ate was...

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,620
Sweet Factory's Moist Castella!

125
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,480
Dancer Producers
Nakamura Yoshinobu  -  Kobayashi Hiromitsu

126
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,900
It's been a while we haven't seen this, huh?
-True.

127
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,580
Thank you very much!

128
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,500
Did you really know?
-In the end I thought:

129
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,240
"This is it, it's exactly the same!"

130
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,080
Just with the flavor?
-Just the flavor.

131
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,700
The third one is Endou, chosen for him is:

132
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,750
Bunmeido's Slice Castella.

133
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,180
What are you doing? Geez...

134
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,980
That is just wrong...
-No, no!

135
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,390
I'm trying to keep it
in my mouth to see the

136
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,760
absorption of the sponge.

137
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,630
That joke sucked.

138
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,360
Sweet... This is very sweet.

139
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,700
There was no crystal sugar so...
I'll look for that.

140
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,280
You can feel it's crunchy when it does.

141
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,010
In the world of comedy it is said
that Endou is the #1 idiot.

142
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,120
I'm not stupid.

143
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,180
The one who said that is the real idiot.

144
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,520
Should I try this Nozomi one?

145
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,720
Should I try this one?
-Sure, go on.

146
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,100
I don't know if I said this but,

147
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,280
I did a blood test just today.
-Is that so?

148
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,940
So, in a sense, I'm doing this like Endou would.

149
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,040
This is not sweet at all,
completely wrong.

150
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,800
The one I ate was not
Sera Rouge's Top Quality Castella!

151
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,480
So fast.
-Yeah, I can do this.

152
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,680
It was not Moist Castella.

153
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,320
Feeling like it's homework, using sweetness
as guide, he splendidly clears 4 brands.

154
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Bunmeido is very popular isn't it?
-That's true.

155
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,640
So I'll try this one,
Bunmeido's Castella.

156
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,880
Man, this is close!

157
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,900
The one I ate was not
Bunmeido's Slice Castella!

158
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,720
That was lame.
-What a shame.

159
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,400
This is hell isn't it?

160
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,480
You have no discipline, train your taste buds!

161
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,680
Right!
-Understood it this time.

162
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,140
Ugh, I'm sorry!

163
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,720
Next is the man who missed
eight years in a row.

164
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,290
Chosen for him is
Sera Rouge's Top Quality Castella

165
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,040
There!
-Did you chose it?

166
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,770
Crystal Sugar

167
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,360
Which one is it?

168
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,360
Here!

169
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,160
We chose one.

170
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,900
What's wrong?

171
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,920
Thank you very much!!

172
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,660
What's wrong Housei-san?
-Surprise!

173
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,870
This is the first time you were kind to me!

174
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,180
Thank everybody.
-Thank you everyone!

175
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,760
You sure laughed a lot.

176
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,120
Is this real? I'm so happy!

177
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Did you eat enough?
-Yes, enough!

178
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,840
Like this it will be impossible
to get it wrong.

179
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,720
That's true. Thanks to the
kindness of the people.

180
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Well, just like Hamada-san said, it has to be
either of the ones with crystal sugar

181
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,560
I'm going for the one Hamada-san didn't choose!

182
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,770
How about the crystal sugar?

183
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,170
There are lots!

184
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,780
Crystal sugar, check?

185
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,080
Crystal sugar, check!!

186
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,580
This is it...
The sugar is completely...

187
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,880
Wait a moment...

188
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,820
The amount of crystals is wrong...

189
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,320
But it's exactly the same sugar.

190
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,520
Just like this, the sugar.

191
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,820
This is it!

192
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,780
Please be this one!

193
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,140
The one I ate was...

194
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,700
Izumiya's Nagasaki Castella!

195
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,160
You're joking, right?

196
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,220
You have no sense for words or for taste!!

197
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,460
Wait... Let me try again.

198
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,500
Nothing you can do now.
-This part is scary.

199
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,960
Yama-chan, it was this one.

200
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,110
What is that?

201
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,240
This was it. Nozomi Castella.

202
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,020
We chose that, and when we
gave it to you, we realized,

203
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,050
There was one more with crystal sugar.

204
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,520
"It's there!!" We all thought.

205
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,660
You knew I would never
choose that one then?

206
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,100
With me all happy there.

207
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,580
We knew you'd focus on the two...
-And me saying "thank you!".

208
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,230
When I said I was thankful,
what were you feeling?

209
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,760
Last is the man hoping to get it right
after seven years, Matsumoto.

210
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,180
The one chosen was...

211
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,180
Ah!

212
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,480
I heard you go "Ah!"

213
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,650
You found crystal sugar!

214
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,720
For sure you found it!

215
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,140
You said "Ah!", man...

216
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,190
Then Hamada goes "What the hell are you doing?"

217
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,720
Specially chosen for Matsumoto, is the one
with crystal sugar, Nagasaki Honey Castella.

218
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,300
Here I go.

219
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,240
Matsumoto bites the side without crystal sugar.

220
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,180
You bastards...

221
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,550
At this point you give me one without sugar?

222
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,550
Ah!

223
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,820
What did you find?

224
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,290
Crystal sugar!

225
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,420
Crystal sugar!!

226
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,300
That went great.

227
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,900
Ah, sweet!

228
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,560
This is so common...

229
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,880
Well, seeing how things went so far,

230
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,420
I know I should not rely
only on the sugar, right?

231
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,220
I'll go for Bunmeido's Slice Castella.

232
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,480
Eh?

233
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,720
Crystal sugar!

234
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,850
There is crystal sugar!

235
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,680
Do you know what this means?

236
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,860
That there can be sugar in any part of it!

237
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,700
That was a hell of discovery.

238
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
I have no choice now, do I?

239
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,780
There was no crystal sugar.

240
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,800
You were wrong then?

241
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
But I can see it.

242
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,020
You can see it, right?

243
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,620
I couldn't feel it in my mouth!

244
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,700
Can this happen?

245
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,280
The one I ate was not
Bunmeido's Slice Castella!

246
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,760
I knew because there was no sugar.

247
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:25,140
Looking for the crystal sugar,
he clears 4 brands!

248
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,380
I can definitely find the right one.

249
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,480
Here I go.

250
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,960
There is a load of sugar!

251
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,280
Based on the crystal sugar,
and softness of it,

252
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,020
Perhaps this is wrong.

253
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,460
This is not it.

254
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,880
It stinks!

255
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,220
What are you doing?

256
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,760
It is not my partner!

257
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,360
That's too harsh, it's not that bad.
-It stinks!

258
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,220
Not disturbed by Hamada's gas interruption,
he clears 3 more brands!

259
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,120
Both of the two left have sugar on them.

260
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,370
I'll go for Sera Rouge!

261
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,860
Here I go!

262
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,200
Just kidding!

263
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:39,990
You really had no good reason
to laugh, I know.

264
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,660
It's really stuck in there...

265
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,980
Is this wrong?

266
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,500
The sugar wasn't arranged
all crowded like this.

267
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,820
Try eating it then.

268
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,360
Yes.

269
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,220
Yeah!

270
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,860
Maybe...

271
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
This could be wrong.

272
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,060
Ah!
I have to chose one, right?

273
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,860
No matter which one,
I have to go forward.

274
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,580
Man, I'm so nervous.

275
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,000
What should I do?

276
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,260
Maybe it's this one.

277
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,240
Maybe this.

278
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,750
After this:
Will Matsumoto get it right after seven years!?

279
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,920
It is really amusing. It was funny playing it.

280
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,820
Please have fun playing it!

281
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,040
Heipo-san, please talk to this camera.
-Ah, this one?

282
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,660
Get it over at the show's homepage!

283
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:08,280
2 left

284
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,280
What do I do?

285
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,690
How many years have it been?

286
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,560
Seven years!

287
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,870
It's been a while...

288
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,370
It has finally come...

289
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,010
What's with that laughing?

290
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,310
What is it you guys?

291
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,320
Hurry up, do it already!

292
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,050
This is taking too long, you say,
that laugh and feeling, what do they mean?

293
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,630
As the remains caught in my back teeth,
the way of that laughter,

294
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,030
who on earth is that?

295
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,040
What do I do?

296
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,040
I can't decide it, it's impossible!

297
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,580
What do I do?

298
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,300
Here I go!!

299
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,980
I'm going for the opposite of
the one I wanted to.

300
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,420
The one I ate was...

301
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,980
Izumiya's Nagasaki Honey Castella!

302
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,880
Impressive! Really impressive.

303
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,080
This really was...

304
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,720
Trusting your hunch no matter what may not work,

305
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,800
somehow I was able to betray myself.

306
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,660
You thought it was that one, right?

307
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,140
I did it!

308
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,360
I'm so happy!
