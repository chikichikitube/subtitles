Oh, did he ?

23
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,510
I confess I'm not really into this series...

24
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,450
How come ?

I just don't feel good about

28
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,360
satisfying my hunger this way

29
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,580
I'm with you

30
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,730
This ends up being your dinner for the night

31
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,930
Right, and to top it off,

32
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,060
I won't want to go out afterwards

33
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,370
Right

34
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,730
And I don't even get to eat something I like

Tempura by Tanaka

41
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,460
First up is Tanaka

42
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,870
What is his ingredient ?

43
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,100
Here's my first ingredient

44
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,640
I see

45
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,240
What's this ?

46
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,530
These are Strawberry Bean Rice Cakes

47
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:15,450
Ingredient

48
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:15,450
Strawberry Bean Rice Cake

49
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,710
There's strawberry in there

50
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,760
We all know

51
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,100
how well strawberry and mochi tastes together

52
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,640
There's no doubt this will turn out great

53
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,250
Frying Mochi itself would be good,

54
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,850
but you're taking the extra step with the strawberry

55
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,850
I'm going for it

56
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,510
I'm curious to see how this turns out

57
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,010
Here's my second ingredient

58
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,500
Here it is

59
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,310
A bundle of flowers

60
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:41,800
Bouquet of Edible Flowers

61
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:41,800
Ingredient

62
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,750
I don't get this

63
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,710
This is edible ?

64
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,470
Yes, it is

65
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm using Chrysanthemum flowers

66
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,560
Why flowers ?

67
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,400
You are AGERU(To Fry) the AGERU(To Give a Gift)

68
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,750
I see your pun

69
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,100
Right, and I'm going to AGERU(To Fry) it even further

70
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,750
Because I'm frying this whole thing

71
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,630
We can eat it ?

72
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,970
Don't worry, these are edible flowers

73
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,330
Just so we're clear on that

74
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:58,700
Strawberry Bean Mochi Tempura

75
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:58,700
Tanaka's 1st Dish

76
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,890
Here's Tanaka's first ingredient

77
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,610
First, the strawberry bean mochi

78
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,430
are battered and then fried

79
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,600
Here we go

80
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,130
That scared me a little

81
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,860
That looks good

82
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:15,700
Flower Tempura

83
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:15,700
Tanaka's 2nd Dish

84
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,250
Incredible !

85
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,100
Here I go

86
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,840
Wach it, watch it

87
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,790
Shove that whole thing in there

88
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,630
There will only be crumbs left

89
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,020
You're right

90
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,880
Tanaka's 1st Dish:
"Strawberry Bean Mochi Tempura"

91
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,860
Here's Tanaka's strawberry bean mochi tempura

92
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,620
How will they fare ?

93
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,630
I'm seriously starving right now

94
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,580
This will be perfect then

95
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,200
Well, I just want something decent

96
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,040
They look good so far

97
00:02:27,030 --> 00:03:47,800
Strawberry Bean Mochi Tempura

98
00:02:27,030 --> 00:03:47,800
Tanaka's 1st Dish

99
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,030
Couldn't this show hire a real waitress ?

100
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,710
I agree

101
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,700
Hey, come back here

102
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,570
Seriously, this is where we can do better

103
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,300
It's insulting having this guy serve us

104
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,450
Yorihisa Ezure

105
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,000
I mean he would be my one millionth choice

106
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,270
from the bottom of the world population

107
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,780
Tanaka, your mochi looks different

108
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,630
You're right

109
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,850
You're the one who made it, so that's why

110
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,140
This dish has the potential to be a big hit

111
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,740
We'll see

112
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,500
This one looks great so far

113
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,370
Itadakimasu

114
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,700
Itadakimasu

115
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,990
I hate how it's dripping

116
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,030
This is tasty

117
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,280
Isn't this delicious ?

118
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,210
This is good

119
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:08,690
Right ?

120
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,010
Delicious

121
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,100
I admit this is good but...

122
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,770
not much changed from the original

123
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,530
I second that

124
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,530
This isn't THAT good

125
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,410
So, the breading is SATSUMA IMO (Sweet Potato)...

126
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,150
But why Sweet Potato ?

127
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,220
Huh ?

128
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,730
Hold on, we need to figure out what just happened

129
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,220
Wait, I meant to say SATSUMA AGE (Fried Fish)

130
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,840
You got those two words mixed up ?

131
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,980
But you get it, right ?

132
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,390
Tell your wife, Chiaki, about this

133
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,220
She needs to know about this

134
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,480
Tell her this wasn't sweet potato

135
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,140
Yes, just so she's clear on this

136
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,690
Chiaki !

137
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,430
This wasn't sweet potato !

138
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,040
What's this all about ?

139
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,230
Tanaka's 1st Dish:
"Strawberry and Bean Mochi Tempura"

140
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,330
The flavor didn't live up to its appearance and receives 5 points

141
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,070
Tanaka's 2nd Dish: "Flower Tempura"

142
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,390
His second ingredient is a bouquet of flowers

143
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,660
How does this taste ?

144
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:43,500
Flower Tempura

145
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:43,500
Tanaka's 2nd Dish

146
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,350
Great first impression for sure

147
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,740
Will you take a look at this ?

148
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,210
Amazing !

149
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,000
This serves how many people ?

150
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,390
Can you hold that up ?

151
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,100
Yeah, you got it

152
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,200
So far, the presentation is awesome

153
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,850
It's grand

154
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,450
Itadakimasu

155
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,940
Itadakimasu

156
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,240
This isn't so bad, is it ?

157
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,760
Is this really edible ?

158
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,730
Not good

159
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,370
No can do

160
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,250
It tastes like

161
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm rolling around on the grassy lawn

162
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,010
3 points...

163
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,930
2 or 3 points...

164
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,700
2 or 3 points ?

165
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,550
You scored 5 points with your first one so...

166
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,380
You'd give me 3 points for this ?

167
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,760
Tanaka's 2nd Dish:"Flower Tempura"

168
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,980
The flavor didn't live up to its appearance and receives 3 points

169
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,650
Next up is Endo

170
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,530
Tempura by Endo

171
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,520
What are his ingredients ?

172
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,530
Here's my first ingredient !!!!

173
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,020
Here's my first ingredient !!!!

174
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,780
Seedless grapes !

175

Let me just eat them as is !!

176
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:07,100
Grapes (Kyoho)

177
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:07,100
Ingredient

178
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,770
Let me eat them now !

179
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,890
They're so good on their own

180
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,400
I understand they're good right now

181
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,300
but today I'm frying these as Tempura !

182
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,660
Then, I'm hoping this item will finally work wonders this time

183
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,380
Here it is !

184
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,370

Frisk

186
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:23,450
Ingredient

187
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,660
Cut it out !

188
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,210
Please....Frisk ?!!

189
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm begging you !

190
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,790
Did anyone from Frisk ever contact you ?

191
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,020
No, zero, nada

192
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,790
Will Endo's passionate plea be answered ?

193
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:50,100
Endo's 1st Dish

194
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:50,100
Grape Tempura

195
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,470
Imagine if you were the grapes right now...

196
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,790
Well, grapes are never subjected to this treatment

197
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,950
I'm not kidding

198
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,030
It's like Yosuke Eguchi doused in flour

199
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,200
Here I go

200
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,570
What the heck...?

201
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,110
Chef, won't it explode ?

202
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,170
No, it shouldn't

203
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,720
Grapes, I'm counting on you

204
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,970
The Frisk mints get fried like a "mixed tempura"

205
00:05:51,650 --> 00:06:06,400
Endo's 2nd Dish

206
00:05:51,650 --> 00:06:06,400
Frisk Tempura

207
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,010
I see

208
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,430
So that how this would look fried

209
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,420
Man, I can tell it's a failure already

210
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,350
I don't even have to eat that

211
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,750
So here's my Frisk in mixed tempura form

212
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Endo's 1st Dish: "Grape Tempura"

213
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,390
Endo's first dish is grape tempura

214
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,800
How does it taste ?

215
00:06:12,350 --> 00:07:12,600
Endo's 1st Dish

216
00:06:12,350 --> 00:07:12,600
Grape Tempura

217
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,810
They look amazing

218
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,340
I don't know what to say...

219
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,210
It smells good

220
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,000
It's like a work of art

221
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,760
Yeah, it looks like that

222
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,450
They're straight out of the fryer

223
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,750
Itadakimasu !

224
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,960
Hot !

225
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,180
This is way too hot, moron !

226
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:32,790
Hot !!!

227
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,250
It's too hot to eat

228
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,440
Hot !!

229
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,480
I've never had such hot grapes before..

230
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,510
Hot !

231
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,780
It's good !

232
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,650
No way

233
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,740
Not for me

234
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,180
I wouldn't say this is "good"

235
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,430
But...

236
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,940
Considering how low your expectation was,

237
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,480
I think it deserves a good score

238
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,040
Well then, how many points would you give ?

239
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,670
Because this faced a tough obstacle,

240
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,630
I'd say at least 8 points...

241
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,000
Not any lower than that

242
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,210
Don't be a moron

243
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,990
8 points ?

244
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,920
I give you 4 points

245
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,190
Only 4 points ??

246
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,680
If we gave you 8 points for this,

247
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,950
then it would be a part of an every day diet

248
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,270
Endo's 1st Dish: "Grape Tempura"

249
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,430
Endo's grape tempura fails to become part of a daily diet and receives 4 points

250
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,950
Endo's 2nd Dish: "Frisk Tempura"

251
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,650
His second ingredient is Frisk

252
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,950
Will Endo's prayer be answered ?

253
00:07:22,500 --> 00:08:02,050
Endo's 2nd Dish

254
00:07:22,500 --> 00:08:02,050
Frisk Tempura

255
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,740
What the hell....??

256
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,690
Isn't this what you find inside Donbei Cup Noodles ??

257
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,580
It certainly looks...

258
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,580
It certainly looks like it would be great with noodles

259
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,000
Itadakimasu

260
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,520
I can smell this already

261
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,730
This is like...

262
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,950
some kind of curse

263
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,920
The mint flavor has completely taken over

264
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,790
I'm simply stunned

265
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,690
Wouldn't you run home if you saw this in your bento box ?

266
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,860
And you'd do this at the door as your mom opened it

267
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,320
Endo's 2nd Dish: "Frisk Tempura"

268
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,340
Endo's prayer wasn't answered, and it received a skull and crossbones

269
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,230
Next up is Yamasaki

270
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,050
Tempura by Yamasaki

271
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,050
What did he choose ?

272
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,950
Shall I begin ?

273
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,230
Here they are !

274
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,510
They look promising

275
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,540
They are none other than

276
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,830
Donburi Bowls

277
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,320
First we have the Chicken Bowl

278
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:47,000
Ingredients

279
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:47,000
Chicken Bowl

280
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,000
Second is the Mabo Tofu

281
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:47,000
Mabo Tofu

282
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,520
Last is the Curry Bowl

283
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:47,000
Curry Bowl

284
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,190
Can we just have them as is ?

285
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,220
No kidding

286
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,740
Well, today's theme is to create Tempura so...

287
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,460
Anyhow, these are difficult ingredients for tempura

288
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,330
so I prepared them like this

289
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,190
These are the same as the contents in the 3 bowls ...

290
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,540
Are they frozen ?

291
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,810
Yes, they're frozen

292
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,590
Good idea

293
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,180
Yes, they're really frozen

294
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,010
Yamasaki's idea is to freeze the ingredients

295
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,280
before they're fried

296
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,350
And here's my second ingredient

297
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,340
What's this ?

298
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,600
This isn't good

299
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:00,900
Ingredient

300
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:00,900
Jelly-Beans

301
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,570
They are...

302
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,860
Jelly-Beans

303
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm frying them in a mixed tempura form

304
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,480
They sure look colorful and pretty right now

305
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:08,150
3 Frozen Bowl Tempura

306
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:08,150
Yamasaki's 1st Dish

307
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:08,110
First, Yamasaki fries up each member's choice of ingredients

308
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,670
Yamasaki's second ingredient, Jelly-Beans,

309
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:20,000
Jelly-Beans Tempura

310
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:20,000
Yamasaki's 2nd Dish

311
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,200
gets fried in mixed tempura form

312
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,030
They sure look colorful

313
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,380
It has nice color to it

314
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,240
Looks like mixed vegetables

315
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,220
Yamasaki's 1st Dish: 3 Frozen Bowl Tempura

316
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,890
Yamasaki's first ingredients are 3 different frozen bowls

317
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,200
How do they taste ?

318
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,510
I picked Mah-bo-Tofu

319
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,350
Chicken Bowl

320
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,350
Curry Bowl

321
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,350
Endo

322
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,350
Hamada

323
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,350
Mabo Tofu

324
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,350
Matsumoto

325
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,350
Tanaka

326
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,350
Yamasaki

327
00:09:25,660 --> 00:10:26,550
3 Frozen Bowl Tempura

328
00:09:25,660 --> 00:10:26,550
Yamasaki's 1st Dish

329
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,690
I had curry

330
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,700
I also chose curry

331
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,650
And I'm having curry also

332
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,100
I got the chicken bowl

333
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,480
Chicken Bowl Tempura

334
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,060
Are we good ?

335
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,240
Mabo Tofu Tempura

336
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,190
Couldn't you have picked something other than curry ?

337
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,040
Curry Bowl Tempura

338
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,990
What ?

339
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,790
I chose the Tofu and he got the Chicken

340
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,600
Why did you pick curry when two others already have it ?

341
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,520
Let's keep things balanced

342
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,360
My motto is to eat whatever I want...

343
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,050
I see you never grew out of selfish celebrity status

344
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,450
Itadakimasu

345
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,630
Man, this is still cold

346
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,580
You're right

347
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,260
This is cold

348
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,810
It's too bad because this is good

349
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,520
This is good

350
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,220
Seriously, try mine

351
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,690
It's so good

352
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,930
Let me get all that breading, too

353
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,390
You're right

354
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,530
It's delicious

355
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,010
I'm thinking 9 points

356
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:22,940
Yeah, 9 points

357
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,630
Really ?

358
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,880
That's good news

359
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,290
That made me happy

360
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,480
Yamasaki's 1st Dish: 3 Frozen Bowl Tempura

361
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,480
It could have received a perfect score if fully cooked

362
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,040
Yamasaki's second choice is Jelly-Beans Tempura

363
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,060
Yamasaki's 2nd Dish: Jelly-Belly Tempura

364
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,680
Here we have yet another artsy dish

365
00:10:39,650 --> 00:11:16,400
Jelly-Beans Tempura

366
00:10:39,650 --> 00:11:16,400
Yamasaki's 2nd Dish

367
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,960
It sure is colorful

368
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,060
Itadakimasu

369
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,050
Itadakimasu

370
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,020
How sweet is this ?

371
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,130
Go home, asshole !

372
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,820
This is way too sweet

373
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,550
Well...

374
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,650
It's edible ??

375
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,960
The heat...

376
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,010
The heat really brought out the sugary taste

377
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:11,890
I see

378
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,020
I mean, it doesn't help matters

379
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,740
that the Jelly-Beans are already so sweet

380
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,790
Yamasaki's 2nd Dish: Jelly-Beans Tempura

381
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,790
Criticized for being "too sweet," the dish received 2 points

382
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,000
Next up is Hamada

383
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,520
Tempura By Hamada

384
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,520
What are his choices for Tempura ?

385
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,810
Here's my first one

386
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,530
Oh, haven't seen that in years

387
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:54,600
Dried Kelp Shaving

388
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:54,600
Ingredient

389
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,560
It's Fujikko's Jyuntoro

390
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,060
C'mon, you must have seen this recently

391
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,020
This is Tororo (Dried Kelp Shaving)

392
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,990
Each packet contains one serving so ...

393
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,120
So you're frying that whole thing ?

394
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,010
I see you're frying one packet for each of us

395
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,840
You love the thick and gooey stuff

396
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,010
What do you mean by that ?

397
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,970
I've never seen anyone do that ?

398
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,490
It has more volume than I thought

399
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,620
Here's my second choice

400
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:16,300
Corn Soup

401
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:16,300
Ingredients

402
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:16,300
Sliced Bread

403
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,460
So instead of using conventional tempura batter,

404
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,690
I'm going to use this corn soup

405
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,880
I'm soaking the bread in the soup before frying it

406
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,390
That's really an old-fart's way of thinking

407
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,600
*Use Corn Soup as battering

408
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,020
How will corn soup turn out as the tempura batter ?

409
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,750
First step is to batter the dried kelp

410
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:31,000
Dried Kelp Shaving

411
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:31,000
Hamada's 1st Dish

412
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,470
Man, it looks like a cocoon

413
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,460
You're right

414
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,020
I see

415
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,890
It doesn't want to sink

416
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,460
You're right, it's floating

417
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,020
I have the soup ready in this pan

418
00:12:32,550 --> 00:13:05,000
Bread in Corn Soup Tempura

419
00:12:32,550 --> 00:13:05,000
Hamada's 2nd Dish

420
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,950
I'm going to coat the bread like so

421
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,520
I see you already have the soup ready in a pan

422
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,710
Yes

423
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,090
I've got a feeling that I'm going to like this

424
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,820
Corn soup is one of my favorites

425
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,040
What is this ?

426
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,900
I'm afraid this will be a hit

427
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,150
Very innovative if this works out well

428
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,450
No-frill frying

429
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,200
Dip your hand in !

430
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,870
That was close

431
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,320
I almost had him, too

432
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,000
With such high expectations for Hamada's dish,

433
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,430
how will it taste ?

434
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,430
Hamada's 1st Dish: Dried Kelp Shaving Tempura

435
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,960
First is the Grated Yam Tempura

436
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,430
How does it taste ?

437
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,670
It looks good so far

438
00:13:12,350 --> 00:14:02,800
Dried Kelp Shaving Tempura

439
00:13:12,350 --> 00:14:02,800
Hamada's 1st Dish

440
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,400
How do you like this presentation ?

441
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,720
Well, it sort of resembles a toupee

442
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,680
Yes it does

443
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,430
It has weight to it

444
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,260
It's fluffy

445
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,290
Itadakimasu

446
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,990
It's hot

447
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,570
I don't know what to say...

448
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,640
Hot !

449
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,010
I have to say...

450
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,760
this isn't that bad

451
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:49,160
If this was in smaller pieces, it could be a successful dish

452
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,180
Not like this one giant piece

453
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,160
You think so ?

454
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,020
The inside is still really dense and hard

455
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,410
Look at this

456
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,150
It looks like @#$%

457
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,560
Don't try to duck

458
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,400
Hamada's 1st Dish: Dried Kelp Shaving Tempura

459
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,330
The No-Holds-Barred grated yam receives 5 points

460
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,820
How will this creative corn soup batter idea do ?

461
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,080
Hamada's 2nd Dish:
Bread in Corn Soup Tempura

462
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,310
This dish could just be...

463
00:14:12,650 --> 00:15:41,860
Bread in Corn Soup Tempura

464
00:14:12,650 --> 00:15:41,860
Hamada's 2nd Dish

465
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,440
a breakfast food ?

466
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,040
Right, it could be

467
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,370
I'm getting a good vibe from this

468
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,690
I'm feeling this so far

469
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,050
It smells awesome, too

470
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,070
Very good so far

471
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,730
It does smell good

472
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,960
Really good

473
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,330
Itadakimasu

474
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,050
How about just 10 points for this, yeah ?

475
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,170
That was way too quick

476
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,860
Right, 10 points ?

477
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,900
This is way too delicious

478
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,270
This is awesome

479
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,790
How about starting a food-truck business with this ?

480
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,780
Sound good

481
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,020
Seriously, people on a lunch break would love this

482
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,730
I'm not kidding

483
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,490
I'm telling you this is superb

484
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
Put some salt on it

485
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,430
Yes, salt enhances the flavor

486
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,670
I would give it an "Angel" mark as the score

487
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,020
I wouldn't disagree

488
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,680
Shouldn't we consider marketing this ?

489
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,890
I bet we can

490
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,880
As a "Gaki No Tsukai" product

491
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,220
Let's do this

492
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,110
I'm telling you right now, in about a month or so,

493
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,330
when you're out and about shooting some show,

494
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,310
you'll find Hamada selling this out of a food-truck

495
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,240
You mean, Hamada-san will personally be running the business ?

496
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,500
He's running the business

497
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,680
Well, he ain't frugal for nothing

498
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,190
Are you saying he's a cheapskate ?

499
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,400
Hamada's 2nd Dish:Bread in Corn Soup Tempura

500
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,420
Hamada's second recipe receives an unprecedented "Angel" mark

501
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,130
Tempura by Matsumoto

502
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,730
Last up is Matsumoto

503
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,090
What is his ultimate recipe ?

504
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,320
First up is this

505
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,390
Pizza

506
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:12,550
Ingredient

507
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:12,550
Pizza

508
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,910
Why not fry this whole thing ?

509
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,050
Fry the whole pie ?

510
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,460
May I say this is "An Assassin from Napoli, Italy" ?

511
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,520
Duly noted

512
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,940
Well, I wasn't expecting any response other than that

513
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,300
I would have done the same

514
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,070
Forget "An Assassin from Napoli"

515
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,590
And !

516
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,280
I'm fully aware of the risk, but...

517
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,730
What ?

518
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:29,500
Gari Gari Kun Popsicle

519
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:29,500
Ingredient

520
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,370
Gari Gari kun (a Popsicle)

521
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,560
Well...

522
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,260
I could see fried ice cream but...

523
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,230
I know, this is more like a Popsicle

524
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,900
His first ingredient, pizza,

525
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:43,650
Matsumoto's 1st Dish

526
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:43,650
Pizza Tempura

527
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,190
requires covering the whole pie in batter

528
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,740
I need to accept more challenges in life

529
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,190
Looks like a giant rice cracker

530
00:16:44,900 --> 00:17:08,100
Gari Gari kun Tempura

531
00:16:44,900 --> 00:17:08,100
Matsumoto's 2nd Dish

532
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,390
Second is the Gari Gari kun ice pop

533
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,340
I don't know what to say...

534
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,410
Since I saw that your sweet-themed ingredients didn't do well

535
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,290
Like the Frisk and Jelly-Beans

536
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,650
Wouldn't this just melt ?

537
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,270
Yes, it does

538
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,040
I thought so

539
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,580
You need to fry this with care

540
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,450
Well then !

541
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,670
Before we get to try these dishes

542
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,000
And like I've always done in the past...

543
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,670
Again ?

544
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,550
I have one more ingredient

545
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,470
Here it is

546
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,400
What the hell is this ?

547
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,760
Bee Larvae

548
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:42,050
Bee Hive

549
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:42,050
Ingredient

550
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,830
They're in a honeycomb

551
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,330
I see they're all in there

552
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,680
They're in the Larvae stage

553
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,240
I thought I'd fry this up

554
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,270
This is an expensive ingredient, isn't it ?

555
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,450
I believe so

556
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,030
Let me say this will be the world premier

557
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,760
of a residence getting fried

558
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,680
You're right

559
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,670
I suppose the honeycomb is their residence

560
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,010
Right, their house will be fried

561
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,060
After covering it in batter,

562
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:50,200
Bee Hive Tempura

563
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:50,200
Matsumoto's 3rd Dish

564
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,480
the chef fries the whole honeycomb

565
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,590
They're about to enter unchartered flavor territory

566
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:55,590
Matsumoto's 1st Dish: Pizza Tempura

567
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,900
Here's Matsumoto's Pizza Tempura

568
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,710
How is it ?

569
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,700
It looks delicious

570
00:17:58,100 --> 00:19:11,300
Matsumoto's 1st Dish

571
00:17:58,100 --> 00:19:11,300
Pizza Tempura

572
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,080
I've seen this kind of dish before

573
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,170
Can I say that an Italian would never think to do this ?

574
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,790
Let me just slice right into it

575
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,840
I don't know what to call this tool though

576
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,290
It really does look good

577
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,930
I'm into the crunchy sound

578
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,780
The pizza got crunchier from being fried

579
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,140
It's been crunched !

580
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,250
It's the crunchiest !!

581
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,990
I'd call this the "Anarchy in Crunch"

582
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,540
And don't forget "The Assassin from Napoli"

583
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,010
"Ah here comes the Assassin from Napoli"

584
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,190
That's what comedian Hikomaro would say about this

585
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,290
Itadakimasu

586
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,480
Itadakimasu

587
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,780
The crumbs are looking...

588
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,580
Delicious !

589
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,130
Good

590
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,680
This is fantastic

591
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,610
But this was...

592
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,770
I was expecting this to be good...

593
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,220
Don't get me wrong, this is great but

594
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,550
it was almost a given that fried pizza would be good

595
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,290
Well, I've always thought pizza needed more crunch

596
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,290
Now, you're just bullshitting

597
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,720
You're being "teacher's pet"

598
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,270
I'm serious though

599
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,000
Matsumoto's 1st Dish: Pizza Tempura

600
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,180
The crunchiness of pizza helps score a perfect 10

601
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,770
Matsumoto's 2nd Dish: Gari Gari kun Tempura

602
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,350
Matsumoto's second ingredient is the Popsicle

603
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,500
How does it taste ?

604
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,720
I believe this is a home-run

605
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,580
I don't know...

606
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,680
It's a result of thinking "outside of box"

607
00:19:24,780 --> 00:20:05,300
Gari Gari kun Tempura

608
00:19:24,780 --> 00:20:05,300
Matsumoto's 2nd Dish

609
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,000
As I said before, frying ice cream makes sense but...

610
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,710
Remember there's no loser here

611
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,710
That's cool

612
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,420
I recommend this as a dessert

613
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,990
Itadakimasu

614
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,740
What is this ?

615
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,650
This isn't so bad ?

616
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,550
No

617
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,900
Well, the ice Popsicle is OK but...

618
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,180
This one definitely missed the target

619
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,300
No, listen

620
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,420
We can't be fooled with this

621
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,960
Listen

622
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,530
This is OK once I take off the breading

623
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,760
Huh ?

624
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,180
Then you're just eating the "Gari Gari kun"

625
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,010
Matsumoto's 2nd Dish: Gari Gari kun Tempura

626
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,880
Gari Gari kun is better left alone and receives one point

627
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,480
The last item is fried honeycomb

628
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:15,780
Matsumoto's 3rd Dish: Bee Hive Tempura

629
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,380
How does it taste ?

630
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,230
Bon Appétit

631
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:53,400
Honeycomb Tempura

632
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:53,400
Matsumoto's 3rd Dish

633
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,400
Here it is

634
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,640
See ?

635
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,480
What do you think of this...

636
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,890
Is it a dish for royalty ?

637
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,150
You're slicing that, too ?

638
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,860
I really don't want this

639
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,470
This looks like Buddha's head

640
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,550
This looks like Buddha's head

641
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,280
You're right

642
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,690
Is that soft ?

643
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,770
You saw something ?

644
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,000
Incredible

645
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,770
What's wrong with you guys ?

646
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,440
This is so edible

647
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,070
I can't do it

648
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,720
Rumor has it that once you try bee larvae, you'll be hooked

649
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,810
I heard they're sweet beyond belief

650
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,420
Let's do rock-paper-scissors, and the loser eats it

651
00:20:57,800 --> 00:23:15,750
Honeycomb Tempura

652
00:20:57,800 --> 00:23:15,750
Matsumoto's 3rd Dish

653
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,190
Why do we have to eat this ?

654
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,320
I don't wanna lose this one

655
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,140
I'm spared !

656
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,370
Hamada-san, I always knew that you had the balls to try this

657
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,390
Wait a minute

658
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,950
This piece should do

659
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,840
That is one terrifying looking food

660
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,430
Help me hold him down

661
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,990
Eat one like this ?

662
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,480
Good luck

663
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,100
That's a cute little mouth

664
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,750
Open your mouth, Damn it !

665
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,040
Hamada Sensei, please

666
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,980
I seriously don't wanna do this !

667
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,740
Why do you gotta be like @#%$ ?!

668
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,990
Bite into it like a man

669
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,590
Open wide

670
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,250
Try it, try it

671
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,570
Anybody want to try this ?

672
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,820
Anyone ?

673
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:26,960
Well, nobody seems to be really interested...

674
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,560
"Wait, wait for me !"

675
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,610
That voice !

676
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,540
That's a really familiar voice !

677
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,200
Heipo

678
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,530
Could that be... ?

679
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,840
That's Heipo-san

680
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,100
Don't be upset, Heipo !

681
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,210
We didn't forget about you !

682
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,790
You didn't need to shout out like that

683
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,900
Oh boy, that's really...

684
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,970
a larvae...

685
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,890
Yep, we've got Heipo-san here

686
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,000
Itadakimasu

687
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,010
Don't spit it out

688
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,870
Give me a sec

689
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,110
Who are you talking to ?

690
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,610
What's going on ?

691
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,090
What's he doing ?

692
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,220
What's with him ?

693
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,140
He's molting !

694
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,540
Stop Lion Dancing !

695
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,130
Why don't you just try a single one ?

696
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,620
OK, I'll just eat one

697
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,780
Make sure you taste it

698
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,290
Delicious !!

699
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,480
Tasty !

700
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,800
I'm not kidding, it's really good !

701
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,150
This is awesome !

702
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,390
You're kidding

703
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,580
You should try this, it's really good

704
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,460
Did you just reboot your brain or something ?

705
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,370
Wow, this is really good !
