1
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,470
-Let's get started
-Yeah, let's get started

2
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,680
-For today...
-Yes

3
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,540
I personally think that season 3 was fantastic

4
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,860
But surprisingly enough, some people like season 2 instead

5
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,660
So we can see that people are starting to
form their own preferences for Documental

6
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,380
season3 New System
"Zombie System"

7
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:20,180
We want to create a chaotic situation

8
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,850
This chaos becomes apparent as it comes close to the end

9
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,770
And being active as a zombie is very impressive as well

10
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:40,450
Some contestants may even want to
become a zombie as soon as possible

11
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,310
Basically aiming for zombie

12
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,980
Although this makes me ask "why are you even here"

13
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,150
The constantly evolving experiment

14
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,450
The ways to enjoy Documental

15
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,930
I understand that you could be focusing on
who will be the winner and even become emotional

16
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,690
However you could enjoy the show in another way

17
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,120
If you try to focus on the fun parts other than the competition

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,220
Every episode, every season,

19
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,660
It could give rise to comedy duos like Nyanko Star

20
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,490
Although Nyanko Star never actually won

21
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,710
Many people say that this show
has a lot of inappropriate dirty jokes

22
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,490
But I don't think there's any dirty jokes at all for this show

23
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,060
Those are not dirty jokes

24
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,750
Those are ART

25
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,250
Art?

26
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,330
People need to learn more about art

27
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:06,000
When I took a walk this morning, some beautiful
hell flowers were blossoming on the edge of the eaves

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,880
Have you been visiting your loved ones at the cemetery?

29
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,520
That being said, I would like to offer you an invitation

30
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,950
Could you prepare one million yen
and gather at a designated location?

31
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,280
I shall reinitiate Documental

32
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,320
I have prepared a reward of 10 million yen for the winner

33
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,320
Of course, participation is voluntary

34
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,050
For those of you who wish to participate, I shall inform you of the time and location

35
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,450
Awaiting your reply

36
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,790
During the fruitful autumn,
I hope good things will happen to you as well

37
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,630
Sincerely, Matsumoto Hitoshi

38
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,450
THE PARTICIPATING COMEDIANS ENTER

39
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,010
Someone's coming

40
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,580
The first one?

41
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,070
Yes, you are

42
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,750
-So here comes Nobu
-I'm the first one...

43
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,300
Well, it doesn't feel good to be the first one

44
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,250
Hello, I'm Nobu from Chidori

45
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,580
What's this?

46
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,220
Here it comes!

47
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,880
This shouldn't be for Nobu

48
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,790
Nobu is definitely an all-round player

49
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,010
His responses are fast and interesting

50
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,030
While it's possible to get a laugh out of Nobu

51
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,890
But he's the kind of person
who can turn others into Owarai

52
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,710
The Tsukkomi field's addictive kingpin

53
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:07,520
However, I don't think he will be an aggressive player

54
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,670
And he probably won't be interesting at all if he becomes a zombie

55
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,550
Since I'm not a Boke

56
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,040
It's not going to be interesting

57
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,050
I don't mean that I've been lazy or weakened

58
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,630
But recently, my jobs are all about
food reviews for cakes at Shibuya or Harajuku

59
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,030
And I even thought that am I really a comedian now?

60
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,940
So I shall become a comedian again right here

61
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,880
and take on this challenge

62
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,660
How could I be the first one?
Who else is coming?

63
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,950
-This is where it all begins
-Who else is coming?

64
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,000
This is such a big suitcase, is he from Spain or somewhere

65
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,950
It's Itoda-san...

66
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,130
I'm Itoda Jun from Speed Wagon

67
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,180
Please let me do this

68
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,520
Excuse me. Hello

69
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,330
In terms of the ability to attack and defense as a comedian

70
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,210
I'm below average for both of them

71
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,350
He's someone who cares nothing about the atmosphere

72
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,120
He has a strong heart and spirit

73
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,280
Did you forget about it? It's me, it's me

74
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,550
Hamburger!!

75
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,850
Having a strong heart could be very threatening

76
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,550
It's fearful to have this kind of person

77
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,920
He's probably aggressive and tries to attack

78
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,950
However, the attacks that Itoda
think is an attack, won't be attacks at all

79
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,550
But the ones that he don't think
is an attack, may possibly be an attack

80
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,600
Jun-san is awful, this is awful

81
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,690
Even if I try to think about it,
it won't turn out the way I thought anyway

82
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,050
So I rather leave everything to chance,
and hope for something good to happen

83
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:27,620
I want to show a different Itoda, that has never been shown

84
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,290
-You didn't even tell your partner right?
-Yes, I didn't

85
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,980
Because they said not to tell anyone

86
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,180
He never learns his lessons

87
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,100
-It's my third time now
-Third time?

88
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,540
It's already my third time

89
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,690
-I thought Fujimon-san won't be here for the third time
-So it's Nobu-chan and Jun-chan

90
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,010
Hello, I'm Fujimoto from Fujiwara

91
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:04,700
This time, I really want to win

92
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,690
Haha, come on, I knew it

93
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,320
This always come to me

94
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,650
He is almost like a regular member for this show

95
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:20,690
Fujimon is really helpful for being the mood maker

96
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:26,090
Some fans even say that I'm being too nice to Fujimon

97
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:32,680
No I'm not being nice to him,
but it's always good to have a mood maker

98
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,630
The perpetual motion comedian

99
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,820
In my 29th year as a comedian

100
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:44,650
This is the first time for me to
find the field or battlefield that suits me

101
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,510
Last time, I almost won for being the last 4 contestants to stay

102
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,720
I even thought I am going to win

103
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,120
The painful regret for having a moment of relaxation

104
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:20,620
Doing Tsukkomi to every detail could be my way to fight

105
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,620
We're all Tsukkomi right?

106
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,620
-Yeah you're right
-For the three of us

107
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,690
Maybe I should sit on the other side

108
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,390
That's a small bag

109
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,790
-I always use this
-That's a really small one

110
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,020
Because I'm not that type of comedian

111
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,780
Well yeah

112
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,340
It's you again?!

113
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,020
-Why are you coming?
-You're always coming

114
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,370
Fujimon is the one that always comes

115
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,750
You too dude

116
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,350
Hello, I'm Kukky from Yaseibakudan

117
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,750
Here it comes

118
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,260
Again?

119
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,140
She's just my manager

120
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,380
Kukky is actually easily amused

121
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,890
But on top of that, his attacks are even more powerful

122
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,300
The comedian that kills comedian

123
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,220
Who I hated the most was Kukky

124
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,720
That was awful

125
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,690
You have no idea what he will do

126
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:38,850
The zombie Kukky is just terrifying

127
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,420
Seriously, Yoshimoto has took in someone inconceivable

128
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,820
This may sound boring, but to be honest, for my third time

129
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,980
I want to win this contest for real

130
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,590
I won't hesitate to break my eardrum just to win this contest

131
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,720
I will hang up their cheeks
with fishing gut and make it a smiley face

132
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,120
I want to be greedy and win just once

133
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,620
Hey, our watches match, stop that

134
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,910
Alright, let's get it over with

135
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:20,060
Yeah, it's dangerous if we found out after the contest starts

136
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,410
How come?

137
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,920
-How could this overlap
-Stop this kind of happenings dude

138
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,580
Damn, here comes a strong player

139
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,260
Even women are joining this?

140
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,170
So even women are joining

141
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,230
-That's a huge one
-That's amazing

142
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,920
Please excuse me for this

143
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,890
I'm Kurosawa Kazuko from Morisantyu, and I'm single

144
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,350
Ah, my hands are shaking

145
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,200
She is the only woman in this contest

146
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,050
Having a women in this contest makes it interesting

147
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,290
For example, Oojima who joined in season 2

148
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,040
Morisantyu is a group with high potential

149
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,020
No one can possibly stop Kurosawa if she freaks out

150
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:37,310
The meat that sings and dances

151
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,780
If a women eventually wins, then it could possibly be Kurosawa

152
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,250
But Kurosawa has one weakness

153
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,670
What is Kurosawa's weakness?

154
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,840
Kurosawa is on her period

155
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,820
This may also turns out good though

156
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,620
What should I do?

157
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,450
I'm so scared

158
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,250
Seriously, why are you coming?

159
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,820
I didn't win any competitions, not the King of Conte as well

160
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,520
I want to work hard and win Documental

161
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:17,420
So there's a chance for other female comedians to join again

162
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,030
Are you fine with this?

163
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:24,250
But I'm nearly forty already,
so I'm not interested in those sex appeal

164
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,850
-Oh I see
-I'm not in my 20s

165
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,810
What do you mean by sex appeal? We're not doing it for you

166
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,610
It's not?

167
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,470
This can't be true

168
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,570
-How come?
-You both are here?

169
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,060
Yeah, this is the main point

170
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,510
Why are you here?

171
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,020
The first time to have a Kombi

172
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,330
No way, Nobu is here

173
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,650
So for this time

174
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,590
We tried something new, like a new gimmick

175
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,220
To have a comedy duo joining together

176
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,250
I'm Daigo from Chidori

177
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,120
I will not laugh

178
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,560
So I'm being invited by Matsumoto-san

179
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,680
We invited both Nobu and Daigo as a comedy duo

180
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,890
This is actually the first time for this show

181
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:35,520
Which is also an interesting attempt
to know what is going to happen

182
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:42,920
But Chidori is interesting anyway,
and probably both of them suits this show

183
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,210
Yeah, they are interesting

184
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,880
I am having high expectation for them

185
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,380
But just one thing, they are quite easily amused

186
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,810
The crude and shy bald guy

187
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:02,450
I'm not good at making others laugh,
while staying calm in the face

188
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,750
I'm the type of comedian that
makes others laugh while laughing

189
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,920
So this may turn out to be an awful day

190
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,420
No one knows what will happen until it starts

191
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:18,330
If Nobu is here, then we can always
do the usual Boke and Tsukkomi pattern

192
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:23,480
However, he's not here, so I'm not sure what to do

193
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,010
-This attempt is amazing
-Eh, what should I do

194
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,250
Why is Chidori coming, you guys are being recommended, huh?

195
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,580
Don't say that dude

196
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,350
Someone's coming

197
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,760
-This guy is a strong player
-For real?

198
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,150
You're wearing different glasses today?

199
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,450
I left it at home, and I'm wearing the one for performances

200
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,010
I was too nervous, and left it at my lobby

201
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,420
Hello, I'm Iio Kazuki from Zun

202
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,750
I'm nervous as a cat now

203
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,050
Excuse me

204
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,910
Here it comes

205
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,120
I've been using those gags a long time ago

206
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,120
What kind of gags are effective for Documental?

207
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,840
Can this camera take a shot of my feet please

208
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:19,410
I was model posing for the last 7~8 minutes

209
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,880
I have many gags

210
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,400
But for those that are interesting,
I can count on the fingers of one hand

211
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,040
Iio will probably attack from somewhere that no one expected

212
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,420
And with weapons that no one is familiar with

213
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,390
The orthodox inheritor of Sekine faction comedy

214
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,900
He's not the type of player who
makes all-out effort in all rounds

215
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,550
But instead attacking in the 5th or 8th round

216
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,980
I don't think I have any explosive power

217
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,750
I'm more like traditional Chinese medicine,
which takes some time for it to work

218
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,150
Sanma-san said I taste like side dishes 15 years ago

219
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,250
Like the curry rice being sold at Sushi restaurants

220
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,420
If I lost the competition, I will walk back home

221
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,850
And praise myself before I sleep,
because I'll be exhausted from walking

222
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,330
It would be hilarious if Yasu-san came instead

223
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,450
*Yasu-san is Kazuki's partner

224
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,450
Don't say that you idiot

225
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,580
This guy is terrible

226
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,050
Yeah, this guy will definitely make me laugh

227
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,750
This guy has a funny face, which is cunning

228
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,140
He looks like he was immersed in formalin right?

229
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,600
I'm Nishizawa Yusuke from Daian

230
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,120
I will try my best

231
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,790
Excuse me

232
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,110
Again?

233
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,930
Oh, it's not for me?

234
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,980
Just shut up for once

235
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,430
-No, it's not for you Tsuda-san
-Eh, really? Not for me?

236
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,120
I quite like Daian's Manzai, and I've always been watching it

237
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,880
It's quite interesting, and it sometimes amazes me

238
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,820
-This is a chance for you to shine bro
-Yeah I know it's a chance

239
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,520
But I have the impression that he never laughs

240
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,640
And he's strong in this sense

241
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,570
Although people use to say that I have a poker face

242
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,170
But I'm actually easily amused

243
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,170
So I have to be careful of this

244
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,960
We're all the same when we are in the wrestling ring

245
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:37,250
So this chance to beat my seniors as a junior is really exciting

246
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,380
This is what motivates me, and this is what I'm aiming for

247
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,710
He's funny even if he just turns around

248
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,820
Is he an absent-minded character?

249
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,580
No, not absent-minded

250
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,230
Not absent-minded, but people say that I have a poker face

251
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,230
-But I'm actually easily amused
-Yeah he is

252
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,880
Oh, really?

253
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,420
I never saw Nishizawa laughing out loud though

254
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,360
He's really easily amused

255
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,020
Here comes the 9th contestant

256
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,220
Someone's here

257
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,920
Hello everybody

258
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,940
This is terrible

259
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,750
This is freaking me out

260
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,810
You monster

261
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,990
-I know everybody here
-Of course

262
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,590
Of course dude

263
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,070
What is going to happen, seriously

264
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,840
I'm Kurochan from Yasuda Dai Circus

265
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,980
I'm definitely going to get the 10 million

266
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,370
Eh, what's going on?

267
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,210
Letter?

268
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,390
Really?

269
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,440
This man is the unknown

270
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,220
I seriously have no idea what will happen

271
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,350
Maybe everyone will be making fun of him?

272
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,950
And if Fujimon starts making fun of Kurochan,
that's gonna be hilarious

273
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,500
Fujimon x Kurochan

274
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,950
That's enough dude

275
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,300
Just stay calm and act normal

276
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,070
Japan's record holder as prank victim

277
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:10,990
But depending on how people make fun of him,
something may start to change inside him

278
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,170
People always say that, for me to survive,
I have to become the toy of TV shows

279
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,010
It's impossible for me to attack

280
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:24,440
I don't quite understand Owarai,
so I won't understand the high level gags anyway

281
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,630
So I believe I have high defense in this sense

282
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,720
This could actually be a chance right?

283
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,750
If people start to think
"Kurochan can actually make people laugh as well"

284
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,580
Then maybe I can have jobs other than Dokkiri

285
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,370
I'm going to change myself here

286
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,460
I really want to change, and move one step forward

287
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,850
I'll try my best

288
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,520
My parents will prepare the money for me

289
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,770
Just one more person

290
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,720
Who's it gonna be

291
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,300
Maybe the last person is the worst

292
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,510
The last contestant must be surprising for them

293
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,450
I won't laugh if it's Watabe-san

294
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,100
Here comes the last person

295
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,240
-This can't be true
-Really?

296
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,040
You're fine with this?

297
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,200
Why is it these members?

298
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,800
He's definitely qualified though

299
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,580
He don't need this money right?

300
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,580
Hello, I'm Miyasako from Ameagari-Kesshitai

301
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,850
Excuse me

302
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,460
Seriously?

303
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,230
Well, many things happened recently

304
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,180
So I'm not mentally ready to join this kind of show

305
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,880
It's impossible for me to laugh, except in the workplace

306
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,700
-Before that kind of thing happens...
-Can you not say "that kind of thing"

307
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,260
What do you mean by "that kind of thing"

308
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:04,140
If I join the contest with this mental status,
maybe I'll be able to win the 10 million

309
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,370
I never thought Miyasako will accept the invitation

310
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,550
He probably changed right? After that kind of thing happened

311
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,730
The life-and-death off-white comedian

312
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,450
This man is absolutely crazy

313
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,850
He's amazing when he goes nuts

314
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:25,410
His explosive power is truly terrifying

315
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,550
I'm aggressive even towards seniors or whosoever

316
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,320
If there's someone that I don't feel comfortable with

317
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,180
I'll lay him down right from the beginning

318
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:42,530
Recently, most of my jobs are about being the host

319
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,040
There wasn't much chance for me to just mess around

320
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,550
So I want to join this

321
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,380
Miyasako-san is joining as well?

322
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,880
We need to be considerate

323
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,840
It's cunning to do things as a Konbi though

324
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,500
We talked about this and it's fine

325
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,100
The rules didn't prohibit this

326
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,950
-That's fast
-He's trotting

327
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,280
He somehow looks like Takeshi-san though

328
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:41,350
Seriously, having these members to gather is already interesting

329
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,000
Is this even going to take 6 hours?

330
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,960
Yeah, this is definitely going to be awful

331
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,980
I really think so this time

332
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,610
Many of us are easily amused

333
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,090
Did this ever took less than 6 hours before?

334
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,620
-Nope
-No, right

335
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,560
-But for Kuro-chan, while people around him are always laughing
-Yes, exactly

336
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,660
I never saw Kuro-chan laughing

337
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,530
Yeah, I never saw Kuro-chan smile

338
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,820
He always looks embarrassed

339
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,420
That's probably beka...because I'm always in a Dokkiri right?

340
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,840
He said "beka"...

341
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,020
No, some strange words just popped up.
Please forgive me <3

342
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,910
That reaction is no good dude

343
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,930
And Fujimon you're doing too much
brilliant Tsukkomi to those Boke

344
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,850
-That is just making everyone laugh
-Yeah it is

345
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,750
But that just makes me respond spontaneously

346
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,380
Please do it at a different timing then

347
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,210
Yeah all these Tsukkomi, the same applies to Nobu

348
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,030
-Kurochan just sticks in our mind
-Yeah, exactly

349
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,200
He's pouring his soul out to his Boke

350
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,550
No way

351
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,700
It's also a surprise for Miyasako-san to accept this

352
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,730
This is surprising

353
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,930
Well, probably because that kind of thing happened right

354
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,650
My wife said don't let anyone make fun of this today

355
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,160
So you guys can do this, I won't say this anymore

356
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,870
No please

357
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,640
And yesterday, I went to watch you guys Chidori at Lumine

358
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,410
Seriously?

359
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,850
Their manzai performance

360
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,350
From the VIP seats?

361
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,520
No, I'm just sitting at the last row

362
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,630
I wanted to watch these guys at Lumine

363
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,780
Oh my god, that's just terrifying

364
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,750
The support for Chidori is amazing

365
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,550
Well, yeah, not bad

366
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,680
But the Manzai didn't go over very well compared to the support

367
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,910
If you call that didn't go over very well, then how well did you go?

368
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,330
Yeah, it did go over very well, it did

369
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,960
But the support is amazing compared to it

370
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,780
-So the support is too amazing
-Yes, yes

371
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,320
This really surprised me

372
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,180
Have you been immersed in formalin?

373
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,730
No I'm not immersed in formalin, for quite a while

374
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,640
I'm not immersed in anything

375
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,350
Have you been at the bottom of the sea all this time?

376
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,980
No I was at Osaka all this time

377
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,550
Have you been eating rock salt?

378
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,280
Humans become like this for eating rock salt?

379
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,050
Are you the dead body of Murloc?

380
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,210
No, I'm not the dead body of Murloc

381
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,140
-Really?
-Yes

382
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,420
Are you halfway through an experiment?

383
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,950
-Halfway done?
-Not at all

384
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,540
Have you been anesthetized?

385
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,410
No I'm not under anesthesia

386
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,580
Please stop this, these jokes are sticking in my mind

387
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,690
Yeah you're right, I'm sorry

388
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,030
-I think Itoda is a strong player
-He definitely is

389
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,170
-He's gone through a lot
-Yeah, exactly

390
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,910
So Itoda definitely has a strong heart

391
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,620
Yeah I'm sure he has a strong heart, he's gone through a lot

392
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,980
Don't think I've ever seen him laughing out loud

393
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,030
Yeah, he's always the one attacking

394
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,540
No, I always laugh too

395
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,960
Please let me do this

396
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,140
This guy have a lot of characters

397
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,030
This is also a monster right

398
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,470
And he joined for consecutive seasons right?

399
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,900
But I have zero defense, absolutely zero defense

400
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,880
You have a character called Pooh-san, the bear Pooh-san right?

401
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,820
Yeah, the teddy-bear-chan

402
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,120
I bursted into laughter during the hardest time of my life

403
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,830
That saved your life

404
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,830
Owarai saved your life

405
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:58,350
Yeah it saved my life, but if he does that in front of me...

406
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,210
He's crazy, he's absolutely crazy

407
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,080
So he's definitely qualified to sit here

408
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,400
No, no, no

409
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,520
And Kurosawa is on her period today

410
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,050
-Really?
-Yes, be careful

411
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:16,020
You may hear some sounds like "pilipili",
because I'm wearing the 40cm menstrual pad

412
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,120
-The overnight pad
-40cm is the largest one isn't it?

413
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,040
-What's about the 40cm
-That's the largest one

414
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,220
So it's like this long?

415
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,450
You can even hide your belly button with that

416
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,640
Well, well

417
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,070
There's nothing we can do about it

418
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,830
So I won't go through the rules in detail

419
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,730
Fujimon should know the rules clearly right?

420
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,010
Yes, it's already my third time

421
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:50,940
This time, we will be keeping the zombie rule

422
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,140
So you can reborn as a zombie, and try to make everyone laugh

423
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,350
For example, when 2 people stay till the end

424
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,250
And then here comes the zombies

425
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,080
and let's say this person laughs

426
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,800
However, the another person is yet to win the contest

427
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:15,020
Even though this person is the only one left,
however, if there's still like an hour left

428
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,270
You still need to endure the zombies for another hour

429
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,320
That's impossible

430
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,120
And after that, you win

431
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,780
So the person that endures for 6 hours wins the game

432
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,520
That's just absolutely impossible

433
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,120
And if everyone laughs?

434
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,690
Then it's a draw

435
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,860
As if nothing had happened

436
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:38,260
But if this is the case, it just means that
the contest was a hilarious and impressive one

437
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,680
And it's also possible for both of you
from Chidori to stay till the end

438
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,760
For our case, Matsumoto-san

439
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,090
Can we do whatever we want to do together as a Konbi?

440
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,950
-When everyone is still here
-Yes

441
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,290
-As a Konbi?
-Yes, as a Konbi

442
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,710
Yeah, it's fine, isn't it?

443
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,130
So we can do anything

444
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,690
So everybody, please hand me your money

445
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,500
This hurts too

446
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:08,020
I actually thought that maybe
we don't need the orange card this time

447
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,750
There's zombies anyway

448
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:16,310
So you will be red carded after getting one yellow card

449
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:21,420
This adds up to 3 million now...

450
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,820
No matter how much you earn...hahaha

451
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,360
What's fun about this?

452
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,320
-It's 3 million dude
-Every time you come, you pay

453
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
But there's no reason to decline the invitation

454
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,720
-Kukky is the same too
-Yeah it's 3 million now

455
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,990
Your wife is going to kill you

456
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,010
And you're just earning ¥16000 for each show

457
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,680
-You're earning that much?
-Not much at all dude

458
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:50,850
But I'm really happy and touched by the fact that,
everyone is able to collect and bring in this one million

459
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,420
-When I watched this series..
-Excuse me

460
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,780
What are you doing dude?

461
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,400
Because I wasn't able to hand this over

462
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,680
-It's filthy dude
-No it's not dirty, it was even washed by the rain

463
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,680
And why is it coming apart?

464
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,540
Why didn't you tie it up first?

465
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,280
Because it took 5 times to withdraw
one million at the convenience stores ATM

466
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,630
Yeah, you can only withdraw ¥200,000 at a time

467
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,060
Then borrow a rubber band

468
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,360
Yeah, there must be some rubber bands

469
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,200
What kind of condom?

470
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,850
*Rubber band and condom have the same pronunciation

471
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,960
Rubber band dude

472
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,850
Why did that become a dirty joke

473
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,280
It's not started yet

474
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,170
It's not started yet dude

475
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,450
So this is mine...

476
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,870
I'm paying for this one million although I'm not even joining

477
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:35,060
This is really deducted from my wages every time

478
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,710
This is really shocking

479
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,180
-What's going on
-I'm serious

480
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,070
He's saying this every time right?

481
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,460
But I know how much savings he has,
so I just feel like "what is this guy even talking about"

482
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,890
That's not the main point, I'm hosting this show,
yet still being deducted for 1 million, that's just awkward

483
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:56,130
-Well, some of us can still pay for it, but the others...
-No, no, don't say that

484
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,920
-Having Ku-chan to pay three million just hurts like hell to him
-Yeah it is

485
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,410
We all have the same feeling towards one million

486
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,540
That's just the same, all the same

487
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,720
This is amazing

488
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,840
-Can I touch it?
-This aura is amazing

489
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,040
This is amazing right?

490
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,120
Although it's the same amount of money,
but crisp new bills feel completely different

491
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,780
It's quite strict when it comes to our facial expressions right?

492
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,550
To what extent is a grin forgivable?

493
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:31,250
I just want you to keep in mind that
you should always keep a straight face

494
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,720
Yamamoto has been laughing slightly all the time in the last season

495
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,820
Oouji is close too right?

496
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:41,890
Yeah Oouji is close too.
Well, you don't need to be completely straight-faced

497
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,290
But Nobu this face is out

498
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,380
-Nobu has a smirking face
-Yeah you're right

499
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,120
So you have to keep a pouting face

500
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
Yeah, that's it

501
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,000
That's a good one

502
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,520
This is awful in another sense

503
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,020
I do think that's a good face though

504
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,960
No way, please don't

505
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,280
But can you keep that face for 6 hours?

506
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,580
I'm gonna make myself laugh

507
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,400
You look like young Babyshambles

508
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,340
Well, although it's important to win the contest

509
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:18,650
But Owarai fans may actually prefer people like Ku-chan,
who makes the contest much more interesting as a zombie

510
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,830
-Yeah that's true
-So just keep that in mind

511
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,280
It's not always about winning

512
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:22,960
Is it going to start?

513
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,980
-Yeah, it's starting soon
-Oh dear, give me a second

514
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,040
Wait a moment, give me a moment please

515
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,820
Just one more thing, starting from this time

516
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,750
You can call for food delivery here

517
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,200
Using the outside line, and that is inside line

518
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,140
Use the outside line to call for food delivery

519
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,480
Well, if there's anything else, I'll let you guys know

520
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,150
So that's all for now

521
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:55,010
And you can play with these things over here

522
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:55,800
Good luck

523
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,340
It starts as Matsumoto-san leaves?

524
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,260
After I leave, and as the room light changes, the contest starts

525
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,950
-Got it
-This is terrifying

526
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,390
-Good luck guys
-Thank you

527
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,180
Good bye

528
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,840
Should I smoke a cigarette

529
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,340
-We can smoke here?
-Yes it's fine

530
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,300
Should we put our bags over there

531
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,390
We need to laugh now more than ever

532
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,830
What is this atmosphere

533
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,180
Where is my bag, oh I see...

534
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,080
It's about time to start

535
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,850
START!

536
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,940
It just started?

537
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,380
Yeah, it started

538
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,270
-It started
-Got it

539
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,940
-It started guys
-Okay

540
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,550
This atmosphere is abosolutely awful

541
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,850
Yeah, that was unexpected

542
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:02,020
The last drop of my pee came out at the same time,
as the opening bell's "faaa" sound

543
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,740
That was a nice joke

544
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,820
Yeah, that was a nice "faaa", a nice timing

545
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,720
Daigo was already laughing slightly just now

546
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,550
-What?
-You were laughing slightly right?

547
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,640
-You're laughing right?
-You mean this?

548
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,680
You can't do that, you can't laugh even if you're just asking

549
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,460
Yeah, please warn him about this

550
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,940
Wait a second, which face?

551
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,020
-Do it again
-You laughed half way through

552
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,500
Wait, so this is out?

553
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,580
That counts as out too, do you understand?

554
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,620
You're out if you smile

555
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,900
You can't laugh just because
you're asking "does this count as laugh"

556
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,120
-So I'm out?
-Just be careful

557
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,880
Well, so this is just an explanation

558
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,200
You're seriously out if you get a red card

559
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,060
-Why is there water dripping?
-So then I'll be out?

560
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,370
This is the sound of the toilet

561
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,880
What happened to Nobu's pee again?

562
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,420
What's that dripping sound?

563
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,610
What happened to Nobu's pee again?
I wasn't listening

564
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,400
You're annoying dude, that guy is annoying

565
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,150
There's even a mic in the toilet

566
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,840
-A mic?
-Yes

567
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Leaving that aside, let's talk about Nobu's pee

568
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,160
You are annoying

569
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,350
Don't bother me

570
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,550
Come on, you guys are childhood friends right?
Please don't argue anymore

571
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,750
Why does he keeps talking about my pee?

572
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,430
The last drop?

573
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,800
Let's stop talking about pee

574
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,090
When his last drop of pee fell to the toilet

575
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,820
-The opening bell went "faaa"
-So Nobu said that?

576
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,730
Yes, yes, that's all I said

577
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,240
-Iio-san can you do an opening gag for us?
-Let's go for it?

578
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,290
Yeah, just to cheer us up

579
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,230
-Like saying that "now it starts"
-Yeah, let's do this

580
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,760
Hey guys...

581
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,800
Hey guys, you can't choose not to watch this

582
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,730
What's going on?

583
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,150
Let's watch the opening gag

584
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,150
Iio-san's opening gag

585
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,360
We have 6 hours right?

586
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,670
That's gonna pass very quickly

587
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,720
Well yeah, just one gag

588
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
-Where is Miyasako-san?
-He's in the toilet

589
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,860
-We want Miyasako-san to watch this as well
-Yes of course

590
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,680
Can we start now?

591
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,220
The toilet won't flush

592
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
It's automatic

593
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,740
There's no buttons

594
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,480
There's no buttons?

595
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Nobu talked about his pee too right?

596
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,600
That's enough dude, stop talking about my pee

597
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,350
It's smelling sweet here, by the way

598
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:27,840
-Does anybody have diabetes?
-Who have diabetes?

599
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,640
What about the opening gags?

600
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,910
I got switched on for 2 times

601
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,220
-Opening gag?
-Yes

602
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,020
-We don't need that right?
-Sorry Iio-san...

603
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,380
But I got switched on, for 2 times

604
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,420
Sorry, we will ask you to do it again later, maybe in 4 hours

605
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,960
Isn't that too early?

606
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,980
In 4 hours?

607
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,650
-It's too early for us to be out now
-Yeah, this atmosphere is awful

608
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,400
-I can’t hold it much longer, can I go to the toilet?
-Sure

609
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,540
-The sound, the sound
-Are we going to hear the pissing sounds

610
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,750
She should pee and talk or sing at the same time

611
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,480
-Kurosawa we're gonna hear your pee
-Yeah

612
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,360
-Kurosawa we're gonna hear the sound
-Ok

613
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,290
And it won't flush properly

614
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,520
-Shall we listen to Kurosawa's pissing sound together?
-What the heck? No way

615
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,460
Will it be a thin pee or a thick pee?

616
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,050
What the heck is a thick pee?

617
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:21,920
Come on, these guys are drinking and smoking,
and trying to muddle through

618
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,590
I'm gonna warn them about this

619
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,690
We don't need to do that dude

620
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,610
He's listening to it right?

621
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,210
-Kuro-chan you're really disgusting
-Eh, what do you mean?

622
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,260
-What are you doing?
-You're listening to the toilet's sound right?

623
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,020
-No, no, no
-You're doing this for real?

624
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,020
-Because the fan
-Why?

625
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,900
-Because I'm hot so I'm using the fan
-It's not hot at all

626
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,510
Stop staring at it while using the fan then

627
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,400
Seriously, you have to stop this

628
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,100
I'm serious, that's disgusting

629
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,780
No it's not disgusting

630
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,190
*Kurochan said sorry with "gomenasobase", which is usually used by gentlewomen only

631
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,190
-I'm so sorry*
-That's too much

632
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,030
-Should I kill this guy
-Why did you say sorry like that?

633
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,580
I'm fine with him saying sorry

634
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,190
But can you not add "That's too much" to it?

635
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:11,030
-Yeah, Fujimon is always...
-Is always adding sauce to it

636
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,750
Yeah, he's always adding good sauces

637
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,620
Yeah, we don't need that flavor

638
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:15,960
A.1...

639
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,050
A.1. Sauce, the A.1. Sauce

640
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,510
For steaks? What do you mean?

641
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:28,180
Because they talked about adding good sauces

642
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,590
What's going on?

643
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,650
What is Kurosawa doing?

644
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,980
Are you talking about Kurochan?

645
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,370
Why are you standing sideways?

646
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,400
He's definitely listening to Kurosawa's pee

647
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,820
-No I'm not
-Seriously, stop it

648
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,000
Wait a second, wait a second

649
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,660
Kurosawa and Kurochan becomes double Kuro-chan.
Let's do this

650
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,380
Why did you hit me?

651
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:55,260
He's angry because you're seriously trying to make fun of it

652
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,760
Stop messing around

653
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,100
I'm keep hearing an "Ahh" noise

654
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,250
Someone is making the "Ahh" noise

655
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,890
She's probably imitating the Sound Princess

656
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,080
But we can still hear the "choro-choro" sound of peeing

657
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:14,560
-Yeah I heard some "chiri-chiri" sound, like the sound of masturbation
-No one will masturbate in this toilet

658
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,010
Please don't speak in your dialect, that's making me laugh

659
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,010
Yeah, don't speak in your dialect about pee

660
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,010
You should have changed your accent already

661
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:25,790
By the way, I acted with Sugawara Bunta before in the movie The Great Yokai War

662
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,980
Yeah, I remember that

663
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:31,670
He was acting as Kamiki Ryūnosuke's grandpa

664
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,970
We met during the press conference,
and I was the secondary main character

665
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,220
I was the secondary main character and I said "nice to meet you"

666
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,330
Then he replied to me from a very close distance

667
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:42,240
"Who the heck are you nara?"*

668
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:43,480
*The phrase "Nara" is added to the end of each sentence for Bunta-san's dialect

669
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,480
I was the secondary main character

670
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,790
Yeah he always do that

671
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,630
Who the heck are you nara?

672
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,220
Eh? He always do that?

673
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,310
For many times?

674
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,580
Who the heck are you nara?

675
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,520
This is hilarious

676
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,320
You bumped into the table?

677
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,270
Yeah I bumped into it

678
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,380
I love that conversation

679
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,320
-Excuse me
-Pay attention when your Senpai is talking

680
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,960
Well, never mind

681
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,260
I'm sorry

682
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,660
The conversation went off-topic,
so I didn't want to talk anyway

683
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,980
He's flipping out

684
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,760
You didn't even listen to Miyasako-san
talking about Sugawara-san right?

685
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,040
-"Who are you nara" right?
-It's "Who the heck are you nara"

686
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,450
This is such a precious chance to listen to Miyasako-san's talk about Bunta-san dude

687
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,920
Yeah, Bunta-san is no longer alive

688
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,210
His hairstyle was freaking cool in his old age

689
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,410
It's like Juza of the Clouds*

690
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:39,180
*Juza of the Clouds is a character from Hokuto no Ken

691
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,650
Yeah it's really cool

692
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,180
Yeah, and with bangs

693
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,810
Segawa Eiko is cool too right?

694
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:44,040
Yeah, her hair on the sides are so long

695
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,730
I bet she looks like Eiffel tower with her hair standing up

696
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,670
You're annoying

697
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,790
-If her hair stand up in one direction?
-Yes, yes

698
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,880
You guys are annoying

699
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,440
Are you guys talking about Michizane?

700
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:59,940
*Michizane is the god of learning, who has the same surname "Sugawara" as Bunta-san

701
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,040
Why are you mentioning Michizane?

702
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,420
It's Bunta-san dude

703
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,940
-He's close, he's close
-It's not Sugawara Michizane

704
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,120
Fujimon is close

705
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,920
Should we stop this?

706
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,510
Yeah, let's stop that

707
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,400
Let's stop making fun of it

708
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,500
Maybe watch some opening gags instead?

709
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
No thanks

710
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,570
You don't want that?

711
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,350
But I got switched on already

712
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,850
It doesn't feel good if you don't do it?

713
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:22,240
I wanted you to do it back then, so the timing is wrong now

714
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,820
Are you the leader?

715
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,090
Well, you can do it if you want to

716
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,620
Yeah, I'm fine with it

717
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,090
I see, then I'm not doing it

718
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,650
-Hey...
-One...

719
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,220
-Why are you breathing like Darth Vader?
-Well, no...

720
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,770
-You're laughing right
-I need some air...

721
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,250
Yeah he laughed for sure

722
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,780
That was a laugh, without doubt

723
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,620
-Why are you breathing like Darth Vader?
-No I didn't

724
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,160
Who is Darth Vader anyway

725
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,470
Who the heck is that nara?

726
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,450
Who the heck is Darth Vader nara?

727
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,000
You're not Sugawara Bunta dude

728
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,640
Having a seat and at the same time Sharon Stone

729
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,640
Did Nobu laugh just now?

730
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,870
You're annoying

731
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,680
Is that safe?

732
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,520
We asked you not to do gags right?

733
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,240
-I can't do it?
-We said no

734
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,680
-We asked you to do it later right?
-And you said you won't do it too

735
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,580
I'll give a "go signal", so please don't do it before that

736
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:17,240
Yeah, timing is important too

737
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:20,850
Who is Michizane again?

738
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,750
-Sugawara? The god of learning
(Who's laughing, who's laughing?)

739
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,310
-That's enough
(Nobu right?)

740
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,440
Do you mean Yoshizane?

741
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
-Who the heck is Yoshizane?
(Did he laugh?)

742
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
Sugawara Yoshizane?

743
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,990
He must be a normal citizen

744
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,220
That's not a usual Boke from you

745
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,780
Well, but...

746
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,720
But that's interesting too though

747
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,750
Yeah Michizane...

748
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,390
Why do I need be scold, just for saying Michizane

749
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,320
We're not angry, but why did you say that

750
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,220
Well, I'm not angry

751
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:57,160
But I thought that's not a usual Boke from you

752
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,050
And that's interesting to see as well

753
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,610
Can you do Sharon Stone one more time?

754
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,920
You want another one?

755
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,700
Why are you drinking milk?

756
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,900
There's no more water

757
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,860
Stop lying

758
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,590
-There's still a lot dude
-No, there's really no more

759
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,590
There's a lot at the bottom of the fridge

760
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,080
Oh, so it's at the bottom

761
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,240
Yeah, at the lowest shelf

762
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,120
Having a seat and at the same time Sharon Stone

763
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,120
No I'm not worrying about calcium

764
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,170
Your puberty has ended right?

765
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:32,890
My pu-chu-chu?

766
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,340
You puberty

767
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,650
-What was that chu-chu?
-Nobu is close

768
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,200
Nobu is close all the time

769
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,120
Nobu and Fujimon

770
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,330
Ku-chan is also being lax today

771
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,210
There's cold water here, and warm water over there

772
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,000
Your beard will be stained with milk

773
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,900
No it won't be stained

774
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,490
Try to drink it then

775
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:57,490
Chug it

776
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,320
That's fast

777
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,750
It's stained dude

778
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,350
You are the one who asked him to do it

779
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,020
That's definitely a laugh

780
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,850
Wait a second, wait a second

781
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,380
-Wait a second...
-It's Daigo

782
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,740
So weak

783
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,530
That deserves a red card right

784
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,550
No, no, wait a second

785
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:24,040
No, no, wait, listen to me

786
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,420
Because his beard indeed wasn't stained

787
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,750
No, that's not the main point

788
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,510
You just laughed out loud like "poo-hoo"

789
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,590
I said it will be stained and...

790
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,170
Wait a moment, wait a moment...

791
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,450
You guys are all being lax

792
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,070
Nobu as well

793
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,320
-Fujimon too
-Eh, me too?

794
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,150
-And even Ku-chan is being lax this time
-Yes, I'm sorry

795
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,370
Everyone is somehow fluffy

796
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,490
-This atmosphere is just awful
-Yeah, it really is

797
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,650
Yeah, it was awful, I understand that

798
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,570
It's absolutely awful

799
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:57,550
The Sharon Stone gag almost got me

800
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:00,350
So happy to hear that from Matsumoto-san

801
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,780
That really encourages me, thank you so mcuh

802
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,810
But anyway...

803
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:05,760
Daigo right?

804
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,080
Daigo, yellow card

805
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,140
Yes, I know that

806
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,850
Let's watch it again

807
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,420
-That was an easy one
-Yeah, it really is an easy one

808
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:17,430
Wait, wait, let me explain this

809
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:22,040
"It will be stained", "No it won't", and then it really didn't

810
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,550
That's none of our business

811
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,080
Your beard will be stained with milk

812
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,500
No it won't be stained

813
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,060
Try to drink it then

814
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,150
Chug it

815
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,140
That's fast

816
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,500
It's stained dude

817
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:44,220
You are the one who asked him to do it

818
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,560
Nobu laughed as well right?

819
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,520
Wait, please let me explain this, Matsumoto-san

820
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,980
That's because I saw Daigo laughed,
and I was just making a victory pose for that

821
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,690
Well, I agree with that

822
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,480
-That's just a victory pose
-Okay, I see

823
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,700
Yeah, so I'll say that's safe for this time

824
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,880
So anyway, Daigo is yellow carded

825
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,790
If Daigo didn't laugh out loud,
probably three of us are out already

826
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,900
Yeah, that's true

827
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,140
What happened?

828
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,030
She's crying

829
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,760
Eh, what happened?

830
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,650
How come?

831
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,200
What's happening?

832
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,460
Can't understand your emotions

833
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,860
What happened, seriously?

834
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,760
I thought we had a good time

835
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,970
How could this even happen?

836
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:35,450
What happened, seriously?

837
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,520
It's truly a male‐dominated society

838
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,910
A male‐dominated society...

839
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,570
No way, that's not true

840
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,830
Sorry for being emotional

841
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,410
No worries, don't worry about that

842
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:47,050
I thought it's because we talked about dirty jokes

843
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:50,850
I feel like an only child in these conversations, with no siblings

844
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,850
Unable to join the conversation

845
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,750
It's fine even if you're not joining us
