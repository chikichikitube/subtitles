100,000 Yen prize up for grabs, Kiki Ham!!!!!

10
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,520
Well Matsumoto-san

11
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,560
It's Kiki Ham today

12
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,500

00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,600
This Kiki has one of the lowest success rates apparently...

16
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,770
Cocorico

00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,770

What the hell

21
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,370
Oh is it?

22
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,100
It's really bad

23
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,210
Only 3 out of 20 (got the correct answer among the staff)

24
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,240
Success rate of the staff 3 out of 20 (15%)

25
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,200
Oh, it's THAT low?

26
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,970
It's really low, isn't it?

27
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,190
This is our 25th time doing this...

28
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,230
Yep

29
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,470
Put your damn hand up if you like ham...

30
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,180
Oh come on, you must kind of like it

31
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,420
But not like.... that much...

32
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,340
I wouldn't say I "like" it

33
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,650
Yeah...

34
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:37,980
For fuck sakes, there's so much nose hair hanging out of your nose

35
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,550
For fuck sakes, there's so much nose hair hanging out of your nose

36
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,790
What the hell man...

37
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,890
GO HOME

38
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,540
Right, so today we have 12 different types of ham

39
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,360
Eat one of the twelve hams blindfolded

40
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,360
KIKI HAM

41
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,360
and then try and distinguish which one you ate

42
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,550
12 huh?

43
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,250
Get it right and get 100,000 yen!

44
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,470
Get it right and get 100,000 Yen

45
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,470
Get it wrong and get punished!!

46
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,650
Get it wrong and you will receive a punishment

47
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:49,650
Gotcha

48
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,410
No one has got one correct for a while now...

49
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,200
No one has got even close...

50
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:53,950
Nope, there hasn't been one

51
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,610
How many times have we actually got it right?

52
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,670
Who got it right last?

62
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,460
That would be me, in 2007

63
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,310
Endo I'm pretty sure...

64
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,820
In 2007?

65
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,120
Yes

66
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,400
Fuck, I was back in 2002...

67
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,180
You were all the way back in 2002..

68
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,490
7 years ago...

69
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,130
7 years ago?

70
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,780
You haven't got it right in 7 years?

71
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,930
Nothing in 7 years

72
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,580
For 7 years, your sense of taste has been zero?

73
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,020
For 7 years, your sense of taste has been zero?

74
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,420
For 7 years, your sense of taste has been zero?

75
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,040
That is woeful...

76
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,410
You'll never get this one right then...

77
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,320
You guys have gone and done it, huh?

78
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,880
You've really gone and done it, eh!?

79
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,450
I don't think this is the one---AAGGGHHHH!!!!

80
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,020
First up is Endo

81
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,840
Chosen Ham for Endo

82
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,840
Asahi

83
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,840
Hoshi Furu Machi

84
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,570
The one he will taste is the most expensive one

85
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,820
and is Asahi's "Hoshi Furu Machi"

86
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,490
There he goes

87
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,770
For the scent huh?

88
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,950
He's going for the scent, the firmness

89
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,930
The scent huh...

90
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,230
What's he doing?

91
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,530
You've not "licked anything out" for a while huh?

92
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,690
No, to be honest...

93
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,660
I'm actually doing great lately

94
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,420
What the hell are you on about..?

95
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,090
You're a bloody idiot...

96
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,150
You don't need to say that kind of thing...

97
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,530
Yeah you're probably right...

98
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,640
You're such an idiot...

99
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,130
I bet Chiaki is watching

100
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,560
I bet Chiaki is watching

101
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,600
I bet Chiaki is watching

102
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,540
She's going mental at the moment probably...

103
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,420
She's scary though you know?

104
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,090
She is; girls in general are!

105
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,820
What an idiot...

106
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,840
He's going for the taste...

107
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,180
When I swallowed it, right near the end...

108
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,550
It tastes a bit salty...

109
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,970
That's how I will determine the difference...

110
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,480
That's how you're going to do it?!

111
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,040
Yep

112
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,130
That's not much info to go on!

113
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,840
I will be fine

114
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,390
No way, it's impossible!

115
00:02:16,480 --> 00:03:34,860
Correct answer is

116
00:02:16,480 --> 00:03:34,860
Hoshi Furu Machi

117
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,530
Okay then...

118
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,340
I've eaten this Marudai Hams' "Roast Ham" quite a lot

119
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,860
So I will go with this one first

120
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:38,140
Roast Ham

121
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:38,140
Tasting now

122
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,600
It's not this one

123
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,880
The ham I ate... was NOT Marudai's Roast Ham

124
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,610
There we go...

125
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,420
I like it with my salad...

126
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,910
Oh wow, they make Marudai ham in Osaka?

127
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,510
Umm... that, that place

128
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,340
Umm... that, that place

129
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,480
Umm... that, that place

130
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:45,880
Umm... in Osaka...

131
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,950
Umm... in Osaka...

132
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,950
Where??

133
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,690
He wants to know where in Osaka...

134
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,910
For crying out loud...

135
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,590
Where?

136
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,420
That place in Nishinomiya, innit?

137
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,420
Why are you speaking so casually to us?

138
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,370
as I went for the cheapest one first...

139
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,940
He just casually answered you...

140
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:01,960
Really casually...

141
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,910
This time, I will go for the most expensive one...

142
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,210
like some ordinary bloke...

143
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,540
The most expensive one?

144
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,210
Yes, Asahiya's "Hoshi Furu Machi"

145
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,410
800 yen for 100g

146
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,900
800 Yen?

147
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,900
800 Yen?

148
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,000
I will try this one

149
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,250
That's expensive, this one over here is 198 Yen.

150
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,010
Currently tasting

151
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,010
Hoshi Furu Machi

152
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:34,860
Currently tasting

153
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:34,860
Hoshi Furu Machi

154
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,580
Just for 100 grams?

155
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:15,870
Oh wow...

156
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,400
They're priced so differently

157
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,090
800 Yen huh?

158
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,390
It's totally different

159
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,550
The ham I just tasted... was NOT Asahi's "Hoshi Furu Machi"

160
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:36,970
Oh shit...

161
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,570
Are you kidding me?

162
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,800
We are in SERIOUS trouble here guys!

163
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,850
It was so different, I have no idea then!

164
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,090
Endo, stand there...

165
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,150
Face over there

166
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,620
Shit, I'm scared

167
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,260
This is definitely impossible

168
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,390
I don't want to do it...

169
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,060
What's he going to do?

170
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,980
Ow ow ow!

171
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,630
You thin cut (shit) comedian!!

172
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,570
That looks bad...

173
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,630
You're right..

174
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,930
We have no hope

175
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,720
No hope at all

176
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,540
You tried it at a really good time

177
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,200
Yeah, you did

178
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,510
I didn't have the slightest clue

179
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm seriously, like..

180
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,200
Can I go and try next?

181
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,670
Are you sure, Matsumoto-san?

182
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,170
You're going now?

183
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,800
Just please let me go now. I don't want to be the last person...

184
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,850
But seriously... no clue...

185
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,240
Then you won't get too much information from me (on how to distinguish)

186
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,500
No no, we do do it ourselves usually...

187
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,990
We try our very best...

188
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,230
Seriously, like I am...

189
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,500
We're sorry...

190
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,620
Are you going?

191
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,090
I'm the smallest piece of shit out of us lot

192
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,590
I'm the smallest piece of shit out of us lot

193
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,960
I'm the smallest piece of shit out of us lot

194
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,890
Okay Matsumoto-san

195
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,780
We are counting on you!

196
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,730
No I don't need that...

197
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,370
Hold on, you can't do that!

198
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,460
Put it on!

199
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,790
What a dirty trick...

200
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,520
What the hell do you mean by "you don't need it"?

201
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,300
Don't come on to the stage

202
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,500
I got really scared...

203
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,080
but like seriously, I am like

204
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,840
I think it's about when you meet the correct ham

205
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,590
You're right...

206
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,010
I think it's about the timing of when you go and taste the correct ham

207
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,050
I think it's about the timing of when you go and taste the correct ham

208
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,050
Guys, let's go decide which one!

209
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,520
Which one is the best do you think?

210
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,150
But ham is the tastiest and fattiest of all meets so I eat loads of it

211
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,920
But ham is the tastiest and fattiest of all meats so I eat loads of it

212
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,020
But ham is the tastiest and fattiest of all meats so I eat loads of it

213
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,290
It's not tasty or fatty

214
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,090
it's the least tastiest and fattest

215
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,860
When we went for Yakiniku, you would only eat ham!

216
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,160
When we went for Yakiniku, you would only eat ham!

217
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:22,730
Chosen ham for Matsumoto

218
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:22,730
Hasha

219
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:22,730
V mark roast ham

220
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,210
The chosen ham for Matsumoto...

221
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,710
is Hasha's "V mark roast ham"

222
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
I don't need the tooth pick

223
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,460
It's the first time he's gone second

224
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,560
The taste will change if you do that...

225
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,300
What are you doing?

226
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,870
Like puff...

227
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,960
Let's just shut up and just watch him...

228
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,410
He's not even trying to get it right...

229
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,360
No no no, of course I want to!

230
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,500
You just want some cheap laughs!

231
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,180
No no no, I want to get it right!

232
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,370
You definitely don't!

233
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,820
Seriously man...

234
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,200
Just watch him in silence...

235
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,050
Is everyone laughing?

236
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,560
Surely you know the answer...

237
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,220
not even a single laugh after my laughter at myself

238
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,960
not even a single laugh after my laughter at myself

239
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,690
not even a single laugh after my laughter at myself

240
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,100
not even a single laugh after my laughter at myself

241
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,600
Usually everyone laughs when you laugh...

242
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,320
It's not very salty...

243
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,960
There's not much salt at all

244
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,920
and there isn't much oil used in it either

245
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,440
It's frankly a very simple ham

246
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,040
It's frankly a very simple ham

247
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,470
A simple ham...

248
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,680
A simple ham...

249
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,620
The first impressions are anyway...

250
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,800
First impressions?

251
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,280
Yama-chan loves that joke, huh?

252
00:06:12,320 --> 00:09:47,000
Correct answer is

253
00:06:12,320 --> 00:09:47,000
V Mark Roast Ham

254
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,010
I've got nothing to go on here so...

255
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,480
I might do what Endo did

256
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,610
It was this one, right?

257
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,150
Yes

258
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,630
This is like a typical Japanese ham...

259
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,070
Yup...

260
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,250
that I should try first

261
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,630
This one is selling well in the shops...

262
00:06:29,000 --> 00:07:16,780
Currently tasting

263
00:06:29,000 --> 00:07:16,780
Roast Ham

264
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,300
Now this one, I can tell the difference

265
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:40,820
I mean, dude...

266
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,050
Your partner shouts "let's do Kiki Ham" and his partner is

267
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,550
Your partner shouts "let's do Kiki Ham" and his partner is

268
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,320
Your partner shouts "let's do Kiki Ham" and his partner is

269
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,520
trying his first ham...

270
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,360
Why the hell do you fart?

271
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,620
I'm really sorry but I think you two should talk about this kind of thing privately...

272
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,570
This is a little bit out of our league...

273
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,250
We can't join this argument...

274
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,900
We really can't...

275
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,290
We are powerless

276
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,560
There's no way that's acceptable

277
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,060
There's no way that's acceptable

278
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,660
On top of that, I feel sick

279
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,700
On top of that, I feel sick

280
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,000
But anyway...

281
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,330
Yes...

282
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:04,700
Yes?

283
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,890
The texture was definitely different

284
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,540
I can tell the difference on this one as well, Endo...

285
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,480
The Ham I ate was NOT the Marudai Roast Ham

286
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,070
This one I knew, so I'm not really ecstatic that I got it right.

287
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,670
I was really confident about it

288
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,420
I see...

289
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,310
It's that different I guess...

290
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,630
Now, if I'm going to do the same thing as Endo did...

291
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,010
I would try the Hoshi Furu Machi...

292
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,850
Yes, that's correct...

293
00:07:29,030 --> 00:09:05,220
Currently tasting

294
00:07:29,030 --> 00:09:05,220
Hoshi Furu Machi

295
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,660
I know the answer now...

296
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,500
It's this one I'm sure?

297
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,000
It's definitely this one!

298
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,600
It's definitely this one!

299
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,300
You guys have gone and done it, huh?

300
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,000
You guys have gone and done it, huh?

301
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,770
You've really gone and done it, eh!?

302
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,670
You've really gone and done it, eh!?

303
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,390
What does he mean by that?

304
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,580
Why is he shouting it so loudly as well...

305
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,580
If i am right and it is Asahiya's one...

306
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,110
You guys are just really sick people!

307
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,450
You guys are just really sick people!

308
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Like seriously, should you really choose Asahiya again?

309
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,950
Like seriously, should you really choose Asahiya again?

310
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,050
You dirty shits...

311
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,850
We are not at all...

312
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,020
What's he on about...

313
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,530
What should I do??

314
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,030
I actually think I'm right about this one!

315
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,090
If I get this wrong I'm seriously like...

316
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,230
If I get this wrong I'm seriously like...

317
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,000
going home straight away

318
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,830
Come on now...

319
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,910
I will go home STRAIGHT away...

320
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,700
That's got nothing to do with this...

321
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,640
If you get it wrong, you have to pay the consequences...

322
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,960
That's right

323
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,870
No no, I'm a bit of a dick when it comes to this kind of thing

324
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,140
No no, I'm a bit of a dick when it comes to this kind of thing

325
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,350
You can't do that...

326
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,520
I'm a bit of a dick with this kind of thing...

327
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,480
Didn't he threaten us like this the last time we played Kiki?

328
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,960
He threatened to hit us

329
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,540
And I'll like silent call you

330
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,250
And I'll like silent call you

331
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,780
But it'll say on our phone screens that it's Matsumoto-san

332
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,440
"Oh look, it's Matsumoto-san"

333
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,520
I'll withhold my number and then call you guys.

334
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,320
I'll withhold my number and then call you guys.

335
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,690
I'll withhold my number and then call you guys

336
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,730
Right, here we go!

337
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,120
I'm receiving my 100,000 Yen

338
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,500
The Ham I ate WAS the Asahiya's ham!

339
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,970
The Ham I ate WAS the Asahiya's ham!

340
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,950
The Ham I ate WAS the Asahiya's ham!

341
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,460
Not even close, NOT EVEN close

342
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,680
It's the same huge guy...

343
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,730
SNAP OUT OF YOUR HONEYMOON PERIOD!!

344
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,320
This is really a short program...

345
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,030
Hold on a second...

346
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,860
You guys should think about that situation though...

347
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,440
I thought it was the Asahiya one! Right here, the second one, me

348
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,770
I thought it was the Asahiya one! Right here, the second one, me

349
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,500
I thought it was the Asahiya one! Right here, the second one, me

350
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,240
I thought it was the Asahiya one! Right here, the second one, me

351
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,540
Right here, second one, me, Asahiya

352
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,070
Right here, second one, me, Asahiya

353
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,510
Right here, second one, me, Asahiya

354
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,910
Right here, second one, me, Asahiya

355
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,040
I thought I was right!

356
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,780
No no no, I don't care if you thought if you were...

357
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,550
Surely you should have it let happen, in theory...

358
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,840
No no no, I don't care about that...

359
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,820
I thought I snuffed out what  you guys were doing

360
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,150
I thought I snuffed out what you guys were doing

361
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,120
The chosen one for Tanaka is the one that Endo didn't get right and caught Matsumoto out...

362
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:51,160
Hoshi Furu Machi

363
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:51,160
Asahiya

364
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:51,160
Chosen Ham for Tanaka

365
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,180
Asahiya's "Hoshi Furu Machi"

366
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,640
You really don't want this punishment...

367
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,200
Of course not...

368
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,900
Even now, it's hurting me

369
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,970
It really is...

370
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,800
Even now, it's hurting me

371
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,930
Is it that bad??

372
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,470
It's like...

373
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,160
My face burns...

374
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,500
my fifth day in Ishigakijima (in Okinawa)

375
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,670
my fifth day in Ishigakijima (in Okinawa)

376
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,370
It really does hurt...

377
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,420
That's pretty bad...

378
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,200
That's tough...

379
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,700
It really does hurt a fair bit...

380
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,170
I've put the tooth pick in here...

381
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,120
Oh Endo-san...

382
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,810
just put the ham on my hand

383
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,080
just put the ham on my hand

384
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,210
Oh, you don't need the tooth pick?

385
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:05,870
No, I don't

386
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,810
My juniors won't listen to my story at all

387
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,780
My juniors won't listen to my story at all

388
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,780
My juniors won't listen to my story at all

389
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,110
They won't listento my little story at all

390
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,920
They won't listen to my little story at all

391
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,150
They won't listen to my little story at all

392
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,180
The taste, that's the important part

393
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,360
The taste, that's the important part

394
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,100
It's down to the taste...

395
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,590
It's Kiki Ham after all!

396
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,080
Yeah, it is. Don't bother doing stupid things with the ham...

397
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,640
Okay...

398
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,360
The texture is really "kind"

399
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,300
The texture is really "kind"

400
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,450
It's soft, is it?

401
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,020
Yes it is.

402
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,300
Well you know...

403
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,500
That is what ham is after all...

404
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,930
That is what ham is after all...

405
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,000
It's really easy to eat...

406
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,570
Yeah, because we made it small...

407
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,530
I'm good to go!

408
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,470
You're okay?

409
00:11:38,880 --> 00:13:08,630
Correct answer is

410
00:11:38,880 --> 00:13:08,630
Hoshi Furu Machi

411
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,130
First of all, from my experience

412
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,990
this Marudai's Roast Ham

413
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,940
because I've eaten it a lot

414
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,250
I know in my head that it's a bit different

415
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,710
Okay, I get you...

416
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,300
So I want to taste it to be able to clarify the differences...

417
00:11:52,520 --> 00:12:10,070
Currently tasting

418
00:11:52,520 --> 00:12:10,070
Roast Ham

419
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,480
You're going to eat it?

420
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,730
It wasn't like this...

421
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,140
The one before literally crumbled...

422
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,660
It crumbled?...

423
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,560
Yeah it did...

424
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,510
This is not the one.

425
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,170
I'm not going to get caught out here...

426
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,990
The ham that I ate...

427
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,850
was NOT Marudai's Roast Ham

428
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,260
Was it really different?

429
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,800
It really was different

430
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,080
This is where the problem starts...

431
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,610
It is indeed...

432
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,950
Now you have to decide which one next...

433
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,460
Personally I think...

434
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,390
If I choose the Asahiya, can tell the difference and get through it

435
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,690
If I choose the Asahiya, can tell the difference and get through it

436
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,460
If I choose the Asahiya, can tell the difference and get through it

437
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,490
I think it will give me a hell of a lot of confidence to go on

438
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,160
I think it will give me a hell of a lot of confidence to go on

439
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,570
Asahiya's Hoshi Furu Machi

440
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,540
Asahiya's Hoshi Furu Machi

441
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,900
Currently tasting

442
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,900
Hoshi Furu Machi

443
00:12:36,630 --> 00:13:08,630
Currently tasting

444
00:12:36,630 --> 00:13:08,630
Hoshi Furu Machi

445
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,110
How was it again...

446
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,320
It's not this one

447
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,120
Asahiya's ham is firm

448
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,990
Asahiya's ham is firm

449
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay, I'm confident

450
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,620
The ham that I atewas NOT Asahiya's Hoshi Furu Machi

451
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,700
The ham that I ate was NOT Asahiya's Hoshi Furu Machi

452
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,210
The ham that I ate was NOT Asahiya's Hoshi Furu Machi

453
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,820
No good....

454
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,450
What the hell man!!

455
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,860
This is impossible...

456
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,160
This is really awful...

457
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,140
We're just repeating the same thing over and over...

458
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,780
We're just repeating the same thing over and over...

459
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,890
The only difference is the person trying...

460
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,150
You've got to be kidding me!

461
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,020
It really hurts

462
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,730
This part is the same as well...

463
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,690
This part is the same as well...

464
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,620
Ow, it already hurts...

465
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,680
It already hurts a bit right?

466
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,370
It already really hurts...

467
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,030
It does, right?

468
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,320
Ow, that hurts!

469
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,270
SHALL I SLICE YOU UP!?

470
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,940
Seriously, what are we going to do?

471
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,570
Hoshi Furu Machi is really something...

472
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,240
We have no hope in hell...

473
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,680
It really hurts, right?

474
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,250
It really does...

475
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,660
Your face's gone red...

476
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,640
It really does...

477
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,200
I'm going next, Yama-chan, you go last

478
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,660
Hamada-san, you're going next?

479
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,230
Do it for us, Hamada-san

480
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,590
Hamada is going 4th today...

481
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,260
We need him to get it right...

482
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,660
The super shit stain...

483
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,450
I'm definitely going to get it...

484
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,890
The super shit stain...

485
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,820
You talking about Hamada-san?

486
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,530
He's the super shit stain...

487
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,680
I'm definitely going to get it... I've been shitting loads lately...

488
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,530
See, he's like a premium shit stain, right?

489
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,430
See, he's like a premium shit stain, right?

490
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,230
See, he's like a premium shit stain, right?

491
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,350
A premium shit stain?

492
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:22,310
Kamakura Ham Tomioka Shoukai

493
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:22,310
Ham chosen for Hamada

494
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:22,310
Roast Ham

495
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,650
The ham chosen for Hamada

496
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,860
is Roast Ham from Tomioka Shoukai

497
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,070
It's dry...

498
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,530
It's dry?

499
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,640
Yeah..

500
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,220
If I say it like you would, it's definitely meat

501
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,200
It's not the type of ham you use for sandwiches

502
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,200
Are you good to go?

503
00:14:42,590 --> 00:16:09,380
Correct answer

504
00:14:42,590 --> 00:16:09,380
Roast Ham

505
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,590
Okay, I'm going to start with this one

506
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,240
Marudai's...

507
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,520
Marudai's, I see...

508
00:14:48,370 --> 00:15:02,880
Currently tasting

509
00:14:48,370 --> 00:15:02,880
Roast Ham

510
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:51,860
It's so soft...

511
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,220
Well ham is...

512
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,130
It is ham after all...

513
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, ham has to be soft...

514
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,260
It's totally different

515
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,980
Ham should be...

516
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,780
The one I tasted was NOT Marudai's Roast Ham

517
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,020
The one I tasted wasn't like that...

518
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,140
He was so confident

519
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,680
It was totally different

520
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,110
Hmm, this one...

521
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,830
I don't want to try this one and then get stuck on it...

522
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,290
What the fuck are you looking at, oy?!

523
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,530
What the fuck are you looking at, oy?!

524
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,600
We're not allowed to look?

525
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,950
You're kidding me...

526
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,300
What the fuck are you looking at, oy?!

527
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:19,860
This comedian does not allow people to watch him

528
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,800
This comedian does not allow people to watch him

529
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,170
This comedian does not allow people to watch him

530
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,470
This comedian does not allow people to watch him

531
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,500
This comedian does not allow people to watch him

532
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,200
Surely if you don't watch, they get angry...

533
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,520
Usually, that is the case...

534
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,200
You guys wouldn't choose this one again right...

535
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,780
You guys...

536
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,660
You know what, I'm going to try this one...

537
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:33,990
Hoshi Furu Machi

538
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,310
Asahiya-san is doing amazing...

539
00:15:34,250 --> 00:16:02,110
Currently tasting

540
00:15:34,250 --> 00:16:02,110
Hoshi Furu Machi

541
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,300
It's amazing

542
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,340
It's taking up most of the show...

543
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,440
What is going on?

544
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,810
We all fell for it...

545
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,440
Ohhhh, I get it.. Why you guys got stuck on it

546
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,820
This dryness

547
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,300
Like before...

548
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,690
You wanted me to eat this and think it was this one...

549
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,590
I won't fall for that though

550
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,650
The ham I tasted is NOT Asahiya's Hoshi Furu Machi

551
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,630
Amazing...

552
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,490
Finally, we got over this part...

553
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,810
You did well to get past that part...

554
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,980
That's a huge wall you've just gotten over

555
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,090
Now it starts...

556
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:15,650
Chouseai Roast Ham

557
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:16,820
Correct answer is

558
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:16,820
Roast Ham

559
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,820
Hamada's now over the wall

560
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,390
After this, he gets a few more correct

561
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,330
Green Mark

562
00:16:17,050 --> 00:18:36,730
Correct answer is

563
00:16:17,050 --> 00:18:36,730
Roast Ham

564
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,410
It is NOT the Green Mark Roast ham...

565
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,230
12 Total

566
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,230

573
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,120
The texture is similar...

574
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,150
The dryness is  similar too

575
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,690
The dryness is similar too

576
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,690
Just the taste now...

577
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,830
When I swallow the ham...

578
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,130
It's not a strong taste so that's similar too

579
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,230
It's not a strong taste so that's similar too

580
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,000
This one is really similar

581
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,800
This one is really similar

582
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,540
Isn't this the one, oy?

583
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,940

Isn't this the one, oy?

590
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,820
Yo?

591
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,380
Give me a bit of water...

592
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,210
It's so dry...

593
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,850
It's the first time he is stuck...

594
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,840
That's true

595
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,840
That's true

596
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,200
I don't remember getting so thirsty after eating one slice before

597
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,640
I don't remember getting so thirsty after eating one slice before

598
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,440
Hey?

599
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,410
Did I say that I was thirsty before?

600
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,970
That's down to you and how you feel...

601
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,160
isn't it?

602
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,910
You have eaten a fair few now as well

603
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,910
You have eaten a fair few now as well

604
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,380
Ahh man, this one...

605
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,460
It's so similar...

606
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,080
Was it this dry though?...

607
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,310
I don't think it was that dry...

608
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,980
However dry it was...

609
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,430
It's not this one.

610
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,980
The ham I ate was NOT the Kamakura Ham...

611
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,650
I don't think this is the one- AGHHHHHHHHH!!!

614
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,110
He looks like an office worker who's just lost his job

615
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,640
He looks like an office worker who's just lost his job

616
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,980
He looks like an office worker who's just lost his job

617
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,830
He's in some playground, just shouting...

618
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,340
I don't think this one had enough moisture...

619
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,340
Right, let's bet it on that...

620
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,690
The ham I tasted was NOT the Kamakura Roast Ham from Tomioka Shouzai

621
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,480
Seriously, this is amazing...

622
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,280
You were so close!

623
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,410
I thought you got it!

624
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,750
I thought he was going to get it too!

625
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,450
I'm so sure the dryness was a little different...

626
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,680
He was the closest by far out of us lot...

627
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,800
This really hurts...

628
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,500
It hurts like hell...

629
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,960
Really?...

630
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:55,980
Oh yes...

631
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,420
Man, he's big...

632
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,680
He's huge...

633
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,820
This is where it starts hurting

634
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,860
From here...

635
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,860
It already hurts...

636
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,170
His lips, his lips!

637
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,530
YOU BONELESS LIP!

638
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,420
How lucky is he?

639
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,180
You're right...

640
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,500
He gets it wrong but still comes out a winner

641
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,270
He gets it wrong but still comes out a winner

642
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,420
Yeah, he basically won...

643
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,250
He was so lucky...

644
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,830
Last up is Yamasaki

645
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,950

V Mark Roast Ham

648
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,490
The one chosen for him is the V Mark Roast Ham

649
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,400
But you guys all like...

650
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,430
It's all in the taste...

651
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,550
Who told you to just slap it on my hand

652
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,820
Who told you to just slap it on my hand

653
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,680
Oh I'm sorry...

654
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,290
How difficult do you wanna be...

655
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,450
I TOLD YOU I WANTED TO EAT IT WITH A TOOTHPICK!!

656
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,300
You didn't, you didn't say that at all...

657
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,940
OW!!!

658
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,680
Hang on a second you...

659
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,530
I'm not going to be able to taste it as well

660
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,460
I'm not going to be able to taste it as well

661
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,920
No, you will be fine...

662
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,080
Obviously that would hurt a bit...

663
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,290
Yeah, I was hoping he would say that...

664
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,140
It's thick

665
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,770
It's quite thick

666
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,990
It's very thick

667
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,520
Hang on a second

668
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,620
It is very dry

669
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,810
It's one of the more expensive ones...

670
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,350
if it's this dry

671
00:20:14,090 --> 00:22:56,220
Correct answer is

672
00:20:14,090 --> 00:22:56,220
V Mark Roast Ham

673
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,140
I'll go with this one first, I guarantee it's not this one.

674
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,410
I can tell just by looking at it

675

Okay you've touched it

678
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,760
Okay, it's not this one

679
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,140
You're not going to even eat it?

680
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,420
No, I don't need to.

681
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,960
I don't have to, it's totally different

682
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,690
But just in case...

683
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,910
Yeah actually, just in case...

684
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,670
What the hell man...

685
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,270
Well he should try it at least...

686
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,010
His head is so fucked up...

687
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,270
The ham I just tasted...

688
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,350
was NOT Marudai's Roast Ham!

689
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,660
Why does he speak like that? It's not funny in the slightest

690
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,620
I have to get it right quickly or I'm going to forget the taste

691
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,670
Yeah that's right, otherwise you start forgetting the moisture and taste

692
00:20:48,860 --> 00:21:10,980
Currently tasting

693
00:20:48,860 --> 00:21:10,980
Lightly Salted Roast Ham

694
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,680
That's right...

695
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,240
I usually do try and taste the original one for as long as possible...

696
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,940
The thickness is the same...

697
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,100
But it is TOTALLY different

698
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,180
He ate a bit...

699
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,350
Why does he only take a tiny bite?

700
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,080
The ham I just tasted...

701
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,840
Oh, he changed the way he says it...

702
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,840
was NOT the lightly salted Roast Ham

703
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,380

I actually might get this right...

707
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,400
The thickness is totally different

708
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,300
Nope...

709
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,970
The ham I just tasted

710
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,250
was NOT this Roast Ham

711
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,290
I think I will try with this one now...

712
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,450
Which one is that?...

713
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,550
Hold on...

714
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,740
Hold on a second...

715
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,640
It feels exactly the same when I touch it...

716
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,440
Hold on a second!...

721
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,760
Is it similar to when you ate it over there?

722
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,870
Like the first one?

723
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,460
I see...

724
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,020
If it will help you, you can put on the eye mask

725
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,030
If it will help you, you can put on the eye mask

726
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:56,730
Yeah, actually can I?

727
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,980
Yeah, just do exactly what you did before...

728
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,170
Exactly as before...

729
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,430
Hold the ham in you hand or you won't be able to see where the ham is...

730
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,750
Yeah...

731
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,170
Hold the ham in your hand...

732
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,190
You're so stupid...

733
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,320
You need to hold it yourself...

734
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,460
For crying out loud, I will give it to you, which one was it?...

735
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,810
What the hell man...

736
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,810
Get angry like before!

737
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,750
Get angry like before!

738
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,540
Yeah...

739
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,550
You properly shouted at me before...

740
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,750
There's that thing you're meant to do!

741
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,520
There's that thing you're meant to do!

742
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,860
I stabbed his hand with the toothpick

743
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,930
just like the script said...

744
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:36,000
Currently tasting

745
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:36,000
V Mark Roast Ham

746
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:56,220
Currently tasting

747
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:56,220
V Mark Roast Ham

748
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,760
The thickness is identical

749
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,670
It's totally wrong

750
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,940
It's totally wrong

751
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,770
The elasticity

752
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,010
The elasticity

753
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,090
It's different, I got this!

754
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,530
It's totally wrong

755
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,030
The ham I tasted...

756
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,490
was NOT the V Mark Roast Ham

757
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,590
It was the same one as mine!

758
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,700
That's why when you stopped, I thought you had it!

759
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,730
I thought you had it!

760
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,320
That's why I encouraged you to wear the eye mask!

761
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,870
It was definitely drier

762
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,860
It really hurts...

763
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,280
It really hurts...

764
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,710
I don't want it, I don't want it

765
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,330
It really hurts...

766
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,240
It hurts so bad...

767
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,540
Ow ow, my hair, ow...

768
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,530
This will hurt

769
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,720
Your jokes and taste are Ham-pa (SHIT)!!

770
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,430
Hamburger?

771
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,840
So yet again...

772
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,290
Yup...

773
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,100
No one is getting one...

774
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,600
When will someone get one right?

775
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,740
We're going to go 10 years without getting one right...

776
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,170
We're in serious trouble...

777
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,220
Serious trouble...

778
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,030
You're heading for a decade without getting one...

779
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,500
We really need to get one soon...

780
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,310
Soon you're not even going to know what Sapporo Ichiban (beer) tastes like...

781
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,830
You won't even be able to get that..

782
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,210
you'll be saying "it's shio beer (salted beer)"
