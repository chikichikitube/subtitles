1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,940
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,510
So today we have prepared various theories for you

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,130
Matsumoto... Matsu... who're you?

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,000
Finally, Yoshimoto has decided on a successor

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,330
Wow this is exciting

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,640
What a historic day!
-Thanks for your kind words

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,890
Surely there's no way

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,870
That is, to tell the truth

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,620
Sitting opposite Hamada-san is genuinely awful

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,410
It's really scary
-Why do you say that?

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,310
It's like a car is constantly tailing me

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,820
The pressure is really not to be underestimated

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,510
Matsumoto is really quite remarkable

15
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,080
So, it's time to get started!

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,790
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,110
It's Morita!

18
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,390
Chief!

19
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,390
Thank you for having me

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,500
Chief, chief!

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,310
Thank you
-Thank you

22
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,170
You know, I recently heard something

23
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,320
A ghost's lifespan is 200 years

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,520
Does everyone know this?

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,040
A ghost?

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,110
What is this lifespan you speak of?

27
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,550
A ghost is not completely dead, right?

28
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,720
Otherwise it wouldn't be appearing on this side

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,800
Appearing as a ghost in the world of the living

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,260
The life span of this state is 200 years

31
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,270
Heh...

32
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,650
So, seeing ghosts of primitive people

33
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,160
Oh yeah!
-Indeed!

34
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,800
You never hear of such a thing, right?
-No!

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,080
It's weird that they have never appeared
-That's right

36
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,340
Seriously?

37
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,480
So, everyone

38
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,190
So, what I bring to you today is...

39
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,240
A related verification

40
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,770
Really?

41
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,180
The theory I've brought is this:

42
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,510
It is actually difficult to get a person to say "heh?"

43
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,050
I see

44
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,350
After listening to what you just heard

45
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,450
"Heh?" wasn't all that common a reaction

46
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,880
Some said stuff like "Seriously?"
-Indeed

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,910
So it's like this

48
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,790
"Ha?" or something like that.

49
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,460
Yoshimura was the only one that actually said it

50
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,960
He said "heh?" perfectly

51
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,500
200 years, that's all

52
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,530
Heh?

53
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,870
So, is it true what you said about the ghost?

54
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,750
Regarding that...

55
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,360
It's a lie

56
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,850
Heh!?

57
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,440
That's unbelievable!

58
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,200
No, no, wait a minute

59
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,580
You're saying "unbelievable", but first of all...

60
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,450
Do you actually believe in ghosts?

61
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,080
As far as i'm concerned,

62
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,290
I like to share this type of rumor

63
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,720
When people hear stuff like this

64
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,350
I always get this "heh?" reaction

65
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,880
But, as it turns out, actual rumors can't be broadcast on TV

66
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,490
So all the information we used this time is just patently false

67
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,700
I see
-Fictitious

68
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,640
So, how many "heh"s can we get from them?

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,380
Let's find out

70
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:58,460
It is actually difficult to get a person to say "heh?"

71
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,400
And so, the instigator is...

72
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,950
I'm in charge

73
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,930
I see

74
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,100
Morita

75
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,370
Who is being targeted?

76
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,370
A junior of mine called Hyouroku

77
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,170
Hyouroku?

78
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,210
Sounds like a folk tale

79
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,980
A person with great respect for Morita

80
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,620
He has appeared many times as a solo artist on Goodbye Live

81
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,600
Looks like the type to say it

82
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,750
Hyouroku

83
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,840
Isn't this just an "heh?" type face!?

84
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,150
So cunning, seems like it'll be really easy to accomplish!

85
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,450
Let's say it is

86
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,680
This time, to complete the verification Hyouroku and Morita are gathered

87
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,760
In the lounge of a fake show in which the former and the latter are starring together

88
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,500
How many "heh?"s can be elicited?

89
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,500
How many times

90
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,430
He's quite out of touch, that guy

91
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,430
So even if it's a small thing

92
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,770
I think he'll say "heh?", yeah

93
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,030
The time limit is 30 minutes

94
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,390
He'll probably say "heh?"

95
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,950
Seems likely

96
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,600
Hyouroku wore a very bright jacket

97
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,550
But TBS is really...

98
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,550
I thought I'd never come back here again
-How come?

99
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,680
No no, how to say...

100
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,160
Think he'll say it

101
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,750
Speaking of which, you are now, what?

102
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,850
You're not doing comedy anymore, pretty much?

103
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,720
Although I want to-to do it, but, yeah...

104
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,650
He's cute

105
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,530
"LOVE it!" seems to be the one

106
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,330
I'll be on the Sunday episode

107
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,900
Eh——

108
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,920
Eh

109
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,070
Eh——

110
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,400
Is Kawashima on it?

111
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,770
Of course Kawashima will be there

112
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,370
But it seems other comedians wont be

113
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,140
Who will be?
-Probably an actress

114
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,380
Eh——

115
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,280
But it's really good

116
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,110
Too bad!

117
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,540
I think it's Meru Nukumi, I think its been decided

118
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,150
Eh——

119
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,840
This is an "eh?" person!

120
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,860
Although this junior does not say "heh"

121
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,110
He is definitely the type that says "eh-"

122
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,970
Next

123
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,130
She... she's a woman, right?

124
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,260
Yeah, a woman

125
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,930
Eh—

126
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,130
Don't you know her?

127
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,670
I'm sorry, I can't think of the person

128
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,750
This person does not know anything

129
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,700
He seems to be more out of touch than expected

130
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,740
He doesn't even know her

131
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,460
Does this guy not even watch TV?

132
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,070
Didn't Michopa go on TV?
-Oh, Michopa!

133
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,340
You know Michopa?
-Michopa, yes, I do

134
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,540
But the word Michopa...

135
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,950
It can't be broadcast in the northeastern region

136
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,750
Eh? Why?

137
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,080
The word "Michopa"?

138
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,490
Where is it in the northeast, Akita or Yamagata?

139
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,290
Very strong, Morita

140
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,540
He's pretty good at this

141
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:10,460
"Michopa" means "male genitalia"

142
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Such a load of nonsense

143
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,530
I don't know if it's the dialect or what
-Eh-

144
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,330
Very impressive

145
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,480
Bullshit comes as natural to him as breathing

146
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,640
So Michopa can't even be seen on TV in the Northeast

147
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,100
Ah, is that right?
-Yes

148
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,210
Eh—

149
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,540
But Michopa herself seems to have no idea about it

150
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,910
Then, if people in that region talk about Michopa...

151
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,080
If the interview is "Do you know Michopa?" then

152
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,750
"Do you know XXXX", it'd be like that
-Yeah, yeah, yeah

153
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,750
m 0 0 l 0 44 l 122 44 l 122 0

154
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,750
m 0 0 l 0 45 l 125 45 l 125 0

155
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,750
m 0 0 l 0 45 l 125 45 l 125 0

156
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,220
Eh—

157
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,150
"Huh? What are you talking about?" This sort of thing

158
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,350
Eh—

159
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,490
+1

160
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,600
Seriously!

161
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,360
It's like that

162
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,720
Hyuoroku can't not say it

163
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,300
Although the "eh" series was carried out

164
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
What's the score?

165
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,260
In ten minutes, not even a single "heh" has been elicited

166
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,260
Next

167
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,470
I'm going to go to the bathroom for a little bit
-Okay

168
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,590
Here I was also considering the "eh" problem

169
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,740
Here, Morita came out of the room and found the staff

170
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,250
Indeed

171
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,010
He's been saying "eh-" all along, right? That guy

172
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,970
Yeah

173
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,410
It's always "eh-"

174
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,020
What to do

175
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,480
But saying "eh-" is pretty much the same, right?

176
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,850
He didn't say "heh" though

177
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,320
The staff is really strict

178
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,750
That guy believed everything without question!

179
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,160
Show business is so hard. Seriously, right?

180
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,990
Ah...

181
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,260
I remembered one thing

182
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,530
Isn't there someone named Asakura Mikuru?

183
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,730
Ah!

184
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:27,270
Did you know that there is an AV actress with the same name?

185
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,900
I didn't know

186
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,410
Her name is Asakura Mikuru

187
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,440
Eh-

188
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,750
How to say,

189
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,550
No way!

190
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,550
The porno thing,

191
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,610
Wanted a heh

192
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,760
It is possible to hear it from the mouth of Hyouroku

193
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,380
That thing, how to say, it's kind of like a porno but...

194
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,520
Ah, a parody, right?

195
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,890
What is it? - That...

196
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,360
The one that's like "RICHIN"

197
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,360
※RICHIN: a fashion brand for girls

198
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,040
How could you think of that

199
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,220
"RICHIN" is the same. It does seem to be a thing.

200
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,030
"RICHIN"?

201
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,640
What's so funny?

202
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,300
I think Asakura Mikuru appeared in "RIZIN"

203
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,300
You couldn't not be happy being with a guy like this

204
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,630
Do you like H-videos?

205
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,170
I don't have the courage to watch

206
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,740
No courage?
-Hmmm

207
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,040
So you don't watch AV?

208
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,370
I've seen, i've seen them
-What the hell?

209
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,560
So weird

210
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,900
The pair become stuck on the topic of porn

211
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,690
What the hell?

212
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
Male genitalia-like face

213
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,680
Do you know the "Boin"?

214
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,120
"Boin" is boobs
-Yeah, yeah

215
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,290
In fact, an individual boob is called "Boin"

216
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,760
Understand?

217
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,100
Where did this all come from?

218
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,360
So when you talk about both boobs, you have to say "Boin Boin"

219
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,680
Oh really

220
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,500
That's why you should say "I want to play with a girl with boin boin"

221
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,240
Well, it's true, if you think about it

222
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,370
There doesn't need to be two for it to be a boob, right?

223
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,610
Isn't there only one child?
-Yes, yes

224
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,080
So actually by growing a something here...
-Yeah

225
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,980
His brain is wired very uniquely

226
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,720
You know China has it's "one child policy", right?

227
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,850
Because of that they have a single boob

228
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,490
Heh~

229
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,960
Heh~

230
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:51,960
It appeared!

231
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,220
It appeared

232
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,520
A very straightforward "heh"

233
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,530
Thanks to the most false lie so far

234
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,830
1 "heh" finally comes out after 15 minutes

235
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,170
Have you ever seen Mastuko? Matsuko Deluxe

236
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,300
No I haven't

237
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,610
Matsuko-Deluxe is really big, right?

238
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,040
Oh really

239
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,440
So sure enough, it's still a lot of work to walk

240
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,410
So Matsuko uses a segue in TV station corridors

241
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,520
Is that so?
-Because it's really hard to walk

242
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,910
Heh～

243
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,950
How about this one...

244
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,980
After one came out

245
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,720
Mr. Maric  -
-Yeah yeah yeah

246
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,730
Did you know that he and Mr. Children have the same mentor?

247
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,560
And his house address is Mr. 1

248
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,670
Eh—

249
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,920
Still eh

250
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,060
Although the lies are getting more and more outrageous

251
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,440
This one fails to show even a shred of doubt

252
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,320
He really accepts all of it

253
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,360
5 minutes left

254
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
That's awesome!

255
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,530
Hyouroku is a remarkable person

256
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,410
But then again

257
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,180
Recently, Downtown's Matsumoto has been off resting, right?

258
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,320
This is a secret OK

259
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,490
So you can't tell anyone

260
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,620
What happened was... Hamada was arrested

261
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,330
Eh?
-That's right

262
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,160
What about?

263
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,430
Apparently he pulled a gun out of his bag

264
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,940
Oi!

265
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,830
Ah, is that right?
-Yes, yes

266
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,100
Is that so...

267
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,440
Eh...the bag... the bag contained...

268
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,610
A gun in the bag

269
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,270
Heh~

270
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,540
Appeared!

271
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,570
Weakly squeezed out a "heh"

272
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,400
What's more

273
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,210
Speaking of...

274
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,490
Takeru vs Nasukawa Tenshin

275
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,220
At the end, Nasukawa Tenshin said he wanted to quit

276
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,730
Morita is so good

277
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,930
Too strong

278
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,190
So he's been replaced Black Mayonnaise's Kosugi

279
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,970
What? Isn't Ko-ko-kosugi the one that said "he-ha-"?

280
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,090
The "he-ha" one

281
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,470
How can I put it...is this a little too big of a play...

282
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,470
Unpromising?

283
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,500
I don't know. I don't know

284
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,440
Heh~

285
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,480
He said it!

286
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,600
Certainly said it

287
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,720
So we expose the whole thing

288
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,400
What's this reaction

289
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,320
Wh-wh-wh-what's that? This is

290
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,590
As if you've never seen it before

291
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,590
What do you think it is?

292
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,690
I don't know, it's...

293
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,520
Scary scary

294
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,860
What is it again? This theory

295
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,600
It is actually difficult to get a person to say "heh?"

296
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,630
It is actually difficult to get a person to say "heh?"?

297
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,970
It's so hard!

298
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,570
Heh~

299
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,440
"After heh"

300
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,640
It's an "after heh"

301
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,040
So what the hell is going on here?

302
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,410
Why is it now!?

303
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,490
The results are, Morita scores 4 "heh"s

304
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,430
If eh is included it would have been about 20

305
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,620
Seriously

306
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,690
The next challenger is...

307
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,960
He'll probably be pretty good at this

308
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,780
Alco&Peace's Hirako

309
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,810
His target is

310
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,030
His junior, Time Machine No. 3's Yamamoto

311
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,940
How will it go

312
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,940
What will the result be?

313
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,270
Have you met with Kusanagi recently?

314
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,440
Kusanagi, not really been in touch

315
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,200
The same company

316
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,290
Kusanagi called me recently

317
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,480
He was filming on location and called me on location to say,

318
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,910
He bought a Galande

319
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,180
Eh~

320
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,520
Mercedes G Class

321
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,520
Eh, on not that one?

322
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,240
Good at it

323
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,550
Miyashita
-Didn't Miyashita buy a Tesla?

324
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,490
His Tesla was scuffed up

325
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,250
After he got out of the car he realized it was scuffed

326
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,700
Quite good at it!

327
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,650
Indeed

328
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,760
He was on a "Let's go see a foreign car" kind of location shoot

329
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,460
He does look like the kind of person who would say "I'll take this one"

330
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,430
Seems the type

331
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,530
He has some of his own money it seems

332
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,820
Seems to be saving a lot of cash
-Heh~

333
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,300
He had a large stack of cash with him
-Heh~

334
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,700
This is a heh-man

335
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,970
With lies shrouded in seeming truthfulness, two "heh"s appear early on

336
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,340
A heh-man!

337
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,270
What's more,

338
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,280
Not like Hyouroku

339
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,110
Hitori is also very successful

340
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,930
This guy is like a professional liar

341
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,350
Ah because of "Asakusa Kid"? I watched it

342
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,640
It was interesting
-I had tears in my eyes

343
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,450
I actually went to Asakusa yesterday, and it was really great

344
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,890
Did you know that the story itself is actually based on Tamori?

345
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,220
Eh?

346
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,430
Hitori actually shot the story of Tamori

347
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,960
He requested it of Tamori

348
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,100
"I want to make a film about you, Tamori!"

349
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,900
Tamori didn't even wait for him to finish before refusing

350
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,840
"I've not lived a very pleasant life," he said

351
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,210
But Hitori said,

352
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,940
"It doesn't matter, regardless of what the story entails,

353
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,750
You're an extraordinary man!"

354
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,220
After saying that, Tamori smiled and said

355
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,090
"As long you don't add anything to it, it's fine."

356
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,090
So true

357
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,100
So awesome

358
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,490
Without using any BGM and so on as a condition

359
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,160
Good at it

360
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,390
Heh～

361
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,360
Just shoot it in a normal way

362
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
Hmm~

363
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,700
Under these conditions

364
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,350
A different noise

365
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,940
At the end when the credits roll

366
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,270
There's a song played on the trumpet by Tamori
-Wow...

367
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,240
Heh~

368
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,470
That one is OK

369
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,250
It doesn't say "Tamori" on the credits either

370
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,200
The type of person who says heh

371
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,860
A lot of talk!

372
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,050
Heh~

373
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,370
A very long heh

374
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,390
Show businesses is amazing

375
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,220
Super long

376
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,480
Although he has successfully gotten a lot of "heh"s...

377
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,730
Did you watch the NASA press release? The news just came out in the evening

378
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,960
NASA

379
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,800
It confirmed that although there is no heaven in the world, hell does exist

380
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,340
Too much, right?

381
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,270
NASA said that?
-Yes

382
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,040
Did you know that the international rules of shogi are being changed to make it OK to repeat two moves?

383
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,800
Impossible

384
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,470
Starting to fail

385
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,310
No, it means that a two-step move is going to be OK

386
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,120
You can't. If you can repeat two steps, it's not...

387
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,920
It's too fake, right?

388
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,410
As the believability of the lies gradually decrease

389
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,830
The number of "heh"s also began to plummet

390
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,020
And so

391
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,960
Ota Pro seems to be retreating from show business

392
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:33,360
They've proposed entering a new field, said "i'll do denim instead"

393
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,610
A big lie

394
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,030
Well, if Levi's could do it, it's possible I guess

395
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,890
Can Ota Pro make denim and sell it?

396
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,470
Throwing accurate and reasonable remarks at crude and poorly thought out lies

397
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,850
That's true

398
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,700
The greatest truth of all

399
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,440
Do you know the new flavors of Giggles coming out next year?

400
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,440
※Giggle-kun (garigari-kun): Japanese lollipop brand

401
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,510
On the offensive again

402
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,350
I don't know but i'm sure its quite unexpected

403
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,280
It has the smell of petrol

404
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,250
I'm sure it won't sell

405
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,220
They're now whispering words to each other...

406
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,120
So here it is time to reveal the truth

407
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,060
In regard to "heh"

408
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,770
In my understanding, Hirako is a person who loves to lie and blow smoke

409
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,940
I just had the feeling of "Ah~ here we go again with this stuff"

410
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,670
A suspect's expression

411
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,500
So, Alco&Peace's Hirako scores 5 points

412
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,410
But the results are pretty good

413
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,000
The final challenger is

414
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,140
Knights' Hanawa

415
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,050
Who is your target?

416
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,790
It's Master Oozora Yuhei

417
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,290
The one everyone knows

418
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,810
A senior manzai talent

419
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,540
Who knows?

420
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,890
Master Oozora Yuhei

421
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,490
This is bad

422
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Even holding a musical instrument in his promo picture

423
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,700
3rd tier, right?

424
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,800
Who cares?

425
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,550
Because he's 70 years old

426
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,220
I think he probably doesn't understand youth culture

427
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,990
I don't think i've even seen him using a phone

428
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,690
Probably doesn't know how it works

429
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,630
So it might be good to go down that kind of route

430
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,630
I see

431
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,260
It's been a long time since you've been on TV like this, right?

432
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,440
It's been a long time

433
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,040
How many years has it been since TBS? About 7 years?

434
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,780
Very nice looking person

435
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,440
Before was it for manzai work?

436
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,640
Yeah manzai

437
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,310
In terms of us, we come every day

438
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,780
Mm-hmm

439
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,480
There is a late night TV shopping program

440
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,220
Oh I know the one

441
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,080
I'm on that show

442
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,750
I do that one live

443
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,050
Ah, is it a live broadcast?

444
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,190
Heh~

445
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,890
About 6 days a week, working from 3:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m

446
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,860
Heh~

447
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,030
Sometimes until 5:00

448
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,300
It's very hard work, you don't get much sleep

449
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,650
So gentle

450
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,780
Basically, I don't sleep, I just go directly to the next job

451
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,750
But wasn't TBS in decline for a while?

452
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,880
There was a time they made a lot of money in Korea

453
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,780
Isn't there a group called BTS?

454
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,460
That was originally a TBS group

455
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:12,820
Heh~

456
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,350
Originally a group selected by TBS through auditions

457
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,830
No, it's not

458
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,970
Then a guy named J.Y. Park came along
-Hey~

459
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:26,340
And changed the TBS into BTS

460
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,670
Now this group is quite hot in the United States

461
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,840
They earn a load of money

462
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,740
Heh~

463
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,440
Royalties and such

464
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,400
A lot of high quality "heh"s

465
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,480
Fascinated by everything

466
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,050
The level of a master

467
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,820
Oozora Yuhei hits a "heh" streak

468
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,670
And so we enter the previously mentioned topic of phones

469
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,590
Signal...is your phone a smartphone?

470
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,200
It's a tablet, I have both a cellphone and a tablet

471
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,460
You don't have a smartphone, do you?

472
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,970
I have a smartphone

473
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,170
You have both a smartphone and a tablet?

474
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,500
Yes, yes

475
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,870
An unexpected error has occurred

476
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,490
The master is actually a wealthy man who owns both a tablet and a smartphone

477
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,740
So youthful!

478
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,480
However,

479
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,950
I don't seem to have any signal

480
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,350
My cell phone signal still has signal, it's normal

481
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,640
He knows all about signal

482
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,390
I'm connected at least, I can tell there's WiFi

483
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,820
Ah here it is, it feels right to say it like that

484
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,230
Prior to the age

485
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,340
Cute

486
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,060
You know, people below the age of 60 can see it, right?

487
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,240
I can see the Wi-Fi signal hovering around

488
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,830
The signal in this place is pretty pleasant-looking

489
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,110
Oh really?

490
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,950
Heh~

491
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,310
Is this some kind of good guy competition?

492
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,360
This guy is too good for this

493
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,840
Already looks like a good guy competition

494
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,450
So does it go "poof" if you walk into it or something like that?

495
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,660
If you hit into it it just brushes past you

496
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,920
Heh~
-You can't see it anymore, right?

497
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,420
Can't see it at all, no

498
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,660
Usually in the lounge people can always see it

499
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,740
Looks so happy

500
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,560
"The signal's strong today," so to speak

501
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,160
Heh~

502
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,390
He's a model contestant

503
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,440
As the lack or possession of IT knowledge is tested

504
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,290
A big move leads to 3 consecutive "heh" explosions

505
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,290
After this also

506
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,410
I've been an M-1 judge for 4 years

507
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,280
Did you know, the scores are already determined beforehand?

508
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,720
It must be like that, right?

509
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,650
Before the show starts we're given the script

510
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,890
It's not like that, master!

511
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,680
This is really suspicious

512
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,140
Like "Matsumoto gives 0 points, Uenuma gives 0 points", that kind of thing

513
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,460
Everyone looks at it beforehand

514
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,130
It's true

515
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,470
Master!

516
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,030
Why, master!?

517
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,350
Must've been decided long ago

518
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,250
It's not like that!

519
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,470
Why do you think that?

520
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,200
5 minutes left on the clock

521
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,860
Impressive

522
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,580
No matter what it is, it all works

523
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,480
Next is the final sprint

524
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:49,210
Recently there are more and more manzai newcomers joining Manzai Talent Association

525
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:49,980
It's a good thing

526
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,780
Like Kaminari and such

527
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,850
So apparently big things are about to change

528
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,590
I've heard that this summer Downtown are gonna join Comic Talent Association

529
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,560
Wouldn't that be great?

530
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,260
The atmosphere in the association is quite good now

531
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,030
If changes don't happen, the atmosphere in the association won't improve

532
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,640
But in the end...

533
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,510
But haven't they said they want to disband? Dai-bon Sho-bon

534
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,110
Eh？

535
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,280
Really?
-So i've heard

536
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:27,850
That XXXXX I went to a party with them

537
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,120
Dai-bon's seniors and XXXXX's relationship seems to not be very good

538
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,290
Relationship with XXXXX is not good either?

539
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,250
Ah?

540
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:41,760
Didn't XXXXX have an argument with a mentor at the Manzai Newcomer Awards?

541
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,840
Don't say anymore!

542
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,200
Went in a strange direction

543
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,790
Stop it, stop it

544
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,470
Really...

545
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,800
As horror stories about Dai-bon that even he doesn't know begin to come to light

546
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,010
Stop it now!

547
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,050
What's this all about?

548
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,480
The truth is now revealed

549
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,780
I'm really sorry, master, we've actually pranked you

550
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,680
Prank?

551
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,890
This is actually...

552
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,580
Cute

553
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,760
Wednesday Downtown

554
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,790
Eh? But my hair is super messy

555
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,460
I often have messy hair myself

556
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,180
That's not the point

557
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,200
By the way, the number of "heh"s...

558
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,800
You achieved a total of 21

559
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,180
So strong!

560
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,670
I must have an addiction...

561
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:25,140
The result is
Oozora Yuhei, please be extra careful about getting scammed

562
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,890
Impressive

563
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,570
Finally, the previous lies mentioned Matsumoto and Hamada

564
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,450
Today, sure enough

565
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,680
With Matsumoto on a break currently, it makes all of this look pretty suspicious

566
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,730
With Matsumoto off today,

567
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,230
It looks like Hamada is a scapegoat for a lot of things

568
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,580
What scapegoat? What am I a scapegoat for!

569
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,490
All of this news is probably going to leak in about 2 weeks

570
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,570
Let's welcome the next presenter

571
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,780
Zun's Iio!

572
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,570
Hello everyone in the bend, thank you for having me

573
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,570
Let's get right to it

574
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,480
The agency i'm a part of belongs to an office called Asai Planning

575
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,710
One of the great seniors there is Sekine Tsutomu

576
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,220
What does everyone think of when they think of Sekine

577
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,290
Imitation or something like that
-Indeed

578
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,610
Imagination
-Yes!

579
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,360
Someone who can create imaginative stories

580
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,500
That's right. 15 years ago, I witnessed Yuuka's parents steeped in an illusion

581
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,270
Inside their minds?

582
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:35,670
So, this time I bring you a theory about Sekine's specific skillset

583
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,140
This is it

584
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:45,050
There is no successor to Tsutomu Sekine's art of impeccably introducing members of the public

585
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,250
Nostalgic!

586
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,520
We all know the show "It's Okay to Laugh", right?

587
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,170
This is Sekine's swift description when a member of the public is features

588
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:02,740
He would say something very appropriate to the characteristics of that person

589
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,740
He'll say it instantly
-Right

590
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,310
"Three meals a day, all pasta" or something like that

591
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,730
Yeah, yeah

592
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,630
Very impressive
-Just one sentence

593
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,440
The art of Sekine Tsutomu must not be lost

594
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,330
So this project is to select his successor

595
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,190
Sounds interesting

596
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,200
The 2nd Generation Sekine Tsutomu Tournament!

597
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,140
This time, comedians were asked to try

598
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:37,900
The art of describing people who appear one after another with a short phrase

599
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,810
Sekine could really do it well

600
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:45,980
5 extras are randomly selected from a group of 20 people

601
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,440
Is that Hyouroku?

602
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,380
Definitely not

603
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,060
By the way

604
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,460
Thanks for having me

605
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:00,040
Sekine himself is the judge and will score the contestants' performance out of 10

606
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,940
A true successor

607
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,070
The first challenger is

608
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,340
This is bad, these feet spell something bad

609
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,600
Thank you

610
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm looking forward to it

611
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,470
He is really on this show a lot

612
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:16,440
Audrey's Kasuga, who was also a regular on "It's Okay to Laugh" as the same time as Sekine

613
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,140
You're the first up

614
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,010
Well it makes sense, since I have some experience

615
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,640
I will be the successor to Sekine's style

616
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,820
Is that so

617
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,410
So let's get started

618
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,430
It's hard to watch

619
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,120
So, please welcome the first person

620
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,130
BGM: Hiromi Goh - Oyome Samba

621
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,680
The song!

622
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,130
The music is the same as the original

623
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:48,470
Visits several fortune tellers in a row before getting the desired answer

624
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,720
It's good
-Good

625
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,910
8 points!

626
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,910
A feeling of sincere yet slightly naive

627
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,850
The kind of person who doesn't express their own opinion that much

628
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,320
This hits the mark perfectly

629
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,020
Let's move on to the next person

630
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:14,900
Caught a T-shirt thrown out by Hase Hiroshi at a wrestling match

631
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,830
I can't believe he came up with that!

632
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,140
This is good

633
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,310
9 points!

634
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,480
Had a nightmare yesterday

635
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,180
This can be said about anyone!

636
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,040
4 points!

637
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,200
Ah this one isn't good

638
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:40,320
This "had a nightmare yesterday" is too blunt and thoughtless

639
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,860
Being more specific about the nightmare would be better

640
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,000
For example

641
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,730
Had a dream that all his teeth fell out yesterday

642
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,470
If you put it that way

643
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,040
It would be a 7 or an 8

644
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,270
Expanding on what nightmare it was would be best

645
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:12,060
Able to beat someone up the first time they meet them

646
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,370
Too much!
-Too sloppy

647
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,460
This one's too much

648
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,300
The person being evaluated will probably feel bad after hearing it so it's not good

649
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,130
It's important to not hurt people's feelings

650
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,170
That's for sure

651
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,270
Because the other party is not in the industry

652
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,370
If it's a comedian then it's fine

653
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,640
But you shouldn't do it to a member of the general public

654
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,420
There are still rules

655
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,290
Only by possessing the quality of consideration

656
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:40,650
And not hurting the participants can one become the heir to Sekine's style

657
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,560
But Kasuga isn't aware

658
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,030
Husband embezzled a large sum of money

659
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,700
This is a prime example

660
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,570
A public servant in Aomori

661
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,840
Too much!

662
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,570
But it's still kind of interesting

663
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,750
In summary, Kasuga's total score is 32 points

664
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,850
Thank you

665
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,320
Well done

666
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,590
You had some good answers and some not so good answers

667
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,290
I can't believe there's some that weren't good!

668
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,760
It only takes about a second, right?

669
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,560
You only have that amount of time to say something

670
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,400
But your performance is more impressive than I expected

671
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Really?

672
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,470
Can Sekine please say one?

673
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,810
If I were to say one...

674
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,840
The third one is a little on the heavy side

675
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,180
Only the wife's whining and gout cannot be overcome

676
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,660
Not bad for him
-Good

677
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,550
Awesome!

678
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,650
If you just say "suffers from gout," it'll seem a little harsh

679
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,920
It would be too direct

680
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,320
So add a little bit of the wife aspect first

681
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,620
The demonstration of a pioneer

682
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,290
The next challenger is

683
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,800
Thanks for having me

684
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,620
This'll be good

685
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,140
The Great King of Kansai, Laughing Rice's Nishida

686
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,540
Nishida is very interesting

687
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,510
Good-looking face too

688
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,680
Like a person in a Chinese ink painting

689
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,780
Please can the first person enter

690
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,610
Already going!

691
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,450
Always ready. It's a habit

692
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,550
This one is difficult

693
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,760
Still using mixi until now

694
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,760
※mixi：Social media platform established in Japan in 2004

695
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,900
This is a good one

696
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,470
Not trying too hard to be funny is a good approach

697
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,910
Brought back a dog that was completely different from the one that ran away and kept it

698
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,450
Whoa!

699
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,820
She's indeed emitting the aura of regret regarding letting it run away

700
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:10,070
Beaten by son with a violin

701
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,300
This is no good

702
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,310
Such violence is not allowed

703
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,450
Same person

704
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:28,120
Offered Chicken McNuggets to the statue of The Buddha Jizo

705
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,760
Differences in food culture

706
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,690
Good!

707
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,150
McNuggets are so effective

708
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:35,390
The combination of "The Buddha Jizo statue" and "Chicken McNuggets" is great

709
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,370
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

710
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,170
This is great!

711
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,670
Looks good with the glasses and looks like he has a good brain

712
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,310
It's also good that it ended at MIT

713
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,050
Interesting

714
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,270
Despite points lost for having violent elements

715
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,390
He surpasses Kasuga with 36 points

716
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,530
If only he didn't say the violin

717
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,880
The next challenger is

718
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,460
Thank you

719
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,960
Kano Eiko

720
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,030
So, let's have the first one on stage

721
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,470
This MC is a firecracker

722
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,440
An assistant producer on Funny Manga Dojo

723
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,450
Whoa!

724
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,320
I want to score a 10 on this one

725
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,660
But nowadays, young people don't know "Funny Manga Dojo"

726
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,660
※A program broadcast from 1974 to 1994

727
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,660
Therefore 2 points were deducted

728
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,190
In my heart it's 10 points

729
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,140
Installment fees are covered by us

730
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,710
This is a bit of a no-go

731
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,840
5 points

732
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,110
A little underworld hint, right?

733
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,010
So what should you do with scary-looking people

734
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,650
This one is...

735
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:07,120
Heaving a sigh, was supposed to quit 3 years ago

736
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,190
Who would say such a thing

737
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,060
It's kind of the opposite

738
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,660
Fuji Takashi would certainly laugh at this

739
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,370
Even carefully washes no-wash rice

740
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,780
8 points

741
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,750
She does have that atmosphere of carefully washing rice even if it doesn't need to be

742
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,330
Sells cicada shells for 10 yen

743
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,400
7 points

744
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,670
Raised a cat that immediately ran away

745
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,710
This is 6 points

746
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,540
I'm not really getting the same feeling

747
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:14,890
In summary, Kano overtook Kasuga with 34 points and reached second

748
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,340
The next challenger is

749
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,290
Thank you

750
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,140
Razor Ramon RG

751
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,730
So, let's have the first one on stage

752
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,500
Often resents blow drying her hair after showering

753
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,570
This one needs a bit more of something

754
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,680
Despite having a person she likes, she won't admit it

755
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,520
This is bad

756
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,720
It's too straightforward

757
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,080
Next,

758
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,230
Loves to wear red clothes in his spare time

759
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,960
Too weak

760
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,030
It's not red, it's burgundy

761
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,570
Too similar

762
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,910
Despite using analogies, Sekine isn't impressed so the score doesn't raise

763
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,640
Next, please

764
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,290
It's actually a centre parting

765
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,890
I think this is good

766
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,560
The phrase "actually is" gives it substance

767
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,030
It's a good one

768
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,630
But the total score is 31 points

769
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,830
And so, he's in last place

770
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,600
More. I want to do it again

771
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,410
I wanna repeat

772
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,440
Wow - dammit - it's too tough

773
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,460
And, the last challenger is...

774
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,240
Naked Eye Lifting 1.0, hello everyone

775
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,090
Zun's Iio, a direct junior and descendant of Sekine's style

776
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,430
If Iio isn't there who else would come?

777
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,000
Let's have the first one on stage

778
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,770
Can't be completely honest two nights a year

779
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,480
Not bad for a guy like you

780
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,480
Whoa!

781
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,050
This "can't be completely honest" is great

782
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,720
And 2 times a year

783
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,700
Baseball team made it to Koshien in the second year of high school

784
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,030
7 points

785
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,900
I've also used this

786
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,330
When the person doesn't have much characteristics that stand out

787
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,800
Just focusing on unrelated events

788
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,880
Didn't just say "Baseball team made it to the Koshien"

789
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,010
So it makes it a bit funnier

790
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,520
There is a shortcut to the park that only he knows

791
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,220
Fantastic!

792
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,290
8 points

793
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,210
This is great

794
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,740
Despite the loneliness... the day after tomorrow, I'll be back home

795
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,480
This is funny

796
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,640
"Despite the loneliness" this

797
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,450
With this emotion at the beginning, you can feel the power of the line

798
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,130
Never had to worry about his children

799
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,030
This is good

800
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,230
Raising children is difficult

801
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,830
And he also has this look of tenderness

802
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:55,000
In summary, the final results are shown

803
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,010
Iio, with an average score of 8 or more, claims the top spot

804
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,810
Awesome!

805
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,880
Pioneer, Hello Mr. Pioneer

806
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,320
"Can't be completely honest two nights a year"

807
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,550
That's a great one

808
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,920
Oh really, thank you

809
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,760
The person from Cameroon?

810
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,390
Can you do one for them?

811
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,660
For example,

812
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,400
Used to seeing elephants

813
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,070
Worthy of you

814
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:30,680
In summary
Zun's Iio is decided as the second-generation

815
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,660
Iio is great!
-Thank you. I'm so sorry

816
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,980
I'm sure you've been watching
-I've been watching

817
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:43,850
But i'm a bit embarrassed to get first place in the VTR

818
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,570
It was great!

819
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,920
What do you think Hamada, 2nd generation, 3rd generation

820
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,730
I think it can be done

821
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,660
I hope some new people will step up

822
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,820
Kawashima, you should too

823
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,620
Join in

824
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,900
I'd like to see it

825
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,910
You're so impressive on "Love it!"

826
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:03,110
You can take Matsumoto and Sekine's crowns!

827
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:09,880
Next is "everyone's theories!"

828
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,460
Tonight's presenter is...

829
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,290
Hello everyone
-Jinai Tomonori!

830
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,160
Jin!
-That's right, Jin is here!

831
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,630
Without further ado, do you know about "T-shirt tips"?

832
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,700
Is that the folding method?
-Yes

833
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,100
I saw it on tv
-Yes?

834
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,440
Fold it quickly

835
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,210
Yes, yes, yes, yes
-We're aware

836
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,840
I have a T-shirt here

837
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,910
I will demonstrate a common folding method

838
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,040
Come bird... like this

839
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,650
"Come bird?"

840
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,750
Mr Jin!
-Mr Jin!

841
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,480
Mr Jin's got a screw loose!

842
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,180
No, that's not true. Good job
-Yeah, right

843
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,590
Cute

844
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,580
Here we go, everyone watch this folding method

845
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:00,580
Here we go. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, right?

846
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,070
Mr Jin!

847
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,670
Fast, right?
-It's neat

848
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:11,340
We can often see this on life style programs
-Indeed

849
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,310
But who actually invented this technique?
-Who did?

850
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,410
So, this time, the theory is:

851
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,880
The mysterious origin of the t-shirt folding technique

852
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,050
Ah
-It is mysterious

853
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,390
Who was the first to use it?

854
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,690
Not some guy in a store?

855
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,030
"Some guy in a store"

856
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,400
Excuse me

857
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,560
The store staff member came up with it

858
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,900
Sekine will be angered

859
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,240
They have to finish folding quickly. It can't take long

860
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,740
That may be so

861
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,560
Don't really know

862
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,940
But I haven't seen much of it in stores
-It's true

863
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,480
I've never seen a clothing clerk do it
-Yes.

864
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,280
No one has ever used this method of folding, right?

865
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,880
But this method should be the fastest

866
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,020
The mysterious origin of the t-shirt folding technique

867
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,160
Do you know the tips for folding T-shirts?

868
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,300
Pinch the T-shirt at the seam to fold it?

869
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,480
We all know that

870
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,570
Pick up one side of the T-shirt and the other side and fold it in one go

871
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:14,540
I've seen pinching the clothes in two places to fold it

872
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:23,490
Many people have seen such tricks but not tried them

873
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,340
It's true that it's always on TV

874
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,890
90% of the people are vaguely aware

875
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:35,950
When was it born and how was it popularized by TV programs?

876
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:43,630
We used the TBS library and web to research

877
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,110
Hard work!

878
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,610
We found it was featured just 8 months ago in August 2021

879
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:53,330
There is a program that introduces this technique

880
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,700
Very recent

881
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,080
Indeed

882
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,250
It is as follows

883
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,250
Asa

884
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,950
Asa's weather forecast

885
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,810
Do you have clothes that have not been folded yet?

886
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:09,260
Today i'll introduce you to a quick way to fold clothes

887
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:14,790
Grab here and here and then do this

888
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,530
It's folded

889
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:24,270
Old people and 3-year olds get to know about this technique

890
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,570
We continue to investigate

891
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,360
Is it necessary?

892
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:38,260
On Midday West! in 2021, a former clothing store manager introduced clothes storage tips

893
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:44,170
How to fold clothes in seconds was introduced

894
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,170
It was also featured on TV Tokyo's 2020 "Seven Colors Perfect Day!"

895
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,490
2 years ago

896
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,900
The presenter marked symbols on T-shirts

897
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,880
Are carefully described the method

898
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,550
That method

899
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:05,090
In recent years, this has been featured in morning and afternoon lifestyle programs

900
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:10,540
In 2020 it also appeared on a variety show

901
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,430
Super convenient 2 seconds to fold clothes trick

902
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,600
This voice is Iio

903
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:21,610
This method was introduced by cleaning professionals on TBS "Papa Johnnys WEST"

904
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,320
2 seconds from the time I pick it up

905
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,240
What happened

906
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,420
Young people don't know?

907
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,410
Awesome

908
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,010
Although times change, young people can still be impressed in 2020

909
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,790
This shows the importance of constant reintroduction

910
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,440
We continued to review earlier programs

911
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:56,010
And found 23 programs since 2010

912
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:03,180
Around 2010, lifestyle programs were a big hit

913
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:08,850
A piece of cardboard, you put it on, you fold it, fold it again

914
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,780
Fold this way, then this way

915
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,540
Ridiculous tricks like folding clothes with cardboard

916
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:24,290
A variety of T-shirt folding tips crowded TV  at the time

917
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,530
However, as we continued our investigation

918
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,810
More and more clothes

919
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,780
Murakami mother and son's super fast T-shirt folding method

920
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,970
It stopped at 2009's "Fast Life Guide SHOW"

921
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:46,490
The folding method that was introduced every year suddenly disappeared from earlier programs

922
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:53,860
Until we discovered it again 4 years prior in 2005

923
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
More?

924
00:41:54,870 --> 00:42:00,440
The originator of lifestyle programs, "The Ito Family's Table"

925
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,730
Ah the Ito Family

926
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:08,370
After appearing in 2003, it became the No.1 tip of the year

927
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,140
And even appeared on the show 3 times in one year

928
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:21,000
And there was no show that introduced the folding method earlier than this program

929
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:27,260
So, the trick was introduced by this program

930
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,230
Therefore, it this it's origin?

931
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:38,090
We interviewed the chief director of the program at the time, Amamiya

932
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:43,710
Did your program come up with this folding method?

933
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,780
Yes

934
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:54,320
This little trick was invented by our program team

935
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,950
As expected, the "Ito family" is the source of the trick

936
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,020
Independently developed eh?

937
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:07,360
At that time, a housewife wrote to introduce the technique of folding bed sheets

938
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,030
We thought this technique was good

939
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:17,570
But thought whether we could change the object to something else to make it more useful

940
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:22,780
At that time I was in the midst of T-shirt collection mania, I had probably over 200 of them

941
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:30,550
This inspired determining whether it could be modified for t-shirts

942
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,160
That's how it came about

943
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:40,370
So, the origin of that folding method was about 19 years ago

944
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,040
It came from a program!

945
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:45,870
It aired on August 26th 2003

946
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,670
Do you usually use this folding method?

947
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,110
I always roll up my T-shirt

948
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:57,950
I have too many T-shirts so they can only be rolled up otherwise its impossible to store them all

949
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,240
I can't believe I'm not using it!

950
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,780
My home is too small, they can only be rolled up for storage

951
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,410
Thus reveals Amamiya's status as a member of the Rolling School

952
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:11,420
A professional father will not use this method

953
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,240
Usually no one uses it

954
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,240
Yeah...

955
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:18,590
What!?

956
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,580
Scary, a sudden appearance!

957
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,020
Drug Screening

958
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,740
Thank you for your hard work
-Hello

959
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,910
What is this?

960
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,520
I have a few spare clothes with me

961
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,790
Bringing clean clothes?

962
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,020
Yes, I keep them on hand to change

963
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:39,470
A technique appears!

964
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,080
A standing fold

965
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:44,310
A man who usually has no concern for storage casually uses this method

966
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:52,670
The origin is the Ito family, whereas it's only user is the Kuro family

967
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,200
Kuro family
-An unexpected development

968
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,040
That's awesome
-It is, isn't it?

969
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,100
When the staff investigated, it found that, aside from Kuro-chan

970
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,850
Kotouge and Zakoshi both use it

971
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,850
Baldies love to use this trick

972
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:08,630
Seriously!

973
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:11,420
It should be called "the bald people folding method"

974
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,690
Only bald people fold clothes like this

975
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:18,470
What was up with the violent cardboard method

976
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,270
I can't believe they use cardboard boxes

977
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:21,530
Didn't you see the cheers in the studio?

978
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,830
The Age of Peace
-Bubble era?

979
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,070
A crazy era in which folded clothes can be an event

980
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,840
Those people don't fold clothes like that at home

981
00:45:28,740 --> 00:46:14,820
