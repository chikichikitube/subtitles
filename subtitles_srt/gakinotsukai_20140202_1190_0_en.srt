1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
Lastly is Matsumoto

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,420
What type of cooking is he particular with?

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,320
Has anyone fried gyoza?
I have

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,430
I think most have failed once or twice...

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,530
I have done it

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,500
Until now, I have never failed at frying gyoza!!

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,130
I would like all of you to watch me today

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,070
Let's observe him

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,340
I'm not saying to copy/follow me

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,410
My talent would come out truer,
if I used my own frying pan...

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,780
Isn't it bad that it's steaming?

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,610
From the frying pan?

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,880
You remove the pan from the burner?

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,020
Remove it from the burner?

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,250
The reason for taking it off the burner

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,450
There would be a time laps from the first and the 10th gyoza

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,060
I see

18
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,220
By doing so, you don't really need the high heat

19
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,260
That's really true

20
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,730
But from here, it's really the "Feel"

21
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,270
I like Tanaka earlier, you have to "Feel" it

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,670
To ensure the heat has gone through?
That's right

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,170
I have a little more cooking oil...

24
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,140
Is it medium cooking temperature?

25
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,910
Yes, it's medium temperature
Got it, medium heat

26
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,850
It should be crisp like this
Looks delicious

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,880
You look at it?

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,550
You could look at it!!

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,990
Followed by adding water, cover the pan and let it simmer-steam

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,920
Let's raise the heat

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,930
I see
You bring up the heat

32
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,570
I really didn't want to do this
The cover is transparent, but it's best to cover it completely

33
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,500
I see

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,800
Just by the sound

35
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,770
Gyoza is cooked by just the sound

36
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,310
I'm listening to the sound, it's saying "shuwa, shuwa"

37
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,840
When it's saying "shuwa, shuwa" the water content is high
I see

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,250
When it says, "chiri, chiri" it's ready
It's ready?

39
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:43,980
That's right

40
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,050
You know, the staff were suggesting to add cornstarch

41
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,720
To give it a more crisp texture

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,260
It's a waste of time
Waste?

43
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,630
There's no need for it!!

44
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,660
I want them to enjoy the gyoza even further!!

45
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,000
Enjoy it further?

46
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,270
Almost throw it in!!

47
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,270
Throw it in?

48
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,470
I want them to enjoy it in the "raw/pure" state

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,370
It can't be raw!

50
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,010
Not literally

51
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,780
After 2 minutes

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,210
Listen, "chiri, chiri"

53
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,650
Is it coming?
Yes, it's ready

54
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,450
See!

55
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,990
Okay it's ready

56
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,490
It's done!

57
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,120
Are you serious?

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,860
Is it done?

59
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,730
It does definitely looks good

60
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,370
Doesn't it look delicious?

61
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,870
Definitely look delicious

62
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,940
Looks really good!

63
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,770
Definitely looks tasty

64
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,980
Doesn't it look very tasty? It always turns out this way!
Beautifully done

65
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,850
It always turns out this way!!

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,810
You getting carried away

67
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,820
But, normally

68
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,450
Isn't it 100% perfect?

69
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,690
Yes, the appearance, I will enjoy it

70
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,490
Tasting time

71
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,790
How is it?

72
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,530
It's delicious

73
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,100
Yeah, it's tasty, but others who fry gyoza

74
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,900
Isn't it all the same?

75
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,870
All right then!!

76
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,940
You try frying them!!

77
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,040
Calm down now

78
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,340
I'm not saying

79
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,850
Hamada will now challenge frying the gyoza

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,980
You don't even say a thing

81
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,180
It's not hot enough

82
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,890
I didn't say anything earlier

83
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,920
Matsumoto-san you said

84
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,260
You should say something

85
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,560
Gyoza are always getting stuck together

86
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,660
You know

87
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,530
Your effort is "Half-heartedly" done

88
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,660
Now for the water

89
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,600
Hamada who has never fried gyoza is doing
it from memory of Matsumoto's visual earlier

90
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,170
Is the amount of water enough?
Yes

91
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,000
It should be enough

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,340
It was about 1/2 cup
I see

93
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,010
Waiting 2 minutes

94
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,740
The sound

95
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,980
The sound really

96
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,080
It really

97
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,480
Does it mean it's ready?

98
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,980
It's not making much noise, so it means it's ready

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,920
What do you think?

100
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,660
He covered it

101
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,830
It's not a funeral

102
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,500
Please make sure to look at it

103
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,900
Interrupted Announcement

104
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,110
Favorite personnel, the World Acclaimed Heipo

105
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,010
His history in All five parts

106
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,180
Will be on sale

107
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,880
All will be on sale, on March 5th

108
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,990
The gyoza Hamada had cooked for the first time

109
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,790
All right, it's done

110
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,260
Here you go

111
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,560
You've seen these before?

112
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,260
Please look at this

113
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,160
There are this type

114
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,670
I'm talking about these

115
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,970
There are these type

116
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,170
Then eat it!

117
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,370
You see, they are just normal

118
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,210
It's really not the same!

119
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,440
What's so different?

120
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,910
Hamada's Gyoza

121
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,910
Matsumoto's Gyoza

122
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,010
Then please just eat them

123
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,980
I'll eat them, I think they're tasty

124
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,500
Delicious!!

125
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,490
Don't lie!

126
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,090
The burnt part is good?
Isn't it bitter?

127
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,850
It must be definitely bitter

128
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,920
If it's burnt
It's delicious!

129
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,060
There is no problem

130
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,930
What's wrong?

131
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,900
The outer layer is powdery

132
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,370
The outer layer is a bit hard
Right

133
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,240
It's normal, just regular, it's alright, it all tastes the same

134
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,440
There is a difference

135
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,750
It's a "Bad" gaki = kid's prank...

136
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,520
It was a "Bad" kids's comment...

137
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,520
You too ate my gyoza, but picking on the water content, etc...

138
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,930
You really showed the bad brat's side...

139
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,000
Hamada thinks he's really better
