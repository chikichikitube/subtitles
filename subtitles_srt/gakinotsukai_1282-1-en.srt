1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,960
At a certain hot spring, there is an inn where liars gather

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,800
I kinda forgot about this, it's been a while

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,640
Yes true

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,840
When was the last time?

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,400
1 year? 1 year

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,560
Oh it's been a year? Hmm I don't really remember much...except Yamasaki really sucked

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,800
That's as much as I remember

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,680
Time to explain the rules for Liar's Inn

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,400
They pick a card with small, medium or massive written on it along with someone's name. That person nominates someone else to tell a lie

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,480
Whoever is nominated must maintain the lie until it's time to stop

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,560
I think it would be better to have an audience for this

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,320
Yeah for sure, it would be better if there was an audience

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,720
Well the staff here aren't that bad

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,040
You guys are depressing!

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,240
So god damn heavy hearted

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,660
They're depressing, and they're old men, they way they think

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,080
They think like old men!

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,840
They can't keep up

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,600
Yeah for real

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,720
Ah so Endo

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,590
Endo nominates someone to tell a massive lie

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,520
Endo picks a massive lie

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,200
But a massive lie right away...

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,960
A massive lie is hard to do...

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,680
This is something that really surprised me when I heard it
I was eating dinner with some people,

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
And someone said something that made me go "Did that really happen?!" Matsumoto-san

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,400
Did a meteorite really fall on your family's house?

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,240
It was a pretty long time ago though

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,600
A while ago? When

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,240
I think it's been 7 years

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,520
7 years?

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,440
There were a ton of them!

33
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,720
Oh, it wasn't just one?

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,190
One of them fell right on my mom

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,240
Wait if it hit your mom...

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,040
On my mom, here, it smacked her like BAAAM

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,280
But that would kill you...

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Here?

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,440
We were all watching Kōhaku on TV

40
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,640
My mom- Was it this side or this side? I can't remember for sure,

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,360
It hit like BAAAM
And she went like OWWW

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,200
Surely Ow isn't enough

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,520
It was amazing actually

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,480
Were you there?

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,400
We were playing Domino (Shichi Narabe)

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,560
7 years ago...

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,200
And my mom's hand stopped right at the 6

48
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,720
And we were talking about whether that was a foul or not

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,080
My mom refused to play the 6

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,840
I really remember that moment

51
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,520
I said "Who did this?!" and then it hit her like BAAAM

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,360
And then when her cards fell I saw it was my mom's fault

53
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,680
Ah she was holding it back after all

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,120
Yeah it was all mom's fault

55
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,000
Basically everyone was really pissed off about the game,

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,840
So like we had a talk like "It's bad to ruin the fun like that" ... and it's become a great story in our household

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,800
Mmm.  Mmm.

58
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,240
I understand. I see, I see.

59
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,400
Sorry Matsumoto-san, your sweating is just...

60
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Sorry, umm, uhh

61
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,360
Even though you gave me a massive lie...I'm sorry I turned it into something so small

They must maintain the lie no matter what!

Fully Improvised! Liar's Inn

65
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:45,400
They pick a card with small, medium or massive written on it along with someone's name. That person nominates someone else to tell a lie

66
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,000
Whoever is nominated must maintain the lie until it's time to stop

67
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,600
Alright here I go

68
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:00,450
Endo nominates someone to tell a small lie

69
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,440
Wow!

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,560
It's you again

71
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,480
Tanaka, are you alright? Your rib is broken right now right?

72
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,080
Are you good?

73
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,080
Ah, now that you mention it, it makes it hard to continue

74
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,240
Is it a crack, or is it broken?

75
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,000
It's broken

76
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,440
It's totally broken? I don't think I could hold the pain back for that...

77
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,520
Oh? He's not really speaking that loudly either

78
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,240
He was speaking pretty loudly just earlier though

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,720
Could you try making a loud noise?

80
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,600
Wow that hurts...

81
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,920
It resonates?

82
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,040
If I'm not lying

83
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,640
"If I'm not lying"?

84
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,040
You're enduring it you mean?

85
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,520
What did you do that made this happen?

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,960
I kinda started doing Martial Arts recently

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,280
That sounds like a true story

88
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,520
I didn't know about that

89
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,640
I was in a state of no exercise

90
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,000
"A state of no exercise"?

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,080
I don't really do any exercise, which I thought isn't good. So I started doing Martial Arts.

92
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,280
What kind?

93
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,720
Mixed Martial Arts

94
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,040
Like what kind of stuff?

95
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,160
That's amazing!

96
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,560
Yeah, Mixed Martial Arts

97
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,440
I do know some stuff about this,

98
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh yes Matsumoto-san you do martial arts right?

99
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,160
Where?

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,340
In Ebisu (District of Tokyo)

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,320
Ebisu already?

102
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,800
Ebisu

103
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,680
You don't mean the location, but the Organization right?

104
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,500
Organization? Oh they said they're not associated with any organization

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,320
Well forget about the organization, what's the place called?

106
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,380
It says "Ebisu Mixed Gym" on the sign

107
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,280
Ebisu Mixed Gym, that's where I go

108
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,670
Who are you getting to teach you?

109
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,160
I, uh, my Missus

110
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,880
Missus? Your wife?

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,040
Yes

112
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,000
What do you mean?

113
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,920
Then just do it at home. You don't need to go to Ebisu.

114
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,000
You don't need to go to Ebisu

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,320
Does she have any qualifications? Your wi-Missus

116
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,400
Wi-Missus?

117
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,920
Yes she does, she got her qualifications a while ago

118
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,120
Your wife has a trainer's license?

119
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,880
Yes yes yes she has a trainer's license

120
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Doesn't it hurt to do that?

121
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
It's fine it's fine

122
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,480
Oh, so it's fine?

123
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,040
It's fine, this is my job after all

124
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,760
Yeah

125
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,720
I can't really go "Ow Ow" here

126
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,520
Yeah of course

127
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,640
So I'm forcing myself, for lack of a better word

128
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,240
Your wife does it too then?

129
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,320
Yes, she does it too

130
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,720
It must be awful to get into quarrels with her

131
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,240
Oh no no yes, just one hit is all it takes

132
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,600
Oh she hits you? Yeah that makes sense

133
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,240
She just high kicks me

134
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,800
That's scary

135
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,840
Why did she high kick you?

136
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,740
... Well to sum it up, I had an affair

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,340
You cheated on her...

138
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,280
Well, in some sense, a high kick to get it over with is good

139
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,180
Yes, yes exactly, after the kick she forgave me

140
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,800
Here I go

141
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,200
Matsumoto-san nominates someone to tell a medium lie

142
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,800
Matsumoto-san's medium

143
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Matsumoto-san's medium

144
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,680
I heard this, Yamasaki,

145
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,960
Apparently, Yamasaki found some STAP cells

146
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:14,520
STAP was a proposed method of generating stem cells discovered in Japan that was later found to use falsified data in its report

147
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,360
What?

148
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,480
There's no way that's true... Not after everything we know

149
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,560
Even though they said they don't exist

150
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
But apparently it's true!

151
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,960
My wife found out after Yamasaki's wife sent her a text

152
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,880
She sent like "My husband found some STAP cells!"
With a laughing emoji

153
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
The sweating laughing emoji

154
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,760
Man I told her not to tell anyone!

155
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,480
It's a lie right?

156
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,000
This is, this is the truth

157
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,640
But I kept it secret, and it became a big thing, like the Japanese scientists and stuff

158
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,440
There are scientists outside of Japan!!

159
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
This is a major global discovery

160
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,280
I told her, you know, this will become a big deal scientifically.
I did tell her...

161
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,040
What the hell are you saying?

162
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,840
But isn't it a good thing?

163
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
Yeah if it's true

164
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,560
When Obok*ta-san announced that they exist,

165
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,320
If she's saying STAP cells really exist, then let's go out and try to find some

166
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,120
You went on a journey to find STAP cells?

167
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,640
Yes

168
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,560
But that was disproven right?

169
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,040
Like I said, I found some

170
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,720
How did you find them?

171
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,240
Uh, you know, I was shocked myself

172
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,680
I was so shocked ... I just kept walking

173
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,880
Ok...

174
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,440
You were walking?

175
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,680
To where?

176
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,640
I uh, I made it all the way to Kyoto

177
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,960
Why'd you go to Kyoto?

178
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,320
Well cause, it's an ancient city, and they have lots of temples

179
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,440
By yourself?

180
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,520
By myself, of course

181
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,720
To find a new discovery, he goes to an ancient city instead

182
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,280
Yeah instead

183
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:14,240
I really wanted to show that STAP cells are nothing new,

184
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,440
But they are a new thing...

185
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,980
What did you do?

186
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,920
So I was just walking through Kyoto, and I went to a temple first and asked them,

187
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,360
"Excuse me, have you ever heard anything about STAP cells?"

188
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,130
You asked like you were looking for a missing person?

189
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,760
Missing person...

190
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
This is so messed up

191
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,780
Well, in the end-

192
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,000
You might as well ask?

193
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,480
I might as well ask. I really had nothing to lose.

194
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,520
"Excuse me, have you heard anything about STAP cells? In this area"

195
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,720
"Is there nothing about that from the past?"
"No"

196
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,160
I said "Oh is that so"

197
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,680
At around the 8th temple I went to though,

198
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,320
They said "Why are you searching for STAP cells?"

199
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,680
They knew about it this time?

200
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,640
"Well actually, I really like STAP cells..."

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,080
You like STAP cells?

202
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,000
"So I'm looking for them"

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,400
It's like he's talking about japanese sweets

204
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,080
No no, really

205
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,760
Where did you find them then?

206
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,240
Can I be honest?

207
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Be honest

208
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,840
Please

209
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,640
It was ... behind the Jizo statue

210
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,120
The STAP cells?!

211
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,800
Enough already

212
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,720
You found STAP cells behind the Jizo statue?

213
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,480
So annoying

214
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,840
So annoying

215
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,400
Wow, in such a place

216
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,800
This one

217
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,330
Matsumoto nominates someone to tell a massive lie

218
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,330
Hamada?

219
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,300
I heard Hamada is genuinely the Kamen Rider

220
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,300
TN: Kamen Rider is a superhero

221
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,760
I thought he was supposed to be a cyborg

222
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,960
But this is for real

223
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Your wife said it on a TV show in Osaka

224
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,950
Yomiuri I think it was

225
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,320
Really? Well she did reveal it in Kansai

226
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,400
Why did she say that...

227
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,440
Which means...

228
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,440
Please tell us!

229
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,920
So it's real then? What I don't understand is why you became a Cyborg

230
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,530
Well it's the same reason as Hongo Takeshi (Kamen Rider's protaganist)

231
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,080
Hongo Takeshi had a motorcycle accident or something-

232
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,880
No, he was kidnapped by Shocker (evil organisation)

233
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,280
He was kidnapped by Shocker

234
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,320
Woke up strapped down like this

235
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,420
Oh yeah. Eh? You were kidnapped by Shocker?

236
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
What else would it have been!

237
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,800
When?

238
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,920
"When"? ... I've kept it secret for so long I think I've forgotten
Maybe grade 8?

239
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,480
So young!

240
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,040
You got caught in grade 8?

241
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,400
Before the middle school trip

242
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,760
Wow they caught you back then

243
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,440
But you came on that trip right?

244
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,280
I did, I managed to convince them to let me, somehow

245
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,240
Oh you asked them?

246
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,200
But they told me they just finished so "Don't transform at all"

247
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,440
They said there's still some parts they didn't attach yet

248
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,720
Didn't attach?

249
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,040
What wasn't attached?

250
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,480
Like properly you know

251
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,360
Oh not properly?

252
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,360
They didn't attach the cyborg parts properly, so if I transform now they'll come off

253
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,800
So on that trip, well you were there, we went to different places, and sang and danced like this,

254
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,800
I couldn't move like that, they told me side to side movements like that

255
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
You couldn't even move side to side?

256
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,480
Cause it's like, my hip would slip and return, slip and return

257
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,800
That's terrifying!

258
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,360
So I didn't even like doing this

259
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,720
Maybe I wasn't developed enough in middle school

260
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,920
Have you transformed a bunch of times before?

261
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,640
Well one time I did think "I should be fine" and did try to transform

262
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,960
You tried? How do you transform?

263
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,200
Well they didn't tell me anything, so of course I just tried saying "Transform!"

264
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,560
But it barely did anything. My upper body was the same, but my lower body went like *cyborg noises*

265
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,760
Eh your lower body? What happened to it?

266
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,760
It looked sort of like compression pants

267
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,120
That's not very cool...

268
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,960
You don't know what it was though right? It looked like Egashira?

269
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,040
I didn't really know

270
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,640
Yeah yeah, I thought something would happen to my upper body. But it was lame, it was just compression pants.

271
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,960
Oh you were just normal from the top

272
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,240
I just thought "this sucks, I don't want to be seen like this"

273
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
It's just embarrassing

274
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,400
It's just embarassing

275
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,480
"Enough" I said "Nope!" and *cyborg noises*

276
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,880
You said "Nope" and it went back?

277
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,220
So you didn't fight any monsters?

278
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,520
I did fight them

279
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,520
But I do remember them saying it depends from person to person

280
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,320
Person to person?

281
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,880
If you train well then you can get good in about a month

282
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,600
But my physique wasn't good. And I had side effects.

283
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,840
There are side effects?

284
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,280
You had side effects? What kind of side effects?

285
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,040
What do you mean side effects?

286
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,200
What kind?

287
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,680
Like, it makes you fat

288
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,800
Seriously?

289
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,860
That's a relief. That's a relief really.

290
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,480
I guess we wouldn't know the side effects of being a cyborg

291
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,220
Ah, Yama-chan's medium

292
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,400
Hosei nominates someone to tell a medium lie

293
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,840
Endo, your beauty parlour,

294
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,120
You go to the same beauty parlour as Maeda Bibari-san?

295
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,120
Maeda Bibari

296
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Yes, the same as Bibari-san

297
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,420
Did you pick that one on purpose?

298
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,670
On purpose? Well Bibari-san was already-

299
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,320
There's nothing wrong with that

300
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It could be a true story

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,320
Yeah that's true

302
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
It's not a big deal

303
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,840
It's not really unbelievable

304
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,640
It is totally possible isn't it

305
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,540
It's not really a medium lie, it could be true

306
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,120
Yeah, it's not a big deal

307
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,280
It's totally possible

308
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Yama-chan's massive!

309
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,120
Hosei nominates someone to tell a massive lie

310
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,320
Tanaka, I've heard you've got a perfect memory of your past life

311
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:22,760
It's not something I've ever told anyone, but yes yes, it's true

312
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,800
Yama-chan's massive!

313
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,200
Hosei nominates someone to tell a massive lie

314
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,720
What does a massive lie really mean?

315
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,200
Tanaka, I've heard you've got a perfect memory of your past life

316
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:45,780
If I ever talk about this, people go "Are you serious?" or "That's so weird!", so I've never talked about it before but,

317
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,760
But, yes, if I had to say so, it is true

318
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,440
What happened?

319
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,880
In my past life?

320
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,600
I was, well my appearance was mostly the same, I was still tall

321
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,840
But yeah I was a woman that had this same sort of look

322
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,480
Pretty tall

323
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
Huge!

324
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,960
A 181cm tall woman

325
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,080
What nationality?

326
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,120
An Argentinian girl

327
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,080
Do you remember the name?

328
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,240
I think it was Argentina if I'm right

329
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,040
Ar- Argentina

330
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,680
Her name?

331
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,560
Tanaka Naoki used to be Argentina?

332
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,360
An Argentinian named Argentina?

333
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,940
Isn't that strange? Argentinian Argentina, that's like being named Nippon Tarou

334
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,320
Yes, my name was Argentina

335
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,140
What kind of job did you do?

336
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,480
Umm

337
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,280
Well basically, I was a daughter, I didn't do any work

338
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
What do you mean?

339
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,000
What do you mean?

340
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,160
Well that's possible for a girl right? Not working part time or a job or anything

341
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,200
But you did work a little?

342
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,600
I didn't, I wasn't suited for that

343
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,800
I was free, I really did nothing, I lived a life of no worries

344
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,120
You were a noblewoman?

345
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,920
I was a noblewoman

346
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,840
So your parents were...

347
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes, my parents were-

348
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,200
Eh? What did your parents do?

349
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,880
My parents, were on the street corner doing real estate

350
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
Why mention the street corner

351
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,840
The street corner?

352
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,080
Forget about the street corner

353
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,840
They did real estate, they didn't own that much land, but they did have some

354
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,200
Real estate huh?

355
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
You didn't have any siblings?

356
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,840
I did I did

357
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,320
Oh you did?

358
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,980
Us 3 sisters were pretty close

359
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,040
Oh really?

360
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,440
Please tell us their names

361
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,320
Their names, I think, Bibi? Yeah Bibi Argentina

362
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,480
Argentina is the last name?

363
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,480
Bibi Argentina?

364
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,000
Argentina isn't the first name, it's the surname?

365
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,160
Bibi Argentina, and ... Lopes Argentina

366
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,440
That's a boy!

367
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,480
That's boys name isn't it, Lopes?

368
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,040
And Tanaka what name did you have?

369
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,840
I (boku) - I (watashi) was named Argentina

370
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,640
Does that make sense?

371
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,360
I didn't have a last name, I was just Argentina

372
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,080
You didn't have one? Wow

373
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,680
You were married right?

374
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,760
I was married

375
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,880
What kind of man were you married to?

376
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,200
He really was like Argentina-Man like right out of a picture

377
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,240
Argentina-Man?

378
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,480
What was he like?

379
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,720
Sounds like a monster's name

380
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,640
Well, that's, well how do I say,

381
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,440
What was his name?

382
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,260
Hmm...I think was Lopes Argentina

383
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,600
You mentioned him before! You just mentioned him!

384
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,120
Wasn't that your older sister?

385
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,760
Sorry, it was Gomez Argentina

386
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,480
Gomez Argentina?

387
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,760
Gomez Argentina

388
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,400
Kids?

389
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,640
I had them

390
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,880
A daughter?

391
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,840
What was her name?

392
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,240
Mummy Argentina

393
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,820
That's the mom!

394
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,480
Mummy Argentina?

395
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,360
Mummy means mom

396
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,120
Mummy Argentina...

397
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,720
Here I go

398
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,750
Tanaka nominates someone to tell a medium lie

399
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,680
Tanaka

400
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,320
Tanaka Medium

401
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,560
Matsumoto-san

402
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,400
Yes

403
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,640
Is is true that you've recently started drinking with Tagawa Yosuke-san?
(Actor and former idol)

404
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,780
Ah, yeah

405
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,640
That's unexpected

406
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,280
That legendary Onii Tag is finally coming to Nintendo 3DS!

407
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,680
"Don't get caught" Gasuu Kurobikari Rando
Coming out 12/17

408
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,840
Here I go

409
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,910
Tanaka nominates someone to tell a medium lie

410
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,800
Tanaka

411
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,560
Tanaka Medium

412
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,480
Damn, I wonder if this is true

413
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,640
But I guess I'll ask

414
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,200
Matsumoto-san

415
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes

416
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,040
Is is true that you've recently started drinking with Tagawa Yosuke-san?

417
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,880
Tagawa Yosuke

418
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,600
Ah, yeah

419
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,280
That's unexpected

420
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,600
How did you meet?

421
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,880
He came to me for advice,

422
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,240
He was asking me "what is Yoshimoto Creative Agency like?"

423
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,800
Coincidentally, at the hospital

424
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,520
Hospital?

425
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,200
While I was waiting for my medicine at the hospital,

426
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,560
Ohh you were at the same hospital?

427
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,840
Same hospital. And he went like "Hey Macchan"

428
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,360
And Tagawa-san said his dick hurt or something

429
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,120
There's no need to mention that

430
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,600
So he was waiting with for antibiotics, he told me "You should be careful too Macchan"

431
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
No, why were you-

432
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,560
"It stings you know" he said

433
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,360
Basically he kept saying his dick hurt

434
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,600
And that's when you made plans to get drinks?

435
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,840
Ah that's when you planned?

436
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,960
Yeah, like "Let's get drinks"
"Once I'm off the antibitotics I can drink alcohol"

437
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,720
"I gotta take antibiotics for about 2 weeks"

438
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,200
"Basically it hurts"

439
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,000
And the whole time he was talking he was, touching his dick

440
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,160
"Are you alright?" I asked
"I'm fine I'm fine!"

441
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,600
Wow!

442
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,580
"I'm fine! DAHAHAHA"
And I said "You're being kind of loud"

443
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,440
He is that kind of person

444
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,320
Yes, he is

445
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,640
He said something like "It's the 7th time this year"

446
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,960
That's awful, why does it happen so often

447
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,240
"But forget that, how is that Creative Agency, huh?" and kept hitting me like this

448
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,560
He's acting like a drag queen

449
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,760
They called for him "Tagawa-san!", and he came back with a ton of antibiotics

450
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,480
It was sticking out of the bag even

451
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,920
Seriously? That really is a lot

452
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,160
Yeah, there must be a variety of them

453
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,560
Tagawa-san was explaining it to them

454
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,680
"You've messed this up"

455
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,600
What do you mean?

456
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,640
There's probably bunch of different ones, he probably couldn't cure it so he got a lot

457
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,300
Like "You forgot about this one!"

458
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,160
"What is it Macchan, for real huh?"

459
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,920
He's not how I imagined at all

460
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,120
He was going like this

461
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,000
No way, he put you in a headlock?

462
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,600
Not how I imagined him at all

463
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,040
"How do you like it~"

464
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,680
That's all he says huh?

465
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,040
Not at all how I imagined...It's amazing you went out for drinks after that

466
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,640
That's ALL he says

467
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,720
I think after that we started

468
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,920
It's just you two when you go?

469
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,160
Yeah just us 2

470
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,040
You don't invite others?

471
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,480
"If we invite others, it's soo, you know, soo annoying right?" he said

472
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,860
What is annoying?

473
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,560
"So much stuff, it's so not it you know"

474
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
"Let's go~ Let's goooo~"

475
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,640
But if it's the 7th time that's happened to him, he must like it right?

476
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,880
Ohh, I didn't ask anything about that

477
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,140
Don't know the cause after all

478
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,160
When I asked why it happened he said "SHUT UP YOU!"

479
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,760
"WHO THE HELL ARE YOU ASKING?"

480
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,240
But, that's a natural question

481
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,500
"Are you an idiot?!"

482
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
So that's just off limits

483
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,260
It's not like it's always for that reason, sometimes he gets fractures

484
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,470
He gets fractures?

485
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,470
It's not always his dick then?

486
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:22,400
Of course, that's something I'll say for his sake, it's not always about his dick

487
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,680
Sometimes he just needs a compress

488
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,400
A compress?

489
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,660
One time he got a fracture too

490
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,640
You can just buy a compress

491
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,640
Did he get antibiotics

492
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,720
He did get antibiotics just in case

493
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,800
He's just always got them

494
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,280
"I wanna get some~ What do you think about that?"

495
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,540
I'm gonna get scolded aren't I?

496
00:23:54,650 --> 00:24:13,080
