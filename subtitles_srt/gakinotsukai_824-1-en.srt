33
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,690
It might be Hosei-san's answer.

34
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,570
But Hamada is completely wrong.

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,420
Let's announce the right answer.

36
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,580

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,030
Amazing.

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,030
He likes animals...

43
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,540
Correct answer was: watching movies.

44
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,650

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,650

Eh?!

50
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,570
I have no idea.

Say it faster!

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,450
Taurus.

66
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,180
So he is a taurus.

67
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,460
Correct answer was: Taurus.

68
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,800
Hey, you were right.

69
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,670
Amazing.

70
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,000
I am probably the one knowing most about Tanaka.

71
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,710
He knows that the answer is Taurus so he should just say it faster.

72
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,640
Yeah, he should.

73
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,950
It's really hot in here.

74
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,950
Yeah.

75
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,180
Lets us just continue.

76
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,400
Tanaka can't hear anything we say in here.

77
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,680
Really?

78
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,650

79
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,600

What?

96
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,420
Kind of nabe?

97
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,540
Anything is fine as long it's a kind of nabe.

98
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,600
I didn't understand.

99
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,630
Are you done everyone?

100
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,450
That's wrong.

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,460
Ah, that's what he meant?!

102
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,910

It's obvious that you are right. It makes me feel sick.

150
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,960
He only looks straight ahead.

151
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,930
This makes me feel disgusted.

152
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,460
What is Tanaka's favorite story?

153
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,970

168
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,010
Spot on.

169
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,940
Something must have happened during that time.

170
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,420
Weren't they in the same class?

171
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,770
How disgusting.

172
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,830
They must have gotten close then.

173
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:11,900

You were right.

182
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,100
I didn't feel good after I told Yamazaki about this.

183
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,730
Who do you think is the filthiest out of the four others?

184
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,680

192
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,330
Who do you think is the filthiest out of the four others?

193
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,440
Yamazaki-san.

194
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,070
He answered directly.

195
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,990
That was fast.

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,050
Everybody was wrong.

197
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,650
That was the fastest answer he has given us during the whole quiz.

198
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,010
Who do you think is the most malicious out of the four?

199
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,810
This is absolutely me.

200
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,510
This is unexpectedly hard.

201
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,080
Let's see your answers.

202
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,530
Endo-kun

203
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,530
Hamada-san

204
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,530
Me

205
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,530
Yamazaki

206
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,760
Let's announce the right answer.

207
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,550
Who do you think is the most malicious out of the four?

208

Matsumoto-san.

209
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,810
Everybody was wrong.

210
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,180
It's impossible for me to be the most malicious.

211
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,240
Why?

212
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,190
That's what Tanaka thinks.

213
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,380
I am pure, pure, pure boy.

214
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,740

215
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,740

Let's announce the right answer.

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,760
Three.

218
00:10:44,160 --> 00:11:02,640
(Around here they start copying Endo by making faces when the camera zooms
and the banter is usually "that looks forced!" or "you are trying too hard!".)

219
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,910
Who has Tanaka been talking a lot too recently over the phone?

220
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,760
Let's see your answers.

221
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,030

Let's announce the right answer.

226
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,030
Who have I been talking a lot to recently?

227
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,580

228
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,710

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,760

Let's announce the right answer.

235
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,470
Moshimo Box.

236
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,540
You are overdoing it.

237
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,620
How much money does Tanaka usually have in his wallet?

238
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,050

35,000 yen

242
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,250
70,000 yen

243
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,470
Let's announce the right answer.

244
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,600
Around 70,000 yen.

245
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,090
Aren't you overdoing it?

246
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,760
They have been going on for over two hours
but are only done with 200 questions. It's time for a break.

247
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,350
These are the results after 200 questions.

248
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:55,950
(During the break Yamazaki is asking Matsumoto questions (that they already answered) and he doesn't know the answers. Yamazaki then asks a question and Endo answers it and Yamazaki says "wow you are really into Tanaka". Endo responds by saying "Yeah, I'm pretty into Tanaka". Then the narration says after this a mircile happens to Matsumoto.)

249
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,250
Matsumoto-san, here I go.

250
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,720
What was his favorite story?

251
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,320
Ah, I remember.

What?

253
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,120
You don't remember a thing about Tanaka!

254
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,400
What was his favorite story?

255
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,880
Shitakirisuzume.

256
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,260
Right.

257
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,280
Let's continue.

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What does Tanaka's wife often scold him about?

259
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,830
She wants me to talk more with her.

260
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,970

261
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,430

266
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,160
That's three in a row.

267
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,650
(Can't see answers)

268
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,270
I won't miss once after it has become evening.

269
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:36,320
(Apparently Matsumoto is on a 20 for 20 streak after the break.)

270
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,330
I feel disgusted.

271
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,670
You'll remember more about Tanaka.

272
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,440
It doesn't make me like him more.

273
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,380
I'm turning into Tanaka.

274
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,850
No that's impossible.

275
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,200

276
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,440

You can move there next week.

288
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:52,060
After this did they get 20 questions wrong in a row and they are getting more tired after every question.

289
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,980
The four of them are looking more and more lifeless.

290
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,130
