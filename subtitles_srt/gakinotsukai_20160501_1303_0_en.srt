It's for that, right?

12
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,000
What we're doing today.

13
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,280
Yes, that's right.

14
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,030
This time, we're trying something different by telling scary stories.

15
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,830
This time, we're trying something different by telling scary stories.

16
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,170
So that's what we're all doing today.

17
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,450
The season is really wrong though.

18
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,450
It really is.

19
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,450
It's way too early for this.

20
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,800
We're getting ahead of ourselves.

21
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,240
I thought it would be nice to try it.

22
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,810
Here we have A and B,

23
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,140
Here we have A and B,

24
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,140
there are two kinds of cards.

25
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,340
I see.

26
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,050
Both of them

27
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,050
have things that show up a lot in scary stories

28
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,120
They have certain words written on them.

29
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,120
The way you're speaking is scary.

30
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,480
He's getting in the mood.

31
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,390
He's getting into it.

32
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,390
I think I'm getting into it.

33
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,530
We have to set the right mood for this.

34
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,140
That's right.

35
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,730
And so, using two of these words...

36
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,570
Sorry, I can't hear you!

37
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,680
He overdid it so much we couldn't hear him.

38
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,880
You're overdoing it.

A and B, they will pick one of each card and

58
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,930
And so, what kind of scary stories will be told!?

59
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,600
Well then, who's first?

60
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,370
How about you, Tanaka?

61
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,770
Starting from me?

62
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,770
Yeah.

63
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,770
Alright, I'll go first.

64
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,770
First an A card.

65
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,770
A is...

66
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,400
Ah, that's good.

67
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,020
It's perfect.

68
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,540
We have that inn atmosphere.

69
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,540
You got it in the first card, the inn.

70
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,020
Ah, "neighbor".

71
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,200
So the room next door.

72
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,200
That's no problem.

73
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
You got really good cards.

74
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,800
You already have the ideal setting.

75
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
The "inn" and the "neighbor",

76
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,080
I'll use them for my scary story.

77
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,510
This is...

78
00:02:03,570 --> 00:05:15,560
Inn

79
00:02:03,740 --> 00:05:15,560
Neighbor

80
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,510
Um...

81
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,940
Not something I heard from someone else,

82
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,310
it's something that actually happened to me.

83
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,370
I was with my family,

84
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,110
and we agreed to go to an inn.

85
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,620
I think it's nice

86
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,000
to go to an inn with a hot spring once in a while

87
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,400
and spend some time relaxing.

88
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,620
I heard there was

89
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,140
uh...

90
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,450
a really nice hot spring inn in Izu.

91
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,880
So I went

92
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,680
to the hot spring with my family.

93
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,240
And it was

94
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,980
a wonderful inn.

95
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,980
and the food was really good.

96
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,150
They even served sashimi.

97
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,370
It was actually really good.

98
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,250
Later, when we decided it was time to sleep,

99
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,600
right before we laid down,

100
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,910
Knock knock knock knock!

101
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,200
Scary.

102
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,970
Knock knock knock knock!

103
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,220
That's scary.

104
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,400
There was knocking on the wall.

105
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,680
We weren't making too much noise, right after I said it was time to sleep...

106
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
Knock knock knock!

107
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,450
I just thought, "What the hell?"

108
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,150
So I used the phone, to call the waitress.

109
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,350
So I used the phone, to call the waitress.

110
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,090
The front desk.

111
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,600
"There's a really loud knocking noise coming from the room next door."

112
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
"What is it?"

113
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,880
And so, the waitress went

114
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
to the room next door to investigate.

115
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,600
But when she came to our room, she said

116
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,420
"There are no guests in the room next door."

117
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,420
"Today there aren't any guests assigned to that room."

118
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,050
"How can that be?"

119
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,050
"We heard really loud knocking

120
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,310
coming from that room."

121
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,620
"Ah..."

122
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,250
"It could be that..."

123
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,820
"That?"

124
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,450
"What is that?"

125
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
It just so happened

126
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
that in the room next door,

127
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,650
a person had died.

128
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,170
And apparently, the person who died

129
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,480
really didn't want to

130
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,220
go to that inn.

131
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,710
Um...

132
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,020
He was forced to go against his will.

133
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,080
Forced to go?

134
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,510
He really

135
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,600
hated the fact that

136
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,970
he had come to the inn.

137
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,850
That's when, that person who forced him...

138
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,370
He stabbed the person who forced him to death.

139
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,770
After they arrived at the inn?

140
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,770
Yes.

141
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
And he...

142
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
He could have done it before they went.

143
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
And he also, well...

144
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,400
Ended up dying, it was that sort of incident.

145
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,740
And that's what happened...

146
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,340
That's what happened at the inn.

147
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,550
I though, "Yeah, that's pretty scary".

148
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,850
It's still going on?

149
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,950
But then, when I looked at my son...

150
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,190
But then, when I looked at my son...

151
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,860
He was making a "I didn't want to come" face.

152
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,560
He was making a "I didn't want to come" face.

153
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,300
Scary Story Ends

154
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,770
A "I didn't want to come" face?

155
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,770
The ending is a "I didn't want to come" face?

156
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,300
That was just awful.

157
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,940
You didn't even use the word Neighbor once during the story.

158
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,140
You used "next door" but not "neighbor".

159
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,850
Wasn't it awful?

160
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,850
No, no...

161
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,110
I really wanted to set the right mood.

162
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,180
You know, for this kind of scary story

163
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,550
I don't think we

164
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,550
should be laughing.

165
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,550
We really shouldn't laugh.

166
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,160
If we're gonna do this, we gotta do it right.

167
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,090
We have to "get in the zone" while telling these, otherwise

168
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,430
Just like in your story, we'll get possessed.

169
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,830
Just like in your story, we'll get possessed.

170
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,600
Who's next?

171
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,600
Go, 'Zaki.

172
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,770
This is gonna be scary.

173
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,770
Right.

174
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,220
This is 'Zaki's forte.

175
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,140
Ah, that's pretty good.

176
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,570
"Hair"

177
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,080
Too bad it's something this person is steadily losing.

178
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,940
I'm not losing it.

179
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,940
That's scary.

180
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,420
This is...ah, what's fashionable. Sorry.

181
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,680
Don't you know what "wearing your years" means?

182
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,020
We're too young for that.

183
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,740
Coriander?*

184
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,880
*For the americans: Coriander = Cilantro

185
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,740
Coriander.

186
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,740
That coriander?

187
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,200
This... how many years ago was it?

188
00:06:28,230 --> 00:08:37,160
Hair

189
00:06:28,400 --> 00:08:37,160
Coriander

190
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Well, it wasn't that long ago.

191
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,340
It's something that really happened to me.

192
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,980
I really hate coriander.

193
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,140
Like, when it's in ramen or other food,

194
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,310
I always avoid it or put it aside.

195
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,080
But one time,

196
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,050
everyone kept telling me, "Don't avoid eating it".

197
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,600
But I hate it, I can't stand the smell.

198
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,850
I don't like the smell, so I told them "Sorry, it smells bad", but there were people who really liked it.

199
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,450
Since the five of us were sharing, they kept telling me to stop avoiding it.

200
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,050
I said, "Alright then", and just ate all the coriander.

201
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,910
So later, I took a taxi home.

202
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,510
I'm sorry, this is a bit disgusting but,

203
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,370
I threw up.

204
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,510
Yeah, and then

205
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,910
the taxi driver,

206
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,350
he said,

207
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,190
"I want you to pay for the cleaning..."

208
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,990
"I want you to pay for the cleaning..."

209
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,850
"Hmm, alright, I understand."

210
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,800
"I'll pay for the cleaning. I understand."

211
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,370
I told him I'd do it but he said,

212
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,110
"I told you to pay for the cleaning!"

213
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,880
"Yes."

214
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,650
"I know."

215
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,800
"It's because I ate coriander and

216
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,310
I just, uh...

217
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,800
felt a bit car sick and threw up."

218
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,310
"I'm sorry."

219
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,910
"What's wrong with you? I told you to pay for the cleaning! Pay up!"

220
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,200
And after saying that, the driver's...

221
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,480
hair went like...

222
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,540
It started wiggling.

223
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
"What's this?!"

224
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,140
"Why? Why is it wiggling like that?"

225
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,940
"Wait a minute!"

226
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,570
"Please stop!", but the hair came towards me.

227
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,140
It came near my neck and...

228
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,680
It wrapped around my neck...

229
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,720
And that's when  I woke up.

230
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,020
And that's when, I woke up.

231
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,020
It was all a dream?

232
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,970
I woke up...

233
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,680
That's just...

234
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,000
Scary Story Ends

235
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,000
Can't we just stop this?

236
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,940
Isn't this too awful?

237
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,140
I just couldn't get my thoughts in order at all.

238
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,840
I just couldn't get my thoughts in order at all.

239
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,910
I knew it.

240
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,910
Yeah well, that happens to everyone.

241
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,370
I could tell.

242
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,050
This is a bit difficult.

243
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,370
The next challenger is Hamada.

244
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,080
The first card was "water well".

245
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,880
The second card was "girl with a skirt".

246
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,310
"Water well" and "girl with a skirt", huh?

247
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,310
Yes, yes.

248
00:09:12,260 --> 00:10:17,730
Water
Well

249
00:09:12,400 --> 00:10:17,730
Girl
with a
skirt

250
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:20,740
In elementary school, around the 3rd grade,

251
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,740
In elementary school, around the 3rd grade,

252
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,740
there was a girl

253
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,040
who wore a red skirt.

254
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,450
In her neighborhood,

255
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,450
she was known as a sweet

256
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,450
and lovely girl.

257
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,990
Suddenly, one day, she disappeared.

258
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,990
Suddenly, one day, she disappeared.

259
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,360
She had gone missing.

260
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,570
The people in the neighborhood

261
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,570
and the other parents

262
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,370
handed out flyers and went around looking for her.

263
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,140
They did those things but...

264
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,140
they began thinking it had been a kidnapping.

265
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,340
They looked for months, but they couldn't find her.

266
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,910
It just so happened that,

267
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,110
there was a water well in the neighborhood.

268
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,400
When they looked in the well,

269
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
the girl had fallen there.

270
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,300
Scary Story Ends

271
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,480
Did they save her?

272
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
He left the ending open.

273
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,840
No, if you think about it...

274
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,480
Did they save her?

275
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,480
Did she survive?

276
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,940
Well, this is a scary story so...

277
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,370
Then why not have her appear as a ghost?

278
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,680
Wasn't it too short?

279
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,420
That was the best I could do, sorry.

280
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,280
That was the best I could do, sorry.

281
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,020
When I got the word "water well"

282
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,020
I just thought, "I'll have some fall in it"

283
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,110
Someone has to fall in if there's a well.

284
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,300
I thought it'd be an open ending.

285
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,140
You're next, Endo.

286
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,140
Yes.

287
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,510
Very nice.

288
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,510
"Expressway"

289
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,650
Is it alright to have that?

290
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,020
And B is?

291
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,910
This is...

292
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,910
"Thin cardigan"?

293
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,910
Well, I think these are alright.

294
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,450
It's fine, "expressway" and "thin cardigan".

295
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,780
Well...

296
00:11:06,440 --> 00:13:09,930
Expressway

297
00:11:06,640 --> 00:13:09,930
Thin
Cardigan

298
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:12,380
Sometimes, when traveling from Tokyo to Osaka,

299
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,380
Sometimes, when traveling from Tokyo to Osaka,

300
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,860
instead of using the bullet train,

301
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,860
I would travel by car.

302
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,480
One time, while I was on the expressway,

303
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,450
I remembered something, you see, I like cars and I replace them constantly.

304
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,680
So when I

305
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,540
got my car sold...

306
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,850
You got your car sold?

307
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,850
When I sold my car

308
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,250
and got another car, the guy told me

309
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:48,150
"Try to not look behind you."

310
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,150
"Try to not look behind you."

311
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,910
The car dealer?

312
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,910
The car dealer.

313
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,910
And uh...

314
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,310
While replying "You got it",

315
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,940
I just took off.

316
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,370
Later...

317
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,650
There was a car behind me that kept flashing its headlights.

318
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,170
I got really scared after remembering,

319
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,600
but the car kept insisting with its headlights.

320
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,000
When I looked

321
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,400
behind me with the rear-view mirror...

322
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,200
When I looked,

323
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,880
it wasn't a car.

324
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,480
It was someone wearing a thin cardigan.

325
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,020
Of course.

326
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:53,480
It a really slender old woman wearing a thin cardigan.

327
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,480
"Open the trunk!", she said.

328
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,710
Knock knock knock !, "Let me ride in the back!"

329
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,850
And so,

330
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,620
I got so scared that

331
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,250
now I always travel to Osaka in the bullet train.

332
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,770
Scary Story Ends

333
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,910
Right, what did you think?

334
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,840
Everyone, please share your opinion.

335
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:23,110
That was Tanaka's "knock knock knock knock",

336
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,110
his partner stole it.

337
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,970
Yeah, you're right.

338
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,280
This duo is gonna fight for it.

339
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,950
This duo is gonna fight for it.

340
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,350
That "knock knock knock knock".

341
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,450
Matsumoto, want to go next?

342
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,220
Alright, whatever.

343
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,730
Face

344
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,730
Pine
Forest

345
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,030
"Pine forest" and "face".

346
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,030
"Pine forest" (Matsubayashi)

347
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,000
Pine forest?

348
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,510
This one's gonna be hard.

349
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,510
This is...

350
00:13:45,070 --> 00:16:23,460
Pine
Forest

351
00:13:45,200 --> 00:16:23,460
Face

352
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,280
something that happened last week.

353
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,350
I was returning home late

354
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,350
and I was wondering what to do.

355
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,150
"I should go to the convenience store

356
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,000
and go home", so I went to the store.

357
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,820
I looked around the store and

358
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
I bought some things.

359
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,370
Since I was already at the store,

360
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,140
I thought it was better to keep walking home.

361
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,600
I was walking by myself in the dead of night.

362
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,910
When suddenly, "Matsubayashi!"

363
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,310
"Aren't you Matsubayashi?"

364
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,310
His name...

365
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,310
He didn't even use an honorific.

366
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,110
"Sorry, I'm..."

367
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,600
"You're Downtown's Matsubayashi, right?"

368
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,450
Who makes that mistake?

369
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,820
"You're with Hama-chan"

370
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,000
"Your partner's name is Hamada, isn't it?"

371
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,910
"Yoshimoto Creative Agency's Downtown"

372
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,770
"You're Downtown's Matsubayashi!"

373
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,200
That one's wrong.

374
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,770
"I'm sorry but, who are you?"

375
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,540
Right.

376
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,800
"What do you mean? I'm always watching you"

377
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,740
"You're always on TV", and then he started listing

378
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,200
Your shows.

379
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,250
all my regular shows.

380
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,250
He was your fan.

381
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,600
"I've watched everything,

382
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,340
I also record it all,

383
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,220
and I would never delete it."

384
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,820
"That's how much I watch you, Matsubayashi."

385
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,170
I couldn't believe it.

386
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,620
"You know,

387
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,770
you've gotten everything right,

388
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,940
but my name is

389
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,850
the only thing that's wrong."

390
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,370
"Why?"

391
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,970
"Do you know why

392
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,080
I keep thinking that

393
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,650
you're Matsubayashi?"

394
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,090
"When you get home, look in the mirror."

395
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,090
"When you get home, look in the mirror."

396
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,510
When I looked in the mirror,

397
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,310
My face...

398
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,880
My face was covered with something.

399
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,540
It was like...

400
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,310
my face looked like I was a "Matsubayashi".

401
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,390
What are you pressing?

402
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,370
Ah, wrong one.

403
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,370
You gotta be kidding me!

404
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,370
You're kidding, right?

405
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,930
Scary Story Ends

406
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,080
You pressed your teacup!

407
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,710
You shouted, "Ahh!"

408
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,710
You pressed on it like this.

409
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,170
You went, "Ah!"

410
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,420
I was thinking, "Why isn't it going off?"

411
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,910
It wasn't going to.

412
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,910
Yeah, it wouldn't.

413
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,710
The staff must have thought that I wanted to drink tea.

414
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,850
The staff must have thought that I wanted to drink tea.

415
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,420
What do you want to do?

416
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,420
There are still cards left.

417
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,460
Of course there are still cards,

418
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,560
since Yamasaki has only

419
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,560
done it once so far!

420
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,300
Hosei, go ahead.

421
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,260
Ah, take this one.

422
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,260
This one.

423
00:17:00,000 --> 00:20:30,440
Music
Room

424
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,850
"Music room"

425
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,220
That's a really good one.

426
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,220
That does work.

427
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,940
A music room.

428
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,940
I just remembered...

429
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,250
I'll do it about that.

430
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,250
That was quick.

431
00:17:09,810 --> 00:20:30,440
Swing

432
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,140
"Swing"

433
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,310
Ah, a swing.

434
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,680
They're near each other.

435
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:19,780
This happened when I was in fifth grade.

436
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,780
This happened when I was in fifth grade.

437
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,690
If you asked me why I remember that, I'd say

438
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,690
it's because I had just moved there.

439
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,340
Since I had just moved,

440
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,540
I couldn't remember my homeroom teacher's face.

441
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,510
I wanted to fix that, so

442
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,600
in order to remember my teacher's face,

443
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,450
I waited until everyone went home

444
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,510
and just stayed in the classroom.

445
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,820
That's because, if I stayed there,

446
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,400
the teacher would come and ask me why I was still there.

447
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,280
I thought I could meet the teacher there.

448
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:56,790
I actually, had feelings for that teacher.

449
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:56,790
I actually, had feelings for that teacher.

450
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,000
Seriously.

451
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It was a female teacher?

452
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,000
She was female.

453
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,400
She was an older woman though.

454
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,820
I liked the teacher,

455
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,370
but I never told her, I didn't want to confess to her.

456
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,450
Because, it was embarrassing.

457
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,620
It was embarrassing to say you liked an older teacher.

458
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,340
Is this the right tone for a scary story?

459
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,420
I thought this would be a scary story.

460
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,170
Yeah, the tone is wrong.

461
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:24,220
It was embarrassing, so I wasn't able to tell her.

462
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:31,510
While I was still wondering what to do, she said, "Hosei, it's time to go home", and I replied, "Okay, I'll go home!"

463
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,200
But I decided to follow her.

464
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,050
So I was following her...

465
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,630
Tap tap tap

466
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,680
You could hear her footsteps.

467
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,220
Hm?

468
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,220
Yeah.

469
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,080
I was wondering why her footsteps made that noise.

470
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,740
That teacher was always barefoot, walking barefoot.

471
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,040
That teacher was always barefoot, walking barefoot.

472
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,750
In our school,

473
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,750
they would do that.

474
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,550
Then why does it matter?

475
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,420
Then it's normal, it wouldn't be surprising.

476
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,910
It would be normal.

477
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,940
Everyone would do that...

478
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,940
I thought it was only that teacher.

479
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,200
And her footsteps,

480
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,710
tap tap tap,

481
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,620
tap tap tap,

482
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,170
tap tap tap,

483
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,050
I looked from behind some cover and

484
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,510
it was the music room.

485
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,710
There it is.

486
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,710
Yeah, there it is.

487
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,420
tap tap tap, she went into the music room.

488
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,020
"Why is she going into the music room at this hour?"

489
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,050
I looked at her like this.

490
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,260
Like with binoculars?

491
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,260
Like this,

492
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,760
I used my hand-held telescope to look.

493
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,310
Using my hand-held telescope.

494
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,020
Just do it normally.

495
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,650
The teacher,

496
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,510
she got on the piano and started playing.

497
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,820
There wasn't anyone else.

498
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,740
There were no students, but she played the piano.

499
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,020
"I'm scared!"

500
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,480
"I'm scared, I'm scared..."

501
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,570
"I can't move!"

502
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,970
"I can't move!"

503
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,510
"A swing..."

504
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,200
"I want to ride a swing."

505
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,600
That's just nonsense.

506
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,880
You want to ride a swing?

507
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,940
It doesn't make any sense.

508
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,540
It was just his desire.

509
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,040
Scary Story Ends

510
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,850
What was that?

511
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,370
I didn't get all the walking about.

512
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:42,750
In the end, you could say that the one

513
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,750
that felt the most like a scary story was mine.

514
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,880
Really?

515
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,880
Alright, then you do the last one, Matsumoto.

516
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
The last one.

517
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,930
I was the only one who could tell a scary story.

518
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:52,500
I bet I could do it

519
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:52,500
if you gave me cards while talking.

520
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,310
That's amazing.

521
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,310
Then give him one card at a time.

522
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,310
"Whistle"

523
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,800
This was

524
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,900
back when I...

525
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,270
How many cards?

526
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,610
This is the last one so... 6 cards.

527
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,480
Right.

528
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,410
This is the last one so... 6 cards.

529
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,480
Sure, that's fine.

530
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,480
Is this okay?

531
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,280
Yeah, it's fine, the rules don't matter.

532
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,750
Matsumoto will use six cards to tell a story!?

533
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,750
Matsumoto will use six cards to tell a story!?

534
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,750
Next

535
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,750
Next

536
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,110
Then you'll get six cards while speaking.

537
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,630
Matsumoto will use 6 cards to try to tell a story!

538
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,630
Matsumoto will use 6 cards to try to tell a story!

539
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,630
Matsumoto will use 6 cards to try to tell a story!

540
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,630
Matsumoto will use 6 cards to try to tell a story!

541
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:21,680
To finish, Matsumoto will try to tell a story while successively getting six cards.

542
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:54,630
Whistle

543
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,630
The first card is "whistle".

544
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,530
I went camping once.

545
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,100
It was back in middle school, I went with another friend.

546
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,170
It was back in middle school, I went with another friend.

547
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,740
Right? That time, that friend said

548
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,740
Uh...

549
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,400
What was it? "The guy I invited couldn't go, let's go together, Matsumoto". He wasn't a close friend but,

550
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,600
I thought he would be lonely.

551
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,310
And he just kept going like...

552
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,280
Whistling at me.

553
00:21:54,630 --> 00:22:06,070
Cellphone

554
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,420
"Alright, I'll go", I told him.

555
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,200
So we decided to confirm everything by phone.

556
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,080
Despite being in silent mode,

557
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,370
the phone vibrated like crazy when he called.

558
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:23,390
Laughter

559
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,000
But the vibration wasn't like regular vibration.

560
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,050
It was very intense, but I still answered.

561
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,820
And then,

562
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,540
I started hearing laughing, like in the show "Dorifu Dai Bakusho"

563
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,880
I didn't say anything but it laughed.

564
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,920
It went like "Mwahaha"

565
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:47,540
School

566
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,860
You're going too fast.

567
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,570
Once you use it, I get another one.

568
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,400
That's right.

569
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,230
I can keep this up forever but...

570
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,740
I won't even know what I'm talking about.

571
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,770
The next comes as soon as you say it.

572
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,310
Anyway, the camp was really fun.

573
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,570
We were supposed to only stay one night but

574
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,220
we kept saying, "One more night, one more night"

575
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,880
Before we knew it, it had been 2 weeks.

576
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
2 weeks?

577
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,880
This was just camping?

578
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,250
That's when

579
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:20,680
Prison

580
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,650
I finally noticed

581
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,170
We just kept eating the same thing...

582
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,800
There was a jailhouse...

583
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,280
"This isn't a camp..."

584
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,820
"I've been caught."

585
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:30,020
Prison

586
00:23:21,910 --> 00:24:09,730
This video was brought to you by tofu panda fansubs

587
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,710
"This is a prison..."

588
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,910
Knock knock knock knock knock!

589
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,250
That's my...

590
00:23:30,020 --> 00:24:01,990
Lullaby

591
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,940
That's what we used.

592
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,940
"Help me!"

593
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,740
"Please help me!"

594
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
"You're too loud,

595
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,820
Matsubayashi."

596
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,310
This guy again.

597
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,110
♪ I am not... ♪

598
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,710
♪ Matsubayashi ♪

599
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,710
You're so annoying.

600
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,110
So annoying.
