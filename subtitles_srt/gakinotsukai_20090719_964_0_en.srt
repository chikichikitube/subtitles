1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,410
First time-

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,120
It's my first time meeting them

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,620
Go fish, and then come apologise to me

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,160
Once again at Lake Yamanaka, 15th Fishing Competiton!

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,960
Endo caught the first fish

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,030
Then Itoi

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,270
Then,

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,330
Matusmoto and Ichihara double hit!

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,310
Woah what the hell?

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,340
You both caught it

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,370
Ehhh what?!

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,640
Miraculously, Matsumoto and Ichihara caught the same fish!

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,050
Woah amazing!

14
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,020
It's not big enough to fight over...

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,050
Allow the youngsters to have it

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,050
Then yeah the youngsters...

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,490
Ichihara catches one thanks to Matsumoto's kindness

18
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,460
Iseya Yusuke catches a bass for the first time in his life

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,900
Are you kidding me?!

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,830
This time,

21
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,530
they are off to a good start,

22
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,810
However, Mokomichi and Hamada haven't caught anything!
What will happen?!

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,310
I WINNNNN!!!!

24

25
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,410
No no no no no no

26
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,410
We don't know yet idiot!

27
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,420
I didn't see anything

28
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:19,220
Fishing Competition: Whoever catches the biggest fish wins

29
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,190
Only you and Mokomichi have not caught anything

30
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,190
Seriously?

31
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,500
Heipo come help me out

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,000
Hmm?

33
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,470
You better cut it out man

34
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,340
There's fish here Hamada-san

35
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,840
You better let that one go

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,840
There's fish here for sure

37
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,410
Asano, you......

38
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,940
I can win with this!

39
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,940
What the hell man?!

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,550
The excited Asano has caught 3 already!

41
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,620
It's outrageous I haven't caught a single one

42
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,620
You bastards caught big ones too...

43
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,660
Meanwhile, next to the desperate Hamada

44
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,890
Got one!

45
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,390
The first timer Iseya,

46
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,390
Big one?

47
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,460
It's a big one!

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,230
Catches his second one!

49
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,730
Seriously...

50
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,310
Goddammit he almost dropped it!

51
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,510
Sorry!

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,580
He almost dropped just now

53
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,580
Shit that was close!

54
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,480
Bass fishing is so easy huh?

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,320
Right, Hamada-san?

56
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,320
Eh eh what?

57
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,260
Meanwhile, on Matsumoto's boat

58
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,590
Okuda HIT!!

59
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,300
I've started catching them

60
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,300
This is...

61
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,200
That's a good one

62
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,870
Here you come!

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,870
Long one!

64
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,810
He is really "Fishing"

65
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,210
I see, he is really "Fishing"

66
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,080
Meanwhile, the fishless Hamada...

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,150
But then...

68
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,350
Woah, all of a sudden?!

69
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,090
HELL YEAHHH!!!

70
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,090
So sudden!

71
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,730
Finally I got it goddamn

72
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,730
You got one huh?

73
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,760
Congratulations!

74
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,300
Don't patronise me!

75
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,300
No no no

76
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,270
For now, this is the best I can do

77
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,540
So now only Mokomichi is left

78
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,540
Yeah

79
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,240
Got one

80
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,740
Ichihara got one

81
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,580
That looks like a big one

82
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,950
It's really fighting you!

83
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,920
Did Ichihara catch a big one?

84
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,450
Come on!

85
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,450
You got it!

86
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,450
NICE!

87
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,430
Huge!

88
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,430
Amazing

89
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,430
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

90
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,430
Let me see - It's so big!

91
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,400
Amazing

92
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,800
This is so big!

93
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,020
Damn it! It's so big!

94
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,000
It's so heavy!

95
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,770
Nice!

96
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,210
I keep getting more depressed

97
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,410
C'mon, let's get 1st, 2nd, and 3rd from this boat

98
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,750
Seriously

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,750
I'll try my best

100
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,990
I'll try my best

101
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,220
Endo who enocourages Mokomichi,

102
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,620
suddenly,

103
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,730
Got one

104
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,760
Ahh come on

105
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,860
Alright

106
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,270
Thank you very much

107
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,500
Mokomichi, thank you

108
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,570
What do I do if the fish aren't coming?

109
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,040
This is bad

110
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,110
OK! Got my third one

111
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,980
That tall Mokomichi looks so small now

112
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,620
That confident, tall looking Mokomichi,

113
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,390
Looks so small now

114
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,360
Just wait until the end of the competition

115
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,360
Yeah you're right

116
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,430
He seems pretty frustrated

117
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,030
He seems pretty frustrated

118
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,800
Suddenly, awkward singing from these two

119
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,770
OK Everyone!

120
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,170
Can we have your attention for a moment

121
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,510
This is a small break time

122
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,520
You will all enjoy this lakeside live performance!

123
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,980

I don't understand

154
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,210
Scary

155
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,410
Why this song?

156
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,150
Amazing!

157
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,660
Is this even English?

158
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,690
What an idiot

159
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,110
She's putting her all into it

160
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,240
I like how she's ignoring us

161
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
This is amazing

162
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,930
She sucks, she's doing a normal performance

163
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,370
Only I haven't caught anything?

164
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,370
Seriously

165
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,970

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,770
Below this, below this is a big one

167
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,470

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,850
All three got a simultaneous hit!!

I got a small one

179
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,380

00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,920
All three of us got one?

181
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,920
AHHHH

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000
Got a good one again

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,470
This one is not bad...

191
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,310
Right? What a specimen

192
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,410
It's a bit on the short side

193
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,880
People are similiar to fish, huh?

194
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,050
It's like that

195
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,820
It sounds like we're talking about dicks

196
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,430
Got one! Got one!

197
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,230
The fish are really coming

198
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,100
Outrageous

199
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,370
Outrageous

200
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,640
Thank you very much

201
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,840
Ahh he got one!

202
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,280
Mokomichi finally gets a hit!!

203
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,510
Mokomichi let it go!

204
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,480
It could be a big one

205
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,970
Damn it!!!!

206
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,800
Finally ...

207
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,810
Well Done! Mokomichi's first catch!

208
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,710
Thank you very much

209
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,240
Got one

210
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,910
Keep up this excitement

211
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,380
Using this excitement

212
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,550
I'm catching a bunch

213
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,620
Got one!

214
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,950
Excellent fisherman Ichihara, once again!

215
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,390
Again? Seriously?
That guy says "Got one!" too much

216
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,860
I can hear his "Got one!" the most clearly

217
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,030
His catch rate is amazing

218
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,700
Can't even keep track of them

219
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,870
There's not enough room in the fish tank

220
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,870
Just release it then

221
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,340
Not enough room...

222
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,210
You caught so many you have to release that one?
So cool

223
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,110
He's releasing it cause there's not enough room

224
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,350
He caught so many he has to release some

225
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,850
This guy

226
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,150
God I hate that!

227
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,260
This is messed up

228
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,930
All you need to win is a big one

229
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,530
I want to win

230
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,070
A manly resolve aiming only for victory

231
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,170
That Hamada...

232
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,170
Shit did I get one?!

233
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,140
Shit did I get one?!

234
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,480
That branch flew like "PIIIIN"

235
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,850
Got one

236
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,860
At any rate, today he shall fish! Endo hit!!

237
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,360
I caught this without any bait

238
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,690
Without bait?

239
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,400
Oh you got one

240
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,500
Then Mokomichi as well

241
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
This one is fighting a lot

242
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,110
Thank you very much

243
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,110
OK!

244
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,180
Amazing

245
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,250
Matsumoto changes his lure at the pier

246
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,950
Will he get results?

247
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,520
It's hard to tell when you've got one here

248
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,190
I was surprised when I got one

249
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,260
There's no splashing?

250
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,300
See?

251
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,300
Ehh what?

252
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,970
That was fast!

253
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,970
And it's on the bigger side too

254
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,030
Oh crap me too

255
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,240
Which is this?

256
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,570
That was quick!

257
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,180
It's big

258
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,180
HUGE!

259
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,850
I WINNN!!!!!!

260
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,790
No no no no we don't know yet

261
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,390
Isn't this huge?!

262
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,660
Look at it!

263
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,560
Outrageous...

264
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:10,030
Looking at this I gotta say, did we need the boats?

265
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,240
C'mon c'mon c'mon

266
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,040
No drama at all

267
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,040
Hmm?

268
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,750
You haven't lost a catch yet

269
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,650
Got it!

270
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,190
I'm taking this lightly

271
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,790
It's coming

272
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,790
You caught it

273
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,060
That is...

274
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,060
It's a small one

275
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,300
Okayyyy got it

276
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,500
Me too

277
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,340
I got one too here

278
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,340
What the hell is this?

279
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,850
After dad takes a bath you,
you'd find something like this floating in there

280
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,420
oHhh it's coming it's coming

281
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,920
Oh me too

282
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,360
Iseya gets one at the pier

283
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,560
Did you catch mine?

284
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,560
I think so

285
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,030
Ah you caught mine

286
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,600
Alright I got it

287
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,600
You can catch it like that huh?

288
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,430
How many have you caught?

289
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,200
It's only my 3rd one

290
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,100
You really caught it huh?

291
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,100
I really caught-

292
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,170
You dropped it!

293
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,410
Idiot

294
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,780
Unfortunately, he lost his 3rd catch

295
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,790
What the hell Moko-chan

296
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,430
Mokomichi quickly catches his 3rd fish!

297
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,030
How much longer till we finish?

298
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,270
30 more minutes

299
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,270
Oh really

300
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,240
You're all fishinga lot

301
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,240
Yeah you're right

302
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,910
There's just one event leftover

303
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,910
Of course yeah

304
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,150
That father right?

305
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,550
That's not a father

306
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,250
That grandfather right?

307
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,250
Yes that grandfather

308
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,520
Ah, I see

309
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,520
I haven't seen that old man today yet

310
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,230
Right at this moment...

311
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,230
John

312
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,160
John is right over there

313
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,000
JoHHHn!

314
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,820
It is time for refreshments

315
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,420
For the refreshments, we have a special guest

316
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,160
The special guest ... Is this person!

317
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,190
Creepy

318
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,190
That's creepy

319
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,200
A Namahage? (folklore character)

320
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,900
Somehow, $!$!@# dat fiding, s!@$ real one!
gahaha!

321
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,270
What the hell did he say?

322
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,940
The end, the , the ending, for the ending,

323
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:04,810
TN: Not sure I translated this properly

324
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,810
Keep fishing to the end

325
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,010
I brought snacks for you guys

326
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,010
Ahh thank you

327
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,650
Please, take some snacks

328
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,290
Eh? You don't want any?

329
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,290
No we do,

330
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,790
You need to come closer

331
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,790
Yes Heipo, it's snack time after all

332
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,830
Can you bring the boat closer?

333
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,360
We don't want to hit their boat

334
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,360
Exactly

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,200
WAIT WAIT

336
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,200
Wait!

337
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,800
What the hell are you doing?!

338
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,800
Oh man the snacks...

339
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,470
I told you to take the snacks!

340
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,710
What did you say?

341
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,110
What are you doing Heipo-san?

342
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:43,850
I told Hamada-san "take the snacks"!

343
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,850
I took them!

344
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,620
That's enough

345
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,690
Matsumoto-san, snacks!

346
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,690
No I don't want them they're sopping wet

347
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,360
Eat them please!

348
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:56,230
Let's bring you back in

349
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,230
Deep! DEEEP!

350
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,060
What?

351
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,560
Deep! It's deep!

352
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,560
Deep?

353
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,530
Let's bring you back in

354
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,530
Come on back

355
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,730
What does he mean by deep?

356
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,610
How old are you again?

357
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,740
Fifty-Four...

358
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:20,080
Heipo is interested in what's under Yamasaki's skirt

359
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:20,080
I want to see that. I don't want to see that

360
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,850
That's creepy Heipo san

361
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,620
You're getting excited!

362
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,750
I like that~

363
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,860
Fishing restarts with a fresh mood

364
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,330
That's another one huh?

365
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,800
You got one?

366
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,370
The guys in caps sure can fish

367
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,200
I didn't catch that many

368
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,140
No, no...

369
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:46,080
Asano catches his 4th one!

370
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,150
It makes me happy just to catch one

371
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,450
You're so goddamn motivated

372
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,920
There's some here

373
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,590
Oh that's amazing

374
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,430
Seriously?

375
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,430
I picked a lucky spot

376
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,800
I literally just caught one

377
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,130
You bastard....

378
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,270
What happened this year?

379
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,140
Time up for fishing

380
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,680
Who will win the competition?

381
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,510
So, Matsumoto-san

382
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,050
The battle is over

383
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,050
Yes

384
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,250
We're just waiting for Yamasaki and Tanaka to finish showering

385
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,690
They had some greasy sweat today

386
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,190
I see

387
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,520
They have to take a shower, yes

388
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,520
That's why huh?

389
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,190
It's going to rain soon

390
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,190
Yes the weather is,

391
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:37,360
does not look very good

392
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,030
See

393
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,200
They're walking on two legs already

394
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,470
You just got out of the shower huh?

395
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,470
Literally just took one

396
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,810
Let's continue, time to find the results!

397
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,720
Well done everyone!

398
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,720
Well done!

399
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,920
I've heard good things about today

400
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,890
I think we all did well

401
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,420
That's what we've heard

402
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,430
You all went at it today
First, Shigesato-san!

403
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,300
Shigesato-san

404
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,500
He has a ton of fish

405
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,500
No way!

406
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,730
Big ones too

407
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,730
You caught so many

408
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,300
He did pretty good

409
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,300
They're so big!

410
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,170
They're big yeah

411
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,840
This is the 8th one right?

412
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,910
Thirty? Hold on please

413
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,150
It's 37!

414
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,150
37 centimetres!

415
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,450
This is impressive

416
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,690
Tamio-san!

417
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,890
Tamio-san's turn

418
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,990
Everyone caught so many

419
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,090
6 of them

420
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,800
Tamio-san, thirty-five centimetres!

421
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,790
What the hell

422
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,800
Ahh that's no good

423
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,300
Not the winner

424
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,300
This one, this one

425
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,200
Masatoshi-kun, thirty-seven!

426
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Thank you very much!

427
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,980
Masatoshi-kun?

428
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,980
Even though he used his first name...

429
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,350
Next, Mokomichi-kun

430
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,680
Moko-chan did good at the end

431
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,020
What do we think of this size?

432
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,600
You will pick yourself?

433
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,790
So responsible

434
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,290
It's moving around

435
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,290
Amazing

436
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,670
34.5

437
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,500
Okayy that's great!

438
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,500
I apologise

439
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,470
Iseya

440
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,470
Yusuke-kun

441
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,210
First timer

442
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,240
You did good for your first time

443
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,240
Really?

444
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,580
Look! Look at that fat one!

445
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,520
This is...

446
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,520
Disgusting

447
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,580
It's cute!

448
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,580
It's full of stuff

449
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,420
This is a black bass?

450
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,720
This is disgusting

451
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,720
Let's measure this

452
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,090
So fat

453
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,090
Amazing

454
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,520
Creepy!

455
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,430
What did this thing eat?

456
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,830
So creepy

457
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:57,940
This is... 35 centimetres

458
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,000
Thirty five!

459
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,000
Tadanobu-kun

460
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,070
This one, this one

461
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,110
This is .....

462
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,110
Pick one please

463
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,110
They look the same

464
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,550
That one, that one

465
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,450
This is a big one!

466
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,280
How big?

467
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,480
Wow! This is...

468
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,050
39?

469
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,050
Hold on AHHH!!

470
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,350
Did it pass 37?

471
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,860
It passed! THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETRES!

472
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,230
Impressive!

473
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,530
That is huge!

474
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,970
So, only three left

475
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,940
The first you caught was big right?

476
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,600
The very first one

477
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,870
It was big

478
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,580
HUUUGEEE!!!

479
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,580
That is massive!

480
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,610
So big!

481
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,510
It's big, right?

482
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,680
If this wins, what the hell was the point of the second half

483
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,020
So let's measure this one

484
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,390
It's over 40

485
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,390
Over 40

486
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,690
Eh?! Forty-Five?!

487
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,790
Forty Five!

488
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,790
YESS!!!

489
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,860
Endo-san 45!

490
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,860
YESS! I might win this!

491
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,060
I got a good one!

492
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,500
Hitoshi-kun!

493
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,030
Ahh Matsumoto-san!

494
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,030
How many did I catch?

495
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,040
How-WOW

496
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,770
It's so big!

497
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,910
That one

498
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,210
This one huh?

499
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,410
The fifth one

500
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,580
Matsuomto, miraculously!

501
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,410
Why didn't you say Matsumoto-san?

502
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,120
36.5

503
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,750
36.5

504
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,220
You might as well say 37 I'm not winning anyways

505
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
Get the hell out of the way please

506
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,960
So rude

507
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,260
So that means

508
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,860
Last one

509
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,860
It's just this one

510
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,900
This is it

511
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,900
Last one, lets go

512
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,550
Hold on

513
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,550
Woahh it's huge!

514
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,120
This is close

515
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,420
This is close

516
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,420
This is close

517
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,850
Hold on

518
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,420
How big?

519
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,660
Woahhh!

520
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,560
50?

521
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,860
It's bigger

522
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,360
It's 49 right?

523
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,360
Forty Nine!!!!

524
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,130
Amazing!

525
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,370
So that means

526
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,000
So big

527
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,000
The winner is

528
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,010
Ichihara Hayato-kun!!

529
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,610
