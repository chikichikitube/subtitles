1
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,710
It's actually quite difficult to matchmake for this

2
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,250
This is her first appearance, Yuriyan Retriever

3
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,490
This is a battle between 10 contestants, so I try to avoid having overlapping characters

4
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,490
But also not people who repel each other

5
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,830
Girl, another girl

6
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,940
Women-only?

7
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,340
So maybe all women except him?

8
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,770
Why me? What am I capable of?

9
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,080
I actually thought about having a women-only contest too

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,380
This is like a group dating now, you guys are having a good time, huh?

11
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,350
But that could end up going on the wrong track

12
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,490
So we've decided to put some men in

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,120
So hot...

14
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,660
What the heck are you doing?

15
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,930
That's too much...

16
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm not the goodwill ambassador of nipples, dude!

17
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,070
Please wait for a while

18
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,070
Wait until Daigo is finished

19
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,440
Please learn to wait

20
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,410
How long have you been a comedian? Please learn.

21
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,850
Shoji-san

22
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,050
Yellow card

23
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,590
Because you clearly said  "Ta-ha"

24
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,370
Come on guys, let's go slowly

25
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,240
Agreed, that's better

26
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,640
This is going to last long, so you'll be tired, right? Shoji-san

27
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,610
I think I'll take a nap   -No, you can't

28
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,180
Let's start

29
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,550
It started

30
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,490
Let's calm down

31
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,150
What are you doing Kurosawa?

32
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,960
I wrote "don't laugh" on it

33
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,320
You should know the rules already

34
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,160
I feel like I'm going to forget, so...

35
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,630
Are you still feeling a bit nervous?

36
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,860
So she wrote this to alert herself   -Are you fine?

37
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,330
I'm fine

38
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,570
(Are you fine?)

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,900
Kurosawa, are you fine?

40
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,870
I'm fine

41
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,540
I'm fine

42
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,010
Oh, is this soda?

43
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,450
It's written on it

44
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,380
Oh, it says soda water

45
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,860
Daigo, right? Daigo was close

46
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,860
That's definitely Daigo

47
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,390
Wait a second, wait a second, seriously?

48
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,060
Daigo definitely laughed at that one

49
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,900
Because I heard it behind my back

50
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,030
Which makes you imagine

51
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,970
Yes, because I didn't see that

52
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,510
What's so funny about it?

53
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,970
What's so funny?

54
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,110
Because he did it behind my back

55
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,410
"Pushuu--...Oh, is this soda?"

56
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,810
I won't laugh if I saw it

57
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,150
Kurosawa, are you fine?

58
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,850
I'm fine

59
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,020
Oh, is this soda?

60
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,130
It's written on it

61
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,130
Oh, it says soda water

62
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,300
I thought it's water

63
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,930
This is quite difficult to judge

64
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,200
Because it accumulated

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,600
He's always laughing slightly

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,140
So it accumulated

67
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,870
Daigo, yellow   -I understand

68
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,040
Well, it's just yellow, so still a long way ahead

69
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,780
But I hope you can try harder to keep a poker face

70
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,180
Got it

71
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,610
Okay, let's go slowly

72
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,550
Yeah, we're in a spin

73
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,190
Can I tell you guys a story then?

74
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,190
Yeah, sure

75
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,620
Let's start

76
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,860
It started

77
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,930
Do you guys know about that?

78
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,930
This man that appears in dreams

79
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,530
Eh? What's that?   -I heard about that

80
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,730
You did?

81
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,230
It's really scary

82
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:26,140
In overseas countries, a women had a counselling for mental illness

83
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,510
And she said this same man always appears in her dreams

84
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,640
And she never met this man in real life

85
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,220
So the doctor asked her "how does he looks like", and drew his face

86
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,150
And she's like "Oh, it's him!"

87
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,320
The doctor said "So this is the man who appeared in your dreams, okay"

88
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,390
And he left the drawing on the table

89
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,690
After a while, another patient came in

90
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,460
And she asked "Why is he here? The man who always appears in my dreams?"

91
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,970
Remember, she's another patient

92
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,770
The doctor was surprised and asked "this man appeared in your dreams too?"

93
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,800
And after the doctor published it

94
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,080
Hundreds of people from all over the world, said they saw the same man in their dreams

95
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,620
And this, is the man

96
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:16,260
When this picture was published, people from all over the world said "this man appeared in my dreams too"

97
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,990
So scary

98
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,690
When I saw this picture

99
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,160
I thought like "Huh?!"

100
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,400
He looks exactly the same as someone I know when he was young

101
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,130
Who?   -Please take a look at this

102
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,470
They look the same

103
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,140
Incredible   -Shimura-san?...

104
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,310
Shimura-san when he was young

105
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,650
This man who appeared in the dreams of people all over the world

106
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,110
If you ask what did he do in their dreams?

107
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,420
He gives people relationship advice

108
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,920
Relationship advice?

109
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,950
Shimura-san gives advice?

110
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,490
Oh, is this soda?

111
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,630
So heavy

112
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,070
He said it's so heavy

113
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,340
Because he's carrying a steel on his back

114
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,110
What do you think? Did you ever co-star with Shimura-san?

115
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,210
Nope

116
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,080
Can you do Dafunda (Shimura's gag) for us?

117
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,520
Dafunda

118
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,860
You don't watch other people's gags, huh?

119
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,690
I don't

120
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,100
Dafunda should...   -Dafunda

121
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,200
Make your eyes cross first

122
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,030
And make a funny face

123
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,340
Good, looking good

124
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,040
And then please say it

125
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,200
Dafunda

126
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,310
You never watch other people's gags, huh?

127
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,580
Won't you be worried about overlapping with other's gags?

128
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,080
Did your gags ever overlapped with others?

129
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,010
Gags that overlapped with others...

130
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,550
Oh, yes there is

131
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,160
My gag "Bonjour, mademoiselle, kakimazeru (stir it up)"

132
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,590
Who's gag did it overlap with?

133
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,660
Ikemen (handsome)...I am...

134
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:07,000
*The original phrase is "Ramen, Tsukemen, I am ikemen (handsome)", which is a gag from Kanoh Eiko (Season 5)

135
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,930
Ikemen...

136
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:02,660
Tsukemen...

137
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,560
I am...Nuke (idiot)...

138
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,140
I knew it

139
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,170
It's Daigo, right?

140
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,240
I knew it

141
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,380
Fujimon is suspicious too

142
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,980
He can't say it at all

143
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,550
Because I don't know about it   -Not at all

144
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,820
He's not saying it properly at all

145
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,920
I don't know about his gags

146
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,050
Tsukemen...I am...Nuke...

147
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,590
What do you mean by Nukemen? Please just say it smoothly

148
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,260
I wonder who it will be

149
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,630
I'm sure it's me

150
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,600
Let’s judge this matter

151
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,830
I think I laughed

152
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,700
Well, there's more than one person

153
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,940
And I think it's Daigo

154
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,340
Daigo is smiling all the time

155
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,640
Yes, he's always smiling

156
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,180
He's smiling even when he's talking

157
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,840
So Daigo...

158
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,810
Eh? Please wait a second

159
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,880
That one just now should be Fujimon-san

160
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,920
No, no, I only let out a "hun" sound

161
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,680
So you said "hun"?   -Yes, but...

162
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,950
He said it, he laughed

163
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,320
Then it's Fujimon

164
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,490
All I said is "hun"

165
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,990
Ikemen (handsome)...I am...

166
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,230
Ikemen...

167
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,000
Tsukemen...

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I am...Nuke (idiot)...

169
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,670
Look, he's laughing

170
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,670
No, I'm not laughing

171
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,940
I'm not laughing, right?   -Seems like you didn't

172
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,370
That should count as safe, huh?

173
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,470
Probably safe

174
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,840
That shouldn't be counted, that's too harsh   -Yes, too harsh

175
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,350
Umm...how should this be judged

176
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,010
That's too harsh

177
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,050
Okay, okay, got it

178
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,980
So everyone is safe   -Hooray!

179
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,680
Thank you very much

180
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,690
Just say it smoothly, please!

181
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,990
Oh, it should be Ramen, right?

182
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,260
Why did you say Nukemen then...

183
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,690
Because I thought I have to say something

184
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,290
What does Nukemen even mean?

185
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,430
He even said Bokumen...

186
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,690
Bokumen...

187
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,830
He knows nothing about other's gags

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,470
Let's start

189
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,110
Fujimon always watch other's gags, right?

190
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,240
I watch a lot

191
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,850
Can you do that "Ikemen, Tsukemen" gag?

192
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,250
Of course I can

193
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,680
You remember those moves?

194
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,890
You don't really need to move though

195
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,020
It has some moves like this...

196
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,060
What's your favorite gag recently?

197
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,820
Gags that you want to do recently

198
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,560
Gags that I want to do recently?

199
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,030
The new Haneda Tokyo International Airport

200
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,200
Tanoshingo...

201
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,100
Who's gag is that?   -Tanoshingo

202
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,070
That's pretty old though

203
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,810
You thought it's better to do old gags?

204
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,380
I bet he likes old things

205
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,710
Yes, I like old things

206
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,810
Old gags are more promising (teppeki)

207
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,280
*Teppekin is the catchphrase of a famous deodorant beads CM by Suzuki
*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpz5FweaWYg

208
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,280
Teppekin!!

209
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,550
That's not a gag though

210
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,050
That's not a gag...   Teppekin!!

211
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,250
That's not a gag

212
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,020
If he (Suzuki) sees you do this...   -He's gonna feel unpleasant

213
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,060
Because that's not a gag

214
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,690
But Shoji-san is promising (teppeki) too, right?

215
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,270
Huh?

216
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,900
Please say it again

217
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,940
Shoji-san, how long have you been a comedian? 40 years?

218
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,340
42 years

219
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,140
That's really promising (teppeki)

220
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,780
Teppeki?

221
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,420
Fujimon always watch other's gags, he's really promising (teppeki)

222
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,120
Teppekin!!

223
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,560
And Shoji-san is very promising (teppeki) as well

224
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,930
What's up?

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,040
Let's cook something, shall we?

226
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,140
-Sounds good! There's many girls in here
-Yeah, the girls can cook well

227
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,170
It's rare to have so many girls in here, so...

228
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,410
Girls, girls, girls, huh?

229
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,610
If you think women should cook, then you're making a big mistake!

230
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,950
Women should cook, women should wash clothes, women should clean up the room?

231
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,520
No, that's not what we meant

232
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,590
We just thought girls can cook well

233
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,460
We can cook well

234
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,360
Then it should be fine, right?

235
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
People who can cook well, have to cook?

236
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,300
No, well, there's no need to get angry for this

237
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,840
There're four girls here, so let's ask them to cook something?

238
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,700
That's not what we meant...

239
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,410
You guys have been treating girls like this all the time, right?

240
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,810
What do you guys want to eat?

241
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,180
Well, just whatever is in the refrigerator

242
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,880
If you want an Oden (one-pot dishes), please decide the ingredients

243
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,650
For example, Konjac, Goboten (root vegetable)

244
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,960
Please decide it first

245
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,360
Anything is fine with me

246
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,730
Anything is fine...

247
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,160
There's always that one person saying things like this

248
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,670
If you don't tell us, then we won't know, dude

249
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,670
Same for the broth, it could have Konbu, Katsuo or Niboshi

250
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,770
It's different in different region too

251
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,740
What happened, girls?

252
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,240
What's going on with all these man in here?

253
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,180
Excuse me

254
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,780
They kept asking us to cook for them, very annoying

255
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,350
These dudes should just go ahead and suck women's breast!

256
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,490
We are always ready to let you dudes suck

257
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,960
All we asked for is to cook for us

258
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,330
*The original phrase is a Japanese idiom:
"You don't get to eat if you don't work"

259
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,330
In our world, you don't get to eat if you don't spread your legs

260
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,500
Exactly

261
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,870
And when we say mata (legs), it's not the mata meaning again (same pronounciation)

262
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,270
Why did you add that?

263
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,010
There's always that one person like this within a group

264
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,880
Don't try to analyze us, dude!

265
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
Don't kick things, seriously, Haruna

266
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,680
I'm not Haruna, I'm Reiko

267
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,620
Remember my name

268
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,220
What is your title? Like the Reiko from something...

269
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,390
I'm the Reiko at the window*

270
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:37,230
*From "Totto-Chan: The Little Girl at the Window", an autobiographical memoir written by Japanese television personality Tetsuko Kuroyanagi

271
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,190
Remember that

272
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,230
That's from Yanagi-san...

273
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,800
Totto-Chan...

274
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,370
My name is Kasae

275
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,500
What's your catchphrase?

276
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,810
The arrogant and outrageous Kasae at the roadside

277
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,410
That's so long

278
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,810
The arrogant and outrageous Kasae at the roadside?

279
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,380
I was found at the roadside   -Oh, I see

280
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,920
Oh, so you're an abandoned child?

281
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,520
I'm not an abandoned child!

282
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,220
Yes you are   -You're an abondoned child

283
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,290
You were found at the roadside

284
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,890
Don't treat people like an abandoned child

285
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,530
Because you said you were found at the roadside

286
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,830
So, Kasae-san?

287
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,100
How do you spell it?

288
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,840
Kasae's Ka is Kagawa's Ka

289
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,780
Kasae's Sa is Satou's Sa

290
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,210
Do you mean the Sa with ninben (written as 佐)?

291
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
No, the one with ishihen (written as 砂)

292
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,550
Oh, so sugar (Sa with ishihen means sugar)   -Sugar?

293
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,850
The sweet sugar   -Oh, I see

294
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,420
And E is Katagana

295
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,560
That's an odd name

296
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,690
What about you, what's your name?

297
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,290
I'm Marin from Kitakyushu

298
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,500
I'm Marin with the best pussy in Kitakyushu

299
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,200
The best pussy?

300
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,370
Yes, the best pussy

301
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,670
So every man will be intoxicated after...

302
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,270
After trying Marin-san's pussy?

303
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,270
They say I'm like an octopus sticking to them

304
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,580
What's your name?

305
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,750
I'm Kuniko

306
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,580
Kuniko?

307
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,820
*"Kuni-chan no Yamada Katsutenai" is
a variety show hosted by Yamada Kuniko

308
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,820
I'm Yamada Katsutenai Kuniko!*

309
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,630
So you gals are not going to cook for us, right?

310
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,660
Sorry for making you gals upset

311
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,860
Where is Shoji-san?

312
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,300
Shoji-san didn't appear for a while

313
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,870
I've just remembered this, but...

314
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:33,340
I won the Yamanashi (Prefecture) championship of egg-flying contest

315
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,810
Egg-flying contest?

316
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,280
What do you mean by Yamanashi championship?

317
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,850
Well, Yamanashi championship, Egg-flying championship

318
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,750
What egg is it?   -It's quail eggs

319
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,120
Why are you taking off your pants?   -No...

320
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,060
You need to put this quail egg

321
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,690
In your butthole

322
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,230
And make the egg fly out of your butt

323
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,600
You won the contest?

324
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Yes, I won the contest

325
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Can we have this contest here?

326
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,800
Do Yamanashi (Prefecture) have these vulgar contests?

327
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,810
Excuse me!

328
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,510
*Shoji-san is wearing the costume of people living in the remote valleys of Kyrgyzstan's mountain region, producing the traditional drink of fermented mare's milk, 'Kumis'

329
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,510
Someone, please give me some Kumis

330
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,680
Huh?

331
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,980
Give me some Kumis

332
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,980
Ba...?   -Some Banyuushu (Kumis)

333
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,220
We're having a traffic jam over here

334
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,390
Excuse me

335
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,320
Kumis?   -Yes, Kumis

336
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,820
Kumis? Well, Mr. Kumis

337

Some Kumis...

Excuse me, where are you from?

339
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,600
Eh?

340
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,060
Where are you from?

341
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,200
From Hirakata (city)...   -From Hirakata?

342
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,870
In Osaka?   -No, no...

343
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm from Ulaanbaatar...   -You changed it

344
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,770
What is your name?

345
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,380
Ari...Arisalau

346
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,210
Pardon me?

347
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,580
Arisalau...

348
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,520
Why didn't you decide it beforehand?

349
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,620
You know we're gonna ask you about this, right?

350
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,820
No, I don't know...

351
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,360
Which part did you expect people to laugh?

352
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,390
Please look back and tell us which part

353
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,860
Please look back and tell us which part should we laugh...

354
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,600
Don't look back like this

355
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,940
Please come in and do it again, and raise your hand when you expect us to laugh

356
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,140
Oh, okay, I see

357
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,310
The part that you expect all of us to laugh

358
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,550
Show us what was your plan   -Okay

359
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,050
Sorry, Jimmy-san   -No problem

360
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,420
Excuse me

361
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,420
Okay, please come in

362
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,720
Here he comes...

363
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Please give me some Kumis

364
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,260
Not here?

365
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,390
Kumis? What is Kumis?

366
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,260
It's here

367
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,590
Oh, that's it?

368
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,700
-So that's why he didn't have a clear answer
-Yeah, because he expected it to end here

369
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,070
You're really promising (tepekki), Shoji-san

370
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,510
Yes, I am, because young people don't do these kinds of gags nowadays

371
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,510
Young people nowadays...

372
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,380
Tepekki...

373
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,340
Tepekki?

374
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,380
Tepekki?

375
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,780
Tepekki?

376
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,220
He totally...

377
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,520
What happened?

378
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,860
He was surprised?

379
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,060
Shall we do this then?

380
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,160
Can you really do this?

381
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,800
Yes, well...

382
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,830
Quail egg-flying...Yamanashi championship

383
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,570
It flew out?   -Yes

384
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,670
It's not Yamanashi championship though, it's quail egg-flying championship

385
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,610
It's a quail egg-flying championship in Yamanashi

386
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,610
Did you win the contest, though?   -Yes, I won

387
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,840
How far did it fly?

388
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,480
Eh...about 3 meters

389
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,680
Eh? That's amazing, honestly

390
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,650
How should we prepare for this?

391
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,520
Well, this is done in a unique way, so in your butthole

392
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Where should the audience watch this?

393
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,390
Eh? Just watch it fly out

394
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,700
Can we watch it from the side?   -Yes, you can see it fly out

395
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,860
We can see your butt clearly, are you fine with that?

396
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,300
Well, just watch the quail egg fly out

397
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,070
Is this going to work?

398
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,840
Hey, hey, eww...

399
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,970
Well...this...umm...

400
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,810
The quail egg will fly out

401
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,380
The quail egg will fly out?

402
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,250
Eww...he's putting it in

403
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,380
Oh my god   -I don't think it'll fly out

404
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,320
Yes, it will fly out

405
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,750
No way, it won't   -Yes, it will, it can fly

406
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,020
Please give me a moment, I'll put it in

407
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,490
Be careful, be careful!

408
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,060
Jimmy-san, that's so dangerous

409
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,260
The quail egg fell on the floor

410
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,100
Please wait a second, the quail egg will fly out   -No way, it won't

411
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,830
The quail egg?

412
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,270
Do it over here, get down on all fours   -Good idea

413
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,510
Better do it over here

414
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,380
Oh, I see

415
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,750
Did you really win the contest?   -Yes, I did

416
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,220
Huh?

417
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,620
Maybe I'm a little bit nervous

418
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,650
Wow, it's going in   -It fits?

419
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,360
It's going in! It's going in!

420
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,860
This should work, right?

421
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,730
Yeah, it went in, it went in   -3 meters?

422
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,700
It went in?   -Yes, it went in

423
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,660
Is this going to work?   -Are you okay?

424
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,030
Ah, it went in, it really went in!

425
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,940
Ewww...

426
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,110
How many meters did it fly?

427
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,610
Huh? Where is it?

428
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,780
On the floor...   -It fell on the floor

429
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,780
So it won't fly

430
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,520
No, it did fly during the contest

431
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,650
For 3 meters?   -Yes, 3 meters

432
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,490
I was looking forward to it

433
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,220
I thought it will fly like "pon---"   -That will be hilarious

434
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,960
It's gonna be funny if it flew like "pon---"

435
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,100
This is hand soap...

436
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,200
What are you doing again, Jimmy-san?

437
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,230
(He always washes his hair and his face)

438
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,230
Because...

439
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,670
I did something dirty just now

440
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,940
Why did you wash your hair though?

441
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,710
Well, because it's dirty   -Wash your butt then

442
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,140
You didn't use your hair just now

443
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,080
No, I need to wash my hair, or else it's dirty, right?

444
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,220
No, the problem is your butt

445
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,020
(Exactly)

446
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,020
You're not going to wash your butt?   -I'll just leave my butt like this

447
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,890
No, but...

448
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,390
I actually want to try it one more time

449
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,990
You want a last chance?

450
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,730
May I?

451
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,860
Will it fly out like "pon---"?

452
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,770
The egg crashed inside, so it's slimy now...

453
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,410
It flew out

454
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,450
He clearly laughed

455
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,360
Come on, that's self-destruction

456
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,120
Is that the one in his butt?

457
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,660
I don't know   -Eh? So scary

458
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,160
Is it the one right here?   -Yes

459
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,960
That's the one in his butt

460
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,600
Seriously?

461
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,470
What happened?

462
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,870
Jimmy-san laughed of his own accord

463
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,610
What's so funny?

464
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,650
That dude spat out the egg that was in my butt

465
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,180
And that was funny?

466
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,390
He clearly laughed, and at a strange moment

467
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,190
He clearly laughed but let's take a look

468
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,290
Will it fly out like "pon---"?

469
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,160
The egg crashed inside, so it's slimy now...

470
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,070
He's trying to hold back here

471
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,330
The face of him holding back was funny

472
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,910
I don't understand that one

473
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,510
I don't understand either   -That's a self-destruction

474
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,610
What was that?   -I totally self-destructed

475
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:20,020
I didn't expect him to put that dirty thing in his mouth

476
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,520
Yellow card, Jimmy

477
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,450
I just have to accept this   -Yes

478
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,590
And what were you trying to do with that quail egg?

479
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,490
What is that Yamanashi championship?

480
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,860
You're lying, right?   -No, it's true

481
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,430
There couldn't be such event

482
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,730
It really did, in a snack bar

483
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,600
In a snack bar?   -Yes

484
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,740
Oh, I see   -So a snack bar in Yamanashi?

485
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,800
Yes, a snack bar in Yamanashi

486
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,140
Did it really flew out?

487
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,240
I told you it flew out

488
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,180
Can someone put it in my butthole for me?

489
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,880
It probably won't appear vulgar if it can fly out like "pon--"

490
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,780
So can someone put it in for me?

491
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,150
Did you know?   -Huh?

492
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,250
These girls were...   -What?

493
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,450
Looking at Jimmy-san as if they were looking at a trash

494
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,790
No problem, I don't mind at all

495
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,750
It will fly out, right?

496
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,690
Yes, just let someone put it in for me

497
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,990
Why did you wash your hair just now?   -Yeah, why?

498
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,730
Because it's dirty, right?

499
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,360
Your butt is dirty   -You're hair is clean

500
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,670
You can just put it in with chopsticks

501
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,670
No, no, that's too dangerous

502
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,640
I'll put on some lotion

503
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,980
Put lotion on first?   -Yes, I'll put some lotion on

504
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,180
Are you ready?   -Yes

505
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,520
Is it really going to fly out?   -I told you it will

506
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,450
(I really hope it'll fly)

507
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,020
Can't believe you're doing this, Fujimon

508
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,620
Will poop come out?   -No, poop won't come out

509
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,960
Really?   -Yes, really, really

510
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,160
I'll do it properly...

511
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,860
Hey...that's too much...and not there...

512
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,330
No need to put it on the sides!

513
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,430
I told you that's not necessary

514
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,200
Only the hole, dude

515
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,000
Only the hole

516
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
(Why is he putting it around his butt?)   -Only the hole

517
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,170
Ouch, it hurts! And I told you only the hole

518
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,470
Ouch, ouch, it hurts

519
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,810
Just put it in quickly

520
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,240
I told you it hurts

521
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,110
What the heck are you doing?

522
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,310
Are you the one who asked me to wait at your anus?

523
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,150
Nope...

524
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,560
Are you the one who asked me to wait at your anus?   -No, I didn't...

525
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,120
I'm the gang boss, Takahara

526
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,030
Can I ask him to put it in now?

527
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,570
Come on, just put it in quickly

528
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,240
Please, just put it in

529
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,610
It's incredible if it really flies out

530
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,080
Which one? Where is the hole?

531
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,580
There's a hole down there right?

532
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,210
(There's a hole right...)

533
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,310
Right there, right there, the hole

534
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,320
Yes, right there, did you put it in?

535
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,750
Wait a second, not yet

536
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,150
Put it in quickly

537
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,650
It went in, it went in!

538
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,690
It went in?

539
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,560
Let's go

540
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,700
Probably need another one

541
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,730
Why putting in two...

542
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,670
One more?   -One is already in it though?

543
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,170
It will fly out if you put in two

544
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,670
It's gonna be stuck

545
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,140
One more? You're not making a large-sized fried rice, dude!

546
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,340
Can you shut up, please?

547
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,950
We're still working on this

548
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,820
Is this going to work?   -Yes, I think it will if you put one more in

549
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,050
There's two in it now

550
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,890
It's in it, right?   -Yes, unbelievable

551
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,820
It's in it?   -Do you need one more?

552
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,730
That's awful   -Enough, this is enough

553
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,960
I'll make it fly now

554
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,700
Okay, let's go

555
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,800
Ready, set...

556
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,870
It's stuck   -It went inside

557
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,770
It won't come out anymore

558
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,200
I'll try to slap your ass, okay?

559
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,040
Are you ready?   -Yes

560
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,650
Your poop is going to come out, dude

561
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,950
Let's stop   -This is not working

562
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,680
This is enough

563
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,220
It went inside, right?   -What are you going to do with it?

564
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,850
Yeah, it went inside   -Is it fine for it to stay inside?

565
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,850
It went inside already

566
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,260
Those two eggs are still inside

567
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,260
Someday, someday, it will come out...

568
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,390
Hey! It's gonna come out as a bird

569
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,330
You're saying the wrong joke all the time

570
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,670
The egg will rotten while staying inside

571
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,810
No, it's okay, it will come out when it comes out

572
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,010
It's gonna become century eggs, you know, century eggs

573
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,880
Shoji-san...

574
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,750
Please behave yourself

575
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,780
(Well, he's right)

576
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,490
Will it come out as poop?

577
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,290
Did it ever stuck inside before?

578
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,660
Did it ever stuck inside before?   -What stuck inside?

579
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,030
The quail egg

580
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,760
I'm not in a good condition today

581
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,330
There're 2 eggs inside, please remember that

582
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,260
Yes, there're 2 eggs inside

583
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,030
What are you doing?

584
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,030
What are you doing?

585
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,670
What is he doing?

586
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,810
You're not going to wash your butt?

587
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,370
Please take a seat

588
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,180
Sit down with this thing inside?

589
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:59,300
He's the one who did this

590
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,070
He did it himself

591
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,040
He did it and he laughed   -Come on

592
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,570
What happened?

593
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,240
I didn't expect it to be so quiet

594
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,980
You bursted into laughter

595
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,040
This one is hard to judge too

596
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,680
Mastumoto-san...

597
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,880
Daigo and Jinnai, maybe...

598
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
Umm...no...

599
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,620
Am I right?

600
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,820
I saw Daigo laughed, so I thought it's safe

601
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,730
Come on...

602
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,130
There're 2 eggs inside

603
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,900
What are you doing?

604
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
What are you doing?

605
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,070
What is he doing?

606
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,810
Please take a seat

607
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,810
Sit down with this thing inside?

608
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,360
What about Jinnai?

609
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,630
-Daigo clearly laughed, but Jinnai..,
-Yeah, Daigo is the one who laughed

610
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,200
Really? You laughed after Daigo laughed?

611
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,400
I saw Daigo laughed, so I thought it's safe...

612
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,930
Well, let's take a look at Jinnai

613
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,470
This could be a double kill depending on the situation

614
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,840
Sit down with this thing inside?

615
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,280
He's already smiling here

616
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,050
And after this...

617
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,590
Jinnai...   -Jinnai laughed at the same time!

618
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,460
They laughed at the same time

619
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,260
So Jinnai, yellow card

620
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,860
And Daigo

621
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,860
Orange card

622
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,900
I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble

623
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,330
Oh my god, that sound was awful

624
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,540
Okay, so let's restart

625
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,310
It started

626
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,410
Did you guys ever play the puzzle ring?

627
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,380
Puzzle ring?   -Yes, I did

628
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,680
I'm really good at it

629
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,690
Please let me show it to you guys

630
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,920
So basically to unfasten this puzzle ring

631
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,560
And then?

632
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,180
What the heck is wrong with this thing!

633
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,610
What's wrong with this thing!

634
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,450
You won't be able to solve the puzzle if you become irritated

635
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,650
Chan Noah?*

636
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,290
*Similar pronunciation as puzzle ring (chi-e-no-wa)

637
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,290
Who the heck is Chan Noah?

638
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,490
Chan Noah!

639
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,920
I'm Chan Noah

640
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,990
Chan Noah

641
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,490
Are you an English teacher?

642
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,230
I'm Chan Noah

643
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,370
No, you're not

644
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,920
Both of them are trying to Boke

645
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,640
Sorry for keeping you waiting

646
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,040
Sorry for keeping you waiting

647
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,280
The is the ramen that you've ordered

648
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,880
So tiny...

649
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,620
This ramen is so tiny...

650
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,320
What's this?

651
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,820
This is for the person who ordered Okowa

652
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,090
*Okowa is Japanese steamed rice dish

653
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,090
Not me   -Who ordered Okowa?

654
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,190
Fujimon right?   -Probably Fujimon

655
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,260
He said he wants Okowa

656
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,730
Or do you want this tiny ramen?

657
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,460
You ordered Okowa, right?

658
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,700
Why Okowa...

659
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,000
Here comes your large-sized Nama Beer

660
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,200
Daigo-san and Fujimon-san

661
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,110
Your large-sized Nama Beer   -Thank you

662
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,480
Cheers   -Cheers

663
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,610
It looks even smaller like this

664
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,620
It's really refreshing, huh?

665
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,980
That's what we're proud of

666
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,620
That's what you're proud of?   -Yes

667
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,820
Do you drink with your wife?

668
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,160
Akina?

669
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,060
Yu...Yukina?

670
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,590
Yukina? Is her name Yukina?

671
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,160
How many followers does she have on N...NSN?

672
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,070
It's SNS   -Yeah, SSN

673
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,500
SNS   -SS...

674
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,340
He's completely messed up

675
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,300
SNS

676
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,540
NS...   -It's SNS

677
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,510
What does SNS stand for? Shoji-san?

678
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,280
S...

679
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,950
SNS   -S, N, S, they all stands for something

680
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,720
Story...

681
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,990
Please say it quickly

682
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,320
Story?

683
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,730
Story...   -It's awkward if it takes too long

684
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,700
Because I don't know   -Just say it quickly

685
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,270
N for News, and S for short

686
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,700
SN...

687
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,300
Story News Short?

688
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,270
It could be anything, just say it quickly   -Exactly

689
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,140
It's all about speed when it comes to these things, Shoji-san

690
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,310
But I can't speed up anymore now

691
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,650
Just say it smoothly

692
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,450
SNS

693
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,550
What does MC stands for?

694
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,950
Huh?   -Someone is here

695
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,890
Microsoft

696
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,960
That's MS

697
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Mi...micro...   -Wait...

698
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,200
He got nothing right

699
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,630
Yo, yo...

700
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,100
This place is full of tension, huh?

701
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,370
Excuse me, who are you?

702
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,080
I'm Akira   -Akira-san?

703
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Where are you from?

704
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,750
Godo Retto   -Wow

705
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,710
In Nagasaki?

706
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,750
Nice to meet you

707
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,390
I'm quite good at crisis management, however...

708
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,450
This place is truly full of tension

709
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,660
What brought you here?

710
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,730
I heard that it's full of tension here

711
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,000
You mean here?   -So I thought I have to go there

712
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,200
You like places full of tension?

713
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,900
I want to compete in a place full of tension

714
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,200
Compete for what though?

715
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,240
You guys are competing for something, right?

716
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,710
So I thought what's going on here?

717
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,810
And so...

718
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,580
What do you do for work, by the way?

719
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,250
Akira-san, are you working?

720
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,250
I'm working a lot

721
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,620
What do you do for work?   -I'm free

722
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,260
Free, free, free   -Do you mean Freeter?

723
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,120
Not Freeter?   -Free, free

724
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,160
You mean Freeter, right?   -I told you it's Free

725
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,200
I do anything

726
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,900
What are you doing now, Akira?

727
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,430
Abs workout

728
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,370
You're always working out?   -Yes, I'm working out

729
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,440
I'm asking you guys to stop

730
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,010
Where the heck are you from?

731
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,480
I'm living at the park over there

732
00:33:55,050 --> 00:34:00,650
And it's really noisy over here, so I'm asking you guys to be quiet

733
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,290
This place is under my control

734
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,090
I'm the one who allowed the gangs to control here

735
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,030
And I'm the one who controls the gangs

736
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,690
No, I'm the one

737
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:15,130
I'm the one who's in control, I'm the one who allowed all these shops to open here

738
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,430
And I'm the one who took money from these shops

739
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:22,010
And I'm the one who made those money, for all Japanese citizens

740
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,470
I'm the one who made those papers

741
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:28,580
I'm the one who chose the tree and chopped it down

742
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,620
I'm the one who chose the tree, and chopped it down, and peeled it into paper, and printed those money

743
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,120
Why are you talking like that?

744
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:41,590
Why am I talking like this? Then why are you talking like that?

745
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,290
You don't have the upper right teeth, huh?

746
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,030
I do have the upper right teeth

747
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,560
Yes, I do

748
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,370
I'm the one who made all those teeth

749
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,770
No, I'm the one, I'm the one

750
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,540
No, I'm the one

751
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,340
I'm the one who made all those teeth

752
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,040
I'm a dentist

753
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Both of you are lying, all the time!

754
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,340
I'm a dentist

755
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,280
You're lying!

756
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,810
You look dirty

757
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,780
People like you always lie

758
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,280
I was a pilot before

759
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,850
You're lying!

760
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:06,980
I was indeed a pilot before

761
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,820
I was a pilot too, I was also an astronaut

762
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,520
Me too, me too

763
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,490
I was the first person to be on the moon!

764
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,130
So many strange people here

765
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,890
Is it fine to let them argue here? Waitress?

766
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,930
Umm...please behave yourself

767
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,100
I am behaving myself

768
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,230
Someone's here

769
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,870
They're arguing now

770
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,500
Excuse me

771
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,300
What happened?

772
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,810
I have metal allergy

773
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,170
Because you're wearing this thing, right?

774
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,410
But then you don't have any red spots over here, huh?

775
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,640
It's even on your face

776
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,850
Theses are herpes   -Oh, those are herpes

777
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,850
How dare you come out with just that?

778
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,550
Huh?

779
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,990
How dare you come out with just that?

780
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,090
Well, I just wanted to show you all my metal allergy

781
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,720
Metal allergy, and that's it?

782
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,090
That's it

783
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,690
That's all I want to show you guys

784
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,330
Your performance   -Yes, performance

785
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,130
We all came fully prepared for the contest

786
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,900
So please don't show things like that   -I'm sorry

787
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,970
Sorry, I'm sorry

788
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,170
Please don't say that

789
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,300
That's the style of our performances

790
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,170
Well, yeah

791
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,650
*Shoji-san and Jimmy-san both belongs to the Sanma Family, led by Akashiya Sanma

792
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,650
We didn't learn other kinds of performances from Akashiya Sanma*

793
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,880
We didn't learn those proper performances

794
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,180
What did you learn from Sanma-san?

795
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,620
Okay, what's next?

796
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,330
Maybe let someone out?

797
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,300
Okay, let someone out

798
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,470
Excuse me!

799
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,140
Eh?

800
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,140
I have the most Guinness World Records in Japan

801
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,380
I'm Cherry Yoshitake!

802
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,180
Thank you, Cherry Max!

803
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,220
Oh, Cherry-san

804
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,450
Shiratori's fiancee   -Thank you very much

805
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,250
Congratulations   -Congratulations

806
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,920
Thank you very much

807
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,690
He's actually my helper

808
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,690
Eh? Daigo-san's helper?   -Yes

809
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,860
I became friends with Cherry recently

810
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,830
And Cherry is incredible

811
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,100
He has many Guinness world records

812
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
Look, he really has a lot

813
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Wow, amazing   -Incredible

814
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,370
He holds many records

815
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,970
It's rare to see world records in real life, right?

816
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,110
Never saw one

817
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,450
So, let's ask him to show it to us   -May I?

818
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,050
I heard about you before   -Thank you

819
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,320
Cherry is doing a radio show, right?

820
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,820
Yes, thank you very much

821
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,020
He's doing it with a partner   -I'm doing it with Neko Hiroshi

822
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,020
At where?   -At Kiba Studio

823
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,160
Who the heck will even listen to it?

824
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,330
People living at Kiba will listen to it, right?

825
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,070
Who the heck will listen to Neko Hiroshi and Cherry's radio show?

826
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,240
What are you going to show us?

827
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:45,840
I'll move 29 beans to this bin with straw within 30 seconds

828
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,910
Incredible

829
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,950
The current world record is 29 beans

830
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,750
Eh? Incredible

831
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,150
So if he can reach 30 beans within 30 seconds today

832
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,420
Eh? Will this be approved?

833
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,390
If this can be approved, then that's a new world record

834
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,360
So, there's many seniors here

835
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Cherry is probably nervous too

836
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,760
Within 30 seconds?

837
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,360
Yes, 30 seconds

838
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,370
I'm ready   -Are you ready?

839
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,470
Ready, start!

840
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:17,010
1, 2, 3...(counting)

841
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,010
There's still plenty of time left

842
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,120
10 seconds have passed

843
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,790
20 seconds have passed

844
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:47,700
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

845
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,740
Time's up!   -28 beans

846
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,740
Time's up!   -That's 28 beans

847
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,980
Cherry, time's up

848
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,950
Cherry, Cherry   -Cherry?

849
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,580
Cherry, time's up!

850
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,550
Cherry!

851
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,180
Cherry!!

852
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,350
Cherry!!!

853
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,360
Cherry!!!

854
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,890
Daigo...   -Daigo-san

855
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,890
Time's up!

856
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,990
Daigo-san...   -Cherry!

857
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,790
Daigo...

858
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,600
Time's up

859
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,300
I'm sorry

860
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,530
I really wanted to break world records   -Sorry guys

861
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,540
No problem, that's fine

862
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,340
He's really focused

863
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,870
Yeah, he's concentrated, so...

864
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,140
But Daigo is being too harsh

865
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,180
You're outrageous

866
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,010
Please stop him gently

867
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,650
Sorry   -You got it?

868
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,950
I'll challenge another world record now

869
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,190
What's this, Cherry?

870
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:40,660
I'll ring the bell with my jaw within 30 seconds

871
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,930
That sounds quite easy   -I'll challenge this

872
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,960
Within 30 seconds?   -Yes

873
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,760
Ready...   -I'm ready

874
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:47,760
Start

875
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,000
He'll probably break the record for this one

876
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,910
10 seconds have passed

877
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,920
20 seconds have passed

878
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,090
Hurry up!

879
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:18,030
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

880
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,860
Stop!

881
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,930
Cherry, stop

882
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,130
Cherry!

883
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,240
Cherry!

884
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,300
Hey, no, no

885
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,140
Cherry!   -Cherry, stop

886
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,810
Cherry!!!

887
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,080
Daigo...   -Cherry!

888
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,680
Cherry!   -Daigo...

889
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,350
Cherry!

890
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,050
Stop! Cherry!

891
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,120
Cherry, stop

892
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,920
Hey no, Daigo

893
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
It's not a big deal

894
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,260
No need to stop him like that

895
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,790
Because he doesn't stop   -Well yeah, it's Cherry's fault too

896
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,030
Can you really break the world record like this?

897
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,230
Eh?   -Huh?

898
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,700
Because he's not stopping at all

899
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,340
And Daigo will become angry at you

900
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,770
Would you be able to stop?

901
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,600
Yes, I'll stop

902
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,140
Shall we shout like "Stop!"

903
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,970
Yes, I need someone to shout it out loud

904
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,180
Just shout like "Stop!"

905
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,640
Okay, so we will shout "Stop!" together

906
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,240
Thank you

907
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,680
So, let's challenge this world record?

908
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,150
Oh, what's that?

909
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,490
I'll suck in the tape of the crackers within 30 seconds

910
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,920
I'll set of the cracker

911
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,560
Ready, start!

912
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,030
Almost got that one

913
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,380
10 seconds have passed

914
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,610
20 seconds have passed

915
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,050
Not much time left

916
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:43,910
Go go go

917
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:50,220
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

918
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,420
Stop!

919
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,660
Stop!   -Stop! Stop!

920
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,630
It's over!

921
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,860
Hey Daigo...

922
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,760
Cherry!!!

923
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,300
Daigo, that's your fault

924
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,230
Hey Daigo

925
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,670
Daigo kept setting of the cracker

926
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,040
Even after we said stop

927
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,970
He's not stopping at all! You guys clearly said stop

928
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,940
Because Daigo you kept setting it of

929
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,940
Because you kept setting it of, of course he'll suck it

930
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,150
Of course he has to suck it

931
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,420
Sorry guys   -No, no problem

932
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,150
How do you feel now, Cherry-san?

933
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,990
I feel sorry for not being able to break the world record

934
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,220
That's it?   -Yes, of course

935
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,590
What do you think about Daigo then? Nothing?   -Yes

936
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,630
You feel thankful, right?

937
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,800
Thank you, Cherry Max

938
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,470
That one was quite small, huh?   -Yes

939
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,700
Thank you, Cherry Max

940
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,170
The pose is different from the first time

941
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,810
You did it differently on purpose, huh?

942
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,010
How did you do the pose when you said thank you to me for the first time?

943
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,020
That was small, huh? How should it actually be?

944
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,780
Thank you, Cherry Max!

945
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,090
Why didn't you do that for the first time!!!

946
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,520
Daigo, Daigo-san...

947
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,660
Why didn't you do that right from the beginning!!!

948
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,590
Daigo   -Daigo-san

949
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,230
You're gonna lose if he fights back

950
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,640
Cherry, thank you very much   -That was awesome

951
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,870
Thank you very much

952
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,880
Can I have your attention please?

953
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,580
What happened?

954
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,980
Within these 2 or 3 hours

955
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,120
I found out something   -What did you find out?

956
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,620
There's a terrible person among us

957
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,990
Huh? Among us?   -There couldn't be

958
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,560
What's this? Suspense?

959
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,060
I already know the truth

960
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,070
That's you!

961
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,010
"A dangerous person"

962
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:58,450
What's going on?

963
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,220
What does that mean?   -The bear?

964
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,550
She said there's a terrible person among us

965
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,260
So the bear is the dangerous person?

966
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,990
Is there someone inside?

967
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,660
No idea

968
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,590
What's going on?

969
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,360
I just have to wait until Yuriyan is back

970
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,030
Where did Yuriyan go?

971
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,300
Ah, she's back

972
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,610
Please believe me

973
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,610
For what?   -Believe you for what?

974
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,610
I'm from the future

975
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,450
What's this thing here?

976
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,320
Are those your eyes?

977
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,690
Those are not my eyes

978
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,560
Those are my eyes (making fun of Fujimon's Kansai dialect)

979
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,060
It's Shishito pepper (brand name)

980
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,290
Shishito pepper?   -You're working at Shishito?

981
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:48,200
Well, Shishitou's "tou", is Minshintou's "tou" (Democratic Party)

982
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,270
Oh, so the Shishi Party

983
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,870
You're talking nonsense

984
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,510
What's that "Dangerous person"?   -Yeah, exactly

985
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,410
Who's that? The "dangerous person"?

986
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,410
This bear is the dangerous person?

987
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,480
Or do you mean someone is inside?

988
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,650
Wow, so dangerous

989
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,390
What are you here for? From the future

990
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,960
To bring in the laundry

991
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,990
Hey, dude!

992
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:20,530
Why didn't you expand the conversation like you did just now, when I'm the one performing?

993
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,270
You're being so indifferent to me

994
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,900
Fujimon actually did try to expand

995
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,540
Yes, I did

996
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,770
No way, not at all   -Yes, I did

997
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,540
But even if I try to expand...

998
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,910
Nothing...

999
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:36,980
Don't treat people like a handkerchief, you idiot!

1000
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,520
Like a tiny, tiny handkerchief

1001
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,720
What do you mean?

1002
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,990
So it won't stretch

1003
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,520
And it's impossible to expand

1004
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,420
Isn't it better to say like a tissue? If you mean to pull out something

1005
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,960
I'll take that

1006
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:52,000
Your hands are shaking like a leaf

1007
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,900
Are you really writing it down?   -Yes, I am

1008
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,470
Amazing! Your palm lines are incredible

1009
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,340
Yes, someone told me about that too

1010
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,180
You'll live a long and healthy life   -Yes, exactly

1011
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,480
The palmist Hosoki Kazuko said I'll become popular at the age of 75

1012
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,580
Exactly, your palm lines say so, I can totally see this!

1013
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,450
I'm almost there   -Yeah

1014
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,150
I'm 60 years old now   -Work hard! Work hard!

1015
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,050
Work hard! Work hard! Work hard!

1016
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,020
Uchuchuchuchu...

1017
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:18,390
Work hard!

1018
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,360
You'll become popular at the age of 75?

1019
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,960
Will you become popular?

1020
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,160
Ms.Hosoki said so

1021
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,460
Apologize to her!

1022
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,600
Apologize to Ms.Hosoki

1023
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,170
Ms.Hosoki is the one...   -But Ms.Hosoki sometimes get it wrong too

1024
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,210
Never!

1025
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,210
She got everything right

1026
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,180
Say it clearly, ok?

1027
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,050
"You..."

1028
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,750
"Good!"

1029
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,390
"You will become popular at the age of 75!"

1030
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:53,320
"George-san"

1031
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,160
That's what she said

1032
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,660
Eh? But I'm Shoji...

1033
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,460
And that scene was aired too

1034
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,730
Did she mistaken you for someone else?

1035
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,400
That's why I'm trying to make both of them my name

1036
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,770
Both Shoji and George

1037
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:08,370
You're just Shoji though

1038
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,710
Nope, if someone call me George, I'll turn around too

1039
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,040
George-san?   -Yes?

1040
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:14,710
Look

1041
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,180
Fatal Attraction (Kiken na Jyouji ≈ George)

1042
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,550
Sharon Stone   -Sharon Stone...

1043
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,350
Basic Instinct   -Stones from the top

1044
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,960
What are you doing Jimmy-san?

1045
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,130
Well...umm...I'm just...

1046
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,960
What are you doing since...

1047
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,260
Are you a "rucksuck"?

1048
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,100
Are you a "rucksuck", dude?

1049
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,470
It should be rucksack   -Oh...

1050
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,100
Yeah, rucksack...

1051
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,470
I just said "taha"

1052
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,340
Naturally   -Very naturally

1053
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,580
Like a habit

1054
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:52,010
Naturally, you laughed naturally

1055
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,120
No, I didn't laugh

1056
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,450
You laughed   -That's a Tsukkomi

1057
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:55,350
No, no, you laughed naturally...

1058
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,920
That's a kind Tsukkomi from your Senpai, you idiot!

1059
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,290
Even if you speak in a loud voice, you clearly laughed

1060
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,430
I think someone laughed naturally, right?

1061
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:04,990
It's him!

1062
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,830
No way, it's Shoji-san   -Just take a look

1063
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,330
It's Shoji-san, right?

1064
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:11,930
You laughed naturally

1065
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,170
No, I didn't laugh

1066
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,910
Are you a "rucksuck"?

1067
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,210
Are you a "rucksuck", dude?

1068
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:23,710
It should be rucksack   -Oh, yeah, rucksack...

1069
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,220
You clearly laughed

1070
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,850
Orange card

1071
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,690
I just have a smiling face

1072
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,360
And he'll be out next time, right?

1073
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,830
Yes, he'll be out next time

1074
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,860
Your habit of laughing...   -Better stop that

1075
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,430
It's impossible to stop a habit

1076
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,670
But you have to, or else...

1077
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,410
So, let's start

1078
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:55,240
Do you play guitar?

1079
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,120
"Last night"

1080
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,920
"I saw you in my dream"

1081
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,230
"Under the dazzling morning light"

1082
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:20,670
(I think I heard this song before, who's song is this?)
"If you feel like something is going to happen"

1083
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:23,340
"Then come and find me"

1084
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,710
(Knock, knock) Someone's inside

1085
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,680
(Oh, it's Takajin's song)
"Sometimes it's sunny, Takajin"

1086
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,480
"Close your eyes, Imagine"

1087
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,920
(Can't believe that you know this song)
"Today will definitely be better than yesterday"

1088
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,720
"Sometimes it's sunny, Takajin"

1089
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,760
"Be a little rough, Blue jeans"

1090
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,260
Why are you looking this way, dude

1091
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Wait a second...wait a second...

1092
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,930
You did it yourself!

1093
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,270
You completely laughed

1094
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:55,940
It's definitely Fujimon   -He completely laughed

1095
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:00,280
Ahh, I screwed up

1096
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,680
Wait a second, no, no, Jinnai...

1097
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,520
No, it's not me, it's definitely Fujimon

1098
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,790
Ahh, this is the worst, I screwed up   -It's definitely Fujimon

1099
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,220
You bursted into laughters

1100
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,390
Fujimon, you bursted into laughters

1101
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,560
He tried to make me laugh, but...

1102
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,530
Well, let's take a look

1103
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,630
He said "Why are you looking this way, dude"

1104
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,830
Well, but...that was actually quite interesting

1105
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:27,440
And I thought how did these people hold back on that

1106
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,940
Someone's inside   -Someone's inside

1107
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,080
(Oh, it's Takajin's song)
"Sometimes it's sunny, Takajin"

1108
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,110
(Everyone held back here)
"Close your eyes, Imagine"

1109
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:42,050
(Can't believe that you know this song)
"Today will definitely be better than yesterday"

1110
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,620
"Sometimes it's sunny, Takajin"

1111
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,720
"Be a little rough, Blue jeans"

1112
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,020
Why are you looking this way, dude

1113
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:53,230
You're laughing from "Blue Jeans"

1114
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,900
Yeah, I'm laughing from "Blue Jeans"

1115
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,500
Orange card   -Eh?

1116
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,300
Suddenly orange card?   -Yes, suddenly orange card

1117
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,440
Well, you laughed out loud at that one

1118
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,110
So yellow card is not enough   -Well, yes...

1119
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,540
Oh crap! Oh crap! Oh crap!

1120
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,380
I admit that you tried hard to attack though

1121
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,950
And seriously, there's no need to say "someone's inside"

1122
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,550
That's not a knock   -Not a knock

1123
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,550
Please just watch my performance

1124
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,720
I didn't know that

1125
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,930
Alright! Let's do this

1126
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,500
Did you laugh today, Jimmy-san?

1127
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,340
Only once, with a yellow card

1128
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,870
Oh, just a yellow card?

1129
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,100
Yes, just a yellow card for now

1130
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,110
You were out really fast last time

1131
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,180
Excuse me

1132
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,320
Probably nasal irrigation?

1133
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,520
Sorry, please excuse me, I have a stuffy nose

1134
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,260
May I do this?

1135
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,260
Sure   -Because I have chronic rhinitis

1136
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,460
I see, we're in here for quite a while

1137
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,960
Yeah, so my nose starts to feel...

1138
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:08,740
Amazing

1139
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,440
Aren't you putting in too much?

1140
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,510
You do it like this every time?

1141
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,250
Every time? With that much?

1142
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,710
That's gonna cost you a lot

1143
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,590
(Jinnai...)

1144
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,150
(Jinnai...)

1145
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,790
This feels so good, very refreshing. You guys wanna try it?

1146
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:27,720
No thanks, I'm good

1147
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,030
Just do it

1148
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:31,630
Jimmy-san, you wanna try it? You have a stuffy nose too, right?

1149
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:33,600
Well...umm...

1150
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,160
Is it refreshing?

1151
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,300
Super refreshing

1152
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,930
It will spill out though

1153
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,400
It feels really good

1154
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,010
But Jimmy-san seems to be used to this

1155
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:44,710
Did you try this before, Jimmy-san?

1156
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,710
Well...umm...maybe I did

1157
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,880
I bet you did this to every hole in your body

1158
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,150
Is this fine? That looks painful

1159
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,130
Incredible...

1160
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,300
Much more came out than it went in?

1161
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:12,330
More than it went in, because of his own saliva and snot

1162
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,470
It's doubled

1163
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:16,410
When you put it in, say "ahh" at the same time

1164
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,280
It's more stuffed than before

1165
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,290
It's more stuffed than before?   -Yes, it's more stuffed

1166
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,220
Isn't it refreshing?

1167
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,290
I mean over here, the back of my neck

1168
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,190
The back of your neck? So the cervical spine?

1169
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,060
Yes, the cervical spine   -It's hurting the cervical spine?

1170
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,400
Yes, my cervical spine hurts

1171
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,800
It hurt your cervical spine?   -Yes

1172
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,130
Your neck joints?   -Yes, neck joints

1173
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,400
You're talking absolute nonsense   -Eh?

1174
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,300
What do you mean by "Eh?"

1175
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,610
How do you feel?

1176
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,840
Well...umm...that's enough

1177
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,380
If you want to feel more refreshed, you can try this (wasabi)

1178
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,250
No, seriously, that's gonna destroy my body

1179
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,520
You're using this? Fujimon-san?

1180
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,680
Yes, I'm using this

1181
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,450
I bet you'll feel refreshed

1182
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,720
With this? In my nose?   -Yes

1183
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,660
It's gonna be painful

1184
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:21,370
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

1185
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:34,450
Ouch! Ouch! It hurts!

1186
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,690
It really hurts! It really hurts!

1187
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,220
Is there anything that can help? Anything?

1188
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,260
Oh! I need soda water!

1189
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,260
I definitely need soda water for this!

1190
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,300
Oh, it's soda water

1191
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,130
Only soda water can rescue me

1192
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:50,300
I have to put some soda water in my nose

1193
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,430
Ouch!

1194
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:55,470
It hurts! My nose hurts!

1195
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:56,970
You bastard...Fujimori...

1196
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,910
I shouldn't have listened to you

1197
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,620
Because...because he said Fujimori...

1198
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,850
Yes, he did

1199
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,390
You're out? Are you out?

1200
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:14,760
That's terrible

1201
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,090
This one is hard to judge too

1202
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:18,190
This is just...

1203
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,600
Barely, barely safe

1204
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,800
It's either Fujimon or Daigo

1205
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,400
But either way, that person will be out

1206
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,570
I think it should be Daigo

1207
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,340
I definitely need soda water for this!

1208
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,140
Oh, it's soda water

1209
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,180
Only soda water can rescue me

1210
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,680
(Daigo is already laughing here)
I have to put some soda water in my nose

1211
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:42,080
Ouch!

1212
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,550
My nose hurts!

1213
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,050
You bastard...Fujimori...

1214
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,190
Barely safe! Barely safe!

1215
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,190
Barely safe!   -No, Daigo...

1216
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:51,990
Daigo...   -Barely safe!

1217
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:55,930
Barely safe! Barely safe! Matsumoto-san!

1218
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,400
I beg you! Barely safe!

1219
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,640
You're out!   -Number one

1220
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,470
Number one

1221
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:03,470
You have to accept this

1222
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,380
And how many times did you say "it hurts"?

1223
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,580
It really hurts so bad

1224
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,950
You said it for like 40 times

1225
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,950
Because it really hurts, you can give it a try

1226
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,490
He really did say it for like 40 times   -Exactly

1227
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,460
If you're in a hospital, they're gonna let you go in first

1228
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,130
You're saying it for so many times

1229
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:31,530
So the first person is out only until this time, which never happened before

1230
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,740
Well, Daigo should be out anyway

1231
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,770
Yeah, he's always smiling

1232
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,780
He's out even faster this time

1233
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:45,350
That was close

1234
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:47,850
I'm so weak

1235
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:51,050
Maybe I'm too weak, or maybe they're too strong

1236
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:52,790
Of course one will laugh at that

1237
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,660
I understand that it's painful to have wasabi in your nose, but...

1238
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,630
Something came to his mind, and he went to take the soda water

1239
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,270
Oh! I need soda water!

1240
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,270
I definitely need soda water for this!

1241
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:14,610
And mistaking the name of his junior, who has been with him for several decades

1242
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:16,280
My nose hurts!

1243
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,750
You bastard...Fujimori...

1244
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,050
I shouldn't have listened to you

1245
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,450
I lost one million for soda water?
