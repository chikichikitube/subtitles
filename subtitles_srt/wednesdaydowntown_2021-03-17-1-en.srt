1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,550
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,820
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,520
Anyone?

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,970
Fujimon

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,500
Today is the Toudaiou vs Wednesday Downtown quiz!

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,000
A collaborative one-hour special
-Ah, so that's it

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,950
Wednesday Downtown, which is intellectually inferior to Toudaiou

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,250
But maybe tied in terms of physical strength and perseverance

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,930
I don't think we're any less intelligent than they are.
-Of course we are!

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,600
Not even close
-Not even close

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,160
So today we have prepared three matchups

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,170
The first matchup is this

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,100
Loud voice x Q&A

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,140
By the way, these are the people representing Wednesday Downtown

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,050
Ah, not bad! These are the masters

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,470
Looking good
-I think we may win here

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,720
These people can be considered the top three in the entire show business
-Pretty much

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,760
Although perhaps not comparable in terms of Q&As, in terms of loudness, these three are strong

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,860
Smart people have small voices

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,090
Ah yes yes yes
-Seems that way

21
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,360
That's really true

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,900
Why are you suddenly so quiet

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,630
Shameful
-You really suddenly lowered your voice just now

24
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,920
What follows is three mixed rules matches

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,120
Toudaiou vs Wednesday Downtown Showdown

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,870
Wednesday Downtown VS Toudaiou

27
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,860
The first matchup is Loud Voice x Q&A

28
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,000
Very loud voices!

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,730
Do you have confidence, Wednesday team?

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,550
Looks pretty cold

31
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,440
Of course

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,900
Where's our "Welcome!"?

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,910
"Welcome"!

34
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,570
There it is

35
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,580
Who's Yamaguchi?

36
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,550
On the one hand, there should be no problem with the knowledge of the Toudaiou team

37
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,420
The problem is the volume
-Yes

38
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,590
You haven't spoken out loud much in your entire life, have you?
-No. Absolutely not

39
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,320
Just a few times

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,390
I had to sing a song once

41
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,890
Who understands this? Your little story

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,510
This year's Loud Voice x Quiz takes the form of a group of three

43
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,650
There are girls in this competition.

44
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,700
The first person reads the question out loud

45
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,610
The second person shouts out the answer to the question

46
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:43,350
If the answer is correct, points will be awarded for each meter of distance added up

47
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,920
We have prepared three questions for each team

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,290
The Toudaiou team will start first

49
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:57,030
So upon determining the approximate distance that sound can travel

50
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,950
The East King team decided to challenge first with a total distance of 225 meters

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,700
The sky is cloudless and its a sunny day

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,650
The temperature is 9 degrees Celsius and there is no wind at the venue

53
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,170
This is the perfect environment for shouting

54
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,870
It's too far away, right?

55
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,850
Held at Bando Golf Course, Ibaraki Prefecture

56
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,200
They all went to Ibaraki!

57
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,520
Loud voice x Q&A begins

58
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,660
Then, please read the question first

59
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:43,740
In which magazine were Boboboubo Boubobo and Midori no Makibao serialized?

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,620
Can only hear so much

61
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,050
Such a long question

62
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,080
I heard the question clearly

63
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,850
Eh? Really?

64
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,270
So, please answer

65
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,200
But does he know the answer?

66
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,970
Weekly Shonen Jump!

67
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,750
Audible

68
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,250
Then please show the question board

69
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,700
Ah, impressive!

70
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,220
Weekly Shonen Jump

71
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,900
Such a quiet voice

72
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,220
Correct answer!

73
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,770
It doesn't matter, right?

74
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,870
Great! Yeah yeah yeah!

75
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,700
Toudaiou's first question is correct

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,850
No matter how you put it, it is a loud Q&A

77
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,950
Toudaiou did a great job and answered the first question correctly

78
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,570
Earning 225 points

79
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,550
The comedians can surely win

80
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,920
Basically, I didn't miss anything.
-Great

81
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,490
I heard the two titles clearly

82
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,990
Maybe its ok to dare to go a little farther away

83
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,250
In contrast, the Wednesday team chose to stretch a little further

84
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,870
They can totally go further, right?

85
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,850
They choose to take on the challenge at 250 meters

86
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,650
No problem at all

87
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,520
Testing it out

88
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,470
So, Loud voice x Q & A. The first is Oda

89
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,740
Please read out the question

90
00:04:49,980 --> 00:05:16,400
Who said the famous quote "Let them eat cake"?

91
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,100
Awesome!

92
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,050
Can surely hear this clearly

93
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,140
Ok, I heard clearly

94
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,650
Then, Fujimoto, please answer

95
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,850
It's a little shameful to be so loud if you're wrong
-Very shameful

96
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,900
Does Tsuda know this...

97
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,590
Please show the question board

98
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,520
Marie Antoinette

99
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,950
Correct answer

100
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,950
Awesome

101
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,570
Great, great, great!

102
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,520
As you can see, this team also answered correctly

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,150
Earning 250 points

104
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,200
The second question from Toudaiou team

105
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,850
Girls team

106
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,650
They challenge 300 meters

107
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:25,970
Please guess together with the audience

108
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,850
This is hopeless, right?

109
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,850
Can hear a little bit

110
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,740
What is it supposed to be?

111
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,280
Sounds like something, then something

112
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,020
And then at the end its "What's next?"

113
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,920
By only hearing a list and then "what's next"

114
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,150
There are too few clues

115
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,150
Can she deduce the answer?

116
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,370
What will the answer be?

117
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,470
Please guess together with the audience

118
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,900
Perfect

119
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,900
Here it is heard

120
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,620
Shinzo Abe

121
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,920
Shinzo Abe

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,900
Wrong answer

123
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,770
Ah, its not right

124
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,570
The full question wasn't heard

125
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,570
Ah, that's right

126
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,900
By just a list and "what's next?" she guesses its about Prime Ministers

127
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,900
Impressive

128
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,500
With this clue

129
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,650
The correct answer is "Hatoyama"

130
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,820
Although the answer is not correct, it is still very impressive

131
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,800
But unfortunately they don't get any points

132
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,450
What a genius!

133
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,440
I'm sorry

134
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,370
Next, the second question for the Wednesday team

135
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,350
200m directly

136
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,300
They challenge the longest of 350m so far

137
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,920
Tsuda is very good at it

138
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:52,290
Please guess together with the audience

139
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,870
Please guess together with the audience

140
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,550
Curry Rice

141
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:08,310
In order to keep the feeling of a week, what do the Maritime Self-Defense Force crew eat every Friday?

142
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,800
Correct answer
-Great!

143
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,300
Awesome, isn't it!!!
-Awesome!!!

144
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,200
The excellent answer to this question widens the score difference to 375 points

145
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,470
So, Toudaiou team

146
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,350
What're they gonna do?

147
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,950
We are aiming for a tie

148
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,560
Betting on the opponent's incorrect answer for a tie

149
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,670
With the quietest participant Okamoto asking the question

150
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,000
They challenge 375m

151
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:49,320
Recently used as an ingredient of protein, what is the moisture floating on yogurt called?

152
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,150
You've never spoken so loudly before, right?

153
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,100
Please answer

154
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,120
The first time

155
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,970
The questions are quite difficult

156
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,170
He heard

157
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,400
Ok

158
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,950
Impressive

159
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,350
Whey

160
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,820
Correct!

161
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,670
Toudaiou team gets 375 points!

162
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,180
Ah great...

163
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,570
So, the Wednesday Downtown team

164
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,520
Challenges 400m for their last question

165
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:43,050
For rolling sushi, what type of gourd

166
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:51,080
is used in the speciality sushi of Tochigi Prefecture?

167
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,310
Tochigi Prefecture Specialty Rolled Sushi

168
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,450
What?

169
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,290
Thin...

170
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,420
It's understandable, right?

171
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,760
Come on

172
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,350
What kind of expression is that?

173
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,930
What?

174
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,930
That word... where is that... what?

175
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,870
danbo

176
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,200
danbo

177
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,150
Incorrect!

178
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,610
What a pity!

179
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,280
Oi!

180
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,780
Say it again in the same tone as before

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,120
Kanpyo!

182
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,090
It's clearly "danbo"!

183
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,600
Therefore, both sides have the same score at this point

184
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,460
Next is the second match

185
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,460
Same score?

186
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,000
Same score?

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,670
Same

188
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,830
Indeed

189
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,760
Well, comedians are still great.
-Yeah!

190
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,230
Hamada

191
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,450
Next time we have a loud voice x quiz, please be sure to participate

192
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,010
That is doable

193
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,080
Why else would you maintain a loud persona to this day, right?

194
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,540
When we shoot Gaki

195
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,350
When he says "the first time" he's super loud

196
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,480
Who cares?

197
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,450
When you say "the first time"
-The voice is very loud

198
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,080
The voice is very loud

199
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,550
Can you give us a quick "the first time"

200
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,570
What the hell!
-Please

201
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,030
I just say it normally!

202
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,830
Please give us a "the first time"

203
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,000
Just go to "chiki chiki"

204
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,400
The first time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!

205
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,670
It feels like, WAH, right in your ear

206
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,770
Really
-Great!

207
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,840
It makes you wonder what the second time will be like

208
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,400
The sound is so loud for the first time

209
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,750
So, let's get on with it

210
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,450
Please take a look at the next matchup

211
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,380
Extreme Cold x Q&A

212
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,450
That noise was also deadly

213
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,890
Sorry sorry sorry sorry

214
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,960
Shouting "the first time" warmed him up

215
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,220
There is no need to shout so loudly here
-He's fired up

216
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,130
Forgot to turn the volume back down

217
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,330
Usually its at a 4 but he went to 8

218
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:13,750
The stage shifts to Tsumagoi Village in Gunma Prefecture, where the quiz competition is held

219
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,790
Extreme Cold x Q&A

220
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,080
Looks so cold

221
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,930
That's enough. Stop clapping.
-I can't. Let's get started already

222
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:29,570
By the way, the temperature is minus 12 degrees.
-Stop talking about it

223
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,840
Just put a subtitle at the bottom

224
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,440
The youngest on our side is 37 years old, okay?

225
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,610
The oldest is 50

226
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,450
I'm 50 years old

227
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,150
You didn't get into Toudaiou for this kind of work, did you?

228
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,070
The second game is a scattered flower quiz held at a snow mountain

229
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,800
Super cold

230
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:57,110
10 points for one correct answer, the more correct answers, the more points

231
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:04,350
But if you hide in a cabin because you can't stand the cold, you will be deprived of the right to answer

232
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:11,720
Moreover, the winner is determined by the total score of the three games

233
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,650
What will be the result of this extremely cold quiz?

234
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,490
So, Extreme Cold x Q&A begins!

235
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,630
Wow, impressive

236
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,490
So tough
-Awful

237
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,880
So tough
-This is it

238
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,700
So cold so cold!

239
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,470
Swarming all over the place.
-Inch by inch

240
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,960
The leader is really fast

241
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,430
So fast!
Please listen to the question

242
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,350
3 for 210 yen. How much for 10?

243
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,080
2000 yen!

244
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,990
Wrong answer, the answer is 700 yen

245
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,150
What are you doing?
-I couldn't get it

246
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,360
Really what the hell, think a little will you

247
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,330
Scary scary scary scary

248
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,310
Please listen to the question

Wrong answer
-So hard!

252
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,140
It's ice cream, right?

Please listen to the question

254
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,450

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,010
It's German

256
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,950
Correct answer. 10 points to Toudaiou
-Yes!

257
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,090
Wow, it's cold, it's cold, hurry up!

258
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Please listen to the question

259
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,360
The diameter of a 1 yen coin is exactly how many centimeters?

260
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,310
1cm

261
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,530
Wrong answer
-What are you doing?

262
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,180
How can it be 1 cm

263
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,540
How many centimeters? Tell me the answer!

264
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,710
Please listen to the question

265
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,590
What is the rightmost color of the 4-color button of the TV remote control?

266
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,400
So hard

267
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,580
Yellow

268
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,100
The answer is correct.
-Great

269
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,880
Team Wednesday scores 10 points
-Great!

270
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,220
Please listen to the question

271
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,120
What is the name of the snowman who looks forward to summer in the movie "Frozen"?

272
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,750
This is too easy

273
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,600
Olaf

274
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,000
Get 10 points
-Too easy

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,930
It's cold. I can't.
-I can't do it

276
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,300
What's in the envelope depends on luck

277
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,920
Please listen to the question

278
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,820
い ろ or は, which are not in the human body?

279
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,750

Correct, 10 points!
-OK

281
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:31,170
15 minutes have passed since the start of the game, the current score is shown above

282
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,220
Nose is all red

283
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,130
Right at this moment

284
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,090
Please listen to the question.
-Guys, I can't do it

285
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,190
I'm not even thinking straight

286
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,460
Answer 1 more question

287
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,030
You can still answer one more question. You can do it.
-I got several questions right

288
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,000
I got 3 questions right.
-Believe in yourself

289
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,970
3...how many correct answers did you get?
-Answer 1 more question

290
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,640
What's the point of your bickering here?

291
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,100
Answer 1 more question

292
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,310
One more!

293
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,180
Get back here, Komiya!

294
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:03,050
The person to answer the most correct answers for the Wednesday team gives up here

295
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,440
Komiya knows a lot

296
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,660
Ha...

297
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,270
Gave up after 16 minutes

298
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,700
Ah, really can't stand it

299
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,390
My brain won't work in this situation

300
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,390
Looks pretty cold.
-It really was

301
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,360
After this
-Listen to the question

302
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,360
Can't think straight

303
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,770
Who is the Moroccan traveler known for his book "Travels in Three Continents"?

304
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,770
Ibn Battuta

305
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,860
Who?

306
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,220
Correct!

307
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,280
Wow
-Never heard of him

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,140
"Raw wheat, raw rice, raw chicken, raw eggs", how many times did I say "raw"?

309
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,920
4

310
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,890
So fast

311
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,180
Correct
-Awesome

312
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:36,080
The Toudaiou team keep scoring while the other team...

313
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,470
Ice is a solid of water, what is dry ice a solid of?

314
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,860
Air

315
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,230
Wrong, the answer is carbon dioxide
-Really?

316
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,780
His wife is Ando Sakura, father is Emoto Akira, brother is Emoto Tokio, who is the actor?

317
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,330
Emoto...

318
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,310
Emoto Akira

319
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,320
Incorrect

320
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,300
Already said it!

321
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,310
What the hell?

322
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,180
Emoto was in the question
- You didn't realise?

323
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,710
Emoto Akira

324
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:13,070
Though the leader is second to none in physical strength, with his low intelligence, he drags the team down

325
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:18,370
In the first 40 minutes of the game, the deficit is already quite large

326
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,620
Toudaiou are pretty persistent

327
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,780
Not only that, but Fujimoto is also reaching his limit

328
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,430
Fujimon, you can do it!

329
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,640
I'll withdraw if the answer is right

330
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,510
I've already made up my mind. Answer right and I'll give up

331
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,180
It's blank

332
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,220
Okay, next one, next one

333
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,640
Never seen this expression before

334
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,780
It'll kill...people
-Please give up before then

335
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,350
This...this show will not be broadcast

336
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,820
If it doesn't then I can't manage...

337
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,620
Maybe Wed Down will be cancelled

338
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,130
I wanted to finish with a correct answer!

339
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:59,020
He said he would give up if he answered one more question. Will Fujimoto be able to end up as he wishes?

340
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,100
I'll be at the cabin in a minute

341
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,450
Answer this question correctly I will go to the cabin immediately
-It's blank

342
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,870
Consecutive misses are very impressive

343
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,870
Come on, come again, come again, come again

344
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,610
One more question. Go on, go on

345
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,080
What's wrong with that guy? Are you crazy?
-GoGoGoGo Fight Fight

346
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,060
Please listen to the question

347
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,220
What is the official name of the highly popular game "Motomori"?

348
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,600
Animal Crossing

349
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,630
Correct!

350
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,630
I can't do it

351
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,360
My hands, my hands...

352
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,430
I'm sorry, Fujimoto

353
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,330
It's enough already, Shoji.
-Thanks

354
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,000
Did good, Shoji.
-My hands...

355
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,180
I'll be right there

356
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:44,060
50 minutes from the start, Shoji gave up after answering 5 questions correctly

357
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:51,130
Go!
-Three of the Toudaiou team also quit in quick succession

358
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,790
The leader might be suffering brain problems

359
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,730
Even if we say "no more" and plan to give up

360
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,800
He will get down on his knees to keep us

361
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,560
That guy is a bit of a problem

362
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,570
Why?

363
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,570
The theme has changed

364
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,370
Please listen to the question

365
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,970
The larger the amount, the higher the tax rate. What kind of system is this?

366
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,850
What?

367
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,420
Consumption tax

368
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,220
What are you talking about?

369
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,450
Incorrect
-Incorrect?

370
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,950
What? I don't know

371
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,050
Let me go, I can't do it anymore, I can't feel anything

372
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,230
Let me go

373
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,460
This question has to be answered correctly

374
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,590
Please listen to the question

375
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:32,350
What is the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy called?

376
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,140
It's gotten to this point...

377
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,590
Gravity

378
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,370
Wrong answer
-Too hard

379
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,350
Please listen to the question

380
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:51,550
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provides the "Novel Coronavirus Exposure Confirmation APP" called?

381
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,250
COCOA

382
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,650
Correct answer
-Great!

383
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,020
Please give me the right to stop

384
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,590
Bad luck too, the questions were too hard

385
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,520
Stop messing with me

386
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,290
Can I quit?

387
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,920
It's so hard, I can't...

388
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:13,990
At this point, Ito, the last member of the Toudaiou team, gives up after 1 hour and 5 minutes

389
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,090
On the other side

390
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,170
What is the essential fish in the Hokkaido specialty "Ishikari Nabe"?

391
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,120
Salmon

392
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,950
Great, it's finally over!

393
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,480
You can still answer one more question

394
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,980
Impossible, impossible

395
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,880
Come back!

396
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,260
I don't know what he's talking about

397
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,770
Wow, this is... it's not even my own hand

398
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,680
Finally, only this man remains

399
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,870
How small can the gap be reduced in the face of the King of the East, who finished with 460 points?

400
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,450
The magician brothers who are famous for "Magic~Meow" are?

401
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,560
Kudo Brothers

402
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:11,220
The American (British) physicist who discovered universal gravity was?

403
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,220
This should be known, right?

404
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,130
The Apple one

405
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,380
Not this one

406
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,170
Edison

407
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,610
Who is it? It's the Apple one, right?

408
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,570
Thinking of William Bale

409
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:27,220
It was an hour and 40 minutes after the start of the game when the team failed to close the gap.

410
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,090
This man is so desperate

411
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:33,050
What is the Japanese translation of student's shoes?

412
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,180
Leather Shoes

413
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,380
Loafers

414
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,450
Incorrect

415
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,790
Leader, leader, let's stop here

416
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,490
That...everyone is shocked

417
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,990
Although this is not appropriate to say to a senior, this is abnormal

418
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,290
I've never seen anyone like you

419
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,160
The more you try, the more you are hated

420
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,600
Am I hated?
-Yes. The crowd is already booing

421
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,840
Is it true?
-Yes

422
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,270
One more question

423
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,740
Don't...
-Just one question

424
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,040
Hey, leader, leader, leader!
-Just one question. Just one question

425
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,910
Then one question. ah OKOK, last question, OK

426
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,250
Please listen to the question

427
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:11,880
What is the new station on the JR Yamanote Line that started operation last year?

428
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,300
Takanawa Gatecity

429
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,420
Incorrect

430
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,690
Eh？Gatecity

431
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,260
Gatecity
-Wrong answer

432
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,260
Gatecity
-Wrong answer

433
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,440
Yamanote Line...eh?

434
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,530
Gatecity… eh？

435
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,270
Bad bad bad bad

436
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,070
Leader...

437
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,710
Leader, leader, leader!

438
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,510
Hey, leader, please!

439
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,680
Leader, wait wait...

440
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,110
What the hell, you said just one more

441
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,830
Not only that
-Listen to the question

442
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,460
The female host is also very hard working

443
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:47,950
Who was the youngest person to win the Akutagawa Prize for the novel "I Want to Kick You in the Back"?

444
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,940
Matayoshi

445
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,660
Risa Miya

446
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,140
No, it's not!

447
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,190
Leader
-Hello

448
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,990
Enough!
-Okay

449
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,030
Please let us go

450
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,830
OK I will try my best

451
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,320
Please listen to the question

452
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:07,070
What is the name of the event that occurred at the beginning of the universe about 15 billion years ago?

453
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,930
Big Bang

454
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,140
Correct answer
-You see!

455
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,860
Can't catch up

456
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,150
He ran again

457
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,530
This guy is amazing

458
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:23,070
No one can stop such a leader

459
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,460
It's turning around, it's turning around
-You'll die.

460
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,020
Please listen to the question

461
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,140
Poor host

462
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,470
What family of animals are jaguars, cheetahs, and lions?

463
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,170
Cat

464
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,930
Hopeless...

465
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:48,030
He continues to fight alone despite the dissuasion of teammates

466
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,360
Answer this question correctly and you'll tie with Toudaiou
-Great!

467
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,760
It's on him alone

468
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Please listen to the question

469
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,630
What is the cured product of sturgeon eggs, which is known as one of the top three delicacies in the world?

470
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,610
Caviar

471
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,530
Correct answer

472
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,630
At this time

473
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,640
Great, great, great, great!

474
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,370
Great, great, great

475
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,040
Reversed, reversed
-It's okay. It's okay

476
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,210
It's fine

477
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,510
OK OK OK

478
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,610
Leader, do you know what time it is?

479
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,600
Don't know, reverse!

480
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,560
It's 4:00.
-Really?

481
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,950
Its 4 now
-Reverse reverse reverse

482
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,510
It's already 4:00

483
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,470
Last one. Come on.
-Thank you

484
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,850
The staff must be anxious

485
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,650
I thank you

486
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,820
Please listen to the question

487
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,760
Which of the following is Italian cuisine?

488
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,330
Meat Buns, Thin Cut Raw Meat, French Pudding

489
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,650
Thin cut raw meat

490
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,620
Correct answer

491
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,610
Reverse

492
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,240
Okay, let's go back. Let's go back.

493
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,710
Let me widen the gap

494
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:57,620
As the Wednesday team completes a comeback, they are forced to end the quiz

495
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,550
It is entirely thanks to the leader

496
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,390
The group leader is really great

497
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,630
But I refuse to be on this show with him again

498
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,560
Impressive

499
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,470
It was already 8:00 am when I got back to TBS

500
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,140
I went straight to this one after the Loud Q&A

501
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,270
Not easy
-Then back at 8:00

502
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,740
After a little bit of sleep, I started recording a 3-hour special

503
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,790
Then went straight to the next place again

504
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,050
Yasuda Circus is really something!

505
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,750
The only normal person is HIRO
-He really is the most normal one

506
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,790
Yes

507
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,860
The group leader said, "I want my children to see me in a good light."

508
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,730
Worked so hard to let his children see think he's cool
-Even so...

509
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,870
But he was awful at the actual Q&A aspect

510
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,840
Didn't look good in this regard at all

511
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,170
Everyone should be careful around him in the future, I mean it

512
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,010
Try not to meet him on the road

513
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,480
The next matchup is

514
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,050
Sleepless x Q&A

515
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,850
Say it properly!

516
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,220
What?

517
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,870
Really?
-You're really...

518
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,270
Hey, Hamada...

519
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,220
Say it properly

520
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,500
I said it properly!
-No, you didn't

521
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,730
That's not your way, is it?
-No, no, no

522
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,700
You'll complain again

523
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,480
He's suppressing it

524
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,110
The volume is set to 2

525
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,350
It should be something on top of the remote control

526
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,070
Only these two modes? The sound is either very loud or very small

527
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,800
The volume should be 4

528
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,860
About 4 is just right

529
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,400
Make some adjustments

530
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,650
Ok got it

531
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:44,390
Answer 1 question every 10 minutes without stopping

532
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,330
But the question time for that quiz is 48 hours

533
00:26:49,540 --> 00:27:07,210
▼48 hours, 1 question ever 10 mins             ▼Even if you fall asleep  questioning continues

534
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,950
So long!

535
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,510
This is terrible

536
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,400
If you are sleeping, you can not answer the question

537
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,670
Sustained sobriety is the key to victory

538
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:04,120
So hard
-Questions asked every 10 minutes

539
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,190
This time, Wednesday Downtown sent this person

540
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,050
Audrey's Kasuga

541
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,720
Another different type

542
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,870
What do you all think of Kasuga?

543
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,620
The endurance he has shown in this program is really...

544
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,310
Right!

545
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,440
Very strong

546
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,430
And his amount of knowledge is good
-Yes

547
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,530
I remember he is good at quizzes

548
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,580
Strong in both areas

549
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,700
He took the exam for University of Tokyo.
-Yes

550
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,100
Is that so?
-Yes

551
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,050
Perfect for him

552
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,020
So the participants of the sleepless quiz were

553
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:43,630
20-year-old Inomata and Audrey's Kasuga, who is famous for his endurance

554
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,900
However

555
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,820
This is a ready-for-sleep pose

556
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,590
Is this what's happening?

557
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,960
Calm environment
▼Dim lighting
▼Recliner
▼Healing music

558
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,960
m 0 0 l 0 140 l 405 140 l 405 0

559
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,960
m 0 0 l 0 47 l 405 47 l 405 0

560
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,360
More than just being awake

561
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,500
Have to resist this environment
-Indeed

562
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,960
So that's it

563
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,740
So 48 hours to stay awake quiz begins!

564
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,200
So at 10pm

565
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,590
The endurance quiz with 288 consecutive questions has begun

566
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,120
First category selection... although I understand the need to hurry up and select

567
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,730
But there are still 48 hours to go

568
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:24,260
▼Every hour a new topic is selected

569
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,000
I just don't feel like thinking about it

570
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,340
Even if we speed up here its useless

571
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,260
I'll take physics.
-Physics?

572
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,750
Suddenly?

573
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,380
Already sleepy

574
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,060
Ah, there it is

575
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,070
Questions appear silently from the monitor every 10 minutes

576
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,910
Thinking time is 3 minutes

577
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,370
After being re-asked

578
00:28:38,910 --> 00:29:05,770
The German physicist known for his theory of relativity was?

579
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,180
I thought, "Can I just answer that person?"

580
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,450
Ah, so dangerous, physics is difficult

581
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,690
But every question is important

582
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,210
Einstein

583
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,020
Albert Einstein

584
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,760
Write the full name

585
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,770
This is still question 1

586
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,530
Questions are now asked from level 1 to level 6 in each category

587
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:17,440
A system where the difficulty level rises slowly over the course of 1 hour

588
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,780
Well, if you don't get it right

589
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,150
Even if you are awake, it is meaningless

590
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,920
So if you plan your sleep schedule

591
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,120
It is better to be asleep when the 6th question appears

592
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,890
But, ah

593
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,200
That wouldn't be Kasuga!

594
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,300
It doesn't matter if you get it right or not

595
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,420
Can just brag at the beginning

596
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,130
It's time for a Q&A

597
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,140
Ah, I'm sleepy...

598
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,050
Already sleepy

599
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,210
Sleepy already?
-Sleepy

600
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,800
Yes, in fact, these 2 people

601
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,080
By the way, how long did you sleep today?

602
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,180
Around 9:00 am... I started to wake up

603
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,520
So its actually a 60-hour challenge

604
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,090
I'm looking forward to it

605
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,890
I also got up at 7:00 or 8:00

606
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,990
That's great

607
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,130
I am "61 Hours Q&A".
-That's great!

608
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,100
Starting from a state that has been awake for half a day

609
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,250
It's actually a challenge of over 60 hours

610
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:23,460
Can they stay awake and keep answering to the end?

611
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:59,850
The three primary colors of light are red - blue and what color?

612
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,920
It's here

613
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,850
Suddenly it appears

614
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,350
Eh?

615
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,620
What was it?

616
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,520
Eh...

617
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,130
Can't be sure anymore

618
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,500
Is this it?

619
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,850
I got it right!

620
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:28,710
Who was the first Japanese person to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics?

621
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,490
Physics Prize?

622
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,720
Kasuga is great!
-Awesome!

623
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,640
It's written in Chinese characters!

624
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,570
Very capable

625
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,710
But it doesn't matter

626
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:54,130
What is the gravitational force acting between molecules called?

627
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,680
Don't be ridiculous. What's this?

628
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,400
Feeling at ease

629
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,860
I do not know gravity, I only know this

630
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,380
Van der Walik

631
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,960
What's this? I don't know

632
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,280
This is so hard

633
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,030
Got it right? That's awesome!

634
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,130
Impressive

635
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,120
So smart

636
00:31:54,130 --> 00:32:06,880
Superconductivity

637
00:31:54,130 --> 00:32:06,880
The phenomenon that
the resistance of a
metal, etc. suddenly
becomes zero if it
is cooled to absolute
zero is?

638
00:31:54,130 --> 00:32:06,880
Ujirou Nakatani

639
00:31:54,130 --> 00:32:06,880
Who was the first
physicist to create
artificial snow,
leaving the famous
quote "Snow is a letter
from heaven"?

640
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,410
Knowledgable

641
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,620
Here

642
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,890
Please draw a hypnosis card

643
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,790
Hypnosis card?

644
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,910
This time there is an opportunity every hour to exchange attacks

645
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,300
Attack props can be used to trap the opponent

646
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,060
Kasuga attacks first

647
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,600
Want to make it a one-two punch

648
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,440
Start

649
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,890
Electric blanket

650
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,880
Very warm

651
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,680
Oh~

652
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,250
Warmer than expected, the same feeling as in the furnace

653
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,950
Not bad

654
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,290
You'll fall asleep. The heater is the place where you fall asleep without realizing it.
-Yeah

655
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,560
I will try my best

656
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,990
Good, good, good, good

657
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,600
Drew a good one

658
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:00,490
Then 8 hours passed very quickly after the start of the Q&A

659
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,110
The Sleepless Quiz has seen its first morning

660
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,420
Ah, stayed up all night

661
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,510
Hypnotic prop - Movie

662
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,240
What is this? No subtitles either

663
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,510
No dubbing either?

664
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,240
Kasuga, who has been awake almost a whole day

665
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,620
Is attacked by the Sandman

666
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,240
This side too

667
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,730
How many members of the House of Representatives are there in Congress?

668
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,750
Almost at the limit...

669
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,350
It's only been 9 hours

670
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,490
Here

671
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,350
Opportunity knocks

672
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,400
Toudaiou's Inomata finally falls asleep

673
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,050
It's up to you now

674
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:57,190
Score double when opponent sleeps

675
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:56,290
So, from now on, Kasuga will be rewarded with twice the number of points if the answer is correct

676
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,160
Chance!

677
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:17,680
Who was the Prime Minister of Japan at the end of the war?

678
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:05,800
Unfortunately, the question is level 6 difficulty

679
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,360
Kijyuro Shidehara

680
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,840
No idea about this one

681
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,420
While Inomata continues to sleep

682
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,620
Kasuga chose to specialize in Japanese history

683
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,480
Earn some points here

684
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:40,770
In 1582, Akechi Mitsuhide's attack on Oda Nobunaga was called?

685
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,080
The Charge of Honnoji Temple

686
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:47,310
Account for attendance

687
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:47,310
Anatomische
Tabellen

688
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:47,310
Anatomische/Tabellen

689
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:47,310
What is the name of the
Western medical book that
Genbai Sugita translated
as "New Book of
Disintegration"?

690
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:47,310
What was the system established
during the reign of Tokugawa
Iemitsu that required
the daimyo to leave the
domain and live in Edo

691
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,720
Kasuga gets 60 points for 3 consecutive correct questions

692
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,330
Suddenly the score begins to increase

693
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,930
But here

694
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,520
What's wrong?

695
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,890
Accidentally fell asleep

696
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Inomata woke up after only 30 minutes of sleep

697
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,120
This one is a bit...

698
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,240
11 hours have passed since the start

699
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,510
By the time of the first meal

700
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,350
If you eat enough, you may be attacked by drowsiness

701
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,550
Long-term plan in mind

702
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,550
Both people here choose to eat

703
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,730
12 hours after starting

704
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,670
Kasuga's 5th hypnosis card is

705
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,280
Foot Massage

706
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,700
This is a tough one

707
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,270
Ah, it's so comfortable.

708
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,740
This is bad

709
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,440
Very likely to fall asleep

710
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,210
Really?

711
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,210
Very comfortable

712
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,440
Not bad

713
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,540
Here, the selection is memory

714
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,290
And the Toudaiou team suddenly loses it

715
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:15,160
Please memorize the following graph in 10 seconds

716
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,630
What color is the circle?

717
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,630
Wow, really?

718
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:28,510
What color is the circle?

719
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,570
No idea

720
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,640
Ah, it's yellow!

721
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,510
Great!

722
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,180
Are there acupoints that make you forgetful?

723
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,610
This is the result of a foot massage

724
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:37,760
Wrong answer to the question at level 1

725
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,690
And

726
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,260
How many balls are there?

727
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,220
Eh...

728
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,860
Can't do it at all

729
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,260
What is the color of the word "white"?

730
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,260
Sleepy...

731
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,950
In the Reflexology and Memory Q&A

732
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,660
Because of the complete mismatch, surprisingly 4 consecutive answers are wrong

733
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,720
But after that

734
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,530
After waking up from sleep

735
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,650
Both stay awake for 10 consecutive hours

736
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,600
Impressive

737
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,460
22 hours after start

738
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,090
Already the 2nd night

739
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,120
Not sleepy at all?

740
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,190
I've been in a daze!

741
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:19,190
After a certain period of time there is no difference

742
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,620
Eating shabu-shabu!

743
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,650
No sleep for 35 hours in a row for Kasuga

744
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,620
The next hypnotic prop is

745
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,460
It's coming

746
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,440
Shoulder rub
-It's here!

747
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,270
What will happen?

748
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,500
It's not good, right?

749
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:51,390
What is the card that is shown when the referee orders a player to stop in a sport such as soccer?

750
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,870
Having your shoulders rubbed after a full meal

751
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,340
Can such a double attack be endured?

752
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:51,390
Red

753
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,870
That's it

754
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,800
After 40 minutes of shoulder rubbing

755
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,470
Oh, no!

756
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,380
No, no, no

757
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,760
You can do it!

758
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,410
Kasuga's first crisis!

759
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,950
So dangerous

760
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,610
Desperately trying to stay awake

761
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:21,960
Then the sleepless quiz finally passes 24 hours

762
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,590
Finally halfway through

763
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:30,300
By the way, the current score is 1060 points to 1070 points, almost the same score

764
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,760
I forgot about it

765
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,680
Why?

766
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,720
This matchup
-It's a duel!

767
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:44,440
I'm sure I lost a lot of points in physics

768
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,180
It's not something I know much about

769
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,160
The scores are now shown in the graph

770
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,410
After that is also the same story

771
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,180
Both spent 9 hours awake

772
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,760
What a long time!

773
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,590
33 hours after start

774
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,390
The Sleepless Quiz ushers in the 2nd early morning

775
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,960
So funny!

776
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,740
Such hard word

777
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:19,640
Hypnotic prop
-head massage

778
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:24,320
What is the act of saying the same line repeatedly?

779
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:16,340
Here Kasuga chooses the comedy category

780
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:31,090
Rintaro and Kanakin
are which popular
comedy duo.

781
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:31,090
What is the act
of saying the same
line repeatedly?

782
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:31,090
What is the term
that refers to
young entertainers
who have been
active since the
latter half of
the 2010s.

783
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,730
Both get 3 questions right in a row

784
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,520
But Toudaiou's Inomata

785
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,530
Sleeps for the 2nd time after 24 hours

786
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,560
Not waking up

787
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:54,180
What is the name of Daisuke Miyagawa's group?

788
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,860
Looks sleepy

789
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,510
Do you know?

790
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,040
Ah, you know, right?

791
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,160
Should be ok, right?

792
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:54,180
Chuppachapusu

793
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:54,670
Kasuga has a great opportunitiy

794
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,720
But answers only 2 out of 8 questions correctly

795
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,190
Should've been a good opportunity

796
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,820
Later

797
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,660
Woke up

798
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:10,270
After an hour and a half of sleep, Inomata wakes up

799
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,580
Need to earn points here

800
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,780
38 hours after the start

801
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,670
10 hours to go

802
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,660
This guy's always sleeping

803
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,530
Sleeping is normal, right?
-True

804
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,760
Inomata sleeps for the 3rd time

805
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,940
This is normal and he really tried hard

806
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,350
The difference is now 190 points

807
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,080
You can do it!

808
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,040
Can Kasuga reverse the scores at this point?

809
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,100
Kasuga is awesome

810
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:49,970
The ingredients placed in the center of "Hinomaru Bento" are?

811
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,010
How can he stay awake?

812
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,970
Dried plums

813
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,440
Really impressive

814
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:57,810
Beaujolais Nouveau

815
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:57,810

816
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:57,810

817
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:57,810
The new French red wine
that was unveiled on the
3rd Thursday of November
is?

818
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:57,810
What are the ingredients
for the "tear roll" sushi?

819
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:57,810
What cream cheese
is used in Tiramisu?

820
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,660
He answers 4 questions in the ingredients category correctly

821
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,560
Not bad not bad

822
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,660
And

823
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:12,890
The Chinese wine with golden mignonette flowers infused into white wine is?

824
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:12,890
Osmanthus Aged Wine

825
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,410
Awesome

826
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,440
He answers 6 questions in a row correctly

827
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,650
Awesome awesome

828
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,160
During the period when Inomata was still asleep

829
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,560
The next category is...

830
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:22,020
选择了第一天正确率不错的娱乐圈

831
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,970
Erika Toda

832
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,970
In Takarazuka Opera,
there is the Hana,
Moon,  Snow, Star
and what group?

833
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,970
Last October Zelkova
46 changed her
name to?

834
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,970
Last year's M-1
victor was?

835
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,970
Magical Lovely

836
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,970
Sakurazaka46

837
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,970
Who married actor
Momochi Matsuzaka
last December?

838
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,970
Zu group

839
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,780
然后在这里

840
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,660
4 questions in a row here too

841
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,610
Finally he catches up to only 10 points difference

842
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:47,690
What traditional art begins with an ape and ends with a fox?

843
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,690
Ravings

844
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,470
Wow

845
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,650
Overtaken?
-Yes

846
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,880
After 40 hours

847
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,840
Kasuga finally overtakes Toudaiou

848
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,840
Kasuga's great!

849
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,150
No sleep at all

850
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,230
Inomata slept for two and a half hours

851
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,450
After sleeping for so long

852
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,360
Here

853
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,840
Oh no!
-Overtaken!

854
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,130
If you fall asleep here

855
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,720
He drooled loads!

856
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,450
So much!

857
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:20,020
Kasuga who hasn't slept for 53 hours

858
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,680
What happened?

859
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:27,260
Falls asleep with water in his mouth

860
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,230
He's in such a state

861
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,710
Spilled all over himself

862
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,050
Yeah

863
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,670
Awesome
-Shocking

864
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,910
What came out?

865
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:41,440
Demonstrative

866
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:42,350
What is the radical of the character "祝"?

867
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:41,200
But after answering 1 question correctly

868
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,280
Not bad not bad

869
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,060
Awake again

870
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,690
After sleeping for about 3 hours, Inomata woke up

871
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,510
And

872
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,620
You can do it, Kasuga!

873
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,300
Don't sleep, Kasuga!

874
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,440
What's happening

875
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,060
Pretending?

876
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,120
Kasuga!

877
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,870
Damn

878
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,420
Is he faking?

879
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,660
40 hours and 25 minutes after the start of the Q&A

880
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,530
Ironman Kasuga finally falls asleep

881
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,230
He's sleeping!

882
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,730
Despite intending to pretend to sleep to make the opponent let down his guard...

883
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,250
In doing so, he accidentally fell asleep

884
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,520
And woke up 1 hour later

885
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,210
For the next six and a half hours, the two fight continuously

886
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,380
Still so long!

887
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,140
After 48 hours

888
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,140
So impressive

889
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,930
Finally, the last question

890
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,620
What'll happen?

891
00:43:50,580 --> 00:44:13,440
The law that shifts the country's
industrial structure from primary
to secondary and tertiary industries
is called?

892
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,710
What?

893
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,050
Level 6

894
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:02,180
Jungle TV Tamori's Law

895
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,770
Suddenly making jokes

896
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,910
It is normal not to know

897
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:13,440
Paddy Clark's theorem

898
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,070
What the...

899
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,440
Ah…

900
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,290
Even in this state, the answer is correct

901
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,610
Amazing

902
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,480
I have feeling of "it's over" and also reluctance

903
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,190
It's not the feeling of "it's over, what a relief"

904
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:30,820
Did I overtake him in the last 24 hours?

905
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:35,560
Because he was asleep, did I overtake during that time?

906
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:40,770
Maybe in the second half

907
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,070
I think I did a little better

908
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,290
What was the result?

909
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,290
I'm not happy.

910
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,320
What a shame!

911
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:57,420
I lost by a lot

912
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,710
No... no...

913
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,150
This isn't just lost by a little

914
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:05,290
So in Toudaiou vs Wednesday Downtown

915
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:09,890
The winner of this round is Toudaiou

916
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,100
I want revenge

917
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:19,740
Another duel of patience between me, Inomata and the leader

918
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,420
I see.
-Great!

919
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,530
Although Kasuga worked very hard

920
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:30,070
Overall, Toudaiou won

921
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:33,590
Will Fujimon be bungee jumping?

922
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:34,630
Why?

923
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,590
Why would I?
-For losing

924
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:38,310
I wasn't the team captain!

925
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,010
I'm not the leader of Wednesday Downtown either

926
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,510
It's tough

927
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,930
I can't bungee jump

928
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,930
I will talk to the staff

929
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:46,890
No, no, no.

930
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,240
I'll tell them not to make you

931
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,970
You better!

932
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,160
Tell them angrily!

933
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,540
"Don't make Fujimon jump!"

934
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:29,830
