The Old Man and the Gorilla

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,340
We're told Mr Matsumoto is a fearless person, but can you narrate
to us the most life-threatening situation you've been in so far?

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,720
did the guy actually call you "fearless"?

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,820
let's see now, the most dangerous experience I've had till now would be....

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,190
...I guess it'd have to be the time I was whacked by a gorilla!

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,340
where was this?

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,530
around here.....it went BAM!!

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,640
I meant where were you when this happened!

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
well let's see...I was playing baseball...

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,940
WHERE!?

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,690
in the field, in the field!

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
which field?!

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,810
let's see now - it was the Amagasaki baseball
field (Matsumoto and Hamada's hometown in Hyogo prefecture)

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,620
huh! You've never told me this story before!

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,590
Really?...(politely)..well, can you please listen anyway.....?

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,090
Wham! You remember, I used to hit homeruns all the time back then, right?

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,140
OK, if you say so...(stiffening up out of respect) - aye,aye cap'n!

18
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,090
my adolescence was all about homeruns, man!

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,340
what're you, an idiot?....enough already!

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,040
Wham!!!   Man, did I strike the ball hard back in the day!...SMASHED it
clear out of the field, and it broke the glass in someone's house!

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,810
Oh, really?

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,340
Well, so I make my way over there to apologize....

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,440
but when I got there, there he was....the Gorilla!

24
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,290
really? a Gorilla? you don't say!

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,420
Well...actually, there was an old man too....AND a gorilla!

26
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,390
Oh, I get it, the gorilla was with the old
man at his place! I get it now!

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,690
He said, 'What do you plan to do about this window kid? I
just replaced the glass after it was broken a while back!'

28
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,860
And through it all the gorilla was like this...(sways and swaggers about menacingly)

29
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,470
Sounds like a yankee punk gorilla staring at you up and down!

30
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,180
Go on....

31
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,680
well, I was like all...bowing down low...being humble, you know?...

32
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,040
....just genuflecting and flopping before the guy, you know?....

33
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,150
I was also just a kid back then, remember?....

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,850
And just then, the gorilla pushes the old man aside....and....

35
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,490
wow! he stepped out in front of him, did he?......and?....

36
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,090
'Why the hell don't you just apologize punk?!'

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,530
wait...hold on a second here....

38
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,500
(gestures: 'aren't you getting ahead of the story here?')

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
The gorilla spoke?

40
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,840
No, that's what the old man said!

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,340
Aaaaaah, I get you now -  had me going there for a while!

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
...no, it was the old man, of course....(chuckles to
himself at the idea of a gorilla talking)

43
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,590
thanks, ok i get it now... startled me there for a minute....

44
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,510
And so the old man asked me why I wouldn't apologize....

45
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,580
....and then it was like,'Oi, oi, oi, oi!'

46
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,090
wait, wait, wait, hold on a minute again!..the
gorilla threatened you with,'Oi, oi, oi, oi?'

47
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,240
no, no, that was the old man again!

48
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,950
aaah, i got you -  so it was the old man talking again

49
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,890
.....wow...the old guy sure has a lot to say, didn't he?...and then?

50
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,640
well, so the old man was like,'Oi, oi, oi, oi!'...right?

51
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,220
And I was humbly like,'Well, I don't see why I should apologize,
since I will definitely compensate you for the damage done.'

52
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,480
....and when I said that, it just stepped out menacingly and was like,'YOU
THINK COMPENSATING FOR THE DAMAGE IS GOING TO MAKE EVERYTHING OK?!?!'

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
wait, wait, wait, hold on just a minute again!...this was the goril.....?

54
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,090
no, no, it was still the old man, the old man!

55
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,340
Ok, i get it - so it was the old man again...........the old
guy sure keeps stepping out into the front a lot, doesn't he?

56
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:04,010
With the old guy stepping out so many times, you'd think the poor gorilla would start to feel cramped and crowded out - he'd think
'Should I just squeeze myself to the front from the side somehow? Why doesn't the old geezer just get out of the way?'

57
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,840
And then it was like......BAMMM!!!......I don't know if it was a big rock or a
desk lying around or something that was dashed to the ground...and it said....

58
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,950
Oh wow!...and then?....

59
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,030
'DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FUCK WITH A GORILLA AND GET AWAY WITH IT?!?!'

60
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,840
eh?..stop!...wait, wait a minute....was this the gorilla?

61
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,840
no, no, the old man, the old man again!

62
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,090
and then ......(in a soft voice) 'just compensate us for the damage'

63
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,090
THAT was the gorilla speaking!

64
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,090
Eh?!

65
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,540
OK, so THAT was the gorilla speaking!

66
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,050
For the first time, the gorilla spoke

67
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,090
Pretty chilled out gorilla! - not in the habit of getting angry is he?

68
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,090
He just says softly,'Compensate us for the damage'!....oooooh, wow!

69
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Weren't you in the least bit startled when the gorilla started speaking?

70
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,340
No, that part didn't startle me, not really!...I was
a wild and reckless guy back then.

71
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,840
But really....isn't it odd and funny?....I mean why should anyone have to apologize...if you
compensate for the damage, that should be the end of story, right?.......

72
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,940
He was like, 'You bruised me right here in my arm!'

73
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,190
Wow, you injured the guy?

74
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,340
That was once again the gorilla I'm talking about....

75
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,340
Eh?!

76
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,340
You mean the gorilla addressed you formally and said, 'You have injured me!'.....?

77
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,340
And then he walks up all of a sudden, and....

78
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,790
Wow, that must have been scary!

79
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,740
He must have been around this tall, right?

80
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,840
Sure, he was a big, tall gorilla!

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
BAM!!!!

82
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,340
Wow, did it break your jaw?

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,650
No, it was the OLD MAN who got whacked!

84
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,550
Eh?!

85
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,990
Weren't they living together happily all this time?

86
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,140
'That's how much destructiveness I have pent up!'............

87
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,340
All right, that's enough!

88
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,190
..........was what the old man finally said!

89
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,190
Eh?!

90
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,590
Man, what a strange, scary day it was!

91
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,690
But no one whacked or even touched you!
