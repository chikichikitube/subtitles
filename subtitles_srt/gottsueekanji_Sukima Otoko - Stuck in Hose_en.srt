Tomiyoshi-san

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,370
I'm happy! We haven't eaten sushi in a while

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,990
It's nothing special just the sushi-go-round

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,570
What's wrong?
- Look!

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,240
Is that a person?

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,540
What are you doing?

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,120
What?

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,050
What are you doing?

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,550
It's not "ahh"

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,390
The washing machine hose... hey!

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,020
What?

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,020
I said what are you doing?!

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,890
What with the "ahh"

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,540
Mizuno-san!

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,440
Mizuno-san look at this

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,640
Yes.. huh?

18
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:48,500
See?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,300
What is he doing?

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,670
What the hell is this?

21
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,870
What are you doing mister?

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,920
What?

23
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,970
Get out!

24
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,120
Shut up stupid! It's none of your business

25
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,020
It does matter, you're in my washing machine hose right?

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,320
Are you "Ai Sai go"?

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,850
*Ai Sai Go - Washing machine manufacturer

28
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,250
No I'm not "Ai Sai Go"

29
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,390
That's wrong

30
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,120
I'm wrong?

31
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,370
That doesn't matter, just get out of there!

32
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,070
You're blocking my door, get away!

33
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,170
Shut up stupid, why do I need to get out?

34
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,040
You're right outside his door!

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
I warned you!

36
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,870
You didn't warn anyone

37
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,870
I warned you earlier

38
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,940
Me? We didn't hear anything from you

39
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,970
I sent a messenger to let you know I would be here

40
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,340
Messenger?

41
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,220
He told you...

42
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,950
If he really came, I would have refused!

43
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,650
Hurry and get out!

44
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,450
Just call the police

45
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,090
Can you call the police?

46
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,770
Hey, don't fall asleep!
- Don't sleep!

47
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,390
We're calling the police!

48
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,990
Shut up, I'm not calling them

49
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,370
We're calling!

50
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,670
Shut up stupid

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,770
What's the problem?

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,400
Look at this guy

53
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,420
What is he doing?

54
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,820
Mister

55
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,620
What?

56
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,920
Why are you in there?

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,820
Police?

58
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,620
Yes, it's the police

59
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,150
Get out mister

60
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,020
What?

61
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,520
Can't you get out?

62
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,220
Of course I can get out

63
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,990
How did you get in there?

64
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,090
You're causing trouble for everyone

65
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,170
If it's hard for you to get out, I'll help you

66
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,500
It's kind of complicated

67
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,300
Is it complicated?
Yes it is

68
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,800
When I tried to get out, I got in

69
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,740
You tried to get out but you got in?
That must have been hard huh?

70
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,040
Yeah
- Yeah

71
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,140
Let's get out

72
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,240
You're only thinking about me getting out huh?

73
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,420
Right?

74
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,840
Yeah

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,020
You should have asked me why I'm in here to begin with

76
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,520
Yeah I guess that's true

77
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,820
It seems like you really don't care

78
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,520
Sorry mister

79
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,190
Please tell me why you're in there

80
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,340
Marriage is like prison

81
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,240
My wife...

82
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,440
came from a rich family

83
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,540
I see

84
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,240
I have such a small paycheck, but she uses every last penny

85
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
And...

86
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:19,220
she really likes the high end boutiques,
so she spends a lot of money

87
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,390
It's OK if she like expensive merchandise but...

88
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,470
she should take care of herself from the inside as well

89
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,470
"Take care of yourself from the inside"

90
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,090
I told her

91
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,770
I thought she was going to apologize,
but she just said to keep quiet

92
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,770
So I told her to get out

93
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,940
She said not "me" but "you" get out

94
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,790
I was so mad

95
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,390
Well anyway, that has nothing to do with right now

96
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,790
Has nothing to do with this?

97
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,220
Nothing to do with this?

98
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,050
It looks like I have trauma

99
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,070
Oh, you're talking about being in here?
- Yeah

100
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,790
I have childhood memories

101
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,940
Yeah, you remember the past

102
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,170
I went on a field trip to the mountains in Nara

103
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:15,020
I didn't want to be in the group, so
I went with Sakata and Tsukaguchi

104
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,220
on a different path

105
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,690
We were walking and found a cave

106
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,720
We went into the cave to play, and you know
how kids always forget about the time

107
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:36,470
We didn't realize how late it was and soon it was
dark outside. Everyone was looking for us

108
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,770
They called my parents and the police

109
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,400
Everyone was so worried about us

110
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,370
Since then, dark and small places

111
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,140
I hate it

112
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,970
So what are you doing in there?!

113
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,820
That's strange what he's saying!

114
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,120
OK, are you alright now?

115
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,690
What?

116
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,150
Huh?

117
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,650
Herry and get away from my house

118
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,450
OK

119
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,350
We're going to eat sushi

120
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,320
I'll get out

121
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,990
I'm finally out

122
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,290
You're not out!

123
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,300
You didn't get out mister

124
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,000
Cant you get out on your own?

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,300
Leave me alone

126
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,400
Hurry get out

127
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,740
You're causing trouble

128
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,440
We can't leave with you here

129
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,190
What's the matter?

130
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,140
Are you hurt?

131
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,650
"Happy"

132
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,950
"Happy"

133
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,390
What?

134
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,390
What are you saying mister?

135
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,920
It's not happy, you're causing everyone trouble!

136
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,290
I'm causing trouble?

137
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,390
Right?

138
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,140
I see

139
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,140
Yes, you're committing a crime

140
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,570
Crime?

141
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,900
Yes, this is a crime

142
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,900
This is a crime?
- Yes, it's a crime

143
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,900
This is someone's property right?

144
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,500
You're causing trouble and they can't
use the washing machine either

145
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,370
Did you think about that?

146
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,240
You'll arrest me?

147
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,040
I will arrest you

148
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,690
You're going to arrest me?

149
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,420
Yes I will

150
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,750
If you do that, my wife and child will cry

151
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,250
Yes that's true

152
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,920
That wouldn't be good

153
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,190
Getting arrest will be a problem,
I can't show my face in public

154
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,790
Whatever

155
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,670
Whatever?!

156
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,500
Whatever? What is he talking about?

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,170
I'm going to arrest you and put you in handcuffs

158
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,370
I'm also causing you trouble huh?

159
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,070
Yes you are

160
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,870
The police

161
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,290
You must be busy
- Yes

162
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,790
You must be busy with guys like me

163
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,490
Somehow...

164
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,820
I'm sorry...

165
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,870
I'm sorry.. somehow.. I'm always just thinking about myself

166
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,870
Please forgive me!

167
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,370
"Police man"

168
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,740
Why only "Police man" in English?

169
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,370
Why just that part?

170
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,870
Mister, do you want to get arrested?

171
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,520
Mister!

172
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,140
You're going too far

173
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,240
OK?
- Yes

174
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,920
Also...

175
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,650
if I didn't go home, my family will be worried

176
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,620
Yes, they will worry

177
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,050
I didn't call or anything for the past 3 days

178
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,820
That's bad

179
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,590
I'm such a terrible husband huh?

180
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,200
I can't show my face huh?

181
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,170
I want to get married

182
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,170
You're not married?!
