00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:07,520
A Special for the New Year - Yama-1 Grand Prix!

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,790
Every year, comedians take part

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,490
looking to catch their big break

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,660
I've ripened

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,170
Last week, every performer got 10 points, a miracle!

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,940
We will find the winner in this second part!

Yamasaki Hosei

11
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,960
Yeah we haven't seen any 8's or 9's

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,660
Cocorico


Endo Shozo                            Tanaka Naoki

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,660
They've all gotten the full 10 points so far

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,260
I want us to maintain this momentum

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,770
Let's hope our next performer can do that

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,770
Let's continue

17
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,740
Bringing back that famous song

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,600

Top Color Agency


Double Name

00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,850
Hello, we are Chage and Aska

Please Enjoy

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,230
(They repeat this line)

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,230
Chage is a good guy

24
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,090
Thank you very much

25
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,460
I've heard

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,460
Yes

27
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,690
You are a huge fan of Yamasaki-san

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,030
We love him

29
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,600
Previously, Housei-san and I

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,740
He helped me out at this shady gig

31
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,740
What do you mean "shady gig"?

32
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,710
At that shady gig,

33
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,470
When he was helping us out

34
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,650
Housei-san is a nice guy after all,

35
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,380
He was asking the other performers
"Would you like some candy?"

36
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,720
He was handing out candy

37
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,560
I saw he gave only me a gummy

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,890
Do you remember this?

39
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,730
Sorry, I don't remember the gummy candy

40
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,500
But I do remember that shady business

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,230
So let's move on,

42
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,930

TN: Not sure about this translation, I apologise in advance because I think I am missing a lot of what she is saying

46
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,240
In her 9th year, Ume

Ume

48
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,020

49
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,990
Uh no please I'm full please no more

50
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,790
No I'm really full!

51
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,570
I literally can't eat anymore I'm so full, I will vomit

52
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:46,740
I cannot eat anymore than this

53
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,270
I cannot keep going

54
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,410
That is, so, no

55
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,450
I will become sick

56
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:05,420
I cannot eat anymore you haven't served me that meat yet

57
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,160
You haven't served me that yet

58
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:19,600
I cannot I can't I didn't ask for this Udon or rice

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:34,990
The rice and the udon that's liquor food I don't want anymore thank you for the meal

60
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,790
Thank you very much

61
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,790
Thank you very much!

62
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,860
Housei-san was really laughing

63
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,860
He really was

64
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,660
He was so into it!

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,660
He really liked it

66
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,600
He was laughing so much we couldn't hear anything

67
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,600
The performance?

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,940
I've got tears in my eyes

69
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,440
He says he got tears in his eyes

70
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,080
The score please!

71
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,840
TEN PPOOOOOIIIIIINNNTTSTSTSS

72
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,180
Another perfect score

73
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,190
A lonely guitarist with a depressing ballad
In his 13th year, AMEMIYA

74
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,760
A lot of songs this time

75
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,760
You're right

76
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,600
Sony Music Artists

77
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,370
My song is inspired by the words I see on the streets

78
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,100
For example,

79
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
"Hyashi Chuka is now on the menu"

80
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
TN: Hiyashi Chuka = Chilled Chinese Noodles

81
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,910
I think these simple words have a story to tell

82
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,850
"Gotta be ready by Summer, I've been working on them since spring"

83
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:44,560
"I've reworked it so many times to get the taste right.
Now today,"

84
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,930
"The 20th of December, finally at our ramen shop,"

85
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,870
"Hiyahi Chuka is now on the menu!"

86
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:02,770
"While I was busy working, my wife fell in love with a host"

87
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,970
He's good

88
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,810
"Hiyashi Chuka is now on the menu"

89
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:14,420
"I'm in debt cause someone made a credit card in my name"

90
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:20,060
"Hiyashi Chuka is now on the menu"

91
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:26,700
"Someone's been committing arson, I didn't know I had life insurance"

92
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:33,140
"Hyashi Chuka is now on the menu"

93
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,140
Who cares

94
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:40,450
"It's been half a year since my wife ran off with that host"

95
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,890
"This year I think it's time for that special summer treat"

96
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:53,490
"I've been skimping on the ham bit by bit"

97
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,930
"Hiyashi Chuka, is now on the menu"

98
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:06,040
"I get a call complaining about food poisining,"

99
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,400
That's enough already

100
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,080
"Hiyashi Chuka is now on the menu"

101
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,080
Stop it, stop it!

102
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,720
"I've been hosptalised from the stress, my hair is receding"

103
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,390
"Hiyashi Chuka is now on the menu"

104
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:29,830
"Suddenly somebody appears, and tells me he's my son"

105
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,730
"Hiyashi Chuka is now on the menu"

106
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:40,840
"All over the world, terrorists lurk in hiding"

107
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,540
He's going there?

108
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:48,080
"Why do people hurt, and hurt each other?"

109
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,820
"Hiyahsi Chuka is now on the menu"

110
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,760
"Hiyahsi Chuka, Hiyahsi Chuka"

111
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,730
"Hiyahsi Chuka, is now on the menu"

112
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,930
Thank you very much

113
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,700
Thank you!

114
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,710
AMEMIYA is very happy
I hope you could hear me

115
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,710
We heard it

116
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,210
I learned a lot

117
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,940
AMEMIYA is very happy

118
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,080
What the hell is that?

119
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,620
AMEMIYA is very happy

120
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,520
Matsumoto you heard him right?

121
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,390
What the hell are you?

122
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:32,360
He sounded like my brother, it was good still,
BUT!

123
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,630
This time Yamasaki-san...

124
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,930
He might be harsher this time

125
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,160
It's been all 10 points until now

126
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,570
The score please

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,170
TEN POOOOIIINNTSSS

128
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,870
I'm very happy, thank you!

129
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,780
This 2011 will be your big break, I think you will be busy

130
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,110
AMEMIYA thinks so too

131
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,920
This guy is so annoying

132
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,960
A new format after 20 years of comedy

133
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,690
in their 20th year, X-Gun! (X = Batsu)

134
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,270
Horipro Agency

135
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,500
I guess we're here, the first job of the year,

136
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,500
Hold on

137
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,070
here at Gaki no Tsukai-

138
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,070
"Batsu-gun!", you forgot our intro

139
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,580
Ah, my bad, I'm sorry

140
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,010
No man, if you mess up our pacing at such an important place

141
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,880
You kill our momentum

142
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,220
Well, sorry, sorry.
Let's get this going, let's go!

143
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,650
Even if you say "sorry, sorry"

144
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,390
It's not about whether or not I'm gonna forgive you right now

145
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:44,230
I mean If this show calls us on again after that mistake, I'll forgive you,

146
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,530
If they never call us again cause of that, I will never respect you again

147
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,840
Did I really do something that bad?

148
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,710
That is what being on TV is all about

149
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,340
This is our big chance

150
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,550
How many new year specials have we been invited to?

151
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,680
One

152
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,850
We finally got this chance

153
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,750
And you messed it all up

154
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,920
We're truly finished

155
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,060
Seriously

156
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,560
Ok?

157
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,660
You have that one-shot gag right?
You brought a note with you one time

158
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,730
You left it by your feet so I thought
"He's gonna do that gag?"

159
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,470
For seven hours you didn't speak a word

160
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,040
Why?

161
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,880
Why the note?

162
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
Why did you bring that note?

163
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,410
I wanted to do it

164
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,550
You wanted to?

165
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,680
But you didn't, huh?

166
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:46,620
You thought someone was gonna ask you "hey do that gag"?

167
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,990
You can't take initiative, you've always been like that

168
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,430
You haven't changed since our debut

169
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,900
Seriously

170
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,270
You and Arita, you guys met Sanma-san

171
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,370
And you told me "i cAn fiNalLy pErFoRm"

172
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,150
But you went on stage and only Arita and Yamasaki were talking

173
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,610
You didn't speak at all

174
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,720
And that's the result now, Yamasaki is below Arita

175
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,820
This is the clear result

176
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,390
What the hell is he saying?

177
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,890
Seriously

178
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,320
This is nonsense

179
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,490
And then another thing, you were like,

180
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:30,300
"I'm the tsukommi in our manzai,
but on location shoots and stuff can I boke?"

181
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,170
Of course it's fine

182
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:40,080
And when we were on that show, you didn't speak for seven hours,
even though it was such an easy environment

183
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,350
Why didn't you Boke then?

184
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,020
Just forgive him already

185
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,020
Seriously

186
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,050
Just forgive him!

187
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,260
Today is no different

188
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,260
I forgot the map, I asked you where the exit is, you said you were at A-1

189
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,300
And I couldn't find A-1, I though "huh?" when I saw something

190
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,200
You were on the other side of the door

191
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,840
That was A-5

192
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,180
If you can't handle that then what can you do?

193
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,480
And you're going "mmm" like you're angry too

194
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,380
But I don't give a shit, you know why?

195
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,220
For so many years I've been dealing with your bullshit

196
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,430
Apologise, just apologise!

197
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,100
It's over if you apologise

198
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,400
sorry

199
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,810
"sorry" - I don't really care cause you've been telling me that forever

200
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,640
I'll be grateful if you change

201
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,080
Sorry about that, thank you very much

202
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,250
He got really scolded you

203
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,050
Scolded? Well another thing-

204
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,190
We've been on Cocorico's TV shows a bunch too

205
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,790
I was a little bit nervous,

206
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:08,400
"Don't worry, Endo and I are like best buds" - and yet he didn't speak a single word

207
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,200
There's a story about you and Downtown-san...

208
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,200
Yes, Downtown-san and us

209
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,140
Before our debut, on a "Warate Iitomo!" corner,

210
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,010
It was a corner that showcased amateurs

211
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,210
There was a Hamada and Matsumoto team

212
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,710
We were on Hamada-san's team

213
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,920
And we were super nervous when Hamada-san came to say hello

214
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,120
"You guys are comedians?"
"Yes!"

215
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,360
And when Eri-san called Hamada-san over, while he was walking,

216
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
He turned to us
"Boke as much as you can, I'll tsukommi everything"

217
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,070
"SO COOL!" we thought

218
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,070
That's cool

219
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:46,670
and then after, we were on a Gaki no Tsukai "Kinpachi Sensei" shooting

220
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,040
A long time ago

221
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,310
and he's an amazing guy

222
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,980
It would be troublesome to take pictures individually,

223
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,150
So Hamada-san took pictures in blocks of people
"What a nice guy" I thought

224
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,750
So he was taking pictures in blocks,
and when he finally got to our block,

225
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,120
There was an excited high schooler going like "Yay!!!" with Hamada-san

226
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,460
At first Hamada-san was like "ok ok"

227
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,500
The second time he went "Yayy!", Hamada-san went "HEY ASSHOLE!"

228
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,330
"ARE YOU TAKING THE PISS, HUH?!"

229
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,070
And us,

230
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,510
Just looked up from the camera without taking a picture

231
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,510
You would be shocked

232
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,440
I didn't know what his real personality was

233
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,440
I see

234
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,850
And Sagane-san?

235
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,080
Do you have any memories with Downtown

236
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:37,090
Yes

237
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,260
There's gotta be something

238
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,190
I've always been, uh, watching them on TV

239
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,190
He's gonna scold you again

240
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,500
That is something a non-comedian would say

241
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,540
Yamasaki-san, the score please

242
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,540
TEN POOONTSTSTSTST ST ST ST S ST ST ST

243
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,310

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,210
So let's keep going

245
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,210
Let's go!

246
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:07,290
These M-1 winners came up with a new sketch for today,
In their 8th year, Surimu Club

247
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,160
Hello, thank you very much!

248
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:16,230
Yoshimoto Creative Agency

Surimu Club

249
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,390
Sketch: New Lifeform

250
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,010
What are you?

251
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,010
I am

252
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,320
This star's

253
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,580
most

254
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,950
lowest level gender

255
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,830
Excuse me

256
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,740
I'll leave in 5 minutes

257
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,340
Just a little will do,

258
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,010
Could you provide me some gasoline?

259
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,110
What do you need it for?

260
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,480
For that reason,

261
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,720
I cannot give you any gasoline

262
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,960
GYAHHH

263
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,500
This

264
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,960
memory stick,

265
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,100
contains

266
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,940
until now

267
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,440
the memory of the best sex I've ever had

268
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,380
So what?

269
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,710
I shall give you some gasoline

270
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,920
Thank you

271
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,720
My next request,

272
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,960
Batteries

273
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,990
I will give you two of them

274
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,160
On the places I cannot reach

275
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,070
please rub this medicine

276
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,110
The non-circled spots please

277
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,780
What the hell?

278
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,150
If I apply this medicine everyday at a set time,

279
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,430
An certain organisation gives me 100,000 yen

280
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,500
This is a story from the year 2200

281
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,130
Thank you very much!

282
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,130
Thank you very much

283
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,140
I've heard

284
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:46,040
From February onwards, you have continuous work booked up

285
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,040
Yes thanks to everyone

286
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,810
We didn't have much work before

287
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,850
M-1 was really good to us

288
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,850
I heard you had 1 job you turned down

289
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,850
Turned down?

290
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,590
It was just me

291
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,690
I was invited to a talk show with Kato Taka-san

292
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,690
TN: A famous porn star

293
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,830
The scheduling didn't work out

294
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,300
Cause you're so busy, Surimo Club is busy

295
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,000
Yamasaki-san, the score please

296
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,670
54454e20504f494e545321

297
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,270
What did you like about it?

298
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,480
Huh, hold on, my ear ...

299
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,480
We'll wait for you

300
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,680
Endo, give me a second

301
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,790
There's water in my ear

302
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,590
Water in your ear?

303
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,890
I can't get it out!

304
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,890
I understand

305
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,030
So Tanaka-san, finally tonight's key performer

306
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,030
Key-perfomer, yes

307
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,290
Let's continue

308
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:42,200
The filthiest comedian, here at Yama-1

309
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,840
In his 24th year, Mimata Matazo

310
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,710
He's here

311
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,480
Office Kitano


Mimata Matazo

312
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,250
Mimata, Mimata, Mima-mimata!

313
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,460
Oh shit wait

314
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,360
You messed up

315
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,840
Even if you messed up, you shouldn't say it
We wouldn't have noticed

316
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,510
I messed up

317
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,940
You were the key performer too, how was it?

318
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,280
At Kouhaku Uta Gassen

319
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,280
TN: end of year special by NHK

320
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,450
Misora Hibari-san always has this energy as the key performer

321
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,680
So I was really nervous

322
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,190
Excuse me, but your breath smells like shit

323
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,190
What happened?

324
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,060
Even though you're my senpai, it just stinks so bad

325
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,060
What happened?

326
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,460
I'm sorry

327
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,530
I've been told this before, that my breath stinks

328
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,570
I went to the dentist and got all my cavities done

329
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,040
The nervousness makes the smell come out

330
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,040
A lot came out right now

331
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,170
So Yamasaki-san

332
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,410
Mimata, you really did it

333
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,010
The score please

334
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,080
8 points

335
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,850
That's kind of generous

336
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,630
It's 1 out of 10, normally

337
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:54,730
That was twisted. Twisted 2.5 times.

338
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,800
Yes! Someone in the back laughed at that!

339
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,910
Guy in the back, come on out!

340
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,910
Thank you very much!

341
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,910
Thank you very much

342
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:08,610
Finally, the results. Who shall clutch victory?!

343
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,950
Entry Number 1

344
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,520
Ume-chan!

345
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,330
I want to do a joint live with you

346
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,730
Joint?

347
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,130
Joint?

348
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,500
he wants to do a show together

349
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,800
Looking forward to it

350
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,800
Yes

351
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,840
After the recording was over,

352
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:43,080
An outrageous incident occurred!

353
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,850
Turn the camera on a second

354
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,320
Is it recording?

355
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,290
Is it OK?

356
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,930
You ate my strawberry didn't you?!

357
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,790
Seriously?

358
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,130
There was a strawberry here right?

359
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,560
Yes there was

360
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,300
Yeah yeah yeah exactly

361
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,840
I definitely did not eat any strawberry

362
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,410
Why the hell did you eat my strawberry?!

363
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,480
It was just sitting there ....

364
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,480
You ate it?

365
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,620
Hamada-san that's not right

366
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,550
He ate 4 strawberries

367
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,520
Are you bloody serious?

368
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,660
Did you seriously eat my strawberry?

369
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,830
When?

370
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:39,140
While watching the performance

371
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,640
The camera definitely caught him

372
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,610
There's footage of it

373
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,510
Just need to know the timing

374
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,150
That was during the top batter, Open Space's perfomance

375
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,260
It was 15 seconds after the performance started

376
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,270
He made sure Matsumoto is focused on the performance

377
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,470
The strawberry glutton Hamada!

378
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,910
Furthermore, he ate the remaining single one!

379
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,020
He actually ate it

380
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,020
He actually ate it

381
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,760
You weren't eating it anyways!

382
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

383
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,200
Strawberry, is a sweet

384
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,370
I will of course eat it at the end
