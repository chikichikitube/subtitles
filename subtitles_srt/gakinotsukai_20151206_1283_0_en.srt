00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:08,150
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai! Mess around and you're out!
Serious and accurate animal acting contest!

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,460
How was his shouting?

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:14,760
It was somehow muffled

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,160
It was somehow muffled

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,100
Mess around and you're out

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,100
Serious and accurate animal acting contest!

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,270
Each one of them will choose an animal and they'll study their way of living

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,270
f

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,040
They'll have to play that animal seriously in a dark jungle set

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,040
f

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,050
Who will be the most realistic animal actor between them?

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,050
Who will be the most realistic animal actor between them?

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,650
Comedians usually react fast, sometimes too much

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,650
Downtown

15
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,650
Hamada Masatoshi

16
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,650
Matsumoto Hitoshi

17
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,460
I think that's what I don't like about comedians

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,760
It's kind of lame, isn't it?

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,760
- It is, yes

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,960
But this is realistic, isn't it?

21
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,960
Yes, it is

22
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,100
They have to act like real animals without messing around

23
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,100
Cocorico

24
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,100
Tanaka Naoki

25
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,760
We're gonna think they're real?

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,370
We'll have them act like

27
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,370
real animals without exaggerations

28
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:04,940
Tanaka will explain the distinctive point of each animal

29
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,370
To decide how much they'll be realistic

30
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,510
Is up to Tanaka, who is so well-informed on animals

31
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,940
To the point he even published a book!

32
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,980
Is there going to be a winner?

33
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,950
Yes, when we're done we'll talk about them and decide the winner

34
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,120
Actually, me and Hamada want to set a prize money

35
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,520
Actually, me and Hamada want to set a prize money

36
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,020
I think 9000 yen (81 USD) is enough

37
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,020
I agree

38
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,300
Prize money of 9000 yen

39
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,300
The winner will receive a prize from Downtown:

40
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,290
That will be 4500 yen each

41
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,290
At least raise it up to 10'000 yen!

42
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,730
At least 10'000, come on

43
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,730
No way we're gonna do that at the end of the year

44
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,140
It's time for our first contestant's appearance!

45
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,110
Tsukitei Hosei, please come in!

46
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,880
Tsukitei Hosei

47
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,580
I think it kind of... feels like he's messing around

48
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,790
That's not it, just wait and see until I'm done

49
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,020
Can I say which animal am I?

50
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,020
Yes, which animal are you?

51
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,060
I'm a meerkat

52
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,330
It's a small animal, isn't it?

53
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,330
Yeah, it's really small

54
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
He chose this between others?

55
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,730
Why did you choose it?

56
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,730
Please tell us

57
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,340
I once heard that it's one of the strangest animals there is

58
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,410
That's what made me choose it

59
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,410
Is this an act or...?

60
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,420
When the contest starts it's no good but

61
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,790
You can mess around with us now, it's fine

62
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,350
You're not being funny at all!

63
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,790
You're not being funny at all!

Meerkat

Meerkat

Entry no. 1

77
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:47,880
Tsukitei Hosei

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,880
Our first challenger is Hosei

79
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,500
How will he play the not-so-known meerkat's behavior?

80
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,480
Serious and accurate animal: start!

81
00:02:50,820 --> 00:03:00,260
filmed with a night vision camera

82
00:02:50,820 --> 00:03:04,730
Meerkat

83
00:02:50,820 --> 00:03:04,730
Meerkat

84
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,290
Is the set completely dark?

85
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,290
I think it's almost pitch black

86
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,860
We're watching this with a night vision camera

87
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,860
Oh, I see

88
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,190
So we can just barely see what's going on

89
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,160
Where will the meerkat pop out from?

90
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,730
He's not showing up

91
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,130
Where is he?

92
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,700
Maybe it's so realistic it won't come out at all

93
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,170
Maybe it's so realistic it won't come out at all

94
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,900
He can hear us, can't he?

95
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:45,240
Meerkat

96
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:45,240
Meerkat

97
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,900
Yes he can

98
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,240
We're connected

99
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,240
So what's this about?

100
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,410
Here it is

101
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,410
That's where he was...

102
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,080
He's into this

103
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,080
Yeah he is

104
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,490
It isn't really blinking that much

105
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,490
That's right

106
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,820
What's going on?

107
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,990
Looks like he's moving

108
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,720
It's actually realistic

109
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,430
Is it? It's fine?

110
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,430
Yeah, it feels real

111
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,700
He's quick

112
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,700
He is, yes

113
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,240
So irritating

114
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,070
I bet he just wanted to do this!

115
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,070
These moves?

116
00:03:48,070 --> 00:04:11,360
Meerkat

117
00:03:48,070 --> 00:04:11,360
Meerkat

118
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,480
Did he shout?

119
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,480
What's happening?

120
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,250
Woah, that's impressive

121
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,920
It's a wild animal after all

122
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,050
There's something

123
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,250
It's a scorpion

124
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,050
A scorpion! A scorpion came out

125
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,320
He missed it

126
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,790
He did

127
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,860
He's eating the scorpion!

128
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,700
Is it going to be fine by eating them?

129
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,430
Meerkats are immune to the poison of scorpions

130
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:18,700
They're immune to scorpion's poison, that makes it their st

131
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,700
They're immune to scorpion's poison, that makes it their staple food

132
00:04:19,070 --> 00:05:16,800
Meerkat

133
00:04:19,070 --> 00:05:16,800
Meerkat

134
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,410
That must be a watering hole

135
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,510
Like a puddle?

136
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,380
There's something here

137
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,410
Did he take something?

138
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,410
There was something

139
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,680
He must be really hungry

140
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,120
It's a frog!

141
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,120
It eats frogs too?

142
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,120
Yes, it does

143
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,920
He really looks like an animal in this light

144
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,060
He's going for it

145
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,120
He's eating it

146
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,130
He's not using his hands

147
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,470
Isn't that enough?

148
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,000
He ate it all!

149
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,900
He ate it for real! Is he gonna be ok?

150
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,940
Is he ok? He really ate it!

151
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,310
Meerkat are surely cute, but they can also be fierce

152
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,320
I think I actually got what a meerkat is like by this point

153
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,620
You did? I mean, this scene is so realistic

154
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,790
His reactions are so accurate

155
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,730
It just cried

156
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,730
Alright, it's over!

157
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,740
It was really good, and it was way more legit than expected

158
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,280
When you ate that frog...

159
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,280
Yeah, that frog scene felt really wild

160
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,840
After all we're talking about a wild animal

161
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,350
So that's why, I mean---

162
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,680
What do you think about it?

163
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,880
We just said that

164
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,190
That's all we've been saying

165
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,590
Our next challenger is Goto from Jaru Jaru

166
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,730
Goto Junpei

167
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,730
Jaru Jaru

168
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,730
It does look like he's messing around

169
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,830
No way, I swear I'm not

170
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,610
Are you a japanese language teacher?

171
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,270
If so I would be messing around a lot

172
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,170
What is that?

173
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,170
This is a Bonobo

174
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,440
So it's not a gorilla?

175
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,440
No, it's not

176
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,510
It's neither a gorilla nor a chimpanzee

177
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,580
This is said to be the closest living being to humans

178
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,590
This is said to be the closest living being to humans

179
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,590
Is that so?

180
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,720
This is my first time on Gaki no Tsukai

181
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,320
Is this your debut?

182
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,320
Yes it is

183
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,330
To be honest it was my dream to appear on Gaki someday

184
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:20,690
But I never thought I was going to appear on it as a bonobo

185
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,630
But I never thought I was going to appear on it as a bonobo

186
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:31,640
(Jaru Jaru)

187
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:31,640
Bonobo

188
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:31,640
Bonobo

189
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:31,640
Entry no. 2

190
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:31,640
Goto Junpei

191
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,410
Next up is Goto Junpei from Jaru Jaru

192
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,220
Will he be able to become a bonobo

193
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,530
Which is said to be our closest relative?

194
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,510
Serious and accurate animal: start!

195
00:06:34,840 --> 00:07:57,760
Bonobo

196
00:06:34,840 --> 00:07:57,760
Bonobo

197
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,650
Which moves is he going to do?

198
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,650
I wonder

199
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,980
It's even closer than chimpanzees to us humans

200
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,980
Oh, here it is

201
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,150
He just normally entered from the curtain

202
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,490
The way he's moving on two legs is really...

203
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,360
Impressive

204
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,730
Yeah but anyone could do that

205
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,830
They love to play around and climb up trees like that

206
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,830
I see

207
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,170
How can this not be labeled as messing around?

208
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,270
No but it's true, they actually play with trees like that

209
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,380
And now... he's eating something?

210
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,380
Yes, he's eating

211
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,440
Really

212
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,380
Some berries maybe

213
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,150
Yes, they're omnivorous

214
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,150
So they eat lots of things

215
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,320
That was so good

216
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,990
His cry was really accurate!

217
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,190
Ok but his first scene when he entered through the curtain...

218
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,290
Was straight out from a red light district

219
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,530
There's not so much space to move around

220
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,530
He's finally moving again

221
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,200
This is really...

222
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,070
Maybe it's a young one...?

223
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,170
Yeah it kind of seems that way

224
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,540
I mean, rolling on the ground and playing around...

225
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,010
He really doesn't seem to be on guard

226
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,010
That's true

227
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,120
They're really carefree

228
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,120
Chimpanzees or such are often fighting

229
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,760
But bonobos don't like conflicts at all

230
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,490
They usually solve problems peacefully

231
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:06,060
They have a calm personality and don't like fights

232
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:06,060
They're immune to scorpion's poison,

233
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,830
And that's why they're so calm and carefree

234
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,800
And that atmosphere is really clear in here

235
00:08:06,060 --> 00:09:01,720
Bonobo

236
00:08:06,060 --> 00:09:01,720
Bonobo

237
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,800
Well that's... I see

238
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,540
Oh, it's moving

239
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,840
It went there again

240
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,840
One more time

241
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
He really likes that spot

242
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,010
I was thinking...

243
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,210
What we've been shown is a cutback footage

244
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,280
But there's barely any editing

245
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,350
I mean, nothing's happening but it's onscreen

246
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,730
It's off again, what will he do?

247
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,730
That's a yet unexplored zone

248
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,730
Behind the rock

249
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,200
He found something

250
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,510
He's humping something

251
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,940
He's copulating! This is a valid point too

252
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,340
Look: as you can see that's a missionary position

253
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,340
It seems so

254
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,680
Almost every other animal does it from behind

255
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,380
You all should have noticed that

256
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,200
But the bonobo is said to be one of the few animals that prefers missionary

257
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,590
It uses missionary position, which is rare in animals

258
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,590
They're immune to scorpi

259
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,190
That's also why it is said to be close to us

260
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,590
And I think this scene really made it clear

261
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:14,070
Bonobo

262
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:14,070
Bonobo

263
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,800
He cried

264
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,900
END

265
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,900
THE

266
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,940
And it's over!

267
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,240
So, how was it?

268
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,340
I think I've reached my limit after 5 minutes since the start

269
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,350
By the time I was done with copulation, I had no more energy

270
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,980
By the time I was done with copulation, I had no more energy

271
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,020
The thing about losing energy after copulation you just said...

272
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,550
Sounded like a dirty joke

273
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,420
That was just by chance

274
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,990
By chance, huh...

275
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,690
Says the dirty jokes machine

276
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,690
It was a coincidence

277
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,330
Alright, he's messing around

278
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,330
Yep, definitely

279
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:52,940
Endo Shozo

280
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:52,940
Entry no. 3

281
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:52,940
Panda

282
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:52,940
Panda

283
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,600
Our next challenger is Endo

284
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,940
He'll act as zoo's most popular animal: the panda

285
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,210
Panda's movements are really slow

286
00:09:53,270 --> 00:10:22,230
Panda

287
00:09:53,270 --> 00:10:22,230
Panda

288
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,110
They surely are

289
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,110
Yes, they move very slowly

290
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,320
I've seen them doing this

291
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,320
That's bamboo grass, yes

292
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,990
That's really like that, they love it

293
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,360
He's eating a lot

294
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,360
All he's doing is eating

295
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,060
Hamada, you just said all he does is eating, right?

296
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,130
Their feeding habit is pretty much that of a herbivorous

297
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,630
But they're actually carnivorous, so they don't digest it so much

298
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:33,680
Their principal food, bamboo grass, is hard to digest, and
its nutritious values are also low, so they have to eat nonstop

299
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:33,680
They're immune to scorpion's poison Woooo

300
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,940
They can only digest 20% of it

301
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,270
So in order to get a proper nourishment, they must keep on eating

302
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,380
That's why they're always eating

303
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,680
And he's showing this feature to us?

304
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,680
Most likely, yes

305
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,410
What if he just can't come up with anything good?

306
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,810
What if he just can't come up with anything good?

307
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,520
Our next challenger is Kotohge from Viking, please come in!

308
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,490
Kotohge Eiji

309
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,490
Viking

310
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,920
It's a pleasure

311
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:53,290
COMPLETE BODY PAINTING

312
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:53,290
s

313
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,630
That's wonderfully done!

314
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,300
And which animal is this?

315
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,270
I'm a cheetah

316
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,270
A cheetah, of course

317
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,070
That's a wonderful cheetah

318
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,070
Why did you choose it?

319
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,110
First off, I thought it suited my physique

320
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,270
I see

321
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,880
Also, the cheetah is really fast

322
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,650
I think all of you know it can run really fast

323
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,450
But it has lots of other features and I want to show them to you

324
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,430
(Viking)

325
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,430
Cheetah

326
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,430
Cheetah

327
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,430
Entry no. 4

328
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,430
Kotohge Eiji

329
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,420
Our fourth contestant is Kotohge from Viking

330
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,430
How will he act as the cheetah, the fastest running animal in the world?

331
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,530
Serious and accurate animal: start!

332
00:11:23,460 --> 00:12:27,160
Cheetah

333
00:11:23,460 --> 00:12:27,160
Cheetah

334
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,270
From where will he pop out?

335
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,470
He's there already

336
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,470
As you can see he's here

337
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,470
He's here

338
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,600
Woah, it's a cheetah

339
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,010
This is really a cheetah

340
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,740
Really, this

341
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,110
It's a real cheetah!

342
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,380
The balance of his body is incredible

343
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,380
This is wonderful!

344
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,720
But if kids would see it, they couldn't sleep at night

345
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,120
That's a nice angle

346
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,960
That was...

347
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,730
He let out a cry

348
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,730
It was...

349
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,960
Unexpectedly loud

350
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,230
Yeah he went for it

351
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,930
He's raising up his voice

352
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,000
That was quite powerful

353
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,840
The way he's walking around...

354
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,770
Yeah

355
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,870
Is really good

356
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,870
Yes, it's magnificent

357
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,570
It must be tiring

358
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,180
The way he moves around without staying still is very cheetah-ish

359
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,180
Is it?

360
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,450
They don't usually stay still?

361
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,450
That's right

362
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,050
They move around a lot--- oh?

363
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,180
What is he doing?

364
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,890
Looks like he's drinking water

365
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,890
Yes, he must be drinking water

366
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,560
The way he's intimidating is so real, so good!

367
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,200
Cheetahs show their teeth and hiss to threaten the enemy, that's so realistic

368
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,130
They intimidate the enemies by showing them their teeth

369
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,130
They're immune to scorpi

370
00:12:32,130 --> 00:13:23,080
Cheetah

371
00:12:32,130 --> 00:13:23,080
Cheetah

372
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,230
Just like this

373
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,640
That was so good

374
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,110
That's a nice expression

375
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,110
He's doing such a great face

376
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,910
Huh?

377
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,780
Is this Osamu Niisan?

378
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,950
If so, that would count as messing around

379
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,720
Oh, nice threatening

380
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,820
Oh boy

381
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,560
That's such a good face

382
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,560
Yeah, it's perfect

383
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,730
That's a great face, can't deny it

384
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,730
You can feel his force, he's intimidating after all

385
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,870
I wonder if it's a male or a female?

386
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,570
That part is not clear

387
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,810
That's a cub!

388
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,070
So that means...?

389
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,070
Yes

390
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,180
It's a female, this one's a female

391
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,850
Female cheetahs carry their cubs around with their teeth

392
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:30,990
They're immune to sc2

393
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:30,990
When they sense danger, they carry their cub with their mouth

394
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,450
They carry them around when they sense danger or such

395
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,790
I wonder which situation is going to unfold?

396
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,790
That's a cheetah...

397
00:13:31,320 --> 00:14:11,560
Cheetah

398
00:13:31,320 --> 00:14:11,560
Cheetah

399
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,490
Yes

400
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,660
What now? Is something going to happen?

401
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,190
He's aiming at something

402
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,870
That was disgusting

403
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,470
That scene was sickening

404
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,170
They actually do it, they hide in grassy places and leap out

405
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,710
Is he trying to attack his cub?

406
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:51,710
No

407
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,480
I think he's showing it to him

408
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Oh I see, he's teaching the cub

409
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,450
Yes, I think so

410
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,880
It's pedagogy

411
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:56,880
Yes

412
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,550
That's so realistic

413
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,350
They actually teach it to the cubs

414
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,920
It's really amazing

415
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,920
It is

416
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,720
Painting aside, his face is the same as always

417
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,130
He cried

418
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,560
He made a sound

419
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,900
END

420
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,900
THE

421
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,170
And it's over

422
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,470
Let's call him here

423
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,640
His posture has always been bent

424
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,040
I wonder if his back is gonna be ok

425
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,510
That must have been tiring

426
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,350
I'm dead tired

427
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,680
That was really...

428
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,350
Worth 9000 yen

429
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,350
I agree

430
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,060
Was his act the closest to 9000 yen?

431
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,060
Yes, it was

432
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,660
Our next challenger

433
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,230
Is Iwao from Football Hour, please come in!

434
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,630
Iwao too?

435
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,700
Looks like he did something

436
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,340
Football Hour

437
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,340
Iwao Nozomu

438
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,510
Look how elegant he is!

439
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,040
I have a sort of bad feeling about this

440
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,510
That was such a bold choice

441
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,510
What is this?

442
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,750
I'm a shoebill, it's a bird

443
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,550
Why did you choose this?

444
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,720
You see, the shoebill

445
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,490
Has a certain major feature to it

446
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,830
And I felt a sort of sympathy to that

447
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,460
Don't tell us now what it is

448
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,460
That's what I want to show you

449
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,600
I see, I see

450
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,000
Makes sense

451
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:31,010
(Football Hour)

452
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:31,010
Entry no. 5

453
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:31,010
Iwao Nozomu

454
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:31,010
Shoebill

455
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:31,010
Shoebill

456
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,770
Next up is Iwao, from Football Hour

457
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,770
He felt something close to this bird

458
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,340
But what will it be?

459
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,580
Serious and accurate animal: start!

460
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:43,090
filmed with a night vision camera

461
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:55,770
Shoebill

462
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:55,770
Shoebill

463
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,380
From where will he pop out?

464
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,790
He's standing up like normal

465
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,790
He's standing...

466
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,530
That's a person

467
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,260
It's more a human than a bird

468
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,830
But the way he's slowing moving its feet

469
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,200
It's so realistic

470
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:03,110
They walk slowly and calmly

471
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:03,110
They're

472
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,910
Isn't it kinda creepy?

473
00:16:03,510 --> 00:17:34,530
Shoebill

474
00:16:03,510 --> 00:17:34,530
Shoebill

475
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,710
It's frightening

476
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,720
I mean, if I'd saw this on a security camera I would freak out

477
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,990
It's not moving at all

478
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,360
Is it a calm animal?

479
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,490
Yes, the shoebills...

480
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,730
Are a type of bird which barely even moves

481
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,360
It doesn't move much

482
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,360
They're

483
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,760
But it doesn't look like a bird at all

484
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,430
You're right

485
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,770
What the hell

486
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,000
Seriously, what is this?

487
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,640
He's just standing there!

488
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,780
But they really can stay still for several hours

489
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,710
I want to see the real ones now

490
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,710
I swear they're like this!

491
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,750
If they move around

492
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,320
Their shadow on the water would move too, and fishes would swim away

493
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,230
Oh, I see

494
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,650
That's why they barely move around

495
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,020
They just try to stay still

496
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,490
And they're quick when it comes to catch them?

497
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,490
Yes, they quickly jump for it

498
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,130
So it's aiming at something

499
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,130
It's looking at them

500
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,330
So he can catch them

501
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,330
We may be able to see

502
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,960
A scene where he'll attack

503
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,430
Maybe he's full

504
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,470
He's enduring it

505
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,870
But it seems to be aiming at something

506
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,910
To me it looks like it

507
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:07,910
Is it?

508
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,910
But really, they can stay like this

509
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,010
For such a long time

510
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,310
Yeah but... what's this?

511
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,510
Yeah but... what's this?

512
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,280
It spread its wings

513
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
That's unusual

514
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,280
Yeah it is

515
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,920
These movements

516
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,790
He flapped its wings

517
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,120
He moved, the fishes went away

518
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,120
Yes

519
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,360
What is he doing now?

520
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,360
This movement

521
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,900
He's making sounds by hitting stuff with its beak

522
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,600
This is clattering

523
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,510
Clattering

524
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,510
Making sounds with your own beak in order to threat
or communicate with the others

525
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,510
im gonna have nightmares about this guy i'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooo sure of itttttttt you wont believvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv meeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

526
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,510
im gonna have nightmares about this guy i'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooo sure of itttttttt you wont believvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv meeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

527
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,510
smol guy

528
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,400
Clattering...?

529
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,700
Yes, yes, yes

530
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,100
What the heck is this

531
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,670
With this

532
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,140
They can threat enemies or even

533
00:17:42,840 --> 00:18:04,060
Shoebill

534
00:17:42,840 --> 00:18:04,060
Shoebill

535
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,880
Communicate with others through sounds

536
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,350
That was clattering just now

537
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,980
He went too hard on it and placed his beak back with his hands

538
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,620
He went too hard on it and placed his beak back with his hands

539
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,050
That's all he could do, even the rubber band...

540
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,050
Right

541
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,790
It fell down

542
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,060
Because he did that

543
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,660
He couldn't do much

544
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,060
That's all he could have done

545
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,260
It cried

546
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,460
Yes, it cried

547
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,470
END

548
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,470
THE

549
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,600
And it's over

550
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,200
I must say, you really put a lot of effort during the first half

551
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,010
Where you had to stay still for so long

552
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,040
That was so good

553
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,540
It was incredible

554
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,810
But there's a problem

555
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,810
Yeah

556
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,680
The clattering

557
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,680
Clattering

558
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,950
After you did it you moved your hands like this, why?

559
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,890
He couldn't use his fingers!

560
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,890
Right?

561
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,120
Here's our last challenger

562
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,120
Oh, the last one?

563
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,430
Haranishi from FUJIWARA

564
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,930
Please come in

565
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,960
Takayuki Haranishi

566
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,230
And here he is...

567
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,230
Again...

568
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,140
Please do your best

569
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,140
It's easy to get this

570
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,600
That's right, please tell us

571
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,410
I'm a sea lion

572
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,410
A sea lion

573
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,310
I actually want to become a sea lion, someday

574
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,610
I actually want to become a sea lion, someday

575
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,810
Is this a bombshell announcement?

576
00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:02,850
Sea Lion

577
00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:02,850
Sea Lion

578
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:02,850
Entry no. 6

579
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:02,850
Takayuki Haranishi

580
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,020
Haranishi from FUJIWARA is our last one

581
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,080
He chose the well-known sea lion

582
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,650
The star of aquariums!

583
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,520
Serious and accurate animal: start!

584
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:56,240
Sea lion

585
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:56,240
l

586
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,760
How will he...?

587
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,700
How will he enter the stage?

588
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,470
Here he comes!

589
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,470
Of course he went for that!

590
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,910
That's amazing!

591
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,910
So natural

592
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,740
Incredible

593
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,410
He's pulling out a great sea lion

594
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,180
He really can do it

595
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,180
And he's not even wet

596
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,550
That's incredible

597
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,980
It's really amazing

598
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,790
He's doing something

599
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,790
You can't do it without physical ability

600
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,070
I thought he would have gone "ou ou" first

601
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,270
Sea lions do smile, actually

602
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:03,310
They can show a smiling expression

603
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:03,310
here comes the sea lion | a smile on his face | just look at him smilin' | with his nightmare gaze

604
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,910
They really do it

605
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,910
They make that face?

606
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:03,810
Their expressions are great, that was really on-point

607
00:20:03,650 --> 00:21:09,410
Sea lion

608
00:20:03,650 --> 00:21:09,410
l

609
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,220
Why is it shouting now?

610
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,200
They usually shout to mark their territory

611
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,640
You sure it didn't get involved in an accident?

612
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,300
That's impressive!

613
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,870
Do they cry so much?

614
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,870
That's an amazing cry

615
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,210
He's still going

616
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,360
That's really something

617
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Incredible

618
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,930
Is he done?

619
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,700
Maybe he'll roll around now

620
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,700
Was that... his final cry?

621
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,570
Was that his last one?

622
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,340
He cried so much he's completely done

623
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,270
He wanted it to end

624
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,540
That's how much he shouted

625
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,540
You think so?

626
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,540
Must be it

627
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,210
Was that your final cry?

628
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,880
Alright then, it's over!

629
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,050
END

630
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,050
THE

631
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,720
He cried too much

632
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,890
So it was an ending cry...

633
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,990
He was too tired

634
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,690
Everyone did their best

635
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,530
They really did, didn't they?

636
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,530
Yup!

637
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,690
But we're not actually done yet...

638
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,430
For our grand finale we'll have them all on stage together

639
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,000
All of them?

640
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,700
All of them will be present

641
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,770
Coming next

642
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,770
Will their final appeal time result in trouble!?

643
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
So get ready everyone!

644
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:46,500

647
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,550
Here we are, it's time for our final show

648
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,730
Amazing, huh?

649
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,730
This is incredible

650
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,230
That's unlikely

651
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,230
Yeah, very improbable

652
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,300
It's a miracle they're not brawling

653
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,300
You're right

654
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,000
Not even the cheetah is attacking

655
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,000
That's right

656
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,500
Huh?

657
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,500
Oh

658
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,210
Something came

659
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,710
Danson!

660
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,210
Fiizaki!

661
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,010
Tooza teesaza konsa!

662
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,240
What the hell?

663
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,610
Danson!

664
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,020
Bambino

665
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,020
Fujita Yuuki

666
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,020
Ishiyama Daisuke

667
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,180
Fiizaki!

668
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,350
Tooza teesaza konsa!

669
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,250
What's going on?

670
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,170
Nibura!

671
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,860
Danson!

672
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,490
Fiizaki!

673
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,460
Tooza tee-- nibura!

674
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,760
Is he going to...?

675
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,030
What the hell!

676
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,100
Danson! Fiizaki!

677
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,230
He's getting them one after another

678
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,770
Tooza-- nibura!

679
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,170
He's going really fast

680
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,210
He quickly gets to "nibura"!

681
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,340
He's quick

682
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,910
That's a double!

683
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,310
He's getting em all one by one

684
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,110
Danson!

685
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,650
What's going on...?

686
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,650
Tiisaki!

687
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,610
It's the cheetah

688
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,550
I wonder if it's gonna get caught too

689
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,650
Toosa tee-- nibura!

690
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,230
Ok everyone, come back he~re

691
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,200
The winner is going to be revealed!

692
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,130
And so, who acted the best as an animal between them?

693
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,070
Have you made up your mind, Matsumoto?

694
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,070
Yes

695
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,240
So, can you tell us

696
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,470
Who is today's winner?

697
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,110
Yes of course, the winner is...

698
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,110
Please!

699
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,410
Bambino

700
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:26,620
Winner: Bambino

701
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,180
W-wait...

702
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,180
Bambino is our winner

703
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,620
In the end they won

704
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,420
That last bit was really something

705
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,090
I think it was the best part

706
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,090
You got em all good

707
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,090
All of them

708
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,090
Let me count them just a sec

709
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,090
Oh, ok

710
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,930
3, 4, 5...

711
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,260
You're giving those now...?

712
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,180
Right in front of us?

713
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,500
I really liked you on King of Conto too

714
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,740
That worked way better than you're probably thinking

715
00:23:48,730 --> 00:24:09,790
