19
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,750
I can't blame the audience to be this excited

COCORICO
Shozo Engo                    Naoki Tanaka

Housei Yamasaki

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Tanaka, sorry, but next time !

24
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,020
You too, you too !

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,390
This event takes place in a hospital this year

26
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,810
What's ironic is that one of us was actually hospitalized before we filmed

27
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,700
*Yamasaki had been hospitalized for gastroenteritis

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,020
I had to head right back to the hospital

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,500
Do you realize how serious it is to have a hole in your intestine ?

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,760
For real

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,910
What, what ?!

32
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,630
Is that it?

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,980
Thank you very much

34
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,300
I'm all better now

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
How boring!

A Bus Arrives at

38
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,580
Wow, it's cold

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,450
It's always this freakin' cold
- Freezing !

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,800
That sign says to wait here

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,000
"WAIT HERE !"

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,870
Why do we gotta wait here?
- We're at the hospital

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,690
Hey
Hey !

44
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,300
DOWNTOWN FORMER MANAGER
Hiroshi Fujiwara

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,830
I can't stop
Help me !

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,940
Close call
I could have been HOSPITALIZED

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Not funny

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
You ready ?

49
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,980
I'll be your advisor
My name is Fujiwara

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,700
Shouldn't you be speaking more feminine ?

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,900
As a female nurse,
Don't you think you should act more feminine?

52
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,720
Anyway, Matsumoto

53
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
What do you think of Florence Nightingale ?

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,000
No doubt she was a great person
as many of us have learned

55
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,300
Why are you so serious ?
Aren't you supposed to be funny ?

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,200
He says that every time

57
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,780
You know they can help you
at this hospital

58
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,320
You're saying even if I'm unfunny,
the doctor can cure me ?

59
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,370
Exactly

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,640
Here's where you will be working

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,200
Gah-Soo Black Luster Memorial Hospital

62
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,400
*Gah-Soo is the nickname for one of the producers

63
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,100
Too funny, isn't it ?

64
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,200
What do you think, Hamada?
-I guess

65
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,800
Why aren't you laughing ?

66
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,400
Yeah, it's kinda funny
-I laughed a bit

67
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,640
They can help you with that here

68
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,100
at this HOSPITAL

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,760
I couldn’t help but notice
you've been trying to make puns with the word "hospital"

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,300
But it's not working

71
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,390
Hey ! Guys listen !

72
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,300
How UNcoordinated is this guy ?

73
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,330
"Do Not Laugh Here"
at the
Gah-Soo Black Luster Memorial Hospital

74
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:24,580
Laughter Over the Lives of Patients at this Hospital,
Can They Fend off the Attackers for 24 Hours ?!

75
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,420
You guys need to change

76
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,170
Go over to the fitting room

77
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,800
and put on the uniform

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Change into Appropriate Attire !

79
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,300
Let me know when you're ready

80
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,000
You all ready ?
-Ready

81
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,690
I'm calling you out one by one

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,660
Yamasaki

83
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,320
Yamasaki - A Cute Nurse

84
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,870
Next is Endo

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,020
Fits the character well

86
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,400
Endo - Handsome Nurse

87
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,600
You'll make a good nurse for sure

88
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,740
Tanaka - An Average Nurse

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,500
Matsumoto - Nice Legs

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,500
Hamada Gets the Short Skirt

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,360
Too sexy for work

92
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,710
It's freakin' cold

93
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,220
Where are your socks ?

94
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,630
What the hell...?

95
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,390
Sort of perverted...

96
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,900
Let's get going

97
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,000
I want my socks !

98
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,970
This way
Watch out for the cars

99
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,160
Let me explain the rules

100
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,600

Work as Nurses for 24 hours

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,650

Do Not Laugh While at the Hospital

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,150
3rd Rule
Severe Punishment upon breaking the 2nd Rule

103
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,470
Your work begins as you cross the gate

104
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,950
Damn..
It's gonna be a LONG day...

105
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,820
Longest day ever

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm cold

107
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Let's go then

108
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,840
Hamada, don't be saying you're cold and stuff once we're inside

109
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,000
And stop crossing your legs like a girl !

110
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,760
Don't try to make us laugh

111
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,090
At least you guys have socks on
I got nothing to keep me warm

112
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,140
Hamada Gets the Garter Belt

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,190
Why are you wearing that ?

114
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,620
Why are you...?

115
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,000
You would wear just about ANYTHING, wouldn't you ?

116
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,770
Alright, once you cross the gate,
the game begins

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,290
On the count of three

118
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,230
One, two, three !

119
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,000
"DO NOT LAUGH AT THE HOSPITAL"

120
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,500
Big Hospital, isn't it ?

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,500
Almost too grand, I'd say

122
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,900
Wait

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,920
Here comes an ambulance
Let's move over

124
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,220
Patient in Need of Immediate Attention !

125
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,690
Patient's Husband
Tatsuo Umemiya

126
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,000
Patient
Claudia

127
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,000
What's her status ?

128
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,250
Cardiopulmonary arrest, sir

129
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,000
Claudia !

130
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,300
Claudia !!

131
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,890
Claudia !!!

132
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, that was his real wife

133
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,030
4th Rule:
Swift Butt Slap from the Nurses in Black

134
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,450
That was really unfair
-Seriously

135
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,580
Not cool at all

136
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,160
That was some scream though

137
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,160
"Claudia !!!"

138
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,800
Sounded like
"Gaudia !!"

139
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,990
It's already not fair

140
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,700
Here's a bronze statue of our
first hospital trustee

141
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,570
Suga-Chin-gale

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,380
I see

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,820
Oh

144
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,530
That sign over there needs to be turned around

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,740
Endo, why don't you go fix that quick

146
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,830
Me?
-Yes, you

147
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,850
Hurry up

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
Run for it

149
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,300
How do you NOT laugh at that ?

150
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,600
Boobie Trap

151
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,300
This isn't right !

152
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,890
This is not what I was expecting
This is the wrong way to get a laugh

153
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,300
I still say this is the wrong approach

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,100
Seriously, Endo is
Endo is...

155
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,320
I sure didn't see that coming

156
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,860
I was trying not to look at the sign because
I thought something on it would make me laugh

157
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,200
And when I looked,
Endo had vanished !

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You completely disappeared

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,070
Can you get out ?
-Got it

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Translation by Shibatabread
www.shibatabread.com

161
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Look, the sign says to watch out for the pit

162
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,280
This isn't funny

163
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,560
It's a criminal act, isn't it?

164
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,130
Total criminal

165
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,390
They hid the hole with leaves and everything

166
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,600
You had no idea, didn't you ?

167
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,790
Zero idea

168
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,800
The way you fell was not normal

169
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,260
You just disappeared
Poof !

170
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,100
Pretty crazy

171
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,870
Wait a minute !

172
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,900
What the hell are we hanging around here for?
What is this awkward pause?

173
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,400
Why the awkward pause ?

174
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,400
What's this awkwardness of us standing around the pit ?

175
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,710
Let's get going

176
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,250
That was something else

177
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,010
Look at this production

178
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,790
They're spending big bucks for this

179
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,500
Come this way

180
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,860
Over here

181
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,550
Let me introduce to you our receptionist

182
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,270
Receptionist
Ms. Reiko

183
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,630
I'll give you a little tidbits about this hospital

184
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,700
So this hospital is called the Black Luster Hospital

185
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,710
Peanuts

186
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,210
You know why it's called the "Black Luster?"

187
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,780
You've heard our first trustee, Kenji Suga ?

188
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,050
I heard he had rather dark skin

189
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,040
I guess that's how we got the name "Black Luster"

190
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,970
Dont' be laughing, Fujiwara!
--Yeah! he shouldn't be laughing!

191
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,930
Advidor Fujiwara can't help the Laughter

192
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
Listen up

193
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:27,240
Dr. Suga was actually a pretty good doctor, too

194
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,340
And as this hospital became.......

195
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,020
Gonna be a long day!

196
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,340
Did you guys get all that?
-Yes

197
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,700
I didn't get a word she said
-No idea

198
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,820
Inside is pretty big, too

199
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,490
Are they open ?

200
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,290
Yes, it's open

201
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,560
Where are the patients ?

202
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:25,820
Announcement:

203
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,910
Please stand as the doctor of internal medicine makes his rounds

204
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:34,320
Doctor Making His Rounds

205
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,700
Doctor of Internal Medicine:
Touru Emori

206
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,500
And the status of the patient in room 205 ?

207
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,240
Stable, sir

208
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,310
His numbers are showing progress

209
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,980
Matsumoto's older brother

210
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,590
I had no idea my brother was here

211
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,260
....and this was proven at a medical conference in the States

212
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,930
The rest is up to the patient's will to recover

213
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,770
Your brother has nothing to do with this

214
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,360
He had cool cap on

215
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,000
I almost lost it when I saw Mr. Emori

216
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,930
And who's behind him ?

217
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,570
Dr. Emori sure is charismatic

218
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,570
Let's move on

219
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,040
I wish he'd said something

220
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,540
This way to the Hospital Director's office

221
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,510
Don't forget to introduce yourselves

222
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,200
The Director's not even here

223
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,020
Keep going, keep going

224
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,290
Tanning Bed

225
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,560
Where's the director at  ?

226
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,340
Tanning bed opens

227
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,550
Director
Sonny Chiba

228
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,920
Why did he agreed to do this gig ??

229
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,630
Thank you for coming

230
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,610
I'm the director, Chiba

231
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,790
This guy hits hard

232
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,490
Director, please spare me from your awkward pauses

233
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,160
Thank you for coming

234
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,170

235
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,140
I'm Yamasaki

236
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,180
I'm Endo

237
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,840
Thank you so much for coming

238
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,300
Anyhow

239
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,020
Tanaka Gets Ignored

240
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,620
We all know that our health and safety is the number one priority

241
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,860
With that in mind, I'm giving each one of you a physical

242
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,600
Spread your feet to about shoulder length

243
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Stand up straight

244
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,230
Excuse me

245
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,650
What the hell just happened ??

246
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,080
That wasn't right

247
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,020
This is ridiculous

248
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,130
Part your legs

249
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,720
Well, I guess you guys are in good health

250
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,000
As you start your new career here

251
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,400
There will be some questions and issues

252
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,070
Don't hesitate to shoot me an email

253
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,880
Here's my email address
Very easy to remember

254
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,360
That is all

255
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,470
Good job
You're dismissed

256
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,880
Thank you, sir

257
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,380
Are we good to go ?

258
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,120
Thanks again

259
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,120
You got dissed, Tanaka

260
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,390
You got no hug

261
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,300
You two laugh too much

262
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,260
Did you just laugh ?

263
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,630
Hell no
Don't be starting that

264
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,970
Hamada Shows Off His Garter Belt

265
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,090
Let's not do that again, ok ?

266
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,060
Will you try not to bend over too much
so that thing doesn't show, please ?

267
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,000
Did you always have such nice legs ?

268
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,200
His ankles are perky, too

269
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,970
Over here will be your assigned station

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000

271
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,340
You will all be working together in there

272
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,260
I can't get warm around here

273
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,450
Are there any other nurses around ?
--Yes, they're here

274
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,620
Come this way

275
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,700
Look at the setup in here

276
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,770
Are we gonna be ok here ?

277
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,650
Find your name and sit down

278
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,060
Nice and warm in here

279
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,440
Have a seat

280
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,320
Look for your names

281
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,740
I found mine

282
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,990
Let's go
Have a seat

283
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,820
Hamada is Reluctant to Sit

284
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,830
I see lots of cameras around

285
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,840
Hamada Sits on the Rocking horse

286
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,220
Everyone's in their seats ?

287
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,960
Hey Hamada

288
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,310
That looks like fun

289
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,900
Not really

290
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,930
Yea, looks like fun

291
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,600
You may be having a bit too much fun

292
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,310
Ok, I'm gonna have each of you

293
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,390
spit out some rules of this hospital

294
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,520
to the beat of some music

295
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
What?

296
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,370
You're gonna rap
to lighten things up a little

297
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,490
Here are some lyrics

298
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,020
Rap?
-Yes, rap

299
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,850
Are we ready ?

300
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,520
Ok, start the music

301
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,410
Yo, yo. I'm the advisor, Fujiwara

302
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,220
I'm the happiest rapper in the hospital

303
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:07,970
Why don't all you nurses
let me hear you rap ?

304
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:13,970
MC Shozo
Tell us all about the hours of operation

305
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:22,300
Yo, yo ! I'm MC Shozo
Born in Shikoku, a perverted rapper
Hours of operation are 8 to 5

306
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,340
Unless of course, you have an emergency
then we be making lots of dough

307
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,300
Ok, how about MC Hosei ?

308
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,470
Let's hear about our insurance policy

309
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,300
Yo, yo! I'm MC Hosei
Call me a feeble and ignorant rapper

310
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,130
First time here? Or back again ?
Know who's into fishing ? Hiroki Matsukata

311
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,730
First check-up or monthly check-up
No insurance, you're going to hell

312
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,400
Hosei, you gotta do it over
Stand up this time

313
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,380
Yo, yo ! I'm MC Hosei
Call me a feeble and ignorant rapper

314
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,860
First time here? Or back again ?
Know who's into fishing ? Hiroki Matsukata

315
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,260
First check-up or monthly check-up
No insurance, you're going to hell

316
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,400
What does all this mean ?

317
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,840
What's it mean ?

318
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,120
Hamada Shows Off His Garter-Belt

319
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,050
Let's move on

320
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,000
Start the music

321
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,460
Ok, how about MC Tanaka ?

322
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,680
Tell us about the Visiting Hours

323
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,070
Yo, yo ! I'm MC Naoki

324
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,500
I am a hairy and filthy rapper

325
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:11,220
Visiting time is from 9 to 6
Everyone is happy, like it's party time

326
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:16,670
We welcome all your family and friends
especially those from Shibuya

327
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:23,770
Let's move on to MC Hitoshi

328
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,300
Tell us about our smoking policy

329
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,300
Yo, yo ! I'm MC Hitoshi

330
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,950
Can't get married, a lonely rapper

331
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,390
Smoking is only allowed in designated areas
Hold your ashtray in one hand, you'll look cool

332
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:43,180
If I catch you smoking anywhere else,
I'll beat you up, bad boy

333
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,000
MC Masatoshi, you ready ?

334
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,300
Um....Let's see....

335
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,500
Well....

336
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,300
Um.....

337
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,240
Ok, ok

338
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,390
You don't remember anything, do you ?

339
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,960
How do you guys not laugh at that ?

340
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,600
Start the music !

341
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,640
Tell us about our cell phone policy

342
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,340
Yo, yo ! I'm MC Masatoshi

343
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,270
I got fat lips and I'm a greedy rapper

344
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,340
Don't use a cell phone in the hospital
Sensitive machines are everywhere

345
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,900
Radio waves can mess up the machines
So show my lips some respect

346
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,310
That definitely lifted our spirits

347
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,580
Let's keep this up

348
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,960
We'll take a little break

349
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,630
Good job

350
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,640
It's gonna be another long day

351
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,440
What time is it ?

352
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,270
I don't think you should be asking that

353
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,470
There's No Clock in the Room

354
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,250
I got a lot of dirt in my head

355
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,670
Wipe off the dirt on your shirt, too

356
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,900
Endo falling into the pit was incredible

357
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,650
That was nuts
--Yeah

358
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,490
You're really filthy right now
-- I know

359
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,000
A Dead Leaf

360
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,440
Don't be looking at me thinking
I would find that to be funny

361
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,640
Why don't you take care of your own leaf business ?

362
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:01,600
Why do you have to be all
"Hey ! Check me out ! I found me a dead leaf ! "

363
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,370
Can't you be more civil ?

364
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,590
Give me some funny props, too !!

365
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,970
There's something in this drawer

366
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,220
Yeah, why wouldn't it ?

367
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,030
I'm sure of it

368
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,720
Did you look in ?

369
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,740
No

370
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,810
I know there's something in it though

371
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,940
Ah, the drawer

372
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,010
Why don't you look in it ?

373
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,730
It's gonna bug me if you don't

374
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,200
Can we look in ?

375
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,340
It's Matsumoto's drawer,
why doesn't he open it?

376
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,340
Well...

377
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,300
Feels like there's lot of crap in here
--Open it

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,760
Serious ?
I thought I made it through

380
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,440
I'm finding this to be unfair

381
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,270
Why are they getting my family involved ?

382
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,080
Hey, why don't you look in ?

383
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,410
Really ?
I busted out even without looking in

384
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,040
Why don't all of you look in one by one ?

385
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,190
Which drawer is it ?

386
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,210
Too many drawers here

387
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,660
I'll make this easy
Here's what I got

391
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,790
Can I put this away ?

392
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,270
Did you see the title ?
--Title's the killer

393
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:18,300
"Hey Hitoshi,
Do you Recall These??"

394
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,650
Title's worse than the photo

395
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,240
I mean why can't he say that to my face ?
Why go through a book ?

396
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,600
Let me see what's in my drawer

397
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,900
Empty

398
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,780
What the hell ?

399
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,390
I can appreciate that approach

400
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,580
Why do you gotta always ask me ?

401
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,080
I know the drawer is empty
You don't need to look at me for the approval

402
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,200
A Pen

403
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,470
Tanaka, open yours
--Yes

404
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:50,000
Set of Promotional Cards for the Hospital
Model : Chiaki

405
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,870
Model Chiaki was married to Endo at the time of this shooting

406
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,280
Exactly when did she take this gig ?

407
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,790
She somehow snuck behind you to take these photos

408
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:48,630
Last night, she told me she has nothing to do with today's program

409
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,560
Well, she definitely took these photos for this program

410
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,720
You know this would NOT have been as funny
had I not opened first

411
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,190
Whoever set this up is very lucky

412
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,890
They knew that I would open the drawer first

413
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,840
I don't believe it would have been funny
had we opened the drawer with pen in it first

414
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,850
Tanaka, your turn

415
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,390
A Mysterious Envelope

416
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,200
What's this ?

417
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,840
Something’s in it
--Something
--Yeah

418
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:41,200
A Photo of Comedian Shofukutei Shohei
at the Age 3

419
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,200
That is one ugly kid

420
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,120
We don't need to look anymore
--But there's two more photos in here

421
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,960
Yeah, we gotta look at the rest

422
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:26,650
At the Age 16

423
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,220
Shut the hell up !

424
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,160
Check him out

425
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,110
Damn...
Look at those pants and boots

426
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,220
What's this on his waist?

427
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:58,760
At the Age 15

428
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,000
This is an awesome pic, isn't it ?

429
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,300
Seriously, chcke out this photo !!

430
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,900
An amazing photo

431
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,260
Whoever took that photo should be slapped

432
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,770
Just as he's about to kick the ball...

433
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,090
Look at the apartment behind him
--Pretty shady

434
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,020
His face was skinny then

435
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,050
This isn't fair

436
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,240
These are some hilarious pics

437
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,930
Let's put them back

438
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,390
We don't need to see them again
--Or we can look at them again around 3am

439
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,790
How did he get that tight curl on his head
--Unbelievable

440
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,830
It's been one hour

441
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,400
Time for a break

442
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,120
But there's still more stuff left in the drawers !!

443
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,100
A Mysterious Push-Button

444
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,460
It says "Do not push"

445
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:13,000
"Do not push !"

446
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,640
Freaky, isn't it ?
--Yeah

447
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,910
Do they mean don't press the button ?

448
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,340
It's just a button

449
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,500
It was in your drawer
You deal with it

450
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,830
Nobody has to deal with this
Let me just put it away

451
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,240
What are you laughing at ?

452
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,050
Huh ?

453
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,850
Why don't you push it in once ?

454
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,780
It'll make me feel better

455
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,210
It's bugging us

456
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,590
Once you do it,
it'll be alright

457
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Is he OUT everytime I push this thing?

458
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,410
Wait a minute

459
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,580
That's impossible

460
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,710
Had you not laughed at that,
you would have been alright

461
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,320
That's my guess

462
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,720
Otherwise, this machine is ridiculous

463
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,860
You could potentially get whooped 3 times
when the button is pushed 3 times

464
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,160
No way !
Absolutely not !

465
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,080
Let's just try it then

466
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,970
Wait a sec !

467
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,300
This is not right !

468
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,400
Why do you gotta be so freakin' dramatic !?

469
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,100
Yamasaki Hides the Push-Button

470
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,200
You asked for it

471
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,460
So you DO get slapped everytime

472
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,580
You're too dramatic

473
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,280
No, I'm not !!

474
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,550
Can't you be less dramatic ?
--Seriously, I'm not !!

475
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,880
You asked me to push it
--No sir, I didn't

476
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,460
You did, too
I told you I didn't want it

477
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,670
What ??
There's more ?!!

478
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,090
This isn't the one we just had ?

479
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,250
There was another one in here

480
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,000
Let's see if there's more
Damn, nothing

481
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,390
What the hell are you doing ?

482
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,090
What do you think you're doing ?

483
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,240
Give me that

484
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,000
All the times I took crap from you

485
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,100
There's no more push-buttons anywhere ?

486
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,420
There's gotta be more

487
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,400
All Five Starts to Look for the Push-Button

488
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,670
Are there one for each of us?

491
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,890
A Pen

492
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,290
That pen rolled out nicely

493
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,950

Come outside for the daily morning exercise

496
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,070
Damn, isn't it chilly outside ?

497
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Morning exercise ?
--Right now ?
--Seriously ?

498
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,630
It's gonna be freezing out

499
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,610
I can already tell it's cold outside

500
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,960
Yeah, it's cold
--Freezing

501
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,300

00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,910
Good morning, everyone

507
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:51,720
Before we get to the daily morning exercise,
let me make a couple of site wide announcements

508
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,570
First, the director has an announcement

509
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,340
Please, director

510
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,580
Good morning, everyone

511
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,270
There's been a change in my email address

512
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,010
Here's my new email address

513
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,340
Did you get all that ?

514
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,960
Very good then

515
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,490
Thank you, director

516
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:43,910
We installed a comments box for our patients
and here are some of the comments we have received so far

517
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,430
First One
Doctor Matsushima was yawning during my medical checkup

518
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,370
Second
Doctor Ohnuki was talking on his cell phone rather loudly

519
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,000
Those are the two comments we received recently

520
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,660
Those two doctors,
please come up the stage

521
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:18,950
In order to eliminate future misconduct,
we're implementing disciplinary actions right away
Doctor Chono, please go ahead

522
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,290
God Dammit !!

523
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:27,390
Do you losers have any idea what this hospital is all about ?

524
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,190
Why the hell are you up here ?

525
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,780
I was yawning
--Yawning ??

526
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,500
Man up !

527
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,060
Hand of Discipline Solves the Problem !!

528
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,610
This is out of control

529
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,500
And what the hell did you do ?

530
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:10,520
I was talking on my phone...
--You were loudly talking on the phone, jackass !!

531
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,510
Man up, jerk !

532
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,770
I didn't think he'd actually slap him

533
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,290
I've never seen an elderly getting slapped like that

534
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:39,100
Dude, my head
Did you hit my head ?

535
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,700
Don't let this ever happen again !

536
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,510
There is one more announcement

537
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:53,300
Doctor Chono's cherished handkerchief has been
stolen from his possession

538
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,640
Missing Doctor Chono's Handkerchief !!

539
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,730
This is what it would look like

540
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,450
I ask each one of you to check your coats,  please

541
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,230
Whomever has this handkerchief
would be the prime suspect

542
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,460
Thank God

543
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,900
Suspect Found !

544
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,100
Step forward

545
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,960
Step forward

546
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:29,600
You !

547
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,040
Come up here !!

548
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,260
Why the hell do you have it ?

549
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,160
I don't know

550
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:38,790
Come up here now !!

551
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:44,400
A Slap to the Suspect Is Warranted !!

552
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,280
Why the hell do you have that ?

553
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,500
I don't know
I'm really sorry
but I don't know

554
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,660
Are you lying to me?
--No sir, I really don't know how this happened

555
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,100
Who put this in my pocket ?

556
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,580
I'm sorry
Give me a minute

557
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,560
Seriously, which one of you put this in my pocket ?

558
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,190
Man, is he irritating !!
Just get it over with !

559
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,510
Who wants to switch with me ?

560
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,200
Please switch with me ?

561
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,800
I'm sorry

562
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,170
Where are your muscle and gall?

563
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,810
Am I gonna be OK?

564
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,710
I got a hole in my intestine

565
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,030
No worries, you're in the hospital

566
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,650
But this isn't real

567
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,230
Are you saying this isn't real ?!

568
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,360
What the hell are here for then ?!

569
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,360
I'm really scared !

570
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,590
Just get over it !!
-- Hurry up and do it

571
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:06,220
*Yamasaki had been hospitalized for Gastrointestitis

572
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,500
Seriously, will you just get it over, please?

573
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,510
I got a bad feeling about this

574
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,730
I will never let this happen

575
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,000
Just let me off the hook this time
--But you stole it

576
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,990
I won't let it happen again, I swear !
I'm sorry ! Just let me go !

577
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,500
I'm really sorry !

578
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,800
Do you want to keep working ?

579
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,540
I will work like a dog

580
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:31,770
Man up !

581
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:32,930
Please no!
--Quiet !

582
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,520
Nooooooo !!

583
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,090
Hurry the hell up !
Get it done !

584
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:47,540
This is taking way too long !!

585
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,260
I'm not kiddin' around, guys!

586
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,600
Just do it

587
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,280
Get slapped now

588
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,570
Just once, that's it

589
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,840
I gotta honor the system

590
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,250
I'd just been hospitalized

591
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:09,250
Hospitalized ?

592
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,410
That's none of my business

593
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,580
No ?

594
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:16,390
I'm still feeling under the weather

595
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,100
I can't "Man up"

596
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,310
I'm really sorry, please forgive me !

597
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,200
He wanted to get out of this for real

598
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,330
May I proceed ?

599
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,470
Please proceed

600
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,940
I got it

601
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,680
Any options left ?

602
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:33,900
I'm afraid not

603
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,520
Alright, man up!

604
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,800
Please don't hit my stomach

605
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,870
Don't worry
--It'll be right here

606
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,200
The Moment of Justice Being Served !!

607
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,330
This is hilarious

608
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,350
How do those behind him not laugh at that ?!

609
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:41,540
He just became an old man !

610

611
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:09,550
Let's begin our
morning exercises

612
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,120
Let's spread out so we can all participate

613
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,920
Here's today's intructor

614
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,080
Morning Exercise Instructor
Egashira 2:50

615
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,660
He got even skinnier

616
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,680
God, is he thin !

617
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,320
He somehow lost more weight

618
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,760
Please follow the instructor's lead

619
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,640
Let us begin

620
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,630
"Radio exercise part one"
"Three, two, one"

621
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:59,840
Original Radio Exercise

622
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,270
Let's start with some flexing
and vocal exercises

623
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,040
Move to the side

624
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,710
That's enough

625
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,310
How'd you not laugh at that ?

626
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,690
Thank you, Mr. Egashira

627
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,350
With that, we conclude our daily morning exercise

628
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,120
Dismissed

629
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,660
Where'd they all come from anyway ?

630
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,320
I didn't see any of them inside

631
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,160
What the....

632
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:27,300
Red Hot Convertible !!

633
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,000
Dr. "Playboy"
Michael Tomioka

634
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,540
What's your schedule like today ?

635
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:41,800
Let's see...
Oh, I'll be doing an open heart surgery

636
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,120
Are you free tonight, doctor ?

637
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,000
Tonight ?
Do you wanna go out ?

638
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,350
Ok, I'll be right there

639
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,400
This is definitely NOT cool

640
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,880
That was Michael, wasn't it ?

641
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:25,350
It must be tough to be that popular

642
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,000
I totally didn't see that coming

643
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,260
This production team would do ANYTHING
It's scary

644
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,300
Really scary

645
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:35,600
Only 2 Hours have passed
Are they giving up already?!!

646
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:39,600
The "Laughing Hell" has just begun !!

647
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,840
So the day kicked off with Mr. Tatsuo

648
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:48,860
We didn't think his wife would be with him
It's a husband and wife tag team

649
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,000
And her name is Claudia ??

650
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:54,000
What's wrong with that ?
--It's too long

651
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:58,630
What about when your brother was walking around with the doctors?

652
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,760
This production team is very smart

653
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,700
First they made me focus on Mr. Emori

654
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:06,750
And I was like,
"Oh, I can make it through this without laughing"

655
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,590
Then I looked behind him and I was like,

656
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,720
"I know this guy !"

657
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,500
"I've seen him before!"

658
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,000
"I believe we lived together for a long time !"

659
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,700
A lot happened but...

660
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,280
Yamasaki takes the cake...

661
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,290
You played really dirty

662
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:28,250
I seriously tried my best to get out of it

663
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,260
Remember how I had a hole in my intestine ?

664
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,990
Well, I thought if I got slapped hard,
it would burst

665
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:36,600
Yeah, my whole stomach !!

666
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,900
You were all,
"Please don't hit my stomach"

667
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,000
There's no way he would have hit you there !!

668
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:44,800
Did you see any of them getting slapped on their stomachs ?!!

669
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,500
Freakin' nonsense !!

670
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:52,260
11:00am
Only 2 hours since the start of their shift

671
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,350
Both members of the "over-the-hill" Downtown duo seem exhausted

672
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,410
Who are you calling "over-the-hill ?"

673
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:05,170
Did your ear ring when you got hit?

674
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,670
My ear rang and now this side of my head hurts
--For real ?

675
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:19,190
Hamada, you always look like you're laughing

676
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,250
If I looked like that,
I'd get butt-slapped for it by the nurses

677
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:24,960
I beg to differ

678
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:27,350
I think Yamasaki looks like he's laughing

679
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,410
I don't think so

680
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,350
Seriously, you're kinda snickering now

681
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:32,600
Seriously, you're kinda snickering now

682
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,600
Huh ?

683
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:39,750
This is my normal expression
I'm far from smiling or smirking

684
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,380
Seriously, what's the fascination with my face ?
Let me see

685
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,940
Huh ?

686
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,940
From now on,
no more of that "Huh?" business

687
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,900
You're targetting Tanaka right now, aren't you ?

688
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,510
Seriously, no more

689
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,590
Will you stop please ?

690
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:14,300
You need to stop doing that
--Please, no more

691
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,310
Ah, aaan!

692
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,300
Ouch

693
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:24,300
Tanaka, you're letting out something weird when you get hit

694
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,380
It's changed since last year

695
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,000
You sound a little,
shall I say...gay ?

696
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,700
You sound a little,
shall I say...gay ?

697
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,540
I don't know if you're acting
but...

698
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,600
I sort of noticed it during the morning exercise, too
--Me, too

699
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,690
You were all
"Iyaaaaaaaaaaaaaan"

700
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,060
I don't think Tanaka sounds like that

701
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,340
Ah aaan !

702
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,750
Eyaaaan !

703
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:04,990
I know that was way too obvious

704
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,750
Tanaka, you gotta stop with your moaning

705
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,140
Something's changed in you

706
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,060
My voice's changed ?

707
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,800
Make it more like
"Uaaggghhh"

708
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,800
Or you just sound gay

709
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,300
Ah aaaan!!

710
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,250
I rest my case

711
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:43,410
Just be quiet

712
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,300
It's not like that seriously

713
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:46,920
Can't you take it like a man ?

714
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm not gay

715
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,710
Tanaka, no more of that nonsense

716
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,500
But I'm not doing it on purpose

717
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,540
Do this,
"Ahhhhh"

718
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,050
How about
"Ohh"

719
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,650
"Ohh" ??

720
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,800
Why don't you practice ?

721
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,770
Time to redeem yourself, Tanaka

722
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:23,300
Ohhhh

723
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,200
What the hell was that ??

724
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,910
We gotta stop making ourselves laugh

725
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,080
Hey, Tanaka

726
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,100
Ok, no more suggestions

727
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:44,780
It backfires

728
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,890
How about more like
"Ou!"

729
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,540
Seriously, no more
I'm already too self-consious

730
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,500
Ok, no more then

731
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,300
Is it like noon yet ?

732
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,600
I don't know

733
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,600
Huh ??

734
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,930
It's gotta be noon by now

735
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,500
You just broke your promise

736
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,650
Doing "Huh?" is not cool

737
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,300
Hamada-san, what comes around goes around

738
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,340
11:30am
It's been 2 Hours and 30 Minutes

739
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,300
It's finally time to prove themselves as nurses

740
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,250
You guys get to finally work

741
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:42,000
Let's go up in front
so you can start helping some patients

742
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,570
Here we go finally

743
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,380
We're here to work I suppose

744
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:52,450
Sit right here ?

745
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,090
You sit in a middle

746
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,450
Damn, it's cold

747
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:00,550
Where is everyone ?

748

749
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,960
Are we expecting any patients ?

750
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:03,950
Yes, any minute now

751
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,800
You need to take this more seriously

752
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:10,920
Doctors:
"After the Rain" Suicide Comic Duo

753
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,250
I'm afraid your personal life maybe interfering

754
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,750
with your work life

755
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:20,630
Student Nurses:
Irie, Iwao, and Nishida

756
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,900
Nishida, Why the mustache ?

757
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,850
Because it's soft like Downy

758
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,810
Hey, Iwao

759
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,950
What's with your face ?

760
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,450
Those actors shouldn't be laughing

761
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,080
Ouch You got my hand !

762
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,550
What's your name ?

763
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:05,230
Ah, Yeah! Oh, Yeah!
I'm Irie from LA !!

764
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,900
What ?

765
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,920
I'm Irie

766
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:13,870
Hey Nishida

767
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:17,150
According to my file

768
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,840
You're going out with a single mom

769
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:25,360
Nishida is Dating a Single Mom

770
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,660
What are your dates like ?

771
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:27,730
Well, I'm usually pushing a stroller when we go shopping and stuff

772
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,360
Show us how that goes

773
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,930
"Hey, should I pull down the visor on the stroller?"

774
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,040
I see

775
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:42,980
Also...

776
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,210
When you head out to...

777
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:52,350
You CANNOT be laughing !

778
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,080
That's gonna get me everytime

779
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:01,900
Nishida

780
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:05,710
When you travel to Tokyo for the...Heh heh heh heh

781
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,420
DO YOUR JOB !!

782
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:22,180
Shouldn't those guys be OUT, too ??

783
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,580
Seriously, pull it together, man

784
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,080
No more messing around

785
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:36,660
Please, no more

786
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,760
When you were flying to Tokyo
Heh, heh, heh, heh

787
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,590
They stopped you at the airport for having a steak knife

788
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,610
Why the steak knife ??

789
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,650
It was my first time flying to Tokyo

790
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:51,350
And I thought about eating some ham there

791
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:56,800
Brought a Steak Knife to Eat Some Ham

792
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:56,260
Why did you wanna eat ham ??

793
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,520
I thought ham was pretty "happening"...

794
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:04,830
It's "Happening" to Eat Ham with Knife

795
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,000
What's with his dialogues ?

796
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,030
Hey Nishida

797
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:24,350
You used to have longer hair
Why'd  you cut it ??

798
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:29,650
I let it grow for about four years
and it got down to my lower back

799
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:30,640
I looked at it one day

800
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,220
And I found my crap on it

801
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:34,910
There Was Crap In My Hair

802
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:00,350
You guys need to get your game face on

803
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,090
You all need disciplining
--Doctor, no

804
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:04,450
No violence

805
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,760
Don't worry, we deserve a little disciplining
--But no, that's not right

806
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,370
Violence doesn't solve anything

807
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,680
Please, no violence

808
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:18,850
Get me a Dr. Phil

809
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,150
Well rehearsed

810
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,850
Why the haircut ?
--Crap

811
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:28,240
There Was Crap in My Hair

812
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:32,900
That gets me everytime

813
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,510
That looked painful

814
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:40,950
Don't hit my back !

815
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,420
I'm going to check on my patients

816
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,200
Follow me

817
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:52,190
They giggled too much

818
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:54,190
They got us good though

819
01:04:55,350 --> 01:05:00,850
12:00pm
It's been 3 hours since the start of their shift

820
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:15,670
Follow me and I'll introduce to your patients

821
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,470
Our patients

822
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:20,630
Finally

823
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,950
Our own patients?
--Yes

824
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,110
That's cool
We can finally work

825
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:28,100
I'd rather be working than just sitting there

826
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,110
I get the chills here everytime

827
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,800
Let's start from this room

828
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,870
You ready ?

829
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:41,590
Come on in

830
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:45,700
I'll introduce them to you one by one

831
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:48,890
Stand over here

832
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,330
Here's our first patient

833
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:59,240
Here's Antonio Inoki

834
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,400
Patient 1:
Antonio Inoki

835
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:04,020
Cash is everything

836
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:08,090
Anyway, thanks for coming

837
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,550
in this nipply cold weather

838
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:16,300
Let me do an impersonation of Antonio Inoki
in comic book "Pro Wrestler Chronicle"

839
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:20,150
How's that ?

840
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,960
Let's move to the next one

841
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,150
Antonio Inoki

842
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:50,580
Patient 2:
Antonio Inoki

843
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,850
Health is everything

844
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,470
With your health,
you can work at a gas station

845
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:57,750
Welcome !!

846
01:06:57,850 --> 01:07:00,050
Back it up !
Back it up !

847
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,670
Daaaaaaa !!!!!

848
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:05,070
Would you like regular

849
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:06,640
or high octane ?

850
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:13,050
Diesel tends to pollute the air with its Carbon Dioxide

851
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:14,960
Are you paying CASH !!??

852
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,110
Let's meet the third patient

853
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,780
Patient 3:
Antonio Inoki
*Production Manager

854
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:50,010
How's it going !!??

855
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:51,830
Terrible...

856
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:56,040
Ok, on a count of three
One, two, three...

857
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,800
Daaaaaaaa !!!

858
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:02,290
How're you doing !!??

859
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,360
I was hoping for the real thing...

860
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:11,750
I was really looking forward to meeting Mr. Inoki

861
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:12,900
But this was terrible

862
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,990
Terrible

863
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,500
Awful

864
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,850
Ah aan

865
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:27,850
Hey Tanaka

866
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,530
Stop your moaning

867
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:33,160
Let's move onto the next room

868
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:38,880
Those impersonators sucked

869
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:42,840
I was positive we would get to meet the real guy at the end

870
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:47,140
I was ready to have him put me in a headlock

871
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:50,250
Here's our next set of patients

872
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:53,800
This is terrifying

873
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:55,540
Yes it is

874
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:01,880
Let me introduce you to your next patients

875
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:07,250
Patient 4:
Mr. Kinpachi

876
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,730
I've been teaching for the last 30 years

877
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,600
And I've never busted my own ass so hard before

878
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,150
I just can't live without that lotion

879
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:23,100
Well, you got your lotion
And I got my lotion

880
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,900
Everyone's got the lotion

881
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:26,850
Lotion, lotion, lotion

882
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,210
I don't think this was appropriate

883
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:32,410
You're the boss

884
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:35,120
Well, um..

885
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:38,240
Finish it up

886
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:41,550
We've had enough

887
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:47,110
You've had enough
I see, I see
I have no more to say

888

889
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,900
You laughed at the wrong time
--Yes I did

890
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,940
Let's move on to the next patient

891
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,110
Oh, you've finally made it

892
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,390
Patient 5:
Mr. Kinpachi

893
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:21,840
Let me tell you something scary

894
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,830
this hospital is perverted

895
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:30,300
Here's an impression of me
when my friend only gives me one Tic-Tac mint

896
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,210
Give me some Tic-Tacs

897
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:35,500
Oh, here you go

898
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,800
Why only ONE ?
Give me like TWO or THREE !!

899
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:43,140
That's all
Go away

900
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,830
Here's our next patient

901
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,650
Patient 6:
Mr. Kinpachi
*Production Manager

902
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,000
I thought it would be a nice gesture
to serenade you with a tune

903
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,750
Shall we go now ?

904
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,430
Why the manager again ?

905
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,360
Doesn't he have other things to do ?

906
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:56,500
Doctor Emori Sings Opera

907
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,580
That's pretty cool

908
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,000
And no sign of quitting

909
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:20,250
Yep, he's not quitting

910
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,120
Damn....

911
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:27,500
Italian Opera

912
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,310
How long is enough ?

913
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:36,790
12:30pm
It's been 3 and a half hours since the start

914
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:40,320
Let's see who's having some issues...

915
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,300
What's that, Endo ?

916
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:45,000
Hot cocoa

917
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:46,500
Damn, you love that !

918
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,860
You've been drinking it non-stop

919
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,000
This keeps me warm

920
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,540
That looks so good

921
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:57,120
You can't have that, huh ?

922
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,320
What else can't you have ?

923
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:00,550
I can't have anything like that

924
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:02,670
Only water

925
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,670
*Yamasaki had been hospitalized for gastroentitus
and is on a strict diet

926
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:07,000
Anything other than water ?
- No, nothing

927
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,310
That sucks
--I feel for you

928
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:11,890
You'll be alright
--But it's hard

929
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,430
How about fruit ?

930
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,000
No fruit either

931
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,700
This is the first time in my life
when I can't eat anything for two weeks

932
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,500
Banana's no good ?

933
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,600
No, nothing

934
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:22,270
How about KAKI (persimmon)?

935
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:24,530
No way
--He just said nothing's ok

936
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,190
You know I got sick
from KAKI (oyster) once

937
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:29,440
So banana's a no go ?

938
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,390
I just said no

939
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,030
How about KAKI (persimmon)?

940
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,500
KAKI is no good

941
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,910
I got sick from KAKI (oyster) before

942
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:38,500
And I wouldn't dare try one now

943
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,570
How do you get sick from KAKI (persimmon)?

944
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,600
Remember I got sick from KAKI (oyster)
after that dinner outing ?

945
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,860
You guys are talking about two different KAKI's

946
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:50,330
Wouldn't I be referring to KAKI (persimmon) as a fruit,
when I'm talking about bananas ?

947
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:53,570
I was thinking of seafood KAKI (oyster)
That made more sense to me

948
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,200
I see

949
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,550
How about bananas then ?

950
01:13:57,550 --> 01:13:59,520
I said bananas aren't good

951
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:19,410
He sure asked for it

952
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,180
That looked painful

953
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:32,320
No doubt you were trying to make us laugh
with your "banana" speech

954
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,840
With malicious intent

955
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:36,500
Very evil

956
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:37,990
Guys, listen

957
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,650
It's hard to believe that you can't have bananas

958
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:42,050
I really can't have any

959
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:46,740
We kind of see bananas as something even an ailing person can have

960
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,100
I understand
But no

961
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:49,800
What do you wanna eat the most?

962
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:50,800
Well...Dumplings

963
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,100
Well...Dumplings

964
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,100
BANANAS ?

965
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,100
I wonder why you're craving dumplings ?

966
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,760
I don't know
but I also want pizza

967
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,520
You're craving dough

968
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:05,750
Yeah, you might be right on that

969
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,800
God, I wanna eat them so bad right now

970
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:11,000
I don't think you'll be eating dumplings any time soon

971
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
When can you eat again ?

972
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:13,970
After New Year's ?

973
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:24,230
One of the director's daughters is being hospitalized
and her sister is here to see her

974
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:25,160
What?
I don't get it

975
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,380
Who's here to see who ?

976
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:33,150
It's the director's daughter's sister who's here

977
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:35,500
What do we have to do with that ?

978
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,940
Let's go give our formal greetings

979
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:40,500
So the sister is also the daughter of the director ?
--Yes

980
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,800
Confusing

981
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,900
And what are we doing ?

982
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:47,900
Going to say hello

983
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,330
Get outta here
No need

984
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,210
She's the daughter of our director and ...

985
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:52,920
I don't see the point

986
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,270
I don't wanna go either

987
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:57,080
Who does she think she is ?

988
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:04,060
I think it would be a nice gesture to
give our formal greetings to the director's daughter

989
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,610
Your speaking is so incoherant
I don't know what the hell you're talking about

990
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,000
She's the daughter of the director

991
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,500
Shall we ?

992
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:23,060
It's the sister of our patient who's also the daugher of our director

993
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:30,850
I still don't get it

994
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,890
I told you, not my back !

995
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,480
Let's go then

996
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:44,360
Why does it have to be so confusing ?

997
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:47,780
So it's the sister of the director's daughter ?

998
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:53,860
She's gotta be staying in a nicer room

999
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,390
That's a good guess

1000
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,400
Try not to be rude
Our jobs are on the line

1001
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,270
May we come in ?

1002
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,070
Come in

1003
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,500
Tanaka, close the door behind you

1004
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:24,490
Director's daughters:
Haruka and Haruna

1005
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,640
Who the hell are you ?

1006
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,190
How dare you
just stroll in like that ?!

1007
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,860
HUH ??

1008
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:38,690
Are you deaf ?

1009
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,130
She's trying
but her dialect sucks

1010
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,440
I got a bad feeling about this

1011
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:03,200
This could be really bad

1012
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:11,280
Please speak normal
Don't attempt our dialect

1013
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,280
You're not one of us

1014
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,860
There's nothing funny about my dialect

1015
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,080
Says who ?

1016
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,400
Huh ?

1017
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,070
Who the hell are you anyway ?

1018
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,220
Why so angry ?

1019
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,960
We're only here because we were told to come

1020
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,700
Just messin' with you all

1021
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:49,600
So what brought you here today ?

1022
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:53,230
I would like to introduce you
to our new nurses

1023
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:55,800
This is Haruka and Haruna

1024
01:18:56,590 --> 01:19:00,500
Let's have them do something
It'll be fun

1025
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:03,570
Is there anything you wanna see, sis ?

1026
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:05,250
A cat

1027
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:11,060
She Wants to See a Cat !!

1028
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,430
You love animals

1029
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:12,630
You, come here

1030
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:15,320
Yamasaki Receives the Challenge

1031
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,490
Can't you mimic a cat ?

1032
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,700
A cat ?
--Yes

1033
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:22,690
A cat...

1034
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,810
He's actually pretty good at this

1035
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,340
Why do you have to be so

1036
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:53,300
into it like a professiona l?

1037
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,000
Why not horse around more ?

1038
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,740
How's that cat ?

1039
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Translation by Shibatabread

1040
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:06,020
What do you want to see next ?

1041
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:07,740
I like gorillas

1042
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:09,210
She Wants to See a Gorilla

1043
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,810
You

1044
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:14,300
Let's see a gorilla

1045
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,590
Endo Receives the Challenge

1046
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:17,910
Do it

1047
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,910
Don't quit

1048
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,860
Unless I tell you so
--Ok

1049
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:44,060
You got that ?
--Yes

1050
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,480
You lost your momentum

1051
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,640
She definitely killed your act

1052
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,010
What's next, sister ?

1053
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,140
Seriously, no more

1054
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:24,340
Let's see if you can catch a bill

1055
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:27,100
Play "$100 Bill Catch" !!

1056
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:31,770
She loves giving money to the bums

1057
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:37,600
Rule:
If You Can Catch a $100 Bill, You Win !

1058
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:43,580
What's she saying ?
--I think she's saying that we can have the money

1059
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,990
You're not from the Kansai area, are you ?

1060
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:50,800
So do we get to keep the money ?
--Yes, you can have it

1061
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,050
What the hell is your problem ?!

1062
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,630
Here, take this one

1063
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:00,520
Can you get up ?

1064
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,200
Let' see who goes first

1065
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,990
Be quiet !!

1066
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:08,790
I'M the one talking !

1067
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:11,400
You, the tall one

1068
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,250
Tanaka Receives the Challenge

1069
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:15,000
Let's go

1070
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,400
No good

1071
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:30,200
Because you sucked so bad,
you're wearing these

1072
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:34,640
Here, put these on

1073
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,150
What, am I your mom ?
You put them on !

1074
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,520
We're not buddies !

1075
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,580
Put these on

1076
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,350
Now !

1077
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,530
Oh

1078
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:50,070
Not bad

1079
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,310
Do this with your arms

1080
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,410
Pretty cool

1081
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,000
Next up

1082
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,850
You, on the right

1083
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,900
Matsumoto Receives the Challenge

1084
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,060
You suck

1085
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,880
You desperately tried though

1086
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,780
Wear this

1087
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,760
on your face

1088
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:58,570
You guys didn't catch the face he made just now

1089
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,850
You guys missed out on that
That expression was something else

1090
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,260
Next up

1091
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,400
Hamada

1092
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,780
Hamada Receives the Challenge

1093
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:15,800
For some reason,
she knows his name

1094
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:23,310
Another desperate attempt

1095
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,790
That fell much faster

1096
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:27,900
than I anticipated

1097
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:31,010
Don't assume anything !

1098
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,690
Nothing is what it seems

1099
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:41,080
I'm giving you something to wear, too

1100
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:41,760
Here, wear this

1101
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:42,770
What's this ?

1102
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:44,280
Bite into it

1103
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,600
What?
--Bite into it !

1104
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,600
You're quite pissed off, aren't you ?

1105
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:57,590
Cut me some slack

1106
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,200
That suits you

1107
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,380
Where are they finding those props ?

1108
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:30,080
That thing isn't fair

1109
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,180
What else, sister ?

1110
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,300
Whack-a-mole

1111
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:41,350
She Wants to Play Whack-A-Mole

1112
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:43,960
Move

1113
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:45,840
You also

1114
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:48,880
Thanks

1115
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,910
Now, we're ready to play

1116
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,640
Let's pick some moles

1117
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:02,420
Hamada

1118
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:04,590
Hamada Receives the Challenge

1119
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:05,740
You be on the right side

1120
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,190
How does she know your name
but not ours ?

1121
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:10,890
Right here ?
--Yes

1122
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:12,600
You

1123
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,360
I'm Yamasaki

1124
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,600
Yamasaki Receives the Challenge

1125
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:17,910
You're in the middle

1126
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,910
Yes, the middle

1127
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,720
You're the last one

1128
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:25,600
Matsumoto Receives the Challenge

1129
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,870
I'm Matsumoto, by the way

1130
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,660
Get down

1131
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:30,500
You're the moles

1132
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:32,450
You'll need to retreat

1133
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,230
and retract

1134
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,800
They both mean the same thing

1135
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,600
Why not just
"Come up and down ?"

1136
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:42,200
Retreat and retract

1137
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,650
We're not popping up then ?

1138
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:44,870
Yes, you are !!

1139
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:50,240
Make sure you come up

1140
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:53,120
at random

1141
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,290
Oh, there's one !

1142
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,240
A mole

1143
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:05,220
Another mole

1144
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,400
Where the hell are the others ?!!

1145
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,900
That hurts

1146
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:40,450
Look, Yamasaki is laughing, too

1147
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:44,750
She said
"where the hell are the others ?!!"

1148
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:47,190
Have we had enough, sis ?

1149
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,510
Poor sister can't even nod to answer me

1150
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,760
This is such a waste of our time

1151
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,340
Get outta here !

1152
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:08,700
Hope you feel better soon

1153
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,170
Don't say it

1154
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:11,850
Unless you mean it

1155
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,940
Those who really mean it

1156
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:16,940
can say it now

1157
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:21,600
NONE of You ??

1158
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,120
That was a long visit, wasn't it ?

1159
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:32,070
Is it just me,
or is everything taking longer here ?

1160
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:36,770
Anybody here ?!

1161
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:39,170
Does anybody works here, or what ?!

1162
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:40,710
They are the famous father and son duo

1163
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:44,400
Most Notorious Boxing Team in the World

1164
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:46,600
Anyone ?!

1165
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:48,170
Can we help you ?

1166
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:04,350
How....how can we help you ?

1167
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:11,010
Scoot over to this side
and line up

1168
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:17,060
What's up with the ROUTINE Check-up, huh ??

1169
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:19,240
How can it be ROUTINE,
when there's nobody here ?!

1170
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,270
Huh ??

1171
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:21,490
Look at my son, Kouki

1172
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,300
Both of his arms are broken, yeah ?

1173
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:26,960
With his arms now broken
anything that used to be manageable

1174
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,600
has become unmanageable

1175
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:31,150
How is he gonna train for his fight now ?

1176
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:35,600
We need to keep our integrity

1177
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,550
Why talk so close ?

1178
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,350
Kouki, you tell them

1179
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:57,800
This is hard,
yeah, definitely a hardship

1180
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Translation by Shibatabread

1181
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:15,810
C'mon, that doesn't hurt, does it ?

1182
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,160
Kouki, tell them more

1183
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:18,380
Well, what can I say

1184
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,530
I took it like a man, you know ?

1185
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:22,250
Yeah, my tolerance for pain is high

1186
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,490
I've got lots of it, you know ?

1187
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:26,320
I can't wait to get better

1188
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,460
Definitely want to get better soon

1189
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,950
I thought my brother could help me with rehab

1190
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:32,500
But he's so big,

1191
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,380
he might hurt me.

1192
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:36,400
Yeah, he would hurt me

1193
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,710
Until I'm all bloody red

1194
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,410
Why the word "red" ?

1195
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:59,000
Let's go, Kouki

1196
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,800
I'm staying charismatic

1197
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:08,300
1:00pm
It's been 4 hours since the start

1198
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:16,250
They devour their lunch as if they haven't eaten in days

1199
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:20,670
Is Yamasaki ok ?

1200
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:23,870
I wonder if he's getting an IV injection ?

1201
01:31:23,870 --> 01:31:29,250
*Yamasaki receives IV's to replenish his daily vitamin intake

1202
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:34,610
That's pretty nuts

1203
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:36,780
Can you fall asleep at night ?

1204
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:37,880
I'm so awake at night

1205
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,200
because I hardly burn any calories during the day

1206
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,990
I did a pretty decent cat, didn't I ?

1207
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:48,960
Yeah

1208
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,860
Your "cat" was really good

1209
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,170
I was surprised myself

1210
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:58,060
Can you say "Paper Cup" with your cat voice ?

1211
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,170
Say "Kami Cup" with your cat voice

1212
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:22,640
That was my fault

1213
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:31,390
No more of that

1214
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:33,690
No more

1215
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,590
I think we're all getting tired

1216
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:45,940
Why don't we get some fresh air?
Let's go for a walk

1217
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:48,330
Can I pass ?

1218
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:51,970
Shall we ?

1219
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:53,690
It'll be a good exercise, too

1220
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,430
You have such a gifted face

1221
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,080
You've got the funniest face

1222
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,280
I wasn't like that, was I ?

1223
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,730
Sorry, but no

1224
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:20,590
It looks funnier on Hamada-san

1225
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,580
It's more suited to him, I suppose

1226
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,510
I'm tired of freezing my butt off

1227
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:40,100
Look, the rescue team is conducting a drill

1228
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:44,800
Routine Drill for the Rescue Team

1229
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,080
Rescue member:
Kazuo Umezu

1230
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:54,040
We're conducting our routine rescue drill

1231
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:54,980
Give me your number

1232
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:55,420
ONE !!

1233
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:55,950
TWO !!

1234
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:56,900
three

1235
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,800
Umezu, not loud enough

1236
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:23,990
There are three victims

1237
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:26,760
Rescue the Victims in a Timely Manner

1238
01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:29,700
Time is critical in saving lives

1239
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,360
Time starts

1240
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,680
NOW !!

1241
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:33,650
Yes, sir !

1242
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,180
Is he OK ?

1243
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:53,390
He went face first

1244
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,430
Let's help him first

1245
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:01,800
He's the one who needs RESCUING

1246
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:14,230
They're really milking this "boobie trap" joke

1247
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:17,480
The boobie trap is dangerous

1248
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,060
Let's get going

1249
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:22,590
Is he really OK ?

1250
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,070
So much for the Rescue Team

1251
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,850
He's over 70 years old

1252
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:34,740
Let's just hope he's going to be OK

1253
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:41,800
*Mr. Umezu was safely rescued

1254
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:51,760
Announcement:

1255
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:51,310
Time for the doctor to make another round

1256
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,400
Doctor Making His Rounds

1257
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,140
Well ?
--We're ok this time

1258
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:05,510
His brother's gone

1259
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:17,420
Nurse:
Chiaki (Endo's wife)

1260
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,450
Yeah, that's her

1261
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:28,440
She hides very well

1262
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:32,130
I can see progress has been made

1263
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:36,400
Hello

1264
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:37,880
Good luck today,

1265
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,000
Pu !

1266
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,900
Good luck, today

1267
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,430
Pu !

1268
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,470
You better get going

1269
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,160
I'll do my best, ok ?

1270
01:36:52,450 --> 01:36:53,710
Thank you !

1271
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,230
This isn't cool at all

1272
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:04,570
It's not fair for her to talk to you like that

1273
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:06,480
"Good luck, today ?"

1274
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,330
How could I not laugh at that ??

1275
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:21,400
What does she call you at home ?

1276
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,520
She calls me "big brother"

1277
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:27,150
We were just talking about this last night, too

1278
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:31,730
I asked her if she had anything to do with this show

1279
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,340
And she said no

1280
01:37:35,570 --> 01:37:38,250
I left home this morning and she stayed home

1281
01:37:39,190 --> 01:37:41,340
Freaky

1282
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,580
She was all
"Good luck, today, Pu ! "

1283
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:48,720
2:00pm
It's been 5 hours since the start

1284
01:37:55,670 --> 01:38:00,250
We're holding a "mental care" event
outside for one of our patients

1285
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:02,360
Let's go check it out

1286
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:04,390
It's an important event put together
by the nurses

1287
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:05,780
It's outside ?
--Yes

1288
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,790
Grab a warm jacket from the locker

1289
01:38:09,970 --> 01:38:12,200
What's this,
"mental care" thing?

1290
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:15,250
I wish I had your scarf

1291
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,990
How did you score that scarf ?

1292
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:20,800
Nobody else has a scarf like you do

1293
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:24,250
Wow, it's cold

1294
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,920
What the...?

1295
01:38:27,650 --> 01:38:30,800
I guess we were having issues with our water lines

1296
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:35,040
Water Line Repairs in Process

1297
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,800
Hey !

1298
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,190
You !!

1299
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:40,800
What's taking so long !?

1300
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:43,900
From the Water Dept:
Youichi Nukumizu

1301
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:43,900
I'm sorry, I'm almost done, sir !

1302
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,540
Do you think we got all day here ?!

1303
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,790
Once I tighten this lug nut, we're done, sir

1304
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:52,830
Hey !

1305
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:54,790
Why're you so incompetent ?!

1306
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:59,590
Water Line Erupts !!

1307
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:09,850
I can't bear to watch,
this is so ugly

1308
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:22,630
Let's get outta here !!

1309
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:42,040
This is pretty grand

1310
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:45,430
Look how high it's shooting up

1311
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,250
This is awesome

1312
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,350
I feel for Mr. Nukumizu

1313
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:52,800
He doesn't need to be doing this kind of stuff

1314
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,800
We're almost there

1315
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:56,900
This way

1316
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:59,200
Check this place out

1317
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,280
Wow, wow, wow

1318
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,000

1319
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,840
What's this ?

1320
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:04,830
The nurse's battlefield

1321
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:09,540
Inside this Cursed Iron Castle

1322
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:14,080
What is about to happen here ?

1323
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:16,940
It's gonna be really cold

1324
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:23,230
The person most responsible for this event
should be here any minute now

1325
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:37,540
The wait is finally over

1326
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:40,650
for an event that's quickly becoming

1327
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:42,630
a custom

1328
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:45,400
and put together by our own nurses

1329
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:49,160
to help our patients
ease the fear of their

1330
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:50,390
Haruo Shiono

1331
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:52,700
upcoming surgeries

1332
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:54,050
Without further adieu

1333
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:57,320
Let's introduce our patient

1334
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,450
You can see him in his room over there

1335
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:01,650
His name is Akitaka

1336
01:41:09,150 --> 01:41:11,480
He has an appendix surgery tomorrow

1337
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:14,810
Akitaka (7 years old)

1338
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:19,200
I'm sure he's very nervous about
tomorrow's appendix surgery

1339
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:21,240
But do not worry

1340
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:26,150
Our bright nurses will
eradicate all of your worries

1341
01:41:27,090 --> 01:41:31,330
Gah-Soo Black Luster Memorial Hospital
Nurse's Opening Ceremony

1342
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:42,570
Let us welcome all the nurses who will challenge themselves
to help Akitaka with his surgery tomorrow

1343
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:49,260
Angels in white uniform,
These nurses will surely brighten
any human struggles

1344
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:55,100
Akitaka, let us help you to
build your courage to overcome tomorrow's surgery

1345
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:57,190
Where is he looking ?

1346
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:59,410
Stop the music

1347
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:10,280
Nurse Kosugi
Please step forward

1348
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:15,510
Black Mayonaise
Nurse Kosugi

1349
01:42:18,710 --> 01:42:21,080
He didn't know about this

1350
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,950
He's got to improvise

1351
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:27,690
Before we proceed with the ceremony

1352
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:30,700
Let's hear him sing his heart out !

1353
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:32,100
Damn

1354
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:36,250
Let's hear one of our favorites

1355
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:39,360
The song is titled
"Warmth of Nurses"

1356
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:43,240
Song by Kosugi
"Warmth of Nurses"

1357
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:49,240
~Thank you ~ Thank you~

1358
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:52,780
~Nurses’ Smile~

1359
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,820
~All of Your Kindness~

1360
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,690
~You're Solid n' Pink~

1361
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:03,890
What the hell was that ?

1362
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:07,560
I didn't mean to laugh

1363
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:25,530
Nurse representatives
Step forward

1364
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:27,630
Time for the player's oath

1365
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:37,110
Nurse Representatives:
Shouhei and Moroboshi

1366
01:43:37,610 --> 01:43:39,810
All of us nurses here

1367
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,670
pledge to play fairly

1368
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:44,700
@#@$%....

1369
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,030
on behalf of all the participants

1370
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,120
Let's be more professional !

1371
01:44:10,170 --> 01:44:11,630
Let us begin

1372
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:15,040
Akitaka
We know your surgery will be a success

1373
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:16,290
and you'll be healthy !

1374
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:18,820
Good luck, Akitaka !

1375
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:28,700
Mental Care Event
"Good Luck, Akitaka"
Begins

1376
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:44,400
Mental Care Event:
Nurses Challenge themselves to
Help Patients Muster up Courage

1377
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:47,680
All the nurses

1378
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:50,780
Take a look at the
"Seed of Courage"

1379
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:53,540
Our first Challenge
is

1380
01:44:55,930 --> 01:45:00,300
"Stop the Seed of Courage"

1381
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:08,320
Stop the Seed of Courage:
Try stopping the rolling seed which is
10ft wide (1m) and 220lbs (100kg)

1382
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:13,450
By stopping the seed,
you'll give Akitaka more courage needed for tomorrow

1383
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:17,120
First challenger is
Fukawa

1384
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:19,900
Nurse Fukawa

1385
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,900
He has few words for Akitaka

1386
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:26,200
Akitaka
Believe in your strength

1387
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:31,900
He wasn't looking

1388
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:35,370
Can he really stop this seed ?

1389
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,350
Any moment now

1390
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:41,140
This looks unsafe

1391
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,820
Nurse:
Fail

1392
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:11,570
Nurse:
Tetsuo

1393
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:17,230
Can he stop this rolling seed ?

1394
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:23,120
What do you know ?

1395
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:29,590
Tetsuo Goes Face First Against the 220lb Seed

1396
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:36,360
Two of our challengers
were unable to stop the seed of courage

1397
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,700
Nurse Moroboshi

1398
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:44,510
Akitak@#@$%%

1399
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:53,100
Get it right !

1400
01:46:53,150 --> 01:46:55,210
He tried to hide it, too

1401
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:56,300
Definitely a screw up

1402
01:46:57,810 --> 01:47:00,580
He'll be ready
any second now

1403
01:47:04,830 --> 01:47:07,490
The seed of courage begins its roll

1404
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:09,120
Can he stop it ?!

1405
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:17,260
Nurse Moroboshi:
Fail

1406
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,920
Will any nurse be able to help Akitaka ?!

1407
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,100
So far

1408
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:25,100
The seed of courage
has not been stopped

1409
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:27,100
He looks bored as hell

1410
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:28,710
Next challenge is

1411
01:47:28,810 --> 01:47:33,700
"Dive in Stomach Fluid Pond"

1412
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:45,050
Dive in Stomach Fluid Pond (max 1min)
Grab the seed of courage at the bottom of
the tank filled with lotion

1413
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,770
Our first challenger is
Nurse Kosugi

1414
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:52,960
Akitaka

1415
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:58,610
Have faith in your doctor and nurses’ ability
with your surgery tomorrow

1416
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:02,270
Why not try opening your appendix ?

1417
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:06,640
Any minute now

1418
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:13,600
He dove right in !

1419
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:17,130
Let's get some air

1420
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:20,220
Will he go again ?

1421
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:25,560
His left hand came very close that time !!

1422
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:28,200
Time is quickly running out

1423
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,230
About 40 seconds left

1424
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:35,990
He goes for a second try !

1425
01:48:36,030 --> 01:48:37,060
But no cigar !!

1426
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:41,410
About 10 seconds left !

1427
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:47,700
He'll attempt with his feet

1428
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:50,240
3, 2, 1,

1429
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:08,710
Stomach fluid is too much for the human !

1430
01:49:09,930 --> 01:49:11,630
Nurse Murakami

1431
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,700
She has 1 minute to conquer

1432
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,300
She dove right in

1433
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:20,700
to the pond of stomach fluid

1434
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:23,080
How will she fare ?

1435
01:49:23,910 --> 01:49:25,290
Her face says it all

1436
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:30,100
Right now,
she's trying to utilize her feet

1437
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:32,050
What is that,
a little pig ?

1438
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:36,780
She cannot seem to get
anything going here

1439
01:49:38,170 --> 01:49:40,620
She's gasping a lot for air

1440
01:49:43,930 --> 01:49:44,990
You can do it !

1441
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:48,500
This is super ugly

1442
01:49:50,370 --> 01:49:53,330
Looks like 100% Lotion
has proven to be a tougher opponent

1443
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:55,560
Time is running out

1444
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:57,700
About 20 seconds left

1445
01:49:58,270 --> 01:50:00,940
She did not even come close

1446
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Translation by Shibatabread

1447
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:06,800
We're hoping that she can get something going here

1448
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:10,380
Less than 10 seconds left
and she's sobbing

1449
01:50:10,530 --> 01:50:11,020
7 seconds

1450
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:15,370
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

1451
01:50:18,020 --> 01:50:20,190
Another failed attempt

1452
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:36,980
Nurse Ohshima

1453
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:40,170
He dove right in

1454
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:43,520
Butt Cheeks !!

1455
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:49,700
He seems promising here

1456
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:51,770
One more attempt

1457
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:56,420
Do it for Akitaka !!

1458
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,900
He just cannot dive deep enough

1459
01:51:04,970 --> 01:51:06,120
Ohshima~

1460
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,220
Ohshima~

1461
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:11,450
3, 2, 1,

1462
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:18,660
Another failed attempt !

1463
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:31,280
None of the nurses have been able
to conquer the challenges so far

1464
01:51:31,370 --> 01:51:34,680
Perhaps, it is time
to summon our captain

1465
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:37,770
AGGIDDAKA

1466
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:38,810
Who ?

1467
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:41,670
Eat something @#@$@

1468
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:51,970
Can't you enunciate ?

1469
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:55,370
I thought you called him
"Hagetaka" (Vulture)

1470
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:06,970
He slowly descends
using the ladder

1471
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:09,600
He actually looks promising

1472
01:52:12,170 --> 01:52:14,240
He's got his kick going

1473
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:18,150
He was only able to keep
himself submerged

1474
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,270
Another disappointing attempt

1475
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:30,020
This concludes today's event

1476
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:34,020
Unfortunately,
No "seed of courage" was captured

1477
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:38,030
4:00pm
It's been 7 hours and 30 minutes since the start

1478
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:42,280
The group is back in their break room
after the big event

1479
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:52,020
Ultra-man is here

1480
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:59,290
Seriously, you sleep with a smirk

1481
01:52:59,710 --> 01:53:01,500
No way

1482
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,760
Ok, this is what you look like
I'm just imitating you, ok ?

1483
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,220
I'm not doing that at all !

1484
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:21,890
Didn't I say

1485
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,730
I was just imitating

1486
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:26,400
HIM ?!!

1487
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:35,440
Where is...

1488
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,320
Where's justice in that ?

1489
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,720
SNAP !

1490
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:47,870
Hamada Trying to Get Laughs

1491
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,890
You know what ?

1492
01:53:51,270 --> 01:53:52,470
What're you trying to do ?

1493
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:53,820
Are you allowed to do that ?

1494
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,260
Definitely not

1495
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:57,500
He needs to be slapped

1496
01:53:57,990 --> 01:54:00,430
Why should I be responsible
for someone laughing ?

1497
01:54:01,150 --> 01:54:04,300
Then let me say that
your face is now a lethal weapon

1498
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:11,180
You also know that I wouldn't look
as funny as you do with that mask

1499
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,340
Yes ?

1500
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:29,490
Not cool
Not fair at all

1501
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:34,020
This isn't right
He needs to be warned

1502
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:37,950
That hurts

1503
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:40,290
This situation is unfair

1504
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:46,870
Let's go to the front and help patients

1505
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:48,050
Ok

1506
01:54:52,690 --> 01:54:54,650
Patients will bring in their

1507
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,460
urine samples

1508
01:54:56,570 --> 01:54:59,090
Write down their names and their room numbers

1509
01:54:59,190 --> 01:55:03,670
Collect Patient Urine Samples

1510
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:07,170
This will be good practice for you guys

1511
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:11,440
Matsumoto,

1512
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,380
Collect his sample

1513
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:16,820
I'm Mitsuhashi
from Room 201

1514
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:20,020
Mr. Mitsuhashi from Room 201

1515
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:21,530
Write it down quickly
before another one shows up

1516
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:26,220
Your name, please ?

1517
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:30,850
Mr. Sato from Room 303

1518
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:41,020
Damn it,
it's that guy

1519
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:49,820
Patient:
Mikihisa Azuma

1520
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:55,350
Filled to the Brim with Urine !!

1521
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,900
You got way too much there

1522
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:01,180
Hamada, why don't you accept it ?

1523
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:27,420
Mr. Azuma from Room 402

1524
01:56:27,670 --> 01:56:29,020
What're you in here for ?

1525
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:42,530
He's gotta be super ill

1526
01:56:42,610 --> 01:56:44,210
to be carrying that IV around

1527
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,850
5:00pm
It's been 8 hours since the start

1528
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:50,800
Time to observe the Adult Medicine Department

1529
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,160
Are we observing the doctor ?

1530
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:54,220
Yes, in the adult medicine department

1531
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,300
We will be observing the doctor
diagnosing patients

1532
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:00,400
What ?

1533
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,830
Take a look

1534
01:57:06,980 --> 01:57:09,600
Black Jack is here

1535
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:09,400
Black Jack

1536
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:14,170
His operating skills are far superior to others,
but he's not a board certified doctor

1537
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:18,550
Assistant
Pinoko

1538
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:18,550
Unlicensed Doctor
Black Jack

1539
01:57:14,170 --> 01:57:18,780
He's also known to demand
ridiculous amounts of money for his operating skills

1540
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:24,270
We're lucky to catch him here

1541
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:28,200
I don't think he likes us watching him

1542
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:29,850
Itsuji Itao presents BLACK JACK !!

1543
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:33,800
Itsuji Itao presents BLACK JACK !!

1544
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:36,400
What the hell was that ?

1545
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:46,850
What's with this actor ?

1546
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:53,680
Seriously, what the hell was that ?

1547
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:55,090
I don't get his sense of humor

1548
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:58,320
I know he didn't like us watching him for sure

1549
01:57:58,520 --> 01:57:59,170
This way

1550
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:02,870
Come inside

1551
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:12,500
Observing the Practice

1552
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:14,520
Doctor, please proceed

1553
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:17,780
Next patient

1554
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:25,790
Have a seat

1555
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:29,570
Please sit down

1556
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:33,530
What seems to be the problem ?

1557
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:36,250
( Gibberish)

1558
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:43,180
Let's take your temperature

1559
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:51,510
How's your appetite ?

1560
01:58:51,650 --> 01:58:54,700
( Gibberish )

1561
01:58:55,130 --> 01:58:56,650
Is your throat sore ?

1562
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:02,110
Let me see the thermometer please

1563
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:07,600
It's High !!

1564
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:19,370
Unbelievable
You do have a temperature

1565
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:23,180
I'm writing you a prescription

1566
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:27,390
About a week's worth of pills

1567
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:30,850
Expensive !!

1568
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:35,800
That's really high!

1569
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:44,950
You guys are ok with that ?

1570
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:53,270
That was nuts

1571
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:55,660
Next patient, please

1572
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,880
Patient:
Atsumu Watanabe

1573
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:02,400
Have a seat

1574
02:00:04,730 --> 02:00:06,030
And what brought you here today

1575
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:08,460
Well, I have a tendency to

1576
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:12,500
turn into a moron
every time I say numbers with a "3" in them

1577
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:15,210
and also any number divisible by 3

1578
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:19,900
Loses Composure with Numbers Containing 3
and Numbers Divisible by 3

1579
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:24,300
I don't understand
Could you demonstrate, please ?

1580
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:15,900
I don't wanna get that sickness for sure

1581
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:17,610
Anything else ?

1582
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:19,290
I have another problem

1583
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:23,550
where it's almost impossible

1584
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:27,160
to tell whether
I'm laughing or crying

1585
02:01:27,630 --> 02:01:30,820
Difficult to Distinguish Between Laughing and Crying

1586
02:01:30,820 --> 02:01:32,760
Why don't you show me that as well

1587
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:22,320
Next patient, please

1588
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:25,660
He's got a lot of patients

1589
02:02:29,110 --> 02:02:30,030
Please, have a seat

1590
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,500
Foreign Patient

1591
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,500
Interpreter

1592
02:02:32,490 --> 02:02:33,490
What seems to be the problem ?

1593
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:35,550
What seems to be the problem ?

1594
02:02:36,490 --> 02:02:41,130
I've had this killer headache since last night (in fluent Japanese)

1595
02:02:41,130 --> 02:02:44,690
I mean, I always get chronic migraines
but this one felt a little more severe

1596
02:02:45,330 --> 02:02:50,580
He said he has a chronic migraine, but
this headache has been bothering him since last night

1597
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:53,850
Do you have any food allergies ?

1598
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:56,520
Any food allergies ?

1599
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:58,700
Allergies ?

1600
02:02:59,980 --> 02:03:00,900
Oh, you know what ?

1601
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:03,130
I don't do well with wheat flour

1602
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:05,550
What else,
let's see

1603
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:08,900
Yeah, what do you call that?
It's on tip of my tongue

1604
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:12,500
Is it IGUSA (Rush Grass)?
The one used in Tatami floors ?

1605
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:14,450
That gets me every time

1606
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:16,500
I mean, my thighs get real itchy

1607
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:32,250
Take care now

1608
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:36,530
Next patient, please

1609
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:42,050
Patient:
Hey! Taku-chan

1610
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:46,620
What seems to be the problem ?

1611
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:50,370
What the hell was that movie all about ?

1612
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:53,290
That just sucked !

1613
02:03:54,940 --> 02:03:59,780
It just made me really ill watching it

1614
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,090
The whole thing was utter garbage !!

1615
02:04:09,090 --> 02:04:10,540
There was one cool scene though

1616
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:17,700
Where that girl took off her clothes

1617
02:04:18,050 --> 02:04:19,220
in the beginning I think

1618
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:24,610
And that was garbage, too !!!

1619
02:04:43,090 --> 02:04:44,680
Next patient, please

1620
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:46,330
Is this going to end ?

1621
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,620
It's my wife

1622
02:04:54,810 --> 02:04:56,400
Her breasts are really swollen

1623
02:04:57,410 --> 02:04:58,850
I just want you to take a look

1624
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:00,400
Bring her in

1625
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:10,840
Patient with Swollen Breasts

1626
02:05:13,250 --> 02:05:15,170
It happened about a week ago

1627
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:24,500
and it's gotten worse the last couple of days
I think they've gone numb, too

1628
02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:26,070
She's lost feeling in them?

1629
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:29,200
May I see how bad they are?

1630
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:36,500
Arrangement of Aluminum Cans

1631
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:52,810
What do you think, doc ?

1632
02:05:53,150 --> 02:05:54,830
Yeah, it's pretty severe

1633
02:06:01,910 --> 02:06:03,850
I would say I didn't quite laugh at that

1634
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:08,270
I really don't think I laughed

1635
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:15,800
Incredible

1636
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:17,500
Indeed

1637
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:22,390
5:30pm
It's been 8 hours and 30 minutes since the start

1638
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,700
Gastro camera ?

1639
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:28,090
Let's observe in here as well

1640
02:06:29,210 --> 02:06:31,110
I believe the doctors are coming in soon

1641
02:06:35,710 --> 02:06:36,820
Lift up that side

1642
02:06:36,820 --> 02:06:38,750
I'll cover it with my foot

1643
02:06:40,170 --> 02:06:41,860
No, no, no,
not like that

1644
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:43,240
Put some muscle into it

1645
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:45,700
Doctor and his assistant:
Tsuyoshi and Reiji

1646

1647
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:48,170
Don't worry I got this

1648
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:50,040
I got it
I got it

1649
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,900
Damn, it's gettin' heavy

1650
02:06:52,850 --> 02:06:55,900
Put it down
Put it down

1651
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:58,790
Ouch, just pinched my hand !

1652
02:07:00,730 --> 02:07:02,130
We shouldn't be struggling so much

1653
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:04,960
Let's just get it done

1654
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:20,110
We'll demonstrate how this gastro camera works

1655
02:07:20,110 --> 02:07:22,920
and see how the patient's stomache is doing

1656
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:28,150
Studying the Inside of Patient's Body

1657
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:28,320
Please have a good look at it

1658
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:29,670
Are we ready ?

1659
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:31,530
Here it goes

1660
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:40,070
There's the uvula

1661
02:07:41,490 --> 02:07:43,020
How are we doing here ?

1662
02:07:45,510 --> 02:07:47,530
Now, going through the esophagus

1663
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:51,240
Esophagus

1664
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:49,930
Looks pretty good

1665
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:52,700
Looks good

1666
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:56,180
Ok

1667
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:00,250
Interesting

1668
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:04,900
I'm afraid he's having issues with his digestive system

1669
02:08:04,990 --> 02:08:07,130
Incomplete digestion:
Bread

1670
02:08:07,890 --> 02:08:11,900
Incomplete digestion:
Fish and cheese

1671
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:12,970
This does not look good

1672
02:08:15,230 --> 02:08:16,100
Let me go !

1673
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:19,010
Cut it out !

1674
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:20,510
Help me someone !

1675
02:08:19,970 --> 02:08:21,570
Oligo-Saccharide

1676
02:08:21,590 --> 02:08:25,310
Why can't you just cooperate with us ?

1677
02:08:25,450 --> 02:08:27,680
Evil Virus

1678
02:08:28,270 --> 02:08:30,400
Don't worry,
we'll make it nice and easy

1679
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:32,470
Just follow us

1680
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:36,800
And don't forget,
from now on

1681
02:08:36,990 --> 02:08:38,430
This is our territory

1682
02:08:40,450 --> 02:08:41,380
No !!

1683
02:08:42,450 --> 02:08:44,120
This is just God awful

1684
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:54,970
~We're none other than~

1685
02:08:54,970 --> 02:08:58,410
~the Good Virus~

1686
02:09:01,370 --> 02:09:06,940
Good Virus
Mr. Nakamura (Producer)

1687
02:09:11,450 --> 02:09:12,950
So THIS is where he decides to show up

1688
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:22,030
~We, the Good Virus is here~

1689
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:25,510
~to defend all the evils~

1690
02:09:26,730 --> 02:09:29,780
~like you, the Evil Virus~

1691
02:09:30,470 --> 02:09:31,920
Why is he doing this ?

1692
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,710
~We're here to protect~

1693
02:09:35,650 --> 02:09:36,700
~our host's stomache~

1694
02:09:39,530 --> 02:09:41,730
~right now~

1695
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:48,510
If you want the Oligo-Saccharide back,
you'll have to fight for it

1696
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:49,840
I'll take that challenge

1697
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:52,260
We'll finish you once and for all

1698
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:39,740
CUT !
CUT !
CUT !

1699
02:10:42,650 --> 02:10:44,600
What the hell are you doing ?

1700
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:47,290
You're supposed to be the Good Virus, right ?

1701
02:10:47,690 --> 02:10:50,680
I'm not feeling your willingness to
protect the stomache !

1702
02:10:52,370 --> 02:10:53,340
Get it right !

1703
02:10:54,430 --> 02:10:56,160
I'm sorry, Sakura chan

1704
02:10:57,270 --> 02:10:59,290
I know this is taking way too long

1705
02:10:59,290 --> 02:11:03,200
Sakura Uehara
in Stomache !

1706
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:05,570
I can't keep going like this

1707
02:11:05,570 --> 02:11:06,700
with morons like this !

1708
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:07,870
We're taking a break

1709
02:11:07,870 --> 02:11:09,410
You suck, get it right !

1710
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,760
We're very sorry about this
Why don't we go take a break over there ?

1711
02:11:16,020 --> 02:11:17,840
Unless you're ready,
we're not continuing

1712
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:30,630
I don't get it

1713
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:40,640
Why is he from Osaka ?

1714
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:43,550
Let's check out how the MRI works

1715
02:11:43,550 --> 02:11:45,840
This is where we perform the brain scans

1716
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:50,090
Each of you will get to scan
one by one

1717
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:52,120
Let's start with Yamasaki

1718
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:57,360
Experience the MRI

1719
02:11:53,950 --> 02:11:54,790
Rest of you can sit tight here

1720
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:56,190
and wait for your turns

1721
02:11:57,990 --> 02:12:06,700
MRI scanning is a
a medical imaging technique used to
visualize the internal structure and function of the body

1722
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:09,770
And this MRI comes with
unique feature !!

1723
02:12:16,810 --> 02:12:18,110
Why does Yamasaki go first ?

1724
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:24,780
Examination Start

1725
02:12:28,190 --> 02:12:29,720
This looks scary

1726
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:47,010
What's going on in there ?

1727
02:12:47,010 --> 02:12:48,040
What was that ?

1728
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:06,560
Why is he out ?

1729
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:11,700
You're up next, Hamada

1730
02:13:15,470 --> 02:13:17,170
What's going on ?

1731
02:13:17,170 --> 02:13:18,900
Are you ok ?

1732
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:22,480
Why don't you lie down on that ?

1733
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:23,980
Lie on my back ?

1734
02:13:27,710 --> 02:13:29,920
What, what's this ?

1735
02:13:30,350 --> 02:13:31,720
What is this ?

1736
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:45,360
What, are you serious ?

1737
02:13:57,380 --> 02:13:58,640
This isn't cool at all

1738
02:13:59,450 --> 02:14:00,280
What are they doing to him ?

1739
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:03,880
That sucked

1740
02:14:09,690 --> 02:14:11,290
I bet he'll come outta there like me

1741
02:14:15,830 --> 02:14:17,460
Endo, you're up

1742
02:14:19,060 --> 02:14:20,600
Freaky

1743
02:14:27,910 --> 02:14:30,040
Forgive me

1744
02:14:35,450 --> 02:14:36,780
Lie down on there

1745
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:39,620
I'm scared

1746
02:14:40,850 --> 02:14:42,420
This is not funny at all

1747
02:15:08,650 --> 02:15:10,950
Tanaka Goes Straight into the Bathroom

1748
02:15:12,550 --> 02:15:14,720
Matsumoto, you're the last one

1749
02:15:15,620 --> 02:15:17,320
Do I really need to go ?

1750
02:15:23,630 --> 02:15:23,630
I'm scared

1751
02:15:23,630 --> 02:15:24,860
Scared

1752
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:28,870
I don't like this at all

1753
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:31,170
This is one freaky stuff

1754
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:50,120
She just tongue-ed him

1755
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:09,270
Pretty scary, wasn't it ?

1756
02:16:11,310 --> 02:16:13,480
I'm having dream about this

1757
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:16,050
A nightmare !

1758
02:16:16,420 --> 02:16:20,720
6:00pm
It's been 9 hours since the start

1759
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:24,460
Yamasaki,

1760
02:16:25,290 --> 02:16:26,830
You haven't had anything to eat today, right ?

1761
02:16:27,690 --> 02:16:33,300
Yamasaki is Dismissed to Receive IV Injection
for Vitamin Replenishing

1762
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:33,610
Yamasaki temporarily is dismissed

1763
02:16:35,070 --> 02:16:36,070
You're lucky

02:17:14,010 --> 02:17:15,640
Hamada san, are you....

1766
02:17:27,290 --> 02:17:29,050
What are you doing ?

1767
02:17:29,050 --> 02:17:30,560
You lost at your own game!

1768
02:17:30,690 --> 02:17:32,490
What did he do ?

1769
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:35,290
He tried to imitate Shinji Tanimura

1770
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:44,170
After watching your work as nurses,

1771
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:46,270
it seems you have a long way to go

1772
02:17:46,510 --> 02:17:49,010
I think it's time for us to go observe again

1773
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:51,510
Observe and study ?

1774
02:17:53,980 --> 02:17:55,510
Exam room ?

1775
02:18:00,690 --> 02:18:01,920
What's this ?

1776
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:03,390
I don't get it

1777
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:08,160
We will have three guests come in

1778
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:11,400
and you will have to figure out which one of them
is NOT pregnant

1779
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:17,470
Find the Fake Pregnancy

1780
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,370
As nurses I expect you to easily figure this out

1781
02:18:17,870 --> 02:18:18,870
Please, come on in

1782
02:18:22,310 --> 02:18:25,940
Tall Pregnant Woman:
Shiro Kishibe

1783
02:18:29,180 --> 02:18:32,890
I'm going to ask them a series of questions

1784
02:18:32,890 --> 02:18:35,490
then you decide who's faking based on their answers

1785
02:18:36,290 --> 02:18:38,190
First question,
How far along is your pregnancy?

1786
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:47,900
How far along is yoiur pregnancy ?

1787
02:18:38,490 --> 02:18:39,860
I'm 6 months along

1788
02:18:40,260 --> 02:18:41,230
No. 2 ?

1789
02:18:42,260 --> 02:18:44,330
I'm just at the 8 months mark now

1790
02:18:44,700 --> 02:18:46,030
No. 3 ?

1791
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:48,130
I'm due this month

1792
02:18:56,310 --> 02:18:57,940
You know what ?

1793
02:18:58,810 --> 02:19:01,580
I'm ready to tell you who's faking.

1794
02:19:02,180 --> 02:19:04,280
I'll tell you exactly who the mole is,

1795
02:19:05,180 --> 02:19:07,190
So no need to ask any more questions

1796
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:09,390
Yeah, we all know now

1797
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:12,560
Here's the next question

1798
02:19:13,230 --> 02:19:15,630
What was your first reaction to the news ?

1799
02:19:15,830 --> 02:19:32,110
Your initial reaction ?

1800
02:19:15,890 --> 02:19:18,800
My folks were elated,
and that made me feel great

1801
02:19:20,570 --> 02:19:21,330
No. 2, please

1802
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:25,170
I was happy for my son
who will have a little brother

1803
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:26,810
and No. 3 ?

1804
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:32,310
I was like "It's about time"
So, yes, I was happy about it

1805
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:41,290
No more questions please

1806
02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:47,060
He seems a bit uncomfortable with this role, too

1807
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:55,370
Here's the next que...
--Seriously, no more

1808
02:19:55,930 --> 02:19:57,440
Here's the question

1809
02:19:58,070 --> 02:20:00,170
Have you thought of your baby's name ?

1810
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:26,100
Baby's name ?

1811
02:20:00,510 --> 02:20:04,140
Her name will either be
"Misaki" or "Minori"

1812
02:20:05,010 --> 02:20:09,750
My son and I are still
thinking about it

1813
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:12,920
If it's a girl

1814
02:20:13,350 --> 02:20:15,190
Her name will be
"Rinka"

1815
02:20:16,360 --> 02:20:17,920
If it's a boy ?

1816
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,860
Then his name will be
"Hyuma"

1817
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:23,400
"HYUMA"

1818
02:20:32,510 --> 02:20:34,320
Why did he say that twice ?

1819
02:20:37,570 --> 02:20:40,910
Let's move on to the next...
---No more, please

1820
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:45,210
What will you say to your newborn ?

1821
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:55,710
First word to your newborn ?

1822
02:20:45,710 --> 02:20:47,770
"Let's build a great life together"

1823
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:51,790
"Thank you for being part of my life"

1824
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:55,750
I'm sure I'll be like,
"Hey, I'm your Mommy"

1825
02:21:11,140 --> 02:21:15,020
Why don't each of you ask the women some questions ?

1826
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:18,000
No need
--Seriously

1827
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:20,970
Matsumoto,
ask them a question

1828
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:25,270
What do you call that,

1829
02:21:25,270 --> 02:21:28,110
that breathing technique
they use while giving birth ?

1830
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:30,580
Can you show me how that goes ?

1831
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:56,500
Breathing Technique

1832
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,500
She's for real

1833
02:21:44,250 --> 02:21:46,420
I can tell she's done this before

1834
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:11,560
Hamada,
Let's make this our last question

1835
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:14,520
How's your morning sickness ?

1836
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:18,450
It's pretty much stabilized,
and I'm used to it now

1837
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:30,300
Still having morning sickness ?

1838
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:24,000
I'm OK now,
but initially I had a tough time

1839
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:30,610
I'm expecting it to happen soon,
but so far so good.

1840
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:38,190
The way he talks is irritating

1841
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,040
You mean, she hasn't gotten sick yet ?

1842
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:48,400
I don't think so
and she's due this month

1843
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:51,840
OK, it's time to point out
who the mole is

1844
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:54,680
We told you
we already knew the minute they walked in

1845
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:58,890
Everyone Picks No.3 !!

1846
02:23:01,410 --> 02:23:05,650
Here's the correct answer!!

1847
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:14,430
Correct Answer: No. 2

1848
02:23:12,670 --> 02:23:14,570
The mole is No. 2

1849
02:23:14,830 --> 02:23:15,700
What ?
-- Huh ?

1850
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:16,870
What about No. 3 ?

1851
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,300
Let me touch your stomach

1852
02:23:19,970 --> 02:23:21,340
Yeah, she's for real

1853
02:23:21,970 --> 02:23:24,810
Cut it out,
Stop touching me

1854
02:23:28,080 --> 02:23:30,720
He's nothing other than
a huge middle aged man

1855
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:36,520
7:00pm
It's been 10 hours since the start

1856
02:23:36,520 --> 02:23:38,760
Time to observe surgery

1857
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:41,030
My butt hurts

1858
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:48,600
Do you know where Denny's is ?

1859
02:23:49,530 --> 02:23:51,300
No, that's Dunkin' Donuts

1860
02:23:57,810 --> 02:23:59,200
Itsuji ItaoPresents BLACK JACK !!

1861
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:03,080
Itsuji Itao Presents BLACK JACK !!

1862
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,090
What's with this sound effect ?

1863
02:24:10,300 --> 02:24:11,580
He forgot something

1864
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:16,000
He Forgot His Cell Phone

1865
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:25,990
Was he charging his cell phone ?

1866
02:24:27,210 --> 02:24:29,030
He left some change here, too

1867
02:24:29,030 --> 02:24:30,520
Damn, that's a nice stack of change

1868
02:24:33,460 --> 02:24:35,120
This way to the operating room

1869
02:24:36,750 --> 02:24:37,910
This way

1870
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,070
I see, we'll be observing from this room

1871
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:43,500
This is impressive

1872
02:24:43,930 --> 02:24:45,120
Pretty cool

1873
02:24:49,450 --> 02:24:52,000
Surgeon:
Ichiro Mizuki

1874
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,300
There's that guy

1875
02:24:56,900 --> 02:24:59,880
We're just about ready
to start

1876
02:25:00,470 --> 02:25:01,960
Good luck everyone

1877
02:25:04,010 --> 02:25:04,860
Anesthetic please

1878
02:25:05,360 --> 02:25:06,300
ZEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETTTT !!!

1879
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:11,600
Scalpel

1880
02:25:11,650 --> 02:25:13,320
ZEEEETTT !!

1881
02:25:19,700 --> 02:25:20,000
Sweat

1882
02:25:20,300 --> 02:25:21,720
ZEEETT !!

1883
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:28,740
Doctor, do you need the  surgical scissors ?

1884
02:25:28,740 --> 02:25:30,170
Scissors, ZEEETT !!!!

1885
02:25:35,050 --> 02:25:37,040
Nobody needs any "ZEEEETT!!" right now

1886
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,990
What kind of surgery is this ?

1887
02:25:42,210 --> 02:25:46,160
Doctor, his blood pressure is at a critical level

1888
02:25:46,550 --> 02:25:47,710
Stop the bleeding
Stop the bleeding

1889
02:25:47,710 --> 02:25:49,420
ZEEEETT !!!!

1890
02:25:51,130 --> 02:25:52,490
Cardiopulmonary arrest

1891
02:25:52,490 --> 02:25:54,070
Cardio !!!
ZEEEEEEEEEETT !!!!

1892
02:25:54,070 --> 02:25:55,460
Massage ZEEETTT !!

1893
02:25:55,910 --> 02:25:56,630
ZET !

1894

ZET !

1895
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:00,110
Go away, ZET !!!

1896
02:26:00,750 --> 02:26:01,490
ZET !

1897
02:26:02,790 --> 02:26:04,000
ZEEEETT !!!

1898
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:08,110
I pronounce this patient dead

1899
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:10,560
Dead Patient !!

1900
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:12,290
He's dead ?

1901
02:26:12,290 --> 02:26:14,500
Well, you can't be successful every time

1902
02:26:14,510 --> 02:26:16,200
Are you serious ?

1903
02:26:16,350 --> 02:26:18,200
They're just gonna leave him there ?

1904
02:26:18,300 --> 02:26:20,000
I thought he was one of the best surgeons...

1905
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:27,000
2nd Urine Test

1906
02:26:27,470 --> 02:26:29,030
Way too much

1907
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:33,400
How much can he piss a day ?

1908
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:36,910
Where are you taking that anyway ?

1909
02:26:36,910 --> 02:26:38,280
Operating room...

1910
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:50,500
Translation by Shibatabread

1911
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:48,400
That's the operating room

1912
02:26:53,300 --> 02:26:54,920
Don't go in there

1913
02:26:55,150 --> 02:26:56,400
They're operating in there

1914
02:26:56,950 --> 02:26:57,970
Don't go in there

1915
02:26:58,350 --> 02:27:02,270
7:30pm
It's been 10 and a half hours since the start

1916
02:27:03,800 --> 02:27:06,560
The nurses visit another exam room

1917
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:09,900
Please, come right in

1918
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:13,530
Doctor:
Heipo

1919
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:17,420
The internal medicine department
is a good place to observe

1920
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:20,060
how doctors exam their patients

1921
02:27:20,730 --> 02:27:21,980
Next patient, please

1922
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:28,800
Come right in

1923
02:27:28,950 --> 02:27:30,000
Thanks

1924
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:32,580
What brought you here today ?

1925
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:35,950
I'm feeling a little feverish

1926
02:27:36,580 --> 02:27:38,080
and flushed

1927
02:27:39,170 --> 02:27:42,330
Let me listen to your heart then

1928
02:27:46,850 --> 02:27:49,190
Let me get a little closer
so I can hear better

1929
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:52,530
Excuse me
--Don't worry

1930
02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:54,100
Doctor, what're you doing ?

1931
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:55,380
Bump !

1932
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:01,640
Let me check your throat then

1933
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:03,010
Open up wide, please

1934
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:03,930
Open wide

1935
02:28:04,530 --> 02:28:05,270
Open wider

1936
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:06,610
Looks good

1937
02:28:06,610 --> 02:28:07,360
Yes
yes
yes

1938
02:28:07,800 --> 02:28:08,850
Ouch!

1939
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:20,650
You don't need to get so close

1940
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:28,500
I've never seen such an unprofessional doctor

1941
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:29,340
I'll get it right

1942
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:31,380
No, get away from me

1943
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:32,810
I've had enough

1944
02:28:33,730 --> 02:28:36,260
I can't blame her
--Of course, she's pissed

1945
02:28:37,710 --> 02:28:41,340
I suppose I need to write an apology letter

1946
02:28:41,330 --> 02:28:47,030
Doctor Heipo Needs to Write an Apology Letter

1947
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:44,600
Can you guys come with me ?

1948
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:47,300
I don't think we're qualified
We're new here

1949
02:28:47,830 --> 02:28:51,340
I don't think this is any of our business
It's yours

1950
02:28:52,180 --> 02:28:53,180
I don't want to go

1951
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:55,590
You guys need to help me

1952
02:28:56,050 --> 02:29:00,920
Heipo writes an apology letter
and delivers it to the patient

1953
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:04,480
You will have to read it to her
like you really mean it

1954
02:29:04,480 --> 02:29:06,360
or it won't work

1955
02:29:10,330 --> 02:29:11,680
Look, she's still mad

1956
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:14,320
She Cannot Subdue Her Anger

1957
02:29:16,450 --> 02:29:20,480
Could you give him a chance
to read his apology letter ?

1958
02:29:23,890 --> 02:29:28,500
Heipo Reads His Apology Letter

1959
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:26,070
Alright

1960
02:29:26,070 --> 02:29:27,680
This is a very serious letter

1961
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:32,520
I, the world famous Doctor Heipo,

1962
02:29:33,310 --> 02:29:37,150
would like to give a sincere apology to
my patient, Megumi,

1963
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:40,400
for my inappropriate behavior

1964
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:47,300
The public perceives Megumi as a smart woman
with many talents

1965
02:29:47,690 --> 02:29:52,740
but she's nothing more than a former
pin-up girl

1966
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:56,050
who can sandwich things with her boobs

1967
02:29:59,500 --> 02:30:00,500
This isn't cool

1968
02:30:00,510 --> 02:30:02,510
Not cool at all

1969
02:30:02,850 --> 02:30:04,190
Isn't this supposed to an apology ?

1970
02:30:05,960 --> 02:30:07,840
And why are WE gettin' punished for it ?

1971
02:30:08,350 --> 02:30:09,680
Let me finish the rest

1972
02:30:11,290 --> 02:30:14,780
There have also been a lot of magazine articles

1973
02:30:14,780 --> 02:30:18,500
that say she
"Sleeps around with Assistant Directors"

1974
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:28,510
We have nothing to do with this letter !

1975
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:33,770
How is that an apology ?

1976
02:30:34,100 --> 02:30:35,990
Just let me finish the rest, please

1977
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:40,600
There are a lot of magazine articles

1978
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:43,010
that say she
"Sleeps with Assistant Directors"

1979
02:30:44,170 --> 02:30:45,790
If she is such a whore

1980
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:59,480
Seriously, Heipo
Get it right

1981
02:31:00,060 --> 02:31:01,670
OK
I'll finish this up

1982
02:31:02,950 --> 02:31:07,790
When Megumi looks at me
with her cheap, blow-up doll-like face

1983
02:31:16,760 --> 02:31:18,280
That's enough !!

1984
02:31:22,670 --> 02:31:25,790
I have seen Megumi many times

1985
02:31:25,790 --> 02:31:28,130
getting into the station-wagon

1986
02:31:28,830 --> 02:31:33,080
and I thought,
"I can probably get her for about $250"

1987
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:36,120
Perhaps that is where the problem lies

1988
02:31:36,770 --> 02:31:39,080
Anyhow, you have to give credit to a girl

1989
02:31:39,080 --> 02:31:41,270
who went up the ladder of the entertainment world

1990
02:31:41,270 --> 02:31:43,990
with only her boobs

1991
02:31:50,300 --> 02:31:51,900
I'm not gonna help you with this

1992
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:56,650
How the hell is this an apology ?

1993
02:31:56,650 --> 02:31:57,700
It's legit

1994
02:31:57,800 --> 02:31:59,160
Apology not accepted

1995
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:02,530
Get the hell out of here !

1996
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:04,050
Get out !

1997
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:05,560
Let's go

1998
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:06,890
Get out !

1999
02:32:06,890 --> 02:32:08,180
You asked for it

2000
02:32:09,970 --> 02:32:11,270
Ouch !

2001
02:32:12,490 --> 02:32:14,400
You nurses, stay here

2002
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:16,170
Nurses are told to stay

2003
02:32:16,170 --> 02:32:17,430
Get back in here

2004
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:20,800
Nobodys' ever treated me like that

2005
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:23,790
I came here because of their good reputation

2006
02:32:24,890 --> 02:32:26,320
What're you gonna do about this ?

2007
02:32:26,320 --> 02:32:29,290
These four nurses will do anything you please

2008
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:31,100
We're very sorry about this

2009
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:32,230
You mean, ANYTHING ?

2010
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:39,190
I have this set of push-buttons

2011
02:32:41,210 --> 02:32:43,730
Megumi Presents 4 Push-Buttons

2012
02:32:43,730 --> 02:32:46,730
Each read
"Do Not Press !"

2013
02:32:46,730 --> 02:32:51,460
Reminiscent of a Past Episode

2014
02:32:52,250 --> 02:32:54,830
What's up with the Push-Buttons ?!

2015
02:32:55,880 --> 02:32:57,640
They say not to press it

2016
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:00,460
Matsumoto, come and press it

2017
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:03,550
You would do ANYTHING, right ?

2018
02:33:05,490 --> 02:33:06,940
OK, I'll pick this one

2019
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:09,200
Press it

2020
02:33:16,710 --> 02:33:19,800
Matsumoto Receives Muay Thai Kick

2021
02:33:23,800 --> 02:33:26,500
This is the worst punishment yet !

2022
02:33:39,530 --> 02:33:40,290
Not cool

2023
02:33:41,770 --> 02:33:42,830
That looked painful

2024
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:46,010
I'd forgotten how painful it was

2025
02:33:48,400 --> 02:33:50,200
Matsumoto

2026
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:51,830
Pick another one

2027
02:33:52,800 --> 02:33:56,900
God, how can I top what just happened ?

2028
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:00,090
Matsumoto, pick another one

2029
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,100
You know what ?

2030
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:11,310
The way she keeps picking me,
I can't help but to think the worst

2031
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:16,350
And how does this guy not get butt-slapped
for laughing ?

2032
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:23,000
Matsumoto, hurry up

2033
02:34:23,150 --> 02:34:23,680
Yes

2034
02:34:24,700 --> 02:34:25,120
Here I go

2035
02:34:26,050 --> 02:34:27,750
Um..
OK, I'm going for it

2036
02:34:32,930 --> 02:34:36,570
Matsumoto Receives Muay Thai Kick

2037
02:34:37,050 --> 02:34:39,300
Enjoying it

2038
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:46,910
My ass is tingling

2039
02:34:46,910 --> 02:34:47,580
Tingling

2040
02:34:47,580 --> 02:34:48,760
TINGLING

2041
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:51,230
This is pretty hell-ish

2042
02:34:51,540 --> 02:34:52,590
Did that hurt, Matsumoto ?

2043
02:34:52,590 --> 02:34:53,590
Yes, it hurt

2044
02:34:53,590 --> 02:34:54,580
Really hurt ?

2045
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:55,300
Yes

2046
02:34:55,940 --> 02:34:58,800
Should you go one more time, Matsumoto ?

2047
02:34:59,670 --> 02:35:01,640
It's here.
Hell has arrived.

2048
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:05,100
Having him kicked twice like that
made for good television, right ?

2049
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:06,050
Yes, it did

2050
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:09,410
How would a comedian react
a third time ?

2051
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:14,360
I suppose the third time is a charm ?

2052
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:18,540
Matsumoto, how about it ?

2053
02:35:25,270 --> 02:35:28,250
It's unlikely you'd get it a third time straight

2054
02:35:29,350 --> 02:35:31,610
You should be OK this time

2055
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:34,100
Can I switch it with that one ?

2056
02:35:34,250 --> 02:35:34,720
Go ahead

2057
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,030
Here goes nothing

2058
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:49,520
Matsumoto Receives Muay Thai Kick

2059
02:35:49,520 --> 02:35:50,680
Leave me alone !

2060
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:56,580
Really enjoying this

2061
02:35:56,650 --> 02:35:57,680
This really hurts

2062
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:13,820
I cut the cheese

2063
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:15,710
Farted

2064
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:19,100
Your butt is paralyzed

2065
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:20,530
That stinks

2066
02:36:21,590 --> 02:36:23,410
You guys can all leave now

2067
02:36:23,410 --> 02:36:25,540
I just let one nasty fart

2068
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:29,410
Your butt's in bad shape after three kicks

2069
02:36:29,410 --> 02:36:30,820
I'm expecting better service next time

2070
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:32,820
Take care now

2071
02:36:33,480 --> 02:36:35,770
Crazy Muay Thai Kick x 3

2072
02:36:36,540 --> 02:36:37,490
That was incredible

2073
02:36:38,780 --> 02:36:40,380
Three times in a row ?

2074
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:41,970
The first kick looked the worst

2075
02:36:41,970 --> 02:36:43,150
Do you remember that first one ??

2076
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:50,500

Sexy Doctor:
Taka Kato

2078
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:50,960
He's the famous sexy doc

2079
02:36:56,300 --> 02:36:57,600
He looks more like a patient

2080
02:36:57,800 --> 02:37:05,930
Greetings From the Sexy Doc

2081
02:36:59,190 --> 02:37:00,970
I still don't get what he's doing here

2082
02:37:05,800 --> 02:37:08,800
They are big, aren't they

2083
02:37:17,800 --> 02:37:19,360
I smell something fishy

2084
02:37:23,700 --> 02:37:25,530
Hamada san, I'd watch out for him

2085
02:37:25,530 --> 02:37:26,870
You've got a short skirt

2086
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:37,130
Sexy Doc Smells His Fingers

2087
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:34,330
What the...?

2088
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:37,020
What is that smell ?

2089
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:44,800
I don't know
but his fingers stunk !

2090
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:57,100
What the hell is this all about ?

2091
02:37:57,300 --> 02:37:58,850
Does it stink ?

2092
02:37:59,800 --> 02:38:01,450
He was up to no good

2093
02:38:01,450 --> 02:38:03,540
I got a little carried away with her

2094
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:09,380
How long have we been doing this series ?

2095
02:38:09,380 --> 02:38:11,110
This whole "Batsu Game" series

2096
02:38:11,500 --> 02:38:14,150
Our first one was about 6 years ago

2097
02:38:11,530 --> 02:38:18,600
Onsen (Public Bath) Batsu Game in 2003

2098
02:38:14,450 --> 02:38:15,770
That was 6 years ago ?

2099
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:20,730
Filming these for 24 hours only gets
tougher and tougher

2100
02:38:21,730 --> 02:38:25,930
Do you think we can play
Oni Gokko (Tag) for 24 hours ??

2101
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:30,900
Oni Gokko (Tag) in 2000

2102
02:38:26,340 --> 02:38:28,820
No way
We're too old for that

2103
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:29,950
I'm afraid not

2104
02:38:29,950 --> 02:38:30,970
Impossible

2105
02:38:30,970 --> 02:38:33,120
We played that almost 10 years ago

2106
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:34,040
Yes

2107
02:38:34,340 --> 02:38:35,820
it was, sir.....

2108
02:38:35,820 --> 02:38:37,100
Why did you just "sir" me ?

2109
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,300
It's just me, y'know

2110
02:38:55,800 --> 02:38:57,440
Man, they have a lot of energy

2111
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:00,230
They're mostly kids straight outta high school

2112
02:39:01,100 --> 02:39:03,120
No wonder they're so zippy

2113
02:39:04,030 --> 02:39:05,130
They're at the age

2114
02:39:05,130 --> 02:39:07,300
when they can chase girls around

2115
02:39:11,790 --> 02:39:14,500
You were smirking big time just now

2116
02:39:15,510 --> 02:39:16,750
No, no, no, no

2117
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,500
Stop accusing me of that

2118
02:39:22,050 --> 02:39:24,020
I was just doing this

2119
02:39:26,590 --> 02:39:28,690
You're on the verge of laughing

2120
02:39:30,430 --> 02:39:31,670
Don't be changing it now

2121
02:39:39,270 --> 02:39:40,480
I almost fell for that, too

2122
02:39:43,590 --> 02:39:44,080
That hurts

2123
02:39:44,850 --> 02:39:46,200
Hurts, hurts, hurts

2124
02:39:46,380 --> 02:39:47,260
But seriously

2125
02:39:47,260 --> 02:39:50,010
You guys need to chuck,
I mean check on Hamada...

2126
02:39:52,350 --> 02:39:54,280
You can tell we're getting tired

2127
02:39:57,070 --> 02:39:58,650
The fatigue's getting to us

2128
02:39:59,300 --> 02:40:02,520
You can't stutter like that

2129
02:40:07,300 --> 02:40:08,500
Look, he's laughing again

2130
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:13,200
8:30pm
It's been 11 and a half hours since the start

2131
02:40:15,170 --> 02:40:18,540
Why don't we go back to the front
to help some patients ?

2132
02:40:18,840 --> 02:40:20,380
We're getting busy

2133
02:40:22,850 --> 02:40:24,050
Have a seat

2134
02:40:26,500 --> 02:40:30,100
3 Ballerinas

2135
02:40:33,190 --> 02:40:34,390
Sorry, guys

2136
02:40:34,390 --> 02:40:37,480
Ballerina:
Shoji Murakami

2137
02:40:36,170 --> 02:40:37,170
I'm OK

2138
02:40:37,170 --> 02:40:38,140
We were worried sick

2139
02:40:38,140 --> 02:40:40,410
Doc said I'm eating too much

2140
02:40:40,810 --> 02:40:42,080
What ?

2141
02:40:43,150 --> 02:40:45,750
And forget about
our upcoming outdoor recital

2142
02:40:46,920 --> 02:40:48,720
I've been targeted

2143
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:50,420
by the local hunters

2144
02:40:59,230 --> 02:41:01,330
I didn't ask for that story

2145
02:41:03,430 --> 02:41:08,240
Doc also said to leave this alone
and just let it rot and fall off on its own

2146
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:12,780
Or, I'll have to risk losing
part of my small intestine

2147
02:41:15,780 --> 02:41:17,880
Thank you very much

2148
02:41:18,350 --> 02:41:20,780
Give Doc my best regards

2149
02:41:21,320 --> 02:41:23,220
And I'm doing super good

2150
02:41:34,300 --> 02:41:35,830
"Super good ?"

2151
02:41:42,610 --> 02:41:45,610
Please take this performance as
our thanks to you

2152
02:41:49,650 --> 02:41:53,880
"Thank You" Performance by the Ballerinas

2153
02:42:03,490 --> 02:42:05,830
OUCH !!

2154
02:42:16,910 --> 02:42:19,110
His shouting gets me every time

2155
02:42:23,250 --> 02:42:26,180
I wish you luck in becoming
great nurses

2156
02:42:26,780 --> 02:42:27,790
Thanks

2157
02:42:29,150 --> 02:42:34,260
I used to make a living making kitchen knifes

2158
02:42:35,030 --> 02:42:37,800
And then I made a big career change

2159
02:42:49,940 --> 02:42:51,180
Let's go

2160
02:42:56,350 --> 02:42:59,520
9:00pm
It's been 12 hours since the start

2161
02:42:59,780 --> 02:43:01,590
Time for dinner

2162
02:43:02,290 --> 02:43:03,190
What's this ?

2163
02:43:03,690 --> 02:43:05,090
It's NABE ! (Clay Pot)

2164
02:43:05,890 --> 02:43:12,300
Time for dinner
"Chicken Clay Pot"

2165
02:43:13,330 --> 02:43:15,230
Having worked non stop

2166
02:43:16,100 --> 02:43:18,040
the nurses need a nutritious meal

2167
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:21,070
to regain their physical and mental strength

2168
02:43:21,870 --> 02:43:22,540
Looks good

2169
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:27,650
The four dive into the soup

2170
02:43:29,210 --> 02:43:30,850
Their faces look relaxed

2171
02:43:31,980 --> 02:43:35,820
Until this man makes a comment
which spoils the mood

2172
02:43:36,490 --> 02:43:38,790
What happened to all the protein?

2173
02:43:39,990 --> 02:43:41,660
You guys ate all the chicken

2174
02:43:41,660 --> 02:43:43,530
I don't think I had any

2175
02:43:43,930 --> 02:43:46,300
I had one piece
--I had one

2176
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:47,530
I also just had one

2177
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:50,370
You're lying !!

2178
02:43:50,370 --> 02:43:56,340
Argument Over Who Ate the Chicken

2179
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:53,330
You ate it all !!

2180
02:43:53,330 --> 02:43:54,570
I don't think so

2181
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,670
There was tons of chicken in there

2182
02:43:56,920 --> 02:43:57,700
You ate them then !

2183
02:43:57,700 --> 02:43:59,050
I didn't get to have any !!

2184
02:43:59,050 --> 02:44:00,760
What's with the anger ?

2185
02:44:02,820 --> 02:44:04,820
I just completely forgot about the rule

2186
02:44:12,150 --> 02:44:13,790
You busted out very casually

2187
02:44:15,590 --> 02:44:16,800
How's it going in that pot ?

2188
02:44:19,010 --> 02:44:30,600
Piece of stuck noodle

2189
02:44:20,930 --> 02:44:22,630
Nobody has manners around here ?

2190
02:44:23,500 --> 02:44:25,000
You dropped it  You pick that up

2191
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:26,890
Tanaka, it was you

2192
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,620
Let's pick it up together
--Get outta here

2193
02:44:29,900 --> 02:44:31,260
Both of you or just you

2194
02:44:32,140 --> 02:44:37,720
Argument Over Who Will Remove the Stuck Noodle

2195
02:44:34,010 --> 02:44:36,610
You did it    You take care of it

2196
02:44:37,640 --> 02:44:39,810
Hamada, I saw you drop it there

2197
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:41,840
See, I think you should pick it up

2198
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:44,230
He's seriously lying right now

2199
02:44:45,800 --> 02:44:47,000
I didn't even touch the noodles

2200
02:44:47,420 --> 02:44:48,800
Hamada dropped the noodle

2201
02:44:49,930 --> 02:44:53,520
And Hamada ate 4 pieces of chicken
--Get outta here

2202
02:44:55,800 --> 02:44:57,690
Why is he lying like this ?

2203
02:45:00,900 --> 02:45:01,970
I had one piece

2204
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:15,340
Who wouldn't laugh at that ?

2205
02:45:20,820 --> 02:45:22,600
What the hell was that eerie scream ?

2206
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:26,640
Hamada san
please pick up the noodle

2207
02:45:27,330 --> 02:45:29,220
Here I go
Here it is

2208
02:45:30,550 --> 02:45:32,840
I seriously only had one piece of chicken

2209
02:45:33,330 --> 02:45:35,020
Here's my first piece of chicken

2210
02:45:35,420 --> 02:45:36,760
Liar !

2211
02:45:36,760 --> 02:45:37,910
Why're you lying ?

2212
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:39,560
I'd say this is "almost" my first piece chicken

2213
02:45:39,560 --> 02:45:41,300
What do you mean, "almost" ??

2214
02:45:42,020 --> 02:45:43,270
How many have you had ?

2215
02:45:43,390 --> 02:45:44,900
This is my 4th one

2216
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:00,810
Matsumoto will soon be punished
for his lies !!

2217
02:46:20,690 --> 02:46:21,520
What the hell ?

2218
02:46:22,370 --> 02:46:23,520
That sucked

2219
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:28,780
Where'd you hit just now ?

2220
02:46:29,800 --> 02:46:30,960
This is so uncalled for

2221
02:46:34,150 --> 02:46:36,600
Arguments and lies ruin an otherwise

2222
02:46:36,810 --> 02:46:37,840
perfect meal

2223
02:46:38,760 --> 02:46:41,700
The road to becoming nurses is about

2224
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:43,950
to become much tougher !!

2227
02:46:53,810 --> 02:46:55,060
I've got a bad feeling about this

2228
02:46:56,680 --> 02:46:59,050
Here's this city's most reputable veterinary hospital

2229
02:46:59,050 --> 02:47:01,940
Ohnishi Animal Hospital

2230
02:47:03,290 --> 02:47:09,290
And here's Dr. Jimmy Ohnishi
offering care to domestic and farm animals

2231
02:47:09,290 --> 02:47:13,010
Let's observe his typical work day

2232
02:47:13,990 --> 02:47:15,510
Next patient, please

2233
02:47:20,180 --> 02:47:21,720
Come this way

2234
02:47:23,380 --> 02:47:24,300
Hi Doctor

2235
02:47:24,610 --> 02:47:25,710
What seems to be the problem ?

2236
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:29,240
He seems to be having issues with his bowels

2237
02:47:29,240 --> 02:47:30,060
I see

2238
02:47:31,530 --> 02:47:38,990
Yukio (Sheep)
Condition: Hemorrhoids

2239
02:47:33,130 --> 02:47:34,560
I'm afraid it's hemorrhoids

2240
02:47:34,560 --> 02:47:35,370
Let me check it out then

2241
02:47:35,370 --> 02:47:36,190
Thank you, doctor

2242
02:47:36,830 --> 02:47:38,360
Here we go
Alright

2243
02:47:38,850 --> 02:47:40,150
Good boy
good boy

2244
02:47:41,510 --> 02:47:42,100
I got you

2245
02:47:42,490 --> 02:47:44,190
Will you stay put ?

2246
02:47:45,030 --> 02:47:46,070
Let me check it out

2247
02:47:46,610 --> 02:47:48,470
Nee~
Nee~

2248
02:47:49,800 --> 02:47:51,380
Nee~
Nee~

2249
02:48:01,670 --> 02:48:02,700
What the....??

2250
02:48:02,700 --> 02:48:04,080
Why does he keep saying Nee~Nee ~ ??

2251
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,520
He means to say,
Mee~
Mee~

2252
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:11,750
He's got
Nee~ Nee~  mixed up with
Mee~Mee~

2253
02:48:11,750 --> 02:48:12,690
He's saying Nee~

2254
02:48:12,810 --> 02:48:13,610
Nee~
Nee~

2255
02:48:17,260 --> 02:48:18,700
Let me spray some water

2256
02:48:31,190 --> 02:48:32,790
We were so held back

2257
02:48:34,710 --> 02:48:35,820
This is getting tough

2258
02:48:39,980 --> 02:48:41,150
This is just the beginning, isn't it ?

2259
02:48:41,150 --> 02:48:42,230
I don't want anymore

2260
02:48:43,700 --> 02:48:45,990
I wanna go home
home
home
home

2261
02:48:46,270 --> 02:48:48,350
Let me apply some medicine here

2262
02:48:48,350 --> 02:48:52,280
Here it is, Yukio

2263
02:48:52,990 --> 02:48:54,480
Bear with me

2264
02:49:02,590 --> 02:49:04,290
The feces is stuck

2265
02:49:05,990 --> 02:49:09,290
The feces is stuck

2266
02:49:14,290 --> 02:49:15,290
Damn it

2267
02:49:15,810 --> 02:49:17,070
Not good

2268
02:49:21,930 --> 02:49:23,590
We're in bad shape

2269
02:49:26,990 --> 02:49:30,770
Who is he telling the
"The Feces is stuck"?

2270
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:34,000
This medicine should do the trick

2271
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:37,710
The Hemorrhoids Are Cured

2272
02:49:37,890 --> 02:49:38,720
Please let this be over

2273
02:49:38,720 --> 02:49:39,630
Let's finish this

2274
02:49:39,630 --> 02:49:42,090
Next patient, please
-- NO !!!!

2275
02:49:48,280 --> 02:49:52,950
Her pet monkey Nana chan
has lost its appetite

2276
02:49:53,530 --> 02:49:58,140
Doctor Onishi tests it
with bananas

2277
02:50:14,190 --> 02:50:15,440
Why is he eating it ?

2278
02:50:21,230 --> 02:50:22,690
Why is he eating it ?

2279
02:50:25,180 --> 02:50:26,690
He doesn't need to eat the bananas

2280
02:50:30,450 --> 02:50:32,210
Why are they eating together ?

2281
02:50:32,440 --> 02:50:34,180
The monkey seems to be doing OK

2282
02:50:34,180 --> 02:50:36,470
Her appetite is fine

2283
02:50:36,470 --> 02:50:38,380
Let's say bye to the doctor

2284
02:50:39,510 --> 02:50:40,650
Thank you very much

2285
02:50:40,650 --> 02:50:41,590
Thanks, Nana chan

2286
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:44,020
Nana chan
Give me a kiss

2287
02:50:54,040 --> 02:50:56,480
She bitch-slapped him hard

2288
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:03,310
Man, how do I get outta this ??

2289
02:51:03,310 --> 02:51:08,040
Monkey's Lost Appetite is Cured

2290
02:51:08,040 --> 02:51:09,270
Let this be over, please

2291
02:51:09,930 --> 02:51:12,390
Next patient, please
--No !!

2292
02:51:19,990 --> 02:51:21,020
What brought you here today ?

2293
02:51:21,340 --> 02:51:27,990
Pea chan (Pig)
Condition: Not lactating

2294
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:24,790
She has been unable to lactate these days

2295
02:51:24,800 --> 02:51:27,680
and her babies aren't getting' enough nutrition

2296
02:51:27,720 --> 02:51:28,590
I see

2297
02:51:28,710 --> 02:51:37,180
Doctor Onishi Begins His
Pig Lactation Technique

2298
02:51:40,990 --> 02:51:45,070
Her nipples are pretty swollen
Could you look at them to make sure ?

2299
02:51:45,070 --> 02:51:46,140
I got it

2300
02:52:20,950 --> 02:52:24,760
Could you suck on them harder ??

2301
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:47,410
Well

2302
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:48,490
Well..

2303
02:52:49,090 --> 02:52:51,090
I sucked some beads out

2304
02:52:51,320 --> 02:52:54,790
Or perhaps it was fiber?

2305
02:52:54,790 --> 02:52:58,540
Yes, there was some fiber stuck inside

2306
02:53:04,390 --> 02:53:06,680
"He sucked out beads ?"

2307
02:53:21,810 --> 02:53:22,820
Well,

2308
02:53:24,290 --> 02:53:26,330
Yes, the beads are out now

2309
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:31,160
Some kind of fiber

2310
02:53:33,090 --> 02:53:36,270
And her nipples seem to be OK

2311
02:53:36,850 --> 02:53:39,150
Look, this nipple is getting erect

2312
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:41,970
This nipple is getting erect

2313
02:53:54,760 --> 02:53:55,700
Damn it !!

2314
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:57,260
Seriously, no more !!

2315
02:53:57,260 --> 02:53:59,660
Thanks to the doctor

2316
02:53:59,660 --> 02:54:01,530
All of the animals have been cured

2317
02:54:02,180 --> 02:54:03,390
Thank God !

2318
02:54:03,390 --> 02:54:04,170
Alright !

2319
02:54:06,190 --> 02:54:07,310
That was tough

2320
02:54:08,610 --> 02:54:10,710
It cannot possibly get tougher than that

2321
02:54:11,970 --> 02:54:14,280
That was just amazing

2322
02:54:17,990 --> 02:54:20,850
Yamasaki Returns From Getting His Vitamin Replenishment

2323
02:54:20,850 --> 02:54:22,640
He's rejoining you guys

2324
02:54:23,690 --> 02:54:26,890
Do you realize how lucky you are ??

2325
02:54:28,130 --> 02:54:28,880
Are you talking about HIM ??

2326
02:54:28,880 --> 02:54:29,590
Yeah, HIM !!

2327
02:54:30,130 --> 02:54:30,630
I see

2328
02:54:30,890 --> 02:54:31,990
That MAN

2329
02:54:32,290 --> 02:54:34,740
You missed a lot actually

2330
02:54:34,910 --> 02:54:36,460
Thanks for waiting

2331
02:54:36,780 --> 02:54:38,090
Here's your pizza

2332
02:54:40,990 --> 02:54:43,560
I wasn't quite sure how I should approach this but..

2333
02:54:44,290 --> 02:54:47,080
We got a call about 40 minutes ago

2334
02:54:47,500 --> 02:54:50,030
Pizza Cap:
Kazuo Nishio

2335
02:54:53,300 --> 02:54:55,520
Let me borrow your phone, yea ?

2336
02:55:05,990 --> 02:55:09,410
Does he have to talk like a construction worker ?

2337
02:55:09,410 --> 02:55:11,330
Hey, this is Kazuo

2338
02:55:11,730 --> 02:55:13,150
Is Matsubara there ?

2339
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:15,130
What?
He's out and about ?

2340
02:55:15,130 --> 02:55:16,450
What a moron !

2341
02:55:16,450 --> 02:55:18,980
Alright then,
Check this for me, will you ?

2342
02:55:19,420 --> 02:55:20,590
I got this pizza here

2343
02:55:21,430 --> 02:55:22,960
The size is large

2344
02:55:22,960 --> 02:55:24,300
Yeah, L for Large size

2345
02:55:24,300 --> 02:55:26,580
Half seafood
and half supreme

2346
02:55:26,580 --> 02:55:27,990
Yeah, that's their approach

2347
02:55:37,580 --> 02:55:39,150
Will you do something about the way you talk ?

2348
02:55:39,190 --> 02:55:40,940
Why're you "approaching" pizza ?

2349
02:55:43,490 --> 02:55:44,570
Yeah, there's some corn on it

2350
02:55:48,360 --> 02:55:50,310
And here's the address

2351
02:55:51,070 --> 02:55:52,570
12 - 3 - 6

2352
02:55:54,440 --> 02:55:55,740
I don't see the mistake

2353
02:55:56,110 --> 02:55:57,350
Will you grab my map then?

2354
02:55:57,350 --> 02:55:58,910
Yeah, it's next to the dresser

2355
02:56:00,300 --> 02:56:03,210
OK, you go up the path
Up, up, up and up

2356
02:56:04,050 --> 02:56:06,340
You come to a stop
and hang a left, you see ?

2357
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:17,720
Seriously, don't worry about it

2358
02:56:23,510 --> 02:56:25,030
We'll take the pizza

2359
02:56:28,010 --> 02:56:30,390
So it's 12 - 6 - 3 ?

2360
02:56:30,390 --> 02:56:32,250
I see, so the number 3 and 6 got switched ?

2361
02:56:32,580 --> 02:56:35,580
Well, why don't I just have you guys eat this then

2362
02:56:35,580 --> 02:56:38,380
You can have two slices each, yeah ?

2363
02:56:39,640 --> 02:56:41,230
You guys ever need any more pizza

2364
02:56:41,230 --> 02:56:44,100
Just ask for Kazuo
at the Pizza Cap, yeah ?

2365
02:56:44,100 --> 02:56:47,110
You write it like it sounds.
Yeah, I'm the oldest brother as you can imagine

2366
02:56:44,500 --> 02:56:50,500

02:56:47,150 --> 02:56:48,190
Make sure to follow that procedure

2368
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:50,490
Thanks !

2369
02:56:57,250 --> 02:56:58,490
Phew! I'm spared.

2370
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:07,240
Damn it

2371
02:57:08,070 --> 02:57:09,500
There's a guy like that in every town

2372
02:57:09,600 --> 02:57:10,900
Yes indeed

2373
02:57:11,440 --> 02:57:15,480
10:00pm
It's been 13 hours since the start

2374
02:57:19,800 --> 02:57:23,350
This is a good time to observe the Anesthesia Department

2375
02:57:23,500 --> 02:57:24,910
Shall we ?

2376
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:26,750
This won't be easy, I'm sure

2377
02:57:27,970 --> 02:57:29,840
I have a bad feeling about this

2378
02:57:34,800 --> 02:57:35,830
See ??

2379
02:57:35,830 --> 02:57:38,150
I knew this was gonna be bad

2380
02:57:40,450 --> 02:57:41,260
Wow

2381
02:57:43,450 --> 02:57:45,040
Why don't you line up over there and wait

2382
02:57:45,910 --> 02:57:47,550
This looks impossible

2383
02:57:48,210 --> 02:57:49,450
This is gonna be terrible

2384
02:57:50,670 --> 02:57:51,700
I can't go through with this

2385
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:53,630
What am I gonna do ?

2386
02:57:54,170 --> 02:57:55,360
See, I knew it'd be her

2387
02:57:57,150 --> 02:58:01,060
Hot Anesthesiologist:
Ayako Nishikawa

2388
02:58:01,810 --> 02:58:03,310
Nice to see you all
--You, too

2389
02:58:03,400 --> 02:58:08,250
You are here to observe and study

2390
02:58:08,250 --> 02:58:10,580
a new advancement in anesthesiology

2391
02:58:11,220 --> 02:58:12,820
As you can see

2392
02:58:13,900 --> 02:58:16,410
we have three patients
who have been anesthetized

2393
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:18,950
Let's observe them one by one

2394
02:58:20,600 --> 02:58:22,940
Patient 1:
Yosuke Saito

2395
02:58:27,940 --> 02:58:30,080
Patient 2:
Yuki Himura

2396
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:33,470
He's completely under
and would not wake up

2397
02:58:36,220 --> 02:58:38,970
Patient 3:
Producer Nakamura

2398
02:58:47,020 --> 02:58:49,040
Wait a minute!
It was Yamasaki !!

2399
02:58:49,300 --> 02:58:52,250
Yamasaki is SAFE

2400
02:58:57,400 --> 02:58:59,240
How did Yamasaki get away with that.....??

2401
02:58:59,240 --> 02:59:01,530
These three patients

2402
02:59:01,750 --> 02:59:03,000
won't wake up

2403
02:59:03,050 --> 02:59:04,700
under any circumstances.

2404
02:59:05,120 --> 02:59:07,030
First Experiment:
The Slipper

2405
02:59:14,910 --> 02:59:16,300
I'm absolutely not cool with this !

2406
02:59:23,560 --> 02:59:24,800
He will not wake up

2407
02:59:31,900 --> 02:59:33,710
See ?
The anesthetic is working

2408
02:59:38,060 --> 02:59:39,750
This isn't cool
--Not fair

2409
02:59:40,980 --> 02:59:41,970
Impossible

2410
02:59:49,500 --> 02:59:51,240
Because the patient is under the effects of
anesthesia

2411
02:59:51,240 --> 02:59:52,630
He will not wake up

2412
03:00:00,190 --> 03:00:01,560
Stop it !

2413
03:00:15,500 --> 03:00:18,200
Doctor, you have gone too far

2414
03:00:28,950 --> 03:00:33,990
Second Experiment:
Duct Tape

2415
03:00:34,500 --> 03:00:35,600
Doctor

2416
03:00:35,800 --> 03:00:38,220
That's going to leave some marks tomorrow

2417
03:00:44,700 --> 03:00:47,240
Eyebrow hair

2418
03:00:55,750 --> 03:00:57,540
Doctor, this is not right

2419
03:01:00,660 --> 03:01:03,100
He looks pretty bad-ass without eyebrows

2420
03:01:04,480 --> 03:01:08,540
Third Experiment:
The Water Balloon

2421
03:01:07,340 --> 03:01:08,060
What's that ?

2422
03:01:09,670 --> 03:01:11,520
I'm inserting an empty balloon in his mouth

2423
03:01:40,550 --> 03:01:45,520
Fourth Experiment:
Stag Beetle

2424
03:01:53,090 --> 03:01:54,510
Doctor

2425
03:01:54,880 --> 03:01:56,030
Check out his leg

2426
03:01:56,960 --> 03:01:58,000
What's up with his leg !?

2427
03:01:58,870 --> 03:01:59,810
His leg !

2428
03:02:00,100 --> 03:02:01,400
Look !

2429
03:02:11,500 --> 03:02:13,640
He can get his nose pierced now

2430
03:02:13,640 --> 03:02:15,040
Do you all understand the effects of the drug now ?

2431
03:02:15,170 --> 03:02:16,360
We all got it
--Yes

2432
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:18,100
Thank you for your time, doctor

2433
03:02:18,190 --> 03:02:20,400
You get us every time, doctor

2434
03:02:22,010 --> 03:02:23,810
10:30pm
It's been 13 hours and a half since the start

2435
03:02:24,680 --> 03:02:26,500
There is no rest in sight

2436
03:02:30,180 --> 03:02:35,340
A Patient Buzzes for Nurses' Help !!

2437
03:02:35,690 --> 03:02:36,470
Yes

2438
03:02:41,900 --> 03:02:42,590
Got it

2439
03:02:44,250 --> 03:02:45,860
A Patient needs our help in Room 301

2440
03:02:45,860 --> 03:02:46,640
Let's go

2441
03:02:47,110 --> 03:02:48,040
Is it urgent ?

2442
03:02:51,080 --> 03:02:51,970
Damn, it's cold

2443
03:02:58,530 --> 03:02:59,310
Close the door behind you

2444
03:03:00,790 --> 03:03:01,980
Line up over here

2445
03:03:05,430 --> 03:03:08,740
This high school girl just had
plastic surgery

2446
03:03:08,740 --> 03:03:15,650
Witness the Results of Plastic Surgery !!

2447
03:03:10,670 --> 03:03:14,250
I will be taking off her bandages
Watch closely

2448
03:03:25,550 --> 03:03:28,740
High School Girl (?)
Naomasa Musaka

2449
03:03:29,230 --> 03:03:30,010
Cute !!

2450
03:03:30,190 --> 03:03:32,040
Mucchi ??
--Yes, it's me

2451
03:03:44,080 --> 03:03:45,380
Am I cute ?

2452
03:03:45,450 --> 03:03:46,670
Cute !!

2453
03:03:48,600 --> 03:03:49,300
Really ?

2454
03:03:50,210 --> 03:03:51,100
You're super cute !

2455
03:03:51,500 --> 03:03:54,900
I don't look a little like an orangutan ??

2456
03:03:55,920 --> 03:03:59,080
Your breasts are huge !!

2457
03:04:00,120 --> 03:04:05,200
The High School Girl Got A Boob Job !!

2458
03:04:03,030 --> 03:04:03,750
Do you wanna see them ?

2459
03:04:04,400 --> 03:04:04,960
Let me see them  !!

2460
03:04:07,840 --> 03:04:09,320
They're Huge !!

2461
03:04:12,210 --> 03:04:12,740
What the....?

2462
03:04:14,500 --> 03:04:15,490
Nothing's changed !

2463
03:04:15,900 --> 03:04:17,230
They look normal

2464
03:04:28,510 --> 03:04:30,960
Why don't we go pick up some boys ?

2465
03:04:31,800 --> 03:04:32,860
Let's go

2466
03:04:37,770 --> 03:04:38,840
I'm happy for her

2467
03:04:45,030 --> 03:04:50,260
Another Patient Buzzes the Nurses !!

2468
03:04:49,020 --> 03:04:50,140
Hello ?

2469
03:04:54,900 --> 03:04:55,360
Room 201 ?

2470
03:04:56,800 --> 03:04:58,770
Let's head over to Room 201

2471
03:04:59,670 --> 03:05:00,640
Seriously ?

2472
03:05:04,270 --> 03:05:07,310
You guys are on your own this time

2473
03:05:08,700 --> 03:05:10,400
So you won't be coming in with us ?

2474
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,840
Patient:
Eiji Bando

2475
03:05:30,500 --> 03:05:33,190
Hamada,
you know that I used to be a professional baseball player, right ?

2476
03:05:33,750 --> 03:05:34,220
Yes, of course

2477
03:05:35,590 --> 03:05:37,590
I was one of the best,
an amazing player

2478
03:05:39,250 --> 03:05:40,400
I was so good in high school

2479
03:05:40,700 --> 03:05:43,100
Matsuzaka (Boston Redsox)
has nothing on me

2480
03:05:43,410 --> 03:05:45,480
I still hold the record for
most strikeouts

2481
03:05:45,600 --> 03:05:47,500
even after 90 years of high school ball competitions

2482
03:05:47,520 --> 03:05:49,600
I'm still No. 1 in Japan

2483
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:50,620
Amazing, isn't it ?

2484
03:05:51,190 --> 03:05:56,490
Bando Recites his Glorious Past

2485
03:05:55,290 --> 03:05:56,690
And I'm just telling you the facts

2486
03:05:56,690 --> 03:05:57,860
Endo used to play baseball

2487
03:05:57,860 --> 03:05:59,000
Oh, you did ?!!

2488
03:05:59,760 --> 03:06:00,960
Then you must know about my records

2489
03:06:01,730 --> 03:06:02,770
Yea, I know your record

2490
03:06:02,770 --> 03:06:03,730
83 strike outs

2491
03:06:03,730 --> 03:06:04,770
Amazing, isn't it ?

2492
03:06:04,770 --> 03:06:05,770
Amazing, huh ?

2493
03:06:06,470 --> 03:06:07,570
You know what though ?

2494
03:06:09,070 --> 03:06:15,040
Mr. Shigeo Nagashima was drafted
into the Giants years before I was drafted

2495
03:06:15,750 --> 03:06:18,350
His initial salary was $180K

2496
03:06:19,050 --> 03:06:21,520
That's a lot of dough for a kid just outta high school

2497
03:06:21,680 --> 03:06:22,890
Amazing, huh ?

2498
03:06:22,990 --> 03:06:24,850
And the following year,
Sadaharu Oh got drafted

2499
03:06:25,390 --> 03:06:26,890
Then the following year

2500
03:06:26,890 --> 03:06:30,090
was this kid fresh out of high school
with a shaved head

2501
03:06:37,500 --> 03:06:39,270
Why did you call us ??

2502
03:06:41,500 --> 03:06:44,510
Why did he buzz us in ??

2503
03:06:44,500 --> 03:06:50,500
Translation by Shibatabread

2504
03:06:46,610 --> 03:06:49,650
Pay attention, guys !!

2505
03:06:50,480 --> 03:06:53,150
Because of my record-breaking record in high school

2506
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:56,190
My initial salary was $200k

2507
03:06:56,290 --> 03:06:58,490
Kids outta high school were barely making $12k a year !

2508
03:06:58,490 --> 03:07:00,720
But life is cruel sometimes

2509
03:07:08,550 --> 03:07:10,420
What's this have to do with anything ??

2510
03:07:13,470 --> 03:07:14,350
Anyway,

2511
03:07:15,320 --> 03:07:17,770
I signed a contract for $200k

2512
03:07:18,450 --> 03:07:20,700
10 minutes later

2513
03:07:19,080 --> 03:07:20,650
I started selling juke boxes door to door

2514
03:07:21,460 --> 03:07:25,500
and, of course, everyone knew me then

2515
03:07:25,700 --> 03:07:28,610
I drove along the coast, hitting all the resorts

2516
03:07:29,010 --> 03:07:30,490
and I sold 7 juke boxes !

2517
03:07:31,310 --> 03:07:34,600
15 minutes later

2518
03:07:31,540 --> 03:07:34,850
And there were these guys called "Scorekeepers"

2519
03:07:34,850 --> 03:07:37,520
They would collect data on every pitch I threw

2520
03:07:37,300 --> 03:07:41,840
20 minutes later

2521
03:07:38,290 --> 03:07:41,460
I was in the sauna for about 10 minutes and ready to leave

2522
03:07:41,460 --> 03:07:43,750
then guess who shows up ?
Mr. Nagashima

2523
03:07:43,750 --> 03:07:46,190
I couldn't leave him behind
He's a super star

2524
03:07:46,570 --> 03:07:48,330
And he sat right next to me

2525
03:08:03,500 --> 03:08:05,800
He's still yapping ?

2526
03:08:05,800 --> 03:08:06,890
Let's go back already

2527
03:08:07,440 --> 03:08:08,640
No, no, I'm not finished yet

2528
03:08:08,700 --> 03:08:12,500
Bando Isn't Finished

2529
03:08:13,200 --> 03:08:15,440
Seriously, we've had enough

2530
03:08:16,080 --> 03:08:20,000
If we let him, he'll eventually talk
about the "Magical Brain Power"

2531
03:08:20,500 --> 03:08:22,080
He sure can talk

2532
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:26,600
Hard to believe he used to be a professional ball player

2533
03:08:27,200 --> 03:08:28,380
My butt hurts

2534
03:08:28,850 --> 03:08:29,710
Mine, too

2535
03:08:33,080 --> 03:08:38,150
Another Call from a Patient !!

2536
03:08:35,210 --> 03:08:35,900
Again ??

2537
03:08:36,890 --> 03:08:37,700
Hello

2538
03:08:38,800 --> 03:08:39,880
Room 201 ?

2539
03:08:42,730 --> 03:08:48,830
Another Call from Eiji Bando !!

2540
03:08:45,260 --> 03:08:46,320
Call from Room 201

2541
03:08:46,710 --> 03:08:47,450
Shall we ?

2542
03:08:47,830 --> 03:08:49,330
No, no, no, no way

2543
03:08:49,900 --> 03:08:51,000
We already took care of Room 201

2544
03:08:51,100 --> 03:08:52,200
It's our duty

2545
03:08:52,800 --> 03:08:54,370
Why don't you two just go ?

2546
03:08:58,600 --> 03:09:00,490
I wasn't quite finished yet

2547
03:09:01,250 --> 03:09:03,000
We have other patients to tend to

2548
03:09:04,300 --> 03:09:06,700
Remember when my team, the Dragons, won the championship ?

2549
03:09:06,940 --> 03:09:08,010
They hadn't won in 52 years

2550
03:09:08,660 --> 03:09:09,650
The Dragon's theme song

2551
03:09:10,200 --> 03:09:11,310
is a rip-off

2552
03:09:11,500 --> 03:09:14,000
They stole it from the show, "Moonlight Mask"

2553
03:09:14,320 --> 03:09:16,320
The ball club never got into trouble for that

2554
03:09:17,160 --> 03:09:20,100
10 minutes later

2555
03:09:17,830 --> 03:09:20,620
You see kids wearing baseball caps and stuff

2556
03:09:20,620 --> 03:09:23,200
But guess whose idea it was to market other stuff
like t-shirts and pajamas ?

2557
03:09:23,350 --> 03:09:24,900
It was ME !!

2558
03:09:25,100 --> 03:09:27,020
But the whole thing was poorly funded

2559
03:09:27,340 --> 03:09:30,400
15 minutes later

2560
03:09:27,960 --> 03:09:30,560
And finally,
I got to host the show "Magical Brain Power"

2561
03:09:30,560 --> 03:09:33,670
You know that ?
You know, right ??

2562
03:09:34,170 --> 03:09:38,060
I signed a bigger contract than
both Mr. Nagashima and Mr. Oh

2563
03:09:38,590 --> 03:09:41,630
And I was the first Japanese pitcher
to earn a win with ONE pitch !!

2564
03:09:42,040 --> 03:09:43,380
The first One

2565
03:10:03,830 --> 03:10:05,500
You still babbling ??

2566
03:10:06,120 --> 03:10:07,590
I'm not finished !!

2567
03:10:11,500 --> 03:10:13,400
He would talk 'til the morning for sure

2568
03:10:13,780 --> 03:10:15,600
Hamada and Endo,
you guys just go next time

2569
03:10:16,190 --> 03:10:18,740
No, no, no, no
it'll be Matsumoto and Endo

2570
03:10:19,090 --> 03:10:19,970
Get outta here !!

2571
03:10:20,590 --> 03:10:22,060
I'm gettin' slapped way too much

2572
03:10:22,500 --> 03:10:23,900
Me and Yamasaki have gotten the least

2573
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,390
Tanaka, why don't you go by yourself?

2574
03:10:25,830 --> 03:10:27,390
Shut the hell up

2575
03:10:29,860 --> 03:10:30,220
Scary

2576
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:33,090
I was just kiddin'

2577
03:10:38,500 --> 03:10:41,550
I gotta hit the bathroom

2578
03:10:42,910 --> 03:10:48,990
His "gut-less" induced diarrhea
puts him out of the game until the next morning

2579
03:10:49,450 --> 03:10:53,490
But there's no rest for the rest of them !!

2580
03:10:55,330 --> 03:10:59,550
The real "Hell" has just begun !!

2581
03:11:00,830 --> 03:11:02,350
Alright then

2582
03:11:02,500 --> 03:11:04,930
There was some footage you hadn't seen. right, Yamasaki ??

2583
03:11:04,930 --> 03:11:09,710
Yeah, like the Jimmy San playing the vet
Just incredible

2584
03:11:10,340 --> 03:11:19,500
Jimmy Onishi

2585
03:11:10,990 --> 03:11:14,280
I bet you got slapped twice as much as
what we just saw

2586
03:11:14,500 --> 03:11:15,670
Yea, I believe so

2587
03:11:16,360 --> 03:11:17,000
Really

2588
03:11:20,010 --> 03:11:22,060
The audience here is kind of signaling us

2589
03:11:22,680 --> 03:11:23,600
to ignore you

2590
03:11:27,130 --> 03:11:29,240
Why do they have to do that to me ?

2591
03:11:29,500 --> 03:11:30,760
I wanted to talk to you,

2592
03:11:31,210 --> 03:11:33,500
but the audience is like,
"No, don't !"

2593
03:11:34,580 --> 03:11:36,240
I was glad I wasn't there though

2594
03:11:37,840 --> 03:11:38,780
Let's get this straight,

2595
03:11:39,280 --> 03:11:40,870
Mr. Bando seriously talked for a long time

2596
03:11:41,320 --> 03:11:44,120
Yamasaki, you were starting to become really sick at that point

2597
03:11:44,700 --> 03:11:45,850
That was bad for me

2598
03:11:46,870 --> 03:11:47,980
I almost fainted

2599
03:11:49,370 --> 03:11:50,490
You weren't laughing one bit

2600
03:11:50,500 --> 03:11:51,830
Not one bit

2601
03:11:52,310 --> 03:11:53,300
Yea, hahahahaha

2602
03:11:53,300 --> 03:11:54,210
Hey !

2603
03:11:57,500 --> 03:11:59,950
Everyone's like
"Let's ignore him !"

2604
03:12:00,120 --> 03:12:01,300
We just told you that

2605
03:12:08,040 --> 03:12:09,890
My stomach is in pain

2606
03:12:10,800 --> 03:12:12,780
Can I be dismissed ?

2607
03:12:13,870 --> 03:12:17,680
11:00pm
It's been 14 hours since the start

2608
03:12:20,400 --> 03:12:24,840
Another Call for the Nurses !!

2609
03:12:25,700 --> 03:12:27,280
Room 302 ?

2610
03:12:27,500 --> 03:12:28,500
Let's go

2611
03:12:28,700 --> 03:12:30,300
Puuu !!

2612
03:12:30,400 --> 03:12:33,340
I'm not coming after all

2613
03:12:36,500 --> 03:12:38,020
Here it is

2614
03:12:45,400 --> 03:12:48,990
Mikisa Azuma Called for the Nurses

2615
03:12:51,740 --> 03:12:53,360
Hey, could you do me a favor, please ?

2616
03:12:54,700 --> 03:12:56,540
I need to exchange this

2617
03:12:56,750 --> 03:12:58,280
for a new bottle

2618
03:13:08,500 --> 03:13:11,380
Won't you ever learn ?

2619
03:13:14,860 --> 03:13:17,230
Let's go back
We're going back

2620
03:13:20,830 --> 03:13:22,490
Are you really this stupid ?

2621
03:13:22,830 --> 03:13:25,090
Nice surface tension

2622
03:13:29,200 --> 03:13:31,100
Why'd you save so much, moron ?

2623
03:13:31,200 --> 03:13:33,400
How much water do you drink ?

2624
03:13:34,080 --> 03:13:34,980
Be careful with this one

2625
03:13:41,900 --> 03:13:43,850
Could you bring back three...

2626
03:13:43,850 --> 03:13:45,550
No, more like four bottles, please ?

2627
03:13:45,650 --> 03:13:48,000
That guy has zero ability to learn

2628
03:13:51,500 --> 03:13:54,860
All he has to do is dump it out
more frequently

2629
03:13:57,800 --> 03:14:01,050
Baumkuchen

2630
03:14:00,530 --> 03:14:02,910
I gotta tell you what I just remembered

2631
03:14:04,030 --> 03:14:07,200
When both of us were in middle-school

2632
03:14:08,050 --> 03:14:10,380
I said, "Hamada, this is delicious, have some"

2633
03:14:10,500 --> 03:14:12,950
and I handed a piece of Baumkuchen to you

2634
03:14:13,160 --> 03:14:17,210
You FLAT OUT rejected it, saying
"I hate Baumkuchen"

2635
03:14:17,500 --> 03:14:19,320
I SO CLEARLY remember it

2636
03:14:19,700 --> 03:14:22,490
But how many have you eaten today ??

2637
03:14:24,700 --> 03:14:26,780
Liar !!

2638
03:14:30,200 --> 03:14:32,300
Who wouldn't like Baumkuchen !?

2639
03:14:32,300 --> 03:14:34,000
I was so shocked !

2640
03:14:36,040 --> 03:14:37,500
I was FLABBERGASTED !!

2641
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:39,560
You're so bullshitting !

2642
03:14:39,800 --> 03:14:42,220
That day you rejected it, I said

2643
03:14:42,220 --> 03:14:45,320
"Who wouldn't like Baumkuchen !? "

2644
03:14:45,450 --> 03:14:47,750
Yeah, the one who tells the story usually remembers better

2645
03:14:47,860 --> 03:14:51,050
I'm sure you said it,
and you just don't remember

2646
03:14:51,050 --> 03:14:52,230
Is that so ?

2647
03:14:52,770 --> 03:14:55,110
I was waiting for you at the door to your house

2648
03:14:55,230 --> 03:14:58,010
I had one in my mouth
and one in my hand

2649
03:14:58,620 --> 03:15:01,000
I was thinking on my way that...

2650
03:15:16,700 --> 03:15:18,100
So you wanted to give one to Hamada San

2651
03:15:18,100 --> 03:15:19,150
Yeah, I handed one to him

2652
03:15:19,300 --> 03:15:21,050
and he kinda snickered at me

2653
03:15:21,250 --> 03:15:24,210
Don't punish me for this
I'm only telling a story

2654
03:15:24,210 --> 03:15:25,130
This is how he snickered

2655
03:15:25,400 --> 03:15:29,500
As if to tell me
"You don't even know that I hate Baumkuchen ?"

2656
03:15:33,990 --> 03:15:36,500
I think you're fabricating this story a bit

2657
03:15:36,990 --> 03:15:39,150
You want us to sympathize you ?

2658
03:15:42,340 --> 03:15:44,880
I'm sure it happened
--Yes, you said so

2659
03:15:45,580 --> 03:15:47,200
Here's another similar story

2660
03:15:47,490 --> 03:15:49,920
This happened at the door to his house as well

2661
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:55,440
Anyway, Hamada's family didn't know
about eating bread with mayonnaise

2662
03:15:55,850 --> 03:15:57,940
So I more or less told him about it

2663
03:15:58,420 --> 03:16:00,460
He initially was like
"That sounds disgusting"

2664
03:16:00,870 --> 03:16:03,980
But when I fixed it for him at my house,
he got really addicted

2665
03:16:05,250 --> 03:16:08,060
And when I went over to his house couple days later

2666
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:10,600
I still don't get this, but...

2667
03:16:13,230 --> 03:16:15,300
They had this bread that looked

2668
03:16:15,820 --> 03:16:17,500
straight outta the freezer

2669
03:16:29,820 --> 03:16:31,210
I can't continue

2670
03:16:31,490 --> 03:16:34,500
Could you please finish this story ?

2671
03:16:34,550 --> 03:16:36,500
We'd like to hear the end, please ?

2672
03:16:36,590 --> 03:16:38,520
Out of freezer comes

2673
03:16:39,260 --> 03:16:40,530
this bread that looks so frozen

2674
03:16:41,380 --> 03:16:43,260
and when he puts mayonnaise on it

2675
03:16:44,500 --> 03:16:50,500
Translation by Shibatabread
www.shibatabread.com

2676
03:16:45,630 --> 03:16:49,700
You were like,
"This is how you eat a piece of bread"

2677
03:17:00,220 --> 03:17:01,250
Are you seriously telling the truth ??

2678
03:17:01,250 --> 03:17:03,060
I'm telling you nothing but the truth

2679
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:05,200
But hear me out

2680
03:17:05,400 --> 03:17:07,220
Eating a piece of bread with mayonnaise

2681
03:17:07,220 --> 03:17:08,320
is something I showed him how to do

2682
03:17:08,320 --> 03:17:09,790
But...

2683
03:17:09,950 --> 03:17:11,680
He didn't do it right

2684
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:15,200
But I'm still sort of forced to

2685
03:17:15,250 --> 03:17:17,850
take the credit that I don't necessarily want now

2686
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:22,010
Anyway, you were munching on this slushy bread...

2687
03:17:34,400 --> 03:17:36,300
You were nice to Hamada San back then

2688
03:17:36,500 --> 03:17:42,970
Those two incidents (the Baumchuhen and Bread)
both happened within a month of each other

2689
03:17:51,780 --> 03:17:53,950
Did you two live close ?

2690
03:17:53,950 --> 03:17:54,690
Yes, we were neighbors

2691
03:17:55,590 --> 03:17:56,200
Yes

2692
03:17:56,300 --> 03:17:57,360
No funny stories between you guys ?

2693
03:17:57,360 --> 03:17:58,580
Do we ?

2694
03:17:58,850 --> 03:17:59,750
Not really but

2695
03:18:00,190 --> 03:18:03,190
I have to say Endo was much more mature

2696
03:18:03,620 --> 03:18:08,580
for his age, especially with dating girls and stuff

2697
03:18:09,800 --> 03:18:12,090
You can say that I leanred everything about sex

2698
03:18:12,090 --> 03:18:14,180
from Endo

2699
03:18:22,660 --> 03:18:23,760
So Endo showed you the ropes

2700
03:18:37,050 --> 03:18:40,190
The MRI results on Endo and Tanaka

2701
03:18:40,920 --> 03:18:42,640
didn't turn out right

2702
03:18:44,710 --> 03:18:46,620
and need to be re-done

2703
03:18:47,440 --> 03:18:49,100
Would you two come with me ?

2704
03:18:49,670 --> 03:18:50,670
MRI ?

2705
03:18:52,250 --> 03:18:53,290
See you guys

2706
03:18:53,700 --> 03:18:54,910
That MRI again ?

2707
03:19:00,090 --> 03:19:01,610
Why couldn't you get it right the first time ?

2708
03:19:02,200 --> 03:19:04,700
Downtown are Left Alone

2709
03:19:11,020 --> 03:19:13,090
These guys are playing dirty

2710
03:19:13,740 --> 03:19:14,460
Playing dirty

2711
03:19:15,190 --> 03:19:15,900
How come ?

2712
03:19:16,780 --> 03:19:19,620
They purposely took Cocoriko away from us

2713
03:19:20,920 --> 03:19:25,260
to create an awkward atmosphere for us

2714
03:19:28,040 --> 03:19:31,130
Well, I don't know if there's any ill will on their part

2715
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:37,190
Endo, why don't you go first ?

2716
03:19:37,500 --> 03:19:38,820
Is this for real ?

2717
03:19:39,150 --> 03:19:40,400
Tanaka, you wait here

2718
03:19:46,400 --> 03:19:49,700
Why don't you bust a move for me ?

2719
03:19:50,400 --> 03:19:52,500
I'm not that good at dancing

2720
03:19:53,800 --> 03:19:55,300
Just give me a little taste

2721
03:20:08,750 --> 03:20:11,700
How ancient are you ??

2722
03:20:17,490 --> 03:20:21,600
Start of Scan

2723
03:20:27,450 --> 03:20:31,550
Wajima Koichi is in the MRI

2724
03:20:36,350 --> 03:20:40,000
This place gets to me mentally

2725
03:20:47,250 --> 03:20:48,570
Hey, listen

2726
03:20:49,380 --> 03:20:50,850
What ?

2727
03:20:51,350 --> 03:20:53,700
Why aren't you getting married ?

2728
03:20:58,400 --> 03:21:00,130
Are you insane ?

2729
03:21:00,600 --> 03:21:02,700
Why that topic ?

2730
03:21:09,660 --> 03:21:11,860
This isn't cool

2731
03:21:28,750 --> 03:21:31,470
This is impossible

2732
03:21:31,470 --> 03:21:32,900
Seriously

2733
03:21:37,670 --> 03:21:39,050
Hey, hear me out

2734
03:21:40,190 --> 03:21:40,900
Listen

2735
03:21:41,990 --> 03:21:43,080
Yeah ?

2736
03:21:44,400 --> 03:21:47,100
Don't you want kids ?

2737
03:21:47,200 --> 03:21:48,840
I would be fine

2738
03:21:49,780 --> 03:21:51,200
either way

2739
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:52,670
Is that right ?

2740
03:21:52,900 --> 03:21:54,680
Then hurry up and get married

2741
03:21:55,660 --> 03:21:56,750
We'll see...

2742
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:01,200
Were you actually doing something ?
--Yes, we were

2743
03:22:01,200 --> 03:22:03,260
We had to redo our MRI's

2744
03:22:04,170 --> 03:22:06,150
I would love to see anyone

2745
03:22:06,800 --> 03:22:08,610
who can get through that
without laughing

2746
03:22:08,850 --> 03:22:10,500
While I was in there,

2747
03:22:10,850 --> 03:22:13,830
I overheard Matsumoto San screaming a few times

2748
03:22:14,520 --> 03:22:15,690
Because Hamada plays dirty

2749
03:22:17,100 --> 03:22:19,000
He asked me to dance, so I obliged

2750
03:22:19,260 --> 03:22:20,710
Ask him to dance for you

2751
03:22:22,620 --> 03:22:24,130
Could you show me your dance, please ?

2752
03:22:24,730 --> 03:22:26,270
I'm telling you that I'm not that great

2753
03:22:26,720 --> 03:22:27,820
That's OK

2754
03:22:28,410 --> 03:22:30,560
It's not everyday that
we can see you bust a move

2755
03:22:44,700 --> 03:22:46,680
I guess dancing can come in many forms but...

2756
03:22:52,670 --> 03:22:53,820
You know what's making it worse?

2757
03:22:53,900 --> 03:22:55,200
That short skirt of yours

2758
03:22:56,100 --> 03:22:57,160
I think you're right

2759
03:23:00,760 --> 03:23:04,860
Leave it to Our Nurses !
24/7 Assistance

2760
03:23:05,740 --> 03:23:10,190
We are here to take
the patients' calls 24/7

2761
03:23:10,830 --> 03:23:14,180
Let's see how they're doing

2762
03:23:14,900 --> 03:23:17,400
Here's Nurse Ishikawa

2763
03:23:18,800 --> 03:23:22,440
And Nurse Jimmy Onishi

2764
03:23:26,800 --> 03:23:29,260
Yoshida San from Room 204
How can I help you ?

2765
03:23:31,430 --> 03:23:33,800
I'm having a DNA testing tomorrow

2766
03:23:35,060 --> 03:23:38,340
But what's DNA ?

2767
03:23:40,210 --> 03:23:41,610
This is for tomorrow's test ?

2768
03:23:43,200 --> 03:23:43,900
Well..

2769
03:23:46,700 --> 03:23:49,160
It'll hurt a little bit
but good luck to you

2770
03:23:51,560 --> 03:23:53,550
What does DNA stand for ?

2771
03:23:55,890 --> 03:23:56,640
Well..

2772
03:23:58,890 --> 03:23:59,580
Tiny

2773
03:23:59,860 --> 03:24:00,580
Micro

2774
03:24:02,870 --> 03:24:03,780
Assistant ?

2775
03:24:06,260 --> 03:24:07,220
Assistant

2776
03:24:13,310 --> 03:24:14,630
What the hell is he talking about ?

2777
03:24:19,250 --> 03:24:21,150
What is it exactly ?

2778
03:24:22,290 --> 03:24:23,220
Well...

2779
03:24:23,810 --> 03:24:24,880
So the D is

2780
03:24:25,680 --> 03:24:26,410
the D stands for

2781
03:24:29,210 --> 03:24:30,020
Discount

2782
03:24:36,630 --> 03:24:39,120
Will you not do that, Endo ?

2783
03:24:44,670 --> 03:24:46,640
Discount No Assistant

2784
03:24:47,800 --> 03:24:49,250
It basically means that

2785
03:24:50,420 --> 03:24:51,040
Well..

2786
03:24:51,750 --> 03:24:52,210
Well...

2787
03:24:53,790 --> 03:24:56,030
"I'll let you have it for cheaper"

2788
03:25:04,400 --> 03:25:06,390
He's just out of control

2789
03:25:09,730 --> 03:25:11,100
We're all going down fast

2790
03:25:11,720 --> 03:25:13,080
I don't like this

2791
03:25:13,230 --> 03:25:14,220
Hello nurse

2792
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:18,520
How do you pronounce this ?

2793
03:25:18,810 --> 03:25:19,820
Will you teach me ?

2794
03:25:19,880 --> 03:25:20,650
Go for it

2795
03:25:22,570 --> 03:25:23,980
Here's the spelling

2796
03:25:25,500 --> 03:25:26,330
Tur

2797
03:25:27,380 --> 03:25:29,120
ber

2798
03:25:32,620 --> 03:25:33,550
cu

2799
03:25:34,420 --> 03:25:35,640
lin

2800
03:25:36,470 --> 03:25:38,700
(Turberculin Reaction)

2801
03:25:41,170 --> 03:25:42,450
How do you read this ?

2802
03:25:44,660 --> 03:25:45,890
Ah, I see

2803
03:25:46,680 --> 03:25:47,180
I got it

2804
03:25:47,800 --> 03:25:49,700
This is in the form of a question

2805
03:25:59,390 --> 03:26:00,990
Wow, that wore me out

2806
03:26:03,030 --> 03:26:07,230
Midnight
It's been 15 hours since the start

2807
03:26:08,840 --> 03:26:10,110
Bang !

2808
03:26:10,900 --> 03:26:12,820
Man, is that irritating

2809
03:26:12,820 --> 03:26:14,350
Yeah, people coming in and out

2810
03:26:14,450 --> 03:26:16,900
I can't help but notice, y' know ?

2811
03:26:17,200 --> 03:26:21,700
Did you just TAMEGUCHI (speak impolitely to one's seniors)
to Matsumoto San ??

2812
03:26:22,170 --> 03:26:23,910
Huh ?

2813
03:26:25,750 --> 03:26:27,810
Bang !

2814
03:26:28,300 --> 03:26:29,710
Man, is that irritating

2815
03:26:29,890 --> 03:26:30,870
Yeah, people coming in and out

2816
03:26:30,870 --> 03:26:32,400
I can't help but notice, y' know ?

2817
03:26:32,420 --> 03:26:33,900
Help but notice, y' know ?

2818
03:26:33,950 --> 03:26:35,530
Y' Know ?

2819
03:26:35,700 --> 03:26:37,180
Matsumoto San

2820
03:26:37,180 --> 03:26:38,180
Did you feel like

2821
03:26:38,800 --> 03:26:42,880
I spoke to you impolitely just then?

2822
03:26:45,020 --> 03:26:46,020
Yeah

2823
03:26:46,500 --> 03:26:50,380
I think he was just stunned
and couldn't react quickly enough

2824
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:55,900
I didn't mean to be impolite
to anyone

2825
03:26:57,950 --> 03:27:00,180
It doesn't matter anymore, I guess

2826
03:27:00,820 --> 03:27:04,550
I wouldn't talk that way to the president
of Yoshimoto Co.

2827
03:27:08,910 --> 03:27:10,720
But I might talk to
our producer that way.

2828
03:27:15,770 --> 03:27:17,250
Will you please stop?
No more.

2829
03:27:27,190 --> 03:27:29,120
You guys all did a good job today

2830
03:27:29,700 --> 03:27:32,930
Why don't we walk over to the
dormitory to get some rest ?

2831
03:27:32,930 --> 03:27:33,780
There's a dormitory ?

2832
03:27:34,390 --> 03:27:35,370
Yes

2833
03:27:36,880 --> 03:27:39,820
They leave their work place
and head to the dormitory

2834
03:27:40,300 --> 03:27:41,400
But wait...

2835
03:27:44,260 --> 03:27:45,010
What's going on here ?

2836
03:27:45,930 --> 03:27:47,080
An accident ?

2837
03:27:47,960 --> 03:27:50,540
No, one of the patients has escaped
from the psych ward

2838
03:27:51,090 --> 03:27:52,730
He was last seen around here

2839
03:27:53,300 --> 03:27:54,420
Hey, look !

2840
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:06,500
Psych Ward Patient:
Yoshio Kojima

2841
03:28:13,170 --> 03:28:14,930
Here's my right eye....

2842
03:28:16,890 --> 03:28:18,450
But my left eye...

2843
03:28:20,940 --> 03:28:21,950
opens wider

2844
03:28:22,790 --> 03:28:23,780
But that's none of my business

2845
03:28:24,350 --> 03:28:27,570
none of my business

2846
03:28:28,000 --> 03:28:29,950
Hi, Oh Pa Piiiiii !!!

2847
03:28:37,400 --> 03:28:39,860
Yoshio Nakamura

2848
03:28:40,700 --> 03:28:44,210
Look, he can't quite get into character

2849
03:28:45,020 --> 03:28:46,850
One of the producers...

2850
03:28:48,630 --> 03:28:49,560
is too busy to...

2851
03:28:50,500 --> 03:28:52,560
What's with the pauses ?

2852
03:28:59,700 --> 03:29:02,120
What happend to
"That's none of my business" ??

2853
03:29:03,700 --> 03:29:05,230
He's completely

2854
03:29:05,470 --> 03:29:06,720
forgetting everything

2855
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:08,710
But that's none of my business

2856
03:29:09,400 --> 03:29:11,040
Yes, that should be your business

2857
03:29:11,040 --> 03:29:12,580
This is your business

2858
03:29:12,900 --> 03:29:14,950
Hi, Oh Pa Piii  !!

2859
03:29:28,000 --> 03:29:29,670
I feel bad for Kojima

2860
03:29:35,810 --> 03:29:37,420
I mean, his sidekick sucked

2861
03:29:37,890 --> 03:29:39,250
Here's the dormitory

2862
03:29:44,350 --> 03:29:46,210
It's already past midnight

2863
03:29:46,890 --> 03:29:50,390
The nurses head to the dormitory
to rest their exhausted bodies

2864
03:29:50,920 --> 03:29:57,340
But they have no idea what kind of
terror they are about to face !!

2865
03:29:58,780 --> 03:30:00,010
Here it is

2866
03:30:07,590 --> 03:30:11,610
Black Jack Taking A Power Nap

2867
03:30:15,940 --> 03:30:17,740
Why is he here ?

2868
03:30:38,400 --> 03:30:39,720
Itsuji Itao Presents  BLACK JACK !!

2869
03:30:39,720 --> 03:30:43,680
Itsuji Itao Presents  BLACK JACK !!

2870
03:30:44,990 --> 03:30:46,530
We know already

2871
03:30:49,520 --> 03:30:50,870
We know we're out

2872
03:31:01,350 --> 03:31:02,710
Black Jack cometh once again

2873
03:31:02,890 --> 03:31:04,970
That was his third appearance

2874
03:31:08,700 --> 03:31:10,320
How's it going, guys ?

2875
03:31:10,650 --> 03:31:12,610
Are you serious ??

2876
03:31:12,700 --> 03:31:18,970
Plastic Surgeon:
Chihara Junior

2877
03:31:15,190 --> 03:31:17,030
I'm the plastic surgeon at this hospital

2878
03:31:17,470 --> 03:31:18,160
I'm Chihara

2879
03:31:18,540 --> 03:31:19,130
Hello

2880
03:31:19,790 --> 03:31:20,480
How's it going ?

2881
03:31:21,230 --> 03:31:22,900
How was the training ?

2882
03:31:24,940 --> 03:31:26,140
Matsumoto,
How's it going ?

2883
03:31:27,310 --> 03:31:28,840
Well, let me see...

2884
03:31:30,200 --> 03:31:33,530
It was an exhausting day
doing things I'm not accustomed to

2885
03:31:34,450 --> 03:31:37,510
I assume you had a lot of
nerve-wracking episodes

2886
03:31:37,700 --> 03:31:41,200
And I thought, "Why not help them out
by relieving some of that stress ?"

2887
03:31:42,230 --> 03:31:48,000
Let's start with the annual
New Nurses Welcoming Party !!

Here's some of your senior nurses
who insisted on participating with you tonight

2889
03:31:54,550 --> 03:31:56,170
We don't really need them

2890
03:31:56,700 --> 03:31:57,810

I see "baldness" and "zits"

2894
03:32:15,400 --> 03:32:18,090
You could say that THIS is the time
for nurses to shine !

2895
03:32:18,690 --> 03:32:20,100
Let's show'em how it's done

2896
03:32:20,830 --> 03:32:22,590

2914
03:34:01,650 --> 03:34:04,020
Finish it off with the soda

Burp

2939
03:35:22,790 --> 03:35:25,050
You can't stop burping, can you ?

2940
03:35:23,650 --> 03:35:24,500
Burp

2941
03:35:28,160 --> 03:35:28,860
Burp

2942
03:35:29,550 --> 03:35:30,800
You're not faking that ?

2943
03:35:31,080 --> 03:35:31,660
Burp

2944
03:35:36,160 --> 03:35:37,250
This isn't fair

2945
03:35:40,440 --> 03:35:42,000
How do I not laugh at that ?

2946
03:35:42,820 --> 03:35:44,090

2947
03:35:44,150 --> 03:35:45,050

My throat

2951
03:35:57,400 --> 03:35:58,790
ain't loose

2952
03:36:10,620 --> 03:36:12,220
Your throat ain't loose, right ?

2953
03:36:15,410 --> 03:36:17,640
What the hell's wrong with this guy ?

2954
03:36:19,850 --> 03:36:20,930
Please

2955
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:22,150
Let's get on with the topic

2956
03:36:30,660 --> 03:36:31,690
Give me the topic

2957
03:36:31,800 --> 03:36:32,720

Burp

2964
03:36:50,600 --> 03:36:51,810
What the hell ??

2965
03:36:58,100 --> 03:37:00,710
Who wouldn't laugh at that ??

2966
03:37:01,400 --> 03:37:02,900
My ass hurts

2967
03:37:07,800 --> 03:37:10,460
Let's move on to the next game

2968
03:37:11,020 --> 03:37:16,500
Impersonation Game

Good luck to you

2974
03:37:38,090 --> 03:37:38,890
Stand right here

2975
03:37:40,600 --> 03:37:42,980
Let's start the impersonation

2976
03:37:42,980 --> 03:37:45,050
You two are Beat Takeshi

2977
03:37:45,080 --> 03:38:09,450
Beat Takeshi

2978
03:37:51,200 --> 03:37:52,300
Sports Award !!

2979
03:37:52,750 --> 03:37:53,380
Screw you

2980
03:37:56,380 --> 03:37:58,330
Films!
I'm shooting films !

2981
03:37:59,300 --> 03:38:01,080
Why're you naked again ?

2982
03:38:01,800 --> 03:38:03,340
Kiyoshi !!

2983
03:38:04,100 --> 03:38:05,820
Screw you, Mori !

2984
03:38:05,860 --> 03:38:08,470
Kiyoshi, Damn you!

2985
03:38:10,200 --> 03:38:13,100
They sound nothing like Takeshi

2986
03:38:16,040 --> 03:38:17,950
They suck at this

2987
03:38:23,900 --> 03:38:25,420
Let's say this round was

2988
03:38:25,710 --> 03:38:27,000
a draw.

2989
03:38:27,570 --> 03:38:28,550
It was a very close tie.

2990
03:38:31,750 --> 03:38:32,600
Kiyoshi !!

2991
03:38:33,400 --> 03:38:34,880
Round Two

2992
03:38:37,310 --> 03:38:42,170
Hamada vs. Matsumoto

2993
03:38:42,520 --> 03:38:44,710
Here's who you're going to impersonate

2994
03:38:46,920 --> 03:38:58,760
Keisuke Kuwata

2995
03:38:59,400 --> 03:39:00,600
Who ?

2996
03:39:00,900 --> 03:39:02,860
He's supposed to be Keisuke Kuwata

2997
03:39:13,680 --> 03:39:16,050
Seriously, I don't really know what to do

2998
03:39:17,060 --> 03:39:34,100
Keisuke Kuwata

2999
03:39:34,300 --> 03:39:35,600
What's going on here ?

3000
03:39:50,790 --> 03:39:53,270
He needs to start now

3001
03:39:53,880 --> 03:39:55,130
I'm not starting again

3002
03:39:55,960 --> 03:39:57,360
What ?
I just went !!

3003
03:39:58,490 --> 03:39:59,810
It's only fair

3004
03:40:01,170 --> 03:40:02,990
I'll counter when and if Hamada makes sense

3005
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:11,100
Kuwata Keisuke

3006
03:40:11,180 --> 03:40:13,780
I believe he's supposed to be Keisuke Kuwata

3007
03:40:14,550 --> 03:40:16,360
Do you know who Keisuke Kuwata is ??

3008
03:40:16,650 --> 03:40:17,900
I know who he is

3009
03:40:21,160 --> 03:40:23,750
Does Keisuke Kuwata talk like that ?

3010
03:40:25,550 --> 03:40:26,810
Let's move on

3011
03:40:29,200 --> 03:40:36,320
It's time for the super dramatic
"Packing Tape Stare Down" !!

3012
03:40:39,270 --> 03:40:45,460

Rule:
The Challenger Is Allowed
Only 5 Pieces of Tape

3014
03:41:00,390 --> 03:41:01,410
The first challenger is

3015
03:41:02,380 --> 03:41:05,460
Tanaka Receives the Challenge

3016
03:41:06,100 --> 03:41:07,740
Use only 5 pieces of tape

3017
03:41:08,070 --> 03:41:10,100
I don't care how long they are

3018
03:41:10,200 --> 03:41:11,550
How many have you used so far ?

3019
03:41:11,940 --> 03:41:13,220
Just one

3020
03:41:14,020 --> 03:41:15,760
That's a long strip

3021
03:41:16,100 --> 03:41:17,250
I'm OK to go !!

3022
03:41:17,810 --> 03:41:21,800
Here's your stare-down face challenge

3023
03:41:26,800 --> 03:41:29,700
You're playing dirty
Of course it's funny with that enlarged chin !

3024
03:41:33,880 --> 03:41:36,060
To be fair, his left eye is pretty funny, too

3025
03:41:37,090 --> 03:41:38,830
Kinda creepy

3026
03:41:39,510 --> 03:41:41,420
What the...

3027
03:41:48,780 --> 03:41:54,900
And that will conclude the nurse's welcoming party !!

3028
03:41:57,100 --> 03:41:58,300
That was fun !

3029
03:41:58,500 --> 03:42:00,490
I had a good time but...

3030
03:42:01,630 --> 03:42:04,450
I felt like Mr. Yoshida didn't get to shine...

3031
03:42:07,100 --> 03:42:08,290
I have to second that

3032
03:42:08,800 --> 03:42:11,100
I don't think Mr. Yoshida had much of fun here

3033
03:42:11,400 --> 03:42:12,970
If at all

3034
03:42:12,970 --> 03:42:13,720
Alright then

3035
03:42:14,320 --> 03:42:17,190
Why don't I let you participate in
the Packing Tape Stare Down ?

3036
03:42:18,110 --> 03:42:20,010
I'll even let you use as many pieces of tape as you wish

3037
03:42:20,760 --> 03:42:22,990
Yoshida Receives the Challenge

3038
03:42:23,300 --> 03:42:26,200
Thanks, guys, for letting me have this opportunity

3039
03:42:27,370 --> 03:42:29,110
No problem

3040
03:42:34,430 --> 03:42:35,600
Let me just point this out, Nurse Yoshida

3041
03:42:35,700 --> 03:42:37,750
You can't tape over another piece of tape

3042
03:42:40,100 --> 03:42:40,830
OK

3043
03:42:41,860 --> 03:42:42,420
Let's see it

3044
03:42:43,610 --> 03:42:47,150
Packing Tape Stare-Down !!

3045
03:42:55,530 --> 03:42:57,920
How come your tape looks so powdery ?

3046
03:43:06,450 --> 03:43:08,760
My face repels tape for some reason

3047
03:43:11,500 --> 03:43:14,020
I can't get it to stick to my face

3048
03:43:20,030 --> 03:43:25,180
It's like trying to tape over sand

3049
03:43:39,490 --> 03:43:43,540
1:00am
Time to subject the nurses to some "terror"

3050
03:43:48,060 --> 03:43:50,460
I have a favor to ask you

3051
03:43:52,860 --> 03:43:57,780
I left my house key
at the Nurse Station

3052
03:43:58,440 --> 03:44:01,460
Would Endo and Tanaka
go get it for me, please ?

3053
03:44:01,900 --> 03:44:05,100
Isn't this outside our job description ?

3054
03:44:05,400 --> 03:44:08,090
That's why I'm asking you
as a favor

3055
03:44:11,400 --> 03:44:12,580
If you would

3056
03:44:12,580 --> 03:44:14,100
Please

3057
03:44:14,200 --> 03:44:17,400
I'm afraid of these separate activities

3058
03:44:19,000 --> 03:44:21,500
Oh, and from now on, it's no longer
"Do Not Laugh"

3059
03:44:21,510 --> 03:44:23,870
But rather,
"Don't Show Fear"

3060
03:44:24,620 --> 03:44:26,220

03:45:28,800 --> 03:45:30,550
I fell on your ass

3075
03:45:30,650 --> 03:45:32,630
Did that fly in from somewhere ?

I don't know

3077
03:45:34,200 --> 03:45:36,650

Where is it ?

3095
03:46:57,410 --> 03:46:58,560
Could it be inside the room ?

3096
03:46:59,770 --> 03:47:00,430
I don't see it anywhere

3097
03:47:01,070 --> 03:47:01,720

3105
03:47:25,630 --> 03:47:26,760
Should we head back then ?

3106
03:47:26,760 --> 03:47:27,990
You think so ?

3107
03:47:27,990 --> 03:47:28,880

3123
03:48:35,280 --> 03:48:38,870
I left a death certificate over at
the Nurse Station

3124
03:48:39,350 --> 03:48:41,770
Will you pick that up for me ??

3125
03:48:42,630 --> 03:48:46,450
There is also file in my locker

3126
03:48:46,450 --> 03:48:49,510
Will you pick that up as well ??

3127
03:48:49,840 --> 03:48:51,570

Well, we couldn't really see inside

3191
03:53:27,430 --> 03:53:29,860
How dare you tell us it was frightening then ?

3192
03:53:29,930 --> 03:53:31,840
I got zapped when I slid that door open

Oh, so I was right, then !!

3194

I knew there was something with that door

3195
03:53:37,800 --> 03:53:38,660
Yeah, so I opened it

3196
03:53:39,390 --> 03:53:41,740
And I was like,
"This doesn't feel right"

3197
03:53:41,880 --> 03:53:43,290
What'd you just say ?

3198
03:53:44,930 --> 03:53:46,890
What'd you mean,
"doesn't feel right ?"

3199
03:53:53,180 --> 03:53:55,430
I couldn't convey my thoughts right

3200
03:53:57,130 --> 03:53:59,140
Anyway, that room was a total nightmare

3201
03:53:59,180 --> 03:54:00,770

Why are the patients here, anyhow ?

3219
03:55:29,620 --> 03:55:31,690

03:58:03,020 --> 03:58:08,410
We gathered and risked our own lives

3246
03:58:09,540 --> 03:58:19,950
to save another life.

3247
03:58:21,860 --> 03:58:25,830
The limits of our buttocks were severely tested

3248
03:58:26,820 --> 03:58:32,850
and the enemy's jokes and tricks never ended

3249
03:58:34,460 --> 03:58:40,410
inside this hell known as a hospital

3250
03:58:42,210 --> 03:58:45,390
Butt-Slap Count

3251
03:58:46,810 --> 03:58:50,350

3252
03:58:51,620 --> 03:58:55,260

3254

Butt-Slap Count

3255
03:59:12,820 --> 03:59:14,180
Check out that car

3256
03:59:21,610 --> 03:59:24,330
Black Jack Takes A Powernap in his Car

3257
03:59:26,910 --> 03:59:27,720
Oh, he's awake !

3258
03:59:28,980 --> 03:59:30,320
What's with this crappy car ?

3259
03:59:34,590 --> 03:59:36,110
Why does he have to leave

3260
03:59:36,600 --> 03:59:38,500
as if he's caught or something ?

3261
03:59:39,180 --> 03:59:40,100
Itsuji Itao Presents  BLACK JACK !!

3262
03:59:40,100 --> 03:59:44,700
Itsuji Itao Presents  BLACK JACK !!

3263
03:59:51,400 --> 03:59:52,910
We didn't need that

3264
04:00:04,010 --> 04:00:05,090
Once you cross this line

3265
04:00:05,940 --> 04:00:06,920
You're all free

3266
04:00:10,790 --> 04:00:14,610
"Do Not Laugh at This Hospital"
End of Training

3267
04:00:24,080 --> 04:00:25,200
Itsuji Itao Presents  BLACK JACK !!

3268
04:00:25,200 --> 04:00:28,200
Itsuji Itao Presents  BLACK JACK !!

3269
04:00:27,340 --> 04:00:29,450
He must've went the wrong way

3270
04:00:35,420 --> 04:00:36,190
Alright then

3271
04:00:37,050 --> 04:00:37,870
That was it

3272
04:00:38,690 --> 04:00:40,820
It was a long day even for this audience here

3273
04:00:41,390 --> 04:00:42,390
That was a lot of work

3274
04:00:43,320 --> 04:00:44,970
As I lived that day again,

3275
04:00:45,130 --> 04:00:47,980
some of you might think it's no big deal to
get slapped 259 times

3276
04:00:48,130 --> 04:00:51,010
But I'm telling you that
my ass was as big as a baseball glove in the end

3277
04:00:51,480 --> 04:00:53,110
Your ass ?
-yes, my ass

3278
04:00:53,690 --> 04:00:55,180
If you didn't laugh at that

3279
04:00:55,630 --> 04:00:57,970
feel free to swing by one of your local
sporting goods stores

3280
04:00:59,300 --> 04:01:00,000
Get outta here

3281
04:01:00,340 --> 04:01:02,150
No, I want them to feel it in their hands, you know ?

3282
04:01:03,280 --> 04:01:05,010
I want them to feel it with their own flesh

3283
04:01:08,110 --> 04:01:09,110
It's big isn't it ?

3284
04:01:10,420 --> 04:01:11,930
The glove is quite big, yeah ?

3285
04:01:15,990 --> 04:01:17,450
I don't understand this

3286
04:01:17,630 --> 04:01:19,930
We've known each other for, like, 20 years

3287
04:01:19,980 --> 04:01:22,070
Why ignore me after all this time ?

3288
04:01:22,130 --> 04:01:23,940
The situation called for it, that's all

3289
04:01:26,050 --> 04:01:28,060
Thank you very much, everyone !
