00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,120
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,420
Let's get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,790
Who is it, is there anyone there?

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,470
It's FUJIWARA!

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,950
Hello everyone, we're FUJIWARA

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,410
I know you, i've seen you guys on TV

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,000
It's... Genki Haranishi!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,250
Correct
-And poor thing Fujimoto

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,670
Who are you saying is a poor little thing? In what way am I a poor little thing!?

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,470
Matsumoto is crying
-Why are you crying?

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,210
Why is Matsumoto crying?

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,020
I can't believe they forced themselves to be on a variety show

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,180
Whose forcing themselves!?

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,120
So you are forcing yourself to come
-I didn't force myself

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,090
I'll start then
-Let's start. Let's start

16
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,630
This time is a long-waited Kuro-chan project

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,440
Really looking forward to
-I've been waiting for a long time

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,000
When Kuro-chan gets drunk and falls asleep he just doesn't get up, right?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,580
Yes, it has happened before

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,240
So this time, we took the drunken Kuro-chan to a great place

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,040
What more is there to do?

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,900
I thought last time's flower field would be the end of it

23
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,900
※OA：20191030

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,750
What does everyone think the place is?

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,210
Inside a grave

26
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,090
The staff here would do such a thing, right?

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,860
Put him in a coffin
-Then let's state the answer, ready?

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,490
The project we brought this time, is this:

29
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,600
Kuro-chan: Living on a deserted island with a single room

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,930
Single room?

31
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,000
Please allow me to explain

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,270
First a room the same size as Kuro-chan's was built on a deserted island

33
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,940
Then, all of his stuff was moved to it

34
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,640
Everything
-Yes

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,810
Then the drunken Kuro-chan is moved to the room on the island

36
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,650
When he wakes up and walks out of his room, he realizes his home is now a uninhabited island

37
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,780
I see

38
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,750
Can this be done?

39
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,050
What do you think, Degawa?

40
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,990
No no no, how would you react

41
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,120
Thinking you'd left civilization

42
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,660
Not knowing what to do, it'd be really painful

43
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,000
You couldn't speak, you'd be speechless?
-It's difficult to understand the situation

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,830
Yes

45
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,740
Because the rooms are exactly the same

46
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,740
But since he's Kuro-chan, the first thing he'll do is probably look for Mother Kuro

47
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,080
First make contact

48
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,790
Kuro-chan: Living on a deserted island with a single room

49
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,710
And so...

50
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,990
"The Spirit of Kansai Gyaru"

51
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,860
This time we invited Kuro-chan, who has performed PCR testing, to participate in a fake program on SUN TV

52
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,860
※Kuro-chan was diagnosed with covid on July 18 and was discharged on July 29

53
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,600
We called him to a place in Kansai

54
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,270
Let's get hyped together!

55
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,240
And took advantage of this time to remove all the things from his room

56
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,610
The stains on the bed are awful

57
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,780
Take away all the garbage too?

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,930
Then we loaded all the luggage onto the truck and drove west

59
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,850
The staff really work hard

60
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,740
The destination is an uninhabited island floating on the Seto Inland Sea

61
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,840
Its name - Black Island (Kuroshima)

62
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,120
The name is a perfect match

63
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,730
Half a day was spent making the island hut

64
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:18,620
And all the luggage was moved from Tokyo

65
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,620
Thus, a complete reproduction of Kuro-chan's room

66
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,170
This camera view
-Exactly the same!

67
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,750
So, on an uninhabited island 500km away from Tokyo

68
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,060
The moving of Kuron-chan's room is complete

69
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,270
But tenant knew nothing about the matter...

70
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,160
Cheers~

71
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,670
I'm really worried about after this~

72
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,690
At this time, he was unaware that something worth worrying about was actually in progress

73
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,830
He's really aiding the preparation

74
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,660
As usual, Kuro-chan is instructed to drink one glass after another to begin with

75
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,950
With a guy in the park...

76
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,720
Wait!

77
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,660
Ah~ I really can't

78
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,390
Really can't do this kind of thing!

79
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,930
Wait, wait

80
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,230
Can't stop drinking?

81
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,930
He's in a really good mood

82
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:17,090
After listening to the Kansai gyaru girls' unadulterated conversation, he gets more excited and drinks even faster

83
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,070
Put down your hand holding the glass

84
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,240
It's everyone's fault that I have to keep drinking

85
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,380
Oops I said~

86
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,080
Everyone is so cute~ really!

87
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,980
Excuse me, staff members

88
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,880
SUN TV is the best!

89
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,940
His rolling drunken eyes

90
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,950
And then...

91
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,920
Terrible

92
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,690
Sexual harassment occurs through a barrier

93
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,780
Two hours after shooting began...

94
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,970
Uh

95
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,970
Kansai

96
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,940
The spirit of Kansai's gyarus...

97
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,940
SUNTV uh ah…

98
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,140
As usual, he went to sleep after getting drunk

99
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,750
This is still work, right?

100
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,750
Finally...

101
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,020
As expected

102
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,280
Everything is now ready

103
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,760
After all, there is a lot to drink

104
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,230
Usually a show would never hire him again

105
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,340
Regarding Kuro-chan

106
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,520
We all know that he is not easily woken up once he drinks

107
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:48,230
As this time he is on a bot, he wears noise-canceling headphones

108
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:58,200
And is then taken to the port in a drowsy state

109
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,820
After all, it's not far from Kansai

110
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,410
And so, he departs with the rising sun

111
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,590
The departure location is quite

112
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,420
At least put him in a better place

113
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,770
And arrives on an uninhabited island while still asleep

114
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,260
And then...

115
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,970
Gently chucked onto the bed

116
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,990
He is smoothly returned to his own bed

117
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:45,880
Faced with "waking up and finding out that he's now on an uninhabited island"

118
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,610
He undergoes an experience that is possibly the first of its kind in history

119
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,130
What will Kuro-chan do?

120
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,230
The room is decorated exactly the same

121
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,770
He sleeps for two hours in his Kuro Room on Kuro Island

122
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,050
Finally...

123
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,020
You'd surely panic

124
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,090
He has arisen

125
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,150
No doubts about the room

126
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,950
Probably thought someone sent him home

127
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,940
But after all, this is SUN TV

128
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,740
I've forgotten about how they do things in Kansai

129
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,260
But in this case, Kuro-chan did not feel any sense of dissonance

130
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,950
It looks like he forgot

131
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,750
Amazing! Tweeted instantly

132
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,970
First, the usual good morning tweet

133
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,900
Hmm...

134
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,700
Eh?

135
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,990
At this point, Kuro-chan finally realizes something

136
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,580
He was recording a program in Kansai, but doesn't know how he got home

137
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,550
Are doubts setting in?

138
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,920
But...

139
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,880
Hmm...

140
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,220
Ah...uurrr...

141
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,030
It's the hangover that's more taxing

142
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,860
Five minutes after waking up

143
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,320
In order to go to the toilet, Kuro-chan finally gets up and walks to the door

144
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,560
Just how will he react?

145
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,880
Not much of a reaction

146
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,770
You'd surely react like this

147
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,900
Opening the door to what should be the kitchen

148
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,010
Such a long silence!

149
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,290
There's now a sea in front of you

150
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,490
Faced with this shocking sight...

151
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,970
Eh？

152
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,070
Can't even stand up

153
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,010
He can't help but have weak legs

154
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,690
Finally said something

155
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,050
Eh!?

156
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,660
Finally said something

157
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,530
Hey, where's this, hey? Wha...

158
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,990
Eh? Eh?

159
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,560
Wait, what's going on here?

160
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,670
What's happening?

161
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,700
Where!?

162
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,770
WHERE!?

163
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,310
Wait a second. What's going on? What's going on?

164
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,410
This is my home, right?

165
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,180
Eh? What the hell is going on!?

166
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,420
Wait, I really don't understand what is happening

167
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,890
Why is my house here? Why is it here? It's not even my home, right?

168
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,830
But this is my home

169
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,990
What the hell?

170
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:22,320
After this, he continued to wander between the beach and the hut for ten minutes

171
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,610
This is Wednesday Downtown, right? It must be Wednesday Downtown!

172
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,710
How else could this happen? It's not in a dream

173
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,780
It isn't a dream, right?

174
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,610
Only this show, right?

175
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,650
You're pretty much only on this show, right?

176
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,600
Kuro-chan gradually comes to understand the situation

177
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,550
Hey! There's staff here, right? Staff!?

178
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:48,090
I said come out! I don't understand what's going on!

179
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,420
Although Kuro-chan shouts at the staff with all his might...

180
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,930
What's that? A drone?

181
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,240
What the hell? A drones flying over

182
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,270
This time, no staff will appear

183
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,310
Instead, with the use of this drone,

184
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,210
And the numerous cameras set up on the island

185
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,340
Kuro-chan's life on this uninhabited island will be recorded

186
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,460
And so,

187
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,030
Eh!? What is it? It looks like something is dangling

188
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,540
Can I take it off?

189
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,140
What is this?

190
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,800
Kuro-chan's room has been transported to an uninhabited island

191
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,820
There is a camera in the box next to the room, please film yourself

192
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,490
What!? This is an uninhabited island!?

193
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,260
What the hell's up with this teleportation!?

194
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,000
It also says "Please film yourself".

195
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,470
So how do I get back?

196
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,030
Kuro-chan seems to have many questions

197
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,910
What the hell is this place?

198
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,700
What the heck are you doing?

199
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,040
First things first: head protection measures

200
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,210
And defecation

201
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,760
Do I really have to film?

202
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,960
And what is this thing, it goes on the head?

203
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,260
I don't need to. I'm not doing it

204
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,870
Despite his protests, he nonetheless beings to film

205
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,140
No, this...how the hell did it happen?

206
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,640
It's really the same as my house, really

207
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,740
It is my usual home

208
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,820
This is the jungle, right?

209
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,920
The window opens to a jungle

210
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,350
Although it's my home

211
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,730
Once you open the door... the sea is there!

212
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,330
Sea?

213
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,500
Isn't this like a portal?

214
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,170
This is an uninhabited island, right? Can I even leave?

215
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,340
Can I just escape?

216
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,110
Actually, I just saw another house

217
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,440
So if I want to escape, they can probably tell me how, right?

218
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,950
In fact, this uninhabited island is about 1km to the next manned island

219
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,950
Is it possible?

220
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,460
Could swim there with a little effort

221
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,470
And so...

222
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,660
Ta da~

223
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,360
I'll use this to escape

224
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,260
I'll use the breaststroke to swim to the land

225
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,170
He's using his own personal items
-Yes

226
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,100
I'm off then, let's go!

227
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,340
The destination is over there

228
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,890
So, Kuro-chan's uninhabited island escape challenge begins

229
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,170
But this is the Seto Inland Sea after all

230
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,040
The wind and waves shouldn't be too strong

231
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,290
But...

232
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,610
Oh

233
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,650
Huh? The waves are a little big. Eh?

234
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,020
Ah...it's not the same as a swimming pool

235
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,220
The wind is too strong, and the waves are too strong, why!?

236
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,270
How can it be the same as a swimming pool

237
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,170
After 20 minutes of continuous drifting on the tide

238
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,430
Rubber ring... the rubber ring is floating away

239
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,840
A great pity, his escape ends in failure

240
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,740
Just used up his energy

241
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,340
Impossible, how the hell can I swim there

242
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,880
Wasn't it your idea?

243
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,850
What the hell? Seriously

244
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,650
Are you mocking me?

245
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,910
It's mocking you

246
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,190
What's that?

247
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,790
The mocked Kuro-chan seems to have found something

248
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,960
What is this?

249
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,970
What is this?

250
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,910
A bowling ball  on top of a cushion

251
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,780
What is this? The hole...

252
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,510
There are four holes?

253
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,850
This ball is a hint, right?

254
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,920
After all, it's too suspicious

255
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,990
Ah

256
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,360
What does east-west, north-south mean?

257
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,830
This hole is...

258
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,030
East, West, North, South... is that instructions to go to a certain place?

259
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,930
Or am I supposed to stuff something into this hole?

260
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,410
There's a piece of paper next to it

261
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,240
Open it quickly and read it

262
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,440
It's a scroll, isn't this a bit too depressing?

263
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,680
In fact, this scroll shows...

264
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,650
This is a map, right?

265
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:47,490
The four-hole bowling ball was found here

266
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,500
Does that mean there are hints in all these starred places?

267
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,400
If I collect these, is there a way to escape?

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,800
I'm home

269
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,010
There are four holes

270
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,150
And it was on this cushion, right?

271
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,820
Eh, no way!

272
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,190
It can't be that fantastical, surely!

273
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,000
Dragon balls?

274
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,370
One, two, three... one, two, three, four

275
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,370
※One, two, three, four: In the Japanese comic book Dragon Ball, the seven Dragon Balls are pronounced 1234567 in Chinese.

276
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,170
Is this the four star ball?

277
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,080
Hey, wait a minute, I remember this from dragon ball

278
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,220
There are seven of them, right?

279
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,580
It's a lie! It's a lie!

280
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,390
A total of seven markers

281
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,360
Is it the same as the seven dragon balls?

282
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,030
Will the dragon appear?

283
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,900
Really? Will the dragon grant my wish?

284
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:05,920
That's right, if he collects all seven bowling balls on the island, his wish will come true

285
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,670
It is an adventure-based escape project

286
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,780
The adventure is about to begin. It's about to begin!

287
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,610
Let's go and embark on an adventure!

288
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,550
I will definitely collect all of them!

289
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,150
And so, Kuro-chan's incredible adventure is about to begin

290
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,360
What does everyone think?

291
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,700
When Kuro-chan first opened his door there was no response

292
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,870
Yes, indeed, indeed

293
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,700
You're exactly right

294
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,690
I've been screwed with similarly in the past, when I came home and opened the door,

295
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,540
All of my stuff was gone, and the place was turned into Hawaii

296
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,190
Turned into Hawaii?
-The reverse

297
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,380
The reverse version, the room was filled with real sand

298
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,350
There was a big sun umbrella and the ground was full of crabs roaming around

299
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,990
So I know that, in this type of situation, it's really impossible to react straight away

300
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,560
I was completely speechless. I couldn't even say something like "It's Hawaii!"

301
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,110
It is impossible to say anything

302
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,730
You freeze up

303
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,960
You freeze up, so Kuro-chan's reaction is very real

304
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,850
First of all, this

305
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,190
Here

306
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,760
It's right next to the house, so it should be right around here

307
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:39,210
And so, Kuro-chan begins searching the beach area next to the hut

308
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,740
On the map it seems to be a bit more ahead

309
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,770
Probably around here?

310
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,040
This vicinity?

311
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,790
Despite searching, he's unable to find anything resembling a bowling ball

312
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,180
This is the place drawn on the map, but I can't seem to find anything

313
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,420
So, he abandons the beach area for now

314
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,260
This is where I'm going now, this rocky area

315
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,730
These are gloves I didn't hesitate to buy at a Visual Kei shop

316
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,130
As long as you wear these gloves, your strength will increase many times

317
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,270
Wish~

318
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,340
※Wish" and "ZKY" are the comedian DIAGO's jokes

319
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,340
ZKY

320
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,110
Where is it? Is it near there?

321
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,580
I'll climb up and see

322
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,420
What exactly does ZKY mean?

323
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,190
We'll get the ball and dream together

324
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,190
Wish Wish Wish~

325
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:44,100
Facing the craggy cliffs, Kuro-chan performs with surprising ease

326
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,060
Yes, in fact...

327
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,390
Climbing practice, lemme do it! Facing this wall, I've gotta get over it!

328
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,050
This is definitely a lie

329
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:02,170
Kuro-chan has faced this wall head on with sincerity, now i'm a professional rock climber!

330
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,450
Definitely just for show

331
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,080
It's a lie

332
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,750
There's no wall that I can't climb!

333
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,800
Thanks to an interest in rock climbing, Kuro-chan has faced the difficulties of rock climbing on a regular basis

334
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,710
So, the flat rock face is smoothly climbed

335
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,270
That's scary!

336
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,930
After all, there is no safety harness either

337
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,770
Nothing here?

338
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,310
After reaching an altitude of 15 meters...

339
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,570
Ah...

340
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,030
Dangerous!

341
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,610
It's too dangerous. The rock is so fragile

342
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,750
The rocks are loose here

343
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,320
That was close, this rock is soft

344
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,590
Give me a minute, the rocks are falling

345
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,170
Kuro-chan enters an area of unstable rock, and then...

346
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,910
Damn it!

347
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,670
Damn it!

348
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,460
Damn it!

349
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,230
Hey, it's scary. Is it all this type of stone up here?

350
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,530
One wrong step and he risks falling, but...

351
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,150
Kuro-chan is surmounting the difficulties in front of him!

352
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,690
Told you it was a lie

353
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:10,230
Use all your strength to knock down the wall!!! Justice is power!!!!

354
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,750
After all, there's safety measures in a place like that

355
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,260
Ah, almost there! Made it! Made it!

356
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,870
And so, Kuro-chan successfully conquers the rock wall with all his might

357
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,100
Wow, here comes the ramp

358
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Finally...

359
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,570
Ah, I've found it

360
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,710
I found it. It's that one, right?

361
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,070
The color is orange. I found it!

362
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,780
I've found the ball!

363
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,410
After a lot of effort, he's finally found the ball

364
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,750
Found it, found it, found it!

365
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,950
But from here is the most difficult part

366
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,560
The rocks will crack here, staff!

367
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,760
Staff!

368
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,890
Staff! Save me!

369
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,760
No one's coming to save you

370
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,430
Staff, you're watching, right?

371
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,340
Staff, i'm serious

372
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,370
Staff~

373
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:13,310
Unfortunately, Kano Eiko's soulful cry cannot reach the staff

374
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:16,550
They've also got matching gloves

375
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,280
The result: he must rely on his own strength...

376
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,520
I'm there!

377
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,320
Ah, it's over there

378
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,990
Scary
-Super scary

379
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,660
Got it!

380
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,390
I got the ball!!!

381
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,770
This is so scary!

382
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,510
,I have now found two, which means...

383
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,310
,I need to find five more, right?

384
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,050
,Correct

385
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,110
,The sun has begun to set already

386
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,220
,I guess I can't finish it today

387
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,220
,How many days will this take?

388
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,350
,Eh... I'm scared!

389
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,160
,Do I have to get food myself?

390
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,120
,Yeah, really

391
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,870
,Yes, usually this kind of location shoot on an uninhabited island involves...

392
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:04,170
,Getting food from nature

393
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,270
,Either collecting fruit from the trees

394
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,850
,Or going fishing to get food

395
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,880
,However, as this time, an entire room was transported over

396
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,440
,Will there be some in the room?

397
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,010
,Ah, i've got water

398
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,010
,Cup noodles

399
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,280
,Ah so many treasures, there are many

400
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,490
,But there's no gas!

401
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,750
,Beer, I also have beer

402
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:23,160
,For once, messy bad habits actually turn out to be beneficial

403
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,690
,And whiskey

404
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,760
,This was a gift

405
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,660
,Small quantities of food has been gathered

406
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,480
,And so, in the end

407
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,330
,So much!

408
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,970
,It's great to have a whole room transported over

409
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,750
,This level of plentiful bounty

410
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,430
,Is rarely seen on a desert island

411
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,190
,This guy loves Gummi

412
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,580
,Also all grape flavor, why?

413
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,610
,I'm ready to eat then

414
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,480
,Dinner preparation

415
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,010
,I worked way too hard today

416
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,730
,So,

417
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,360
,Surrounding collected branches with stones

418
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,660
,I can't believe it!

419
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,590
,Luckily there are

420
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,900
,The smoke is so big, my eyes hurt

421
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,080
,He boils water in a pot

422
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,640
,The fun of the uninhabited island has been halved

423
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,840
,Too well-equipped

424
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,770
,Ah, how there are bugs, ah~

425
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,800
,Too normal, should go and catch some fish or something

426
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,210
,I'm having a beer!

427
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,170
,He's also having a beer

428
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,580
I'm exhausted

429
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,580
,Cheers~

430
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,280
,Cup noodles plus 2 cans of beer

431
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,890
,A fulfilling solo-camp

432
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,290
,This doesn't feel like a deserted island

433
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,300
,Next

434
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,520
Eh?

435
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,460
,Eh, there is actually signal here?

436
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,500
,Even though it's an uninhabited island?

437
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,060
,Kurojima

438
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,600
,A Kuro island...

439
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,300
,You really found one...

440
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,240
,And so

441
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,500
Hello?

442
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,880
,Mother? It's me

443
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,490
,He reports to his mother what has transpired

444
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,820
,So basically...

445
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,860
,The one who hates me most is Kuro-chan's mother

446
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,860
,※Kuro-chan's parents said in the show (O.A. 210113 39:03) that they hate Fujimoto

447
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,350
,My whole room was transported to an uninhabited island

448
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,900
,You're lying aren't you

449
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,990
,I'm not lying

450
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,840
,A careful explanation of an impossible situation

451
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,260
,It must be Wednesday

452
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,810
,He still hasn't been told it's a tv show

453
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,060
,So weird, so funny!

454
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,770
,It's not funny, seriously!

455
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:21,640
,You can do it, Akihito!

456
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,170
,You must be drunk again

457
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,270
,What the hell!

458
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,230
,It seems like the mother, like the son,

459
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,080
,Is also the type that doesn't stop drinking until becoming unconscious

460
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,850
,This is a good trait to inherit

461
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,080
,Nothing to do today so i'm going to sleep, sleep

462
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,960
,And so

463
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,850
,An early beddtime at 9:30 p.m

464
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,880
,The second day on an uninhabited island

465
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,740
,Morni-morning puri puri princess---♪

466
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,500
,Oh that's a good one!

467
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,570
,It's better to target these three today, right?

468
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,310
,Today, Kuro-chan's goal is...

469
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,670
,The three balls along the beach as shown in the picture

470
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,240
So,

471
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,720
,So scary!

472
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,160
,Where's the ball?

473
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,430
,This is an adventure, right?

474
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,560
,Embarking on a path without a road

475
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,050
,By the way,

476
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,910
,On this island, except for the hut area

477
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,900
,There are no flat places

478
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,040
,If it was anyone other than me they'd be hurt!

479
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,970
,Between the craggy cliffs that still fill one's vision

480
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,630
,Kuro-chan has to keep going up and down the face

481
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,280
,I've been walking for an hour

482
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,860
,It's been two and a half hours since he left

483
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,580
Ah

484
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,090
,Eh, is it not here?

485
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,730
,This sea cove

486
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,170
,This must be it

487
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,620
,Arrived at last

488
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,760
,The location of this ball appears to be somewhere in this cove

489
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,180
,Ah, that's the one, right?

490
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,340
Ball!

491
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,880
,That orange thing must be the one

492
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,060
,You wouldn't wanna go down

493
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,670
So

494
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,290
,Perfect

495
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,530
,If you put this tube above the surface you can breathe

496
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:29,290
,Like a member of a criminal organization carrying out the orders of a high-level boss

497
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:35,170
,He becomes the silent twin killers: Kuro-chan

498
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,780
,Actually, this tube that Kuro-chan is carrying

499
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,210
,A CPAP, a device that assists breathing during sleep

500
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,840
,He uses this instead of diving snorkel to dive into the water

501
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,700
,What is the result?

502
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,150
,Would this work?

503
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:53,970
,No point at all, right?

504
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,100
,It's gone in!

505
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,990
,To be expected

506
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,450
,What's wrong?

507
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,540
,How did all the water get into my nose?

508
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,050
,Of course it would

509
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,820
,CPAP Operations: Ended

510
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,660
,By the way,

511
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,010
,Although the position of the ball is not very deep

512
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,430
,A bowling ball submerged in water

513
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,810
,Is very hard to retrieve

514
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,900
,Looks too heavy

515
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,600
,So slippery

516
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,370
,As it has a fair amount of weight

517
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:40,910
,It will immediately slip if not grasped firmly

518
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,410
,You can do it!

519
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,270
,There are only two holes

520
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,370
,How can this be caught?

521
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,440
,You guys are doing it on purpose, right?

522
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,860
,Get it! Get it!

523
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,500
,Ah, it really slips out

524
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,680
,So close!

525
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,450
Seriously!

526
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,640
,So, he keeps on trying

527
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,190
,For 30 minutes

528
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,670
,At last...

529
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,600
,Got it! Got it!

530
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,100
,Finally got the third ball

531
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,210
,I thought I was going to die

532
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,320
,Immediately afterwards,

533
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,780
,Kuro-chan continues along a path without a road

534
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,680
,I'll bring the watch with me

535
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,320
,Eh? This must be it!

536
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,750
,Ah there it is!

537
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,840
,He arrives at the cave where the fourth ball resides

538
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,740
,After hurrying into the hole

539
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,330
,It stinks...

540
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,240
,I didn't brush my teeth

541
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,410
,But it's not my teeth

542
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,590
,Your teeth must smell pretty bad too

543
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,720
,Actually, this cave

544
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,040
,Because of the alternating high tide and low tide is always shady and dry

545
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,420
,It stinks!

546
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,130
,It emits a strong stench like food waste

547
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,860
,This island is awesome, how did this form in such a way

548
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,690
,Kuro island

549
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,760
,The island is really as the name suggests

550
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,790
,He is forced to bear the stench

551
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:19,520
,And finally retrieves the fourth ball

552
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,770
,There is only one goal left for the rest of the day

553
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,030
,This one is going to be a problem

554
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,050
,Once the sun goes down, nothing can be done

555
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,370
,The time now is 4:00 p.m.

556
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,520
,You can do it!

557
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,390
,If the sun goes down

558
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,280
,Being unable to return to the hut is a possibility

559
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,820
,So he must hurry

560
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,480
,So fast!

561
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,180
,You can do it!

562
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,760
,Finally

563
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,500
,Eh?

564
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,400
,Wait, wait, wait, wait!

565
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,070
,Isn't this an island itself?

566
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,430
,Finally

567
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:04,020
,The island off-land where the fifth ball sleeps appears

568
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,650
,It's too deep, isn't it?

569
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,960
,This is not the same level as the place where the ball was sunk just now

570
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,680
,The sea must be crossed

571
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,880
,To reach the island where the fifth ball sleeps

572
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:26,210
,Specifically, 50 meters of the rapid tide must be traversed

573
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,570
,It is impossible to come back like this

574
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,140
,Just go for it, right?

575
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,370
,Not even one staff member came out

576
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,480
So,

577
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,550
,So deep, so deep

578
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,100
,The life preserver was lost on the first day, right?

579
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,720
,Although his physical strength is heavily depleted

580
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,380
,Kuro-chan is determined to jump into the depths of the water

581
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,670
,Do not underestimate the breaststroke!

582
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,130
Damn

583
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,200
,While filling a stomach with water

584
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,870
,He swims against the tide for 15 minutes

585
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,630
,Awesome

586
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,440
,At last

587
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,960
,He arrives at the island

588
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,430
,I'm here!

589
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,740
,I...

590
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,800
,I am...

591
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,940
,Kurokawa Akito!

592
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,470
,That's right!

593
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,220
,Climbing onto the island! I'm on the island!

594
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,790
,Scared me to death, scared me to death, scared me to death!!!

595
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,290
,Swimming over

596
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,630
,Swam over... although I was afraid I still persevered

597
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:05,100
,Really scared me, too scared

598
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,070
,I was really scared to death

599
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,440
,How many times are you going to say it

600
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,980
,If I was in danger on the way would you save me?

601
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,210
,Someone would surely have to save me

602
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,110
,You'll come to my rescue, right?

603
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,920
,Mummy

604
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,920
,Mummy

605
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,250
,I'm really tried

606
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,990
,Ok we get it, get on with it

607
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,590
,I'm 44 years old in the summer, and i'm really tried

608
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,330
,Akihito will try to keep going, Mummy!

609
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,430
,Desperately trying to show his effort

610
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,130
,I'm not feeling a sense of danger at all ah

611
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,340
,While continuing to stumble around

612
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,190
,The sunset is drawing near

613
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:47,040
,No, where is it?

614
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,580
,If the sun sets it'd be super scary

615
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,910
,I've come this far, I have to find it

616
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,170
,The search lasts for 30 minutes

617
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,620
,Ah, there it is!

618
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,560
,Placing it somewhere like this is bullying

619
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,730
,Found it!

620
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,310
,And so

621
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:12,700
,Today, Kuro-chan retrieved a total of three balls

622
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,470
,But...

623
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,570
,Must get back before sunset

624
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:24,690
,It is the journey home that is the hardest

625
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,680
,Submerged in the water

626
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,920
,So heavy

627
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,740
,This is the same as the death penalty, holding such a heavy thing

628
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,190
,That's the second lot

629
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,990
,There's one more but I couldn't carry it

630
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:42,370
,It takes two trips to finally get all 3 balls back

631
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,130
,So tired...

632
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,320
,Later,

633
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,740
,I'm starting!

634
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:56,140
,Like a manual laborer he wolfs down his instant noodles

635
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,030
,And today also sleeps like a corpse

636
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,310
,It is the morning of the third day of life on an uninhabited island

637
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,800
,Morning, morning, holiday land~ Aloha Oye - - - - - -♪

638
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,100
,After posting a tweet implying he is on an island

639
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,700
,I need to have a wash

640
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,920
,The 3-days without a bath Kuro-chan

641
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,840
,Decides to go to the sea for a little dip

642
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,080
,Drones don't come over, okay?

643
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,150
,That's enough, right?

644
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,650
,I'm going to wash now

645
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,660
,No need to film

646
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,930
,After three days

647
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,440
,This man has transformed into the lord of the island

648
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,470
,Ah so cold!

649
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,070
,Is that little pot necessary?

650
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,490
,Small pots are still necessary, right?

651
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,660
,Wouldn't jumping into the water be enough?

652
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,110
,Because there is no body wash

653
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,640
,He decides to use shaving cream instead

654
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,990
,Ah, this sizzling sensation feels really good

655
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,340
,With shaving in mind

656
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,710
,He then gives his head hair a quick once over

657
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
,Don't shoot this

658
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,400
,Terrifying

659
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,230
,That's awful

660
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,830
,Hurry up and go, will you?

661
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,300
,Get lost!

662
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,910
,You don't see this kind of image on variety shows much, right?

663
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,970
,Demanding someone gets off his island

664
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,050
,As if he were completely indigenous

665
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,650
,Kuro-chan's Kuro Island

666
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,550
,It's kind of awesome

667
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,280
,It's your own island!

668
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,050
,It's so refreshing after washing

669
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,390
,Breakfast, hat about breakfast?

670
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,090
,It's already the third day

671
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,000
,The food is almost gone

672
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,460
,Shall I just eat a can?

673
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,530
,Ah...

674
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,640
,I have to go back today

675
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,510
,So i'll find the two remaining balls

676
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,840
,I'll eat the seafood flavored noodles too

677
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,940
,I can't stand it, I want to eat

678
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,680
,Is it okay?

679
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,900
,Think about it Kuro-chan

680
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,240
,If I keep dawdling like this I'll waste a few more days

681
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,520
,Seafood goes best with the sea

682
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,880
And so,

683
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,860
,The end of the line

684
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,890
,So good

685
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,130
,The last pack of instant noodles is finished

686
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,540
,Along with canned sardines

687
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,230
,I'm full

688
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,720
,Towards the sleeping 6th ball

689
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,100
,He heads into the forest

690
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,410
,I'm off

691
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,070
,Ah it's a bit wet

692
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,140
,Ah, it's raining

693
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,880
,It's raining a lot!

694
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,880
,No more motivation!

695
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,090
,Ah, an umbrella

696
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,650
,Great, thank god for the umbrella

697
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,120
,A rare view on an uninhabited island:

698
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,310
,A scene of someone walking into the forest with an umbrella

699
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,730
,Wait a minute, is this okay?

700
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,960
,This rain is a bit scary

701
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,230
,Is a typhoon coming?

702
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,700
,In fact, this day...

703
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,720
,Had the biggest rainfall of the year

704
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,040
,What a sudden downpour this is

705
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,160
,It's really coming down hard

706
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,200
,Braving the heavy rain

707
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,280
,In a forest the size of Tokyo Dome 2

708
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,960
,He searches for an hour

709
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,560
,Ah, there's an orange thing!

710
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,790
,Ah, it's a ball. There's a ball

711
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,440
,A ball is found in a 5m high tree

712
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,440
,Put in such a nasty place

713
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,630
,I found it, I found it

714
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,720
,This must be a bit scary

715
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,630
,Do I have no choice but to climb?

716
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,730
,Making preparations

717
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,760
,He hatches a plan to climb up halfway and poke the ball

718
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,110
,The trunk of the tree is wet

719
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,180
,It's okay, he's an experienced rock climber

720
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,700
,Experienced my ass!
-He's really experienced!

721
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,210
,But...

722
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,650
,The rain-soaked tree trunk proves very slippery

723
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,390
,So it's tough to climb up

724
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,050
,Nonetheless, he struggles for 15 minutes

725
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,590
,Damn

726
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,390
,He hasn't moved at all

727
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,640
,Hey wait a minute!

728
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,140
,Although he was able to climb up

729
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,010
,He unfortunately loses the critical stick

730
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,380
,Ah the stick!

731
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,080
,But there's no turning back

732
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,830
,Indeed

733
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,620
,So, he chooses to climb up a bit more

734
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,020
,Pretty smart

735
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,580
,You'd have to!

736
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,370
,That's enough

737
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,700
To reach

738
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,110
,Just push it

739
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,940
One, two, ah

740
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,920
,Success!

741
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,520
,Be careful!

742
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,520
,Dangerous, dangerous

743
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,500
,I'm like wax from a candle

744
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,900
And so,

745
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,720
,Mummy!

746
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,490
,I will succeed as long as I don't give up

747
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,080
,Okay, enough

748
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,460
,You used to say, Mum...

749
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,410
,Again, as per usual

750
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,580
,He talks to his mum for a while

751
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,470
,I really hate having to listen to this

752
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,500
,Finally,

753
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,670
,The one on the beach

754
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,170
,Ah he's angry

755
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,900
,Where exactly is it?

756
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,280
,I kind of want to try it too

757
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,440
,Try what

758
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,540
,What exactly?

759
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,220
,Which part?

760
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,160
,This kind of uninhabited island shoot
-Hey, are you serious?

761
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,250
,I'd like to try it out for a little while

762
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,270
,Then let's get started!

763
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,950
,Soon when you leave you may find your home isn't there anymore

764
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,780
,What remains is...

765
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,320
,The one he's been looking for since day one

766
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,990
,But has yet to locate

767
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,630
,The ball on the beach

768
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,330
,But I've been searching for it for the past three days

769
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,900
,Where is it?

770
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,510
,Why can't I find it?

771
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,170
,Why isn't it here?

772
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,570
,Eh, maybe it's smaller than the rest?

773
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,410
,Could it be translucent

774
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,480
,I can't see it. Is it camouflaged?

775
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,320
,No way!

776
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,190
,Why is the last ball so weird?

777
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,520
,The staff of this program really loves to make things difficult

778
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,890
,Like making stuff invisible

779
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,400
,Could it be in the sky...

780
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,500
,If not in the sky...

781
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,300
,Is it buried in the ground?

782
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,810
,Correct answer

783
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,240
,Buried?

784
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:35,210
,That's it, that's it, isn't it!

785
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,110
,These people would definitely do this sort of thing

786
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,830
,And so,

787
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:44,600
,Guessing correctly, Kuro-chan begins digging

788
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,410
,Hellish

789
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,760
,Where is it?

790
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,260
,With a tone like "Where is Panama?"

791
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,490
,He keeps digging

792
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,530
,Where is it? Where is it?

793
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,630
,Kotouge's line!

794
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,970
,Where is Panama?

795
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,380
,You actually know this

796
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,720
Kotouge's line!

797
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,140
,"Where's Panama?", right?

798
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,340
,Where the hell is it?

799
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,440
,Do I have to dig all of this?

800
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,780
,While complaining

801
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,220
,He digs for a whole hour

802
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,820
,Ah, i'm at my limit

803
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,050
,The depth is not known either

804
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,550
,My back hurts

805
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,300
,At last

806
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,730
,Kuro-chan is out of strength

807
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,550
,This kid really likes that small pot

808
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,930
,I can't use my hands anymore

809
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:31,000
,No more grip strength

810
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,240
,Kuro-chan begins to concede defeat

811
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,560
,However,

812
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:44,910
,But I still have to dig!

813
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:49,790
,If I give up here, it's all a waste

814
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,100
,Don't admit defeat!

815
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,890
,Try harder!

816
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:57,520
,I've gotta make it to the end!

817
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,240
,Mum and Dad always told me

818
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,470
,Never to give up half way

819
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,780
,After two years as a repeater, I ended up in a junior college

820
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,060
,Dad's clothes are very impressive

821
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,450
,And withdrew again from school without permission

822
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,340
,That exaggerated Takeshi Kitano shirt

823
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,350
,I never lived up to anyone's expectations

824
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,650
,But Mum and Dad

825
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:29,190
,No matter what happened

826
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,930
,They never gave up on me

827
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:41,240
,I have always been a willful and careless person

828
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,840
,He's like a criminal

829
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,810
,How can I repay my parents?

830
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,380
,Stop asking for money every month

831
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:51,010
,I have to reassure them and put them at ease

832
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,410
,I am now going to start changing now

833
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:56,220
,If I don't change now, there's no point

834
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,320
,I think this is my last chance

835
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,280
,With gratitude to his parents

836
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,920
,Kuro-chan continues to dig the sand with his family's pot

837
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,220
,At last

838
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:17,370
,Ahhhhhhhhhh

839
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:20,070
,There it is. There it is

840
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,680
,It's there!

841
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,480
,It's really buried here

842
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,680
,Mum and Dad, I tried hard!

843
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,450
,I found it! I found it!

844
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,770
,I've been looking for such a long time

845
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,420
,I really suffered

846
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:39,420
,And so, he has finally collected all 7 balls

847
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,300
,He's talking to the ball

848
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,130
,The last ball

849
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,070
,All 7 are together

850
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:49,870
,The only thing left to do next is to grant my wish

851
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,770
,I need to escape from here

852
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:56,210
,With this, will Kuro-chan finally be able to escape Kuro island?

853
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,420
,What fate awaits him?

854
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,440
,What does everyone think?

855
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,920
,A cliffhanger ending is it?

856
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,220
,How do you all feel about this

857
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,730
,Really feel a sense of majesty about it

858
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:15,220
,But not at all moved by it

859
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,390
,Why not? Not even just a little bit?

860
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,740
,Really not moved in the slightest

861
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,670
,Maybe just a tiny bit?

862
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,480
,What aspect is supposed to move me?

863
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,830
,Where is the emotion?

864
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,700
,You're doing "Where is Panama?" again

865
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,410
,After watching it, I think

866
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:32,210
,Make sure you have a small pot

867
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,050
,You can do anything!

868
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,110
,It's useless isn't it?

869
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,230
,You can wash your body and dig in the sand or something.
-No use at all

870
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,150
,It can also cook instant noodles

871
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,670
,There is no need for it. Surely using your hands to dig is faster

872
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:46,750
,Everyone is thinking this is coming to an end, right?

873
00:45:43,590 --> 00:46:14,750
,Thanks for watching. Support me and get subs early at patreon.com/zwanster03

874
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,120
,But it's still early
-Is this just the beginning?

875
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,890
,What else is there to drag on for so long

876
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:51,290
,There's more content to come

877
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,030
,So we have to wait until next week?

878
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,260
,Yes, it will be continued next week

879
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,730
,Next week is also a special hour of Kuro-chan

880
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,070
What's this?

881
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:04,010
,What awaits Kuro-chan

882
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:05,540
Eh, is it not over yet?

883
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,290
,This unbelievable journey of adventure

884
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,770
,Don't miss it!
