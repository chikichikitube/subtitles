1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,900
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai! Battle: let's cook somethin'
good with the ingredients inside the refrigerators!

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,820
Endo Shozo

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,820
Hamada Masatoshi

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,820
Matsumoto Hitoshi

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,820
Tanaka Naoki

6
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,820
Tsukitei Hosei

7
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,240
So, what are we doing today?

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,900
Today we, who can't really cook... I mean we all actually cook

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,900
Yeah but we're not experts

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,380
Yeah, that's it

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,840
But it's not like you never cook, right?

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,220
Well, I mean... I actually cook a lot but...

13
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,280
Pick one, dude!

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,010
He feels like the cooking type

15
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,130
Do you cook at home?

16
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,210
Not that much but like... if you tell me "chop suey" I kind of understand it

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,850
Are you the one who cooks at home?

18
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,600
I'm not!

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,960
Rules are simple: you just have to cook up something good with what you have in the fridge

20
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:58,660
Each fridge has its own main content: beef, pork, chicken, fish ,and seafood, but you won't know which has which until you open each of them!

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,270
Endo

22
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,270
Hamada

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,270
Hosei

24
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,270
Matsumoto

25
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,270
Tanaka

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,040
They have drawn each number tile by lottery

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,190
Which type of dish will they be able to improvise with what they'll find in their own fridge?

28

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,850
Our first challenger is Tanaka, who once learned Chinese cooking on a Gaki episode

35
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,620
Alright Tanaka, first off open up fridge number 4 and check its ingredients out

36
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,940
I'm opening it

37
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,850
His main is...

38
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,300
Woah! It's fish! I'm so glad it wasn't me!

39
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,660
I'm so glad

40
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,160
So Tanaka, the first thing you have to do is to think about what to make with them

41
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,490
Yeah, let's see...

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,920
Well, if I was him...

43
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,240
Ah, I got you, they're already good this way

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,300
What the hell, man!

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,570
But I mean... right?

46
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,090
The hell are you sayin'?

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,580
Alright... I made up my mind!

48
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,230
Alright, please tell us what have you decided

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,120
I'm gonna make a uh...

50
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,250
Using fish and uh... vegetables...

51
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,600
A sort of Chinese-cooking!

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,460
What the hell!

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
How?!

54
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,720
Are you dumb?!

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,550
It doesn't feel right, Tanaka

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,830
Your fridge is the least fit for it!

57
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,840
Ok, I wanna make an original Chinese-styled donburi

58
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,380
Note: bowl of rice with different toppings on top

59
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,900
So, with rice?

60
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,410
Yes

61
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,530
Let's start cooking!!

62
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,260
Alright

63
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,160
Does a Chinese-styled donburi actually exist?

64
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,750
I think so, yeah

65
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:38,920
But look, I mean it already looks good, after all it's the typical men's cooking, the problem is gonna be its taste, though...

66
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,100
Yeah, that's right

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,200
So that's how you cut it

68
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,570
You should at least know that

69
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,830
Are you for real, Endo?

70
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,410
How have you been cutting it?

71
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,490
I mean, that's obvious

72
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,610
Well, to be honest I never actually cut an onion in my life...

73
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,440
You're over 40 and you've never cut an onion in your life!?

74
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,750
Yeah, I never cut an onion before, I swear

75
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,700
Man, that's unbelievable

76
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,800
For now it's all pretty watchable, nothing feels strange

77
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,220
Agreed

78
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,210
Is it ok for him to fry those?

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,700
I mean, that's just potato starch​

80
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,690
Yeah that... that's alright

81
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,280
Is it?

82
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,650
He's gonna stir-fry them for sure, later

83
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,760
Those sounds alone are amazing

84
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,080
Yeah

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
It makes him feel professional

86
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,950
Oh, so he's putting them there

87
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:48,050
Maybe the fact he used potato starch​ could make up a nice coating for the dish

88
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,970
But I must say...
- It seems pretty tasty, right?   - Yeah

89
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,400
I have no idea what he's doing

90
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,080
Ah, he's pouring water on them

91
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,460
I think that this dish's base... has no flavor

92
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,690
It won't have any flavor

93
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,660
That's a lot... are you kidding me?

94
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,160
Note: Tanaka is pouring more potato starch​

95
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,160
Its taste...?

96
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,060
I mean, he poured so much water the flavor must be so dim

97
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,040
Yeah, of course

98
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,900
What is he pouring in now?

99
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,860
Soy sauce

100
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,860
That's saké

101
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,600
It would have been good if he did that before the potato starch

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,960
Why doing it after pouring it in?

103
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,880
What's that?

104
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,450
You can't mix em up!

105
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,020
He's pouring so much in, is it gonna be fine?

106
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,050
And so, how are the results for Tanaka's original seafood Chinese-donburi going to be?

107
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,480
Here goes my original Chinese-donburi

108
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,710
Here it is

109
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,300
Doesn't really make me wanna eat it...

110
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,560
It's a bit stagnant

111
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,560
If not it would have been good

112
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,760
But I must say

113
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,760
In terms of smell, it's pretty Chinese-ish

114
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,600
It smells good

115
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,280
Let's just eat it

116
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,630
Really, smells nice

117
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,300
Tastes like raw fish!

118
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,390
Tastes like raw fish?

119
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, that flavor comes right at you

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,430
Also, this thing is incredibly sour

121
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,750
Eh? Is it sour? Mine doesn't have a flavor to begin with

122
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,170
Are you for real?

123
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,510
All I can taste is the sweetness of the onion

124
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,620
That's true

125
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,530
We have a rating system with 10 points at max, how should we rate this?

126
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,170
How much?

127
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,210
I was hoping for a 6

128
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,930
No way, no way

129
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,060
Don't talk nonsense

130
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,950
All I could taste was that onion's sweetness, so I'd say 1 point

131
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,680
My opinion

132
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,360
That's me

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,310
1 point?

134
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,500
From my point of view

135
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,560
He did it while having "Chinese cooking" on his mind and sort of had success in that

136
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,370
So I think it should at least be a... like, 2 or 3 or so

137
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,060
That's so gentle of you

138
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,340
I may be gentle, but this thing I just ate was way more gentle than me

139
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,340
Alright, how about 2 points then?

140
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,340
2 points? Man, 2 points...

141
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,450
Our next challenger is Hosei

142
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,690
And Hosei's main dish is...?

143
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,350
This is chicken meat

144
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,350
You can see I got some chicken wings here

145
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,360
I also have some leg meat

146
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,160
I think I'm gonna make a chicken with herbs covered in ankake

147
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:26,530
Note: thick starchy sauce made of kuzu powder, usually for udon

148
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,530
Ankake? He's just gonna use it to cover everything up!

149
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,400
Is it a donburi or what?

150
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,560
No, it's not it

151
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,730
Which is it then?

152
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,580
It's a single dish

153
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,220
Let's start cooking

154
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,560
I think this kind of dish fits Hosei's character pretty well

155
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't think he's a guy who cooks that much...

156
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,280
Also, he said herbs

157
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,590
Didn't he?

158
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,760
He just washed his hands and he grabbed the meat again

159
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,070
What was his purpose?

160
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,090
He just wanted to show us he's doing something

161
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,260
To show us he's clean

162
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,810
I can totally see that

163
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,050
It feels like he's trying to remember what Tanaka did

164
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,120
Yeah, I feel like he's copying me

165
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,080
I didn't think his level would be this low

166
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,000
Is he gonna roll em up like that?

167
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,750
He placed it down

168
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,920
That ball hasn't been seasoned, I bet it has zero taste

169
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,000
Is he gonna pour em in eggs and fry em?

170
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,740
Are you kidding me? He needs bread flour

171
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,430
This...

172
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,110
Isn't safe to place in oil, right?

173
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,010
What is he...?

174
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,240
Well yeah, you need breacrumbs to do that

175
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,390
So, he covered it in eggs and in flour again

176
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,170
That poor chicken meat with no flavor

177
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,170
What's the point of those eggs?

178
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:51,450
He then covered the chicken wings and legs in wheat flour and beaten eggs and fried them

179
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,180
Woah woah, that's gonna lower its temperature so much!

180
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,280
How much are you expecting from the temperature of that oil?

181
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,020
While the chicken cooks, he makes the kuzu sauce

182
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,610
That's a lot

183
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,320
That's way too much!

184
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,900
Consommé and broth?

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,220
What's that?

186
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,240
Kuzu sauce, right?

187
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,070
This is gonna kill us all

188
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,530
What is he doing? Is not even moving

189
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,920
For real, what is he aiming at?

190
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,720
What the-?

191
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,610
No idea

192
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,490
That's bad

193
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,660
Is that water?

194
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,640
Really?

195
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,040
Is he planning to pour that on it?

196
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,720
This can't be good

197
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,700
He's 100% gonna pour it over the chicken

198
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,000
Come on, that's the stuff you use to glue back broken sliding doors

199
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,980
He hasn't cooked it yet, not that it changes anything

200
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,510
Some salt and pepper in...

201
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,840
Salt and pepper

202
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,520
He sprikled em inside it

203
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,220
He actually did it

204
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,160
What now?

205
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,030
It's salt, he said it

206
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,740
Isn't that too much?

207
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,680
That's too much

208
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,950
I mean, the chicken is tasteless

209
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,180
Ah so he did this... I see

210
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,200
Oh, he mixed them all up

211
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:23,800
I guess that's a sort of a sweet-and-sour pork, a sweet-and-sour chicken

212
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,240
Hosei goes for a taste test

213
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,480
Enough of this, we had enough

214
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,010
We don't want that

215
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,290
Why have you made such thing?

216
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,790
Curry powder

217
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,330
Are you kidding me?

218
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,270
He's tampering it

219
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,090
By sprinkling that

220
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,320
This guy is dangerous

221
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,430
This is a pretty damn crazy guy

222
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,570
And so, how are the results for Hosei's herbs and kuzu sauce chicken going to be?

223
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,930
Can you

224
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,000
Please start by opening your lid?

225
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,320
This is my deep-fried chicken with stir-fried vegetables

226
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,070
But you

227
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,040
You said "herbs", right?

228
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,560
Where are those herbs?

229
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,050
Well, there's curry, which is a spice of course

230
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,820
And I may wanted to use curry from the very beginning..?

231
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,630
He never made that promise before

232
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,610
First time hearing this

233
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,760
Yeah, that's not it

234
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,100
For now, let's taste Hosei's dish

235
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,900
What the hell is this lump of stuff?

236
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,860
This is so bland

237
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,990
Yeah

238
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,380
I don't even like how you try to cover everything up with curry

239
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,600
I think this is a zero

240
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,530
Yeah, that's it

241
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,810
Are you for real?

242
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,900
Yeah, it's no-vote

243
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,230
Are you kidding me?

244
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,830
Our next challenger is Endo

245
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,160
His main ingredients are shrimps, octopus, clams and other sea food

246
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,860
What will he try to make with them?

247
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,210
L-like an omelet rice...

248
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,570
Which on the inside has pa-- paella-styled seafood

249
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,710
That's what I want to present to you guys

250
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,320
I didn't understand

251
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,660
Isn't it just an already existing dish?

252
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,360
Yeah, the paella

253
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,060
But the paella is cooked with rice

254
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,300
He said "-styled", so it may not be the exact same thing

255
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,210
Can he make a paella? Oh, he's going for the rice

256
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,110
We know for sure he has to do the rice omelet first

257
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,530
Ah, like that?

258
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,190
All I have is seafood, so I'm tossing everything inside

259
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,200
Also the clams... can I take the clams?

260
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,190
Are those clams?

261
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,680
That's wrong, dude

262
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,790
So barbaric!

263
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,670
That's not how you do it

264
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,700
Are you kidding me?

265
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,170
He's an animal

266
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,570
Oh, he only took its innards

267
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,000
That's impressive

268
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,580
You put it like that, right?

269
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,960
Yeah, with the shell, they open up as you cook

270
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,620
He's a monkey, a monkey!

271
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,090
I can't break those

272
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,880
For real?!

273
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,920
This guy's incredible

274
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,430
You have to put em in with the shell for paella, yes?

275
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,160
Yes

276
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,440
But I really wanted to put em in

277
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,740
Give it up man

278
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,690
I'm borrowing this

279
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,600
For a while

280
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,060
He's spilling out salt

281
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,740
What should I do?

282
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,050
Isn't that worse than me?

283
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,410
If I don't take em out we can't eat em

284
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,860
If you heat em up they'll open, but...

285
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,730
It seems he doesn't know that

286
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,420
Sorry, I'm adding those

287
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,610
What's that?

288
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,760
And so, how are the results for Endo's paella-styled rice omelet going to be?

289
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,220
This is what I just made

290
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,370
Here, to describe it simply we can say it's an Ome-paella

291
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,580
You don't pour anything on it?

292
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,640
No well, if you want you can add soy sauce, simple sauce

293
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,610
Or ketchup

294
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,560
I thought you wouldn't say it for once!

295
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,560
What the hell are you sayin'?!

296
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,560
What? No way!

297
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,560
Who would pour it on that?

298
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,960
Are you ready?

299
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,350
I don't really want to eat it, I don't like its smell

300
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,790
It's not a paella, it's just "styled" after it

301
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,080
About its taste...

302
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,110
Not a strong first impression

303
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,460
Yeah, there's like no flavor at all around the rice

304
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,210
It lacks flavor

305
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,210
Yeah

306
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,100
But I mean, all you guys

307
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,780
Are talking while eating, so...

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,710
Doesn't it mean it doesn't taste that bad?

309
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,380
You know, if we have to compare this to what Yamazaki made before

310
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,670
I can eat this without a problem

311
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,330
So, talking about points...

312
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,800
I think it's between Yamazaki's and Tanaka's, so it's a 1

313
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,630
So, we have a zero, one and two, everything starts from now

314
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,440
Our next challenger is Matsumoto

315
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,880
Which will his main ingredients be?

316
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,720
Woah, it's beef

317
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,710
This is... huh?

318
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,730
There's a load of meat

319
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,200
Cow

320
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,550
What will you make?

321
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,470
A beef-burger katsu-don

322
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,210
"Beef-burger katsu-don"...?

323
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,710
Sounds pretty damn hard

324
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,850
I have a feeling I can make it

325
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,800
Alright, gotcha

326
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,060
Hamburger katsu-don...

327
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,060
Let's start cooking, then

328
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,100
This is minced meat, yeah? I'm gonna make some balls

329
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,860
Like this

330
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,860
Then I'm going to fiddle with it

331
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:56,370
At this point I guess I could also add some onion in it, but...

332
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,640
Is that the right way to do it? I don't know

333
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,130
It's fine

334
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,290
Oh, ok

335
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,450
But man, really

336
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,640
The other guys were the worst

337
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,320
I never thought I'd be in the same show with people who don't know when to use potato starch

338
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,810
It's so shameful

339
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,440
I'm gonna cut the onion in big chunks

340
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,380
So you can feel it as you chew

341
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,500
Pretty big

342
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,740
Isn't that too much?

343
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,660
Is it gonna be ok?

344
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,740
I really don't know that myself

345
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,250
His face changed a bit, is he feeling a bit panicked?

346
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,820
Well, I don't know how this will turn out

347
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,080
But this is fine

348
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,920
Next up is the soup

349
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,070
First some broth

350
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:50,810
If I remember correctly for an Oyako-don you use water, soy sauce, japanese broth and mirin or such

351
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:50,810
note: oyakodon is a bowl of rice, chicken and eggs

352
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,650
You're pouring so much, you sure it's ok?

353
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,300
Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it

354
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,000
This is no good

355
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,560
He says it's fine

356
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,730
I'll also pour water

357
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,720
I don't have enough soy sauce

358
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,840
Eh? You really sure that's not too much?

359
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,530
This can't be good for the body!

360
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,210
Alright, in the meanwhile I'll fry this

361
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,690
Should we trust him?

362
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,940
While it fries I wanna make the soup

363
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,810
Let's pour some mirin

364
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,040
I see, so that's how he's doing it

365
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,080
What is he doing?

366
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,650
That's a egg-soup, isn't it?

367
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,090
But he didn't say that before

368
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,330
And so, how are the results for Matsumoto's beef-burger katsu-don going to be?

369
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,640
Let me say this: I never made this before

370
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,980
So it's your first time?

371
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,660
I just made it thinking about how it will turn out

372
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,770
And that's how it looks like

373
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,560
Looks yummy

374
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,910
It looks really tasty

375
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,540
It's my minced-beef katsu-don

376
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,300
I can't deny it smells delicious

377
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,290
Yeah, it surely smells good

378
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,140
Ok guys, eat up

379
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,140
Alright

380
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,510
Let's eat

381
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,820
It smells good, no complaints on that

382
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,740
It smells nice

383
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,540
This is frickin' delicious!!

384
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,900
It tastes a bit too strong

385
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,470
Yeah, it's kind of spicy

386
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,380
Alright but this is good, isn't it?!

387
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,450
But it's spicy

388
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,220
It's the soy sauce

389
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,500
Yeah that's it

390
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,210
Curry?

391
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:26,970
Soy sauce

392
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,030
But

393
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,090
Yeah?

394
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,340
The meat is pretty good too

395
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,030
Can I get a refill?

396
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,880
This was really good, I swear

397
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,280
It has a strong flavor but it's good

398
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,150
The soup was a bit too strong

399
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,320
So Endo, how many point do you think it's worth?

400
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,640
Around 3!

401
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,780
Endo, you're not funny

402
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,050
My head started to hurt

403
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,060
Who cares, come on! Be realistic

404
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,050
Isn't a 3 or a 4 good enough?

405
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,150
Yeah, 3 to me

406
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,900
3 should be fine

407
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,570
Our last challenger is Hamada

408
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,680
And of course his main ingredients are...

409
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,340
Well, of course is that

410
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,610
He's left with a good one

411
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,040
No one went for a noodle-based dish, should I do it?

412
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,880
You sure?

413
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,240
Yeah but what? Pasta?

414
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,920
There's this here and it can do it too but maybe this

415
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,650
Ah! Pasta!

416
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,260
You sure you're ok with that?

417
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,230
The pasta-based dish Hamada chose to do is...?

418
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,510
All-sort-of

419
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,020
Ingredients pas---

420
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,700
Carbonara

421
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,780
Isn't that a normal carbonara?

422
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,130
I mean, there's also milk here, I can totally pour it inside my carbonara

423
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,380
Counting on you

424
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,380
Alright

425
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,650
It's passing through

426
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,980
The knife is passing through

427
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,570
Is he cutting it?

428
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,450
He's not cutting it at all, it just feels as if he's doing it

429
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,040
His face alone is amazing

430
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,740
Only his face is praiseworthy

431
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,150
Which style is this?!

432
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,930
This feels so wrong

433
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,540
I never saw that way of cutting onions before

434
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,440
I heard everything's better with some garlic

435
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,380
And here he goes again, what the hell?

436
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,160
He's just passing it over it

437
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,850
He's stabbing it

438
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,810
Maybe he can't just see

439
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,490
Oh, that's possible

440
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,370
Is that how it is?

441
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,610
This could work if what you're cutting are small bones

442
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,930
With a pike or such

443
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,570
But that's not a pike, doesn't make sense

444
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,580
He should have peeled em off first

445
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,840
I should cut em together

446
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,970
In a bundle

447
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,770
I can't make em stay still

448
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,020
What's the point of this?

449
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,380
Here he goes

450
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,530
It's pike-cooking

451
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,730
That's his own style

452
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,930
The hell?

453
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,900
Next up, he cuts up the enoki mushroom

454
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,990
Maybe I don't need this bit

455
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,220
Huh?!

456
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,980
What is he doing?

457
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,710
I think he may be actually good with a pike

458
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,230
He's going for it

459
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,800
It's not really full of ingredients

460
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,570
It's definitely not so much

461
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,900
And feels tasteless

462
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,320
This is sad

463
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,700
Let's keep on cooking this

464
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,290
It's becoming all black!

465
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,200
This isn't good for the body!

466
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,480
Let's do this, shall we?

467
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,610
Here goes

468
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,540
What are you...?

469
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,820
He's pouring milk on it

470
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,620
I don't wanna eat that...

471
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,620
Is he gonna...?

472
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,300
Stop!

473
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,370
Please don't do it

474
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,410
He can't just do that

475
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,420
Yeah...

476
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,450
How is Hamada's special all-sort-of-ingredients carbonara going to be?

477
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,400
That was... one hell of a ride

478
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,730
Also you said "lots of veggies" when you started...

479
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,930
Where did that promise go to?

480
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,470
There are veggies here

481
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,300
You see? Onions...

482
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,330
Shimeji mushrooms, bell peppers...

483
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,000
Why did you cut the enoki mushrooms?

484
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,230
You should have put it entirely

485
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,700
You're all fussing around, just eat this

486
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,090
I think my tastebuds will die

487
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,660
He cut em in such small parts...

488
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,700
There's also a refreshing tomato here

489
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,230
They're stuck

490
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,780
It's all becoming stiff

491
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,670
It's not stiff at all

492
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,140
Enough of this

493
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,080
Let's skip this

494
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,780
It feels off

495
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,820
He only goes to good restaurants

496
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,890
That's why

497
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,580
Let's eat

498
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,410
Eat the spaghetti and the tomato, you'll feel refreshed

499
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,570
'Cause it's rich

500
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,870
Alright

501
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,870
Let's eat

502
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,800
The milk made it thick

503
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,140
This is horrible

504
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,840
What the hell is this?

505
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,870
This is not edible

506
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,350
What's this? What's this taste?

507
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,710
Is it carpet-flavored?

508
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,850
Tanaka tell him which is the most basic thing in a carbonara

509
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Translation by: Shion (@FGRNDNoises)

510
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,820
It's eggs and cheese

511
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,850
You have to blend em together and make a cream

512
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
I put em in

No, you didn't

515

It's dangerous

518
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
So, its score?

519
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,520
I think this hits rock bottom

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,090

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,910

525
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,680
I should have put it in

526
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,800
You admit it?

527
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,970
