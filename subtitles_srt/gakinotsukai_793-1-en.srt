Downtown's Hamada "Unthinkable!" trial.

The immature and arrogant acts that show business's

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,310
most sadistic man has engaged in are too numerous to mention!

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,200
People say......this man is unthinkable!

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,710
As a result, we held an emergency project!

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,090
We open the court for the Hamada Masatoshi "Unthinkable!" Trial!

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,520
Now, we open court for the 1st Hadama Masatoshi "Unthinkable" Trial.

At last, the accused, Hamada Masatoshi, please enter.

18
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:13,660
Defendant

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,660
Hamada Masatoshi

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,490
I don't understand why I'm even here.

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,480
Shut your trap!

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,880
Your honor...

23
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,270
...please give him the death penalty!

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,240
We'd like you to accept a death penalty.

25
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,450
You haven't even proven anything yet!

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,870
You see, this time...

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,030
...we'd like to show how the defendant, Hamada, is an utterly unthinkable man

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,430
and has caused harm to all those arou....

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,840
Hey, wait! Why aren't you saying honorifics?

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,630
Hah!?

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,860
I said, "Why aren't you saying honorifics?"

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,230
HAMADA!

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,260
Mister Attorney are you all right?

34
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,920
I'm all right!

35
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,190
If you've got nothing prepared then you don't have to respond!

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,810
You see, today I'm outraged.

37
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,050
Because you see, everyone has been harmed by him.

38
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,570
Yes.

39
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,910
This man is an immense sadist...

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,960
...and many people have suffered harm by him.

41
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,350
Firstly, as you won't know how sadistic he is...

42
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,850
..so we have video footage of it for you to watch.

43
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,070
Please watch it.

Hamada Masatoshi "Unthinkable!" Trial!

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,200
"The Legend of the Super Sadist" - Compilation

47
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,960
The defendant - Hamada Masatoshi.

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,440
Victims of his sadistic ways continue to appear all the time.

49
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,400
Victim 1

50
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,400
Yamasaki Housei

51
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,740
?

52
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,590
Shut the hell up!

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,310
The event took place at the Yamasaki versus Moriman battle.

54
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,060
Please pay attention to Hamada, who goes in between the quarreling pair.

55
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,710
That hurts!

56
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,940
It hurts!

57
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,610
The neutralist, Hamada, grabs Yamasaki's hair and drags him around.

58
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,160
This was a decisive moment of the super sadist.

59
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,930
Please pay attention to Hamada, as he gets in between the two again.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,540
This is a different year again.

61
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,250
After dragging Yamasaki out, he slams him down onto the ring.

62
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,810
This man is just unthinkable!

63
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,570
Super sadistic behaviour then explodes mercilessly on to he knocked down Yamasaki.

64
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,090
This is a different year again.

65
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,090
That's right.

66
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,450
....7, 8, 9.

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Fight!

68
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,380
He doesn't easily accept a knock out!

69
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,030
This was a moment of tragedy tasted by Yamasaki, caused by the Super S, Hamada.

70
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,010
There are still many more.

71
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,760
Penalty's Wakki

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,760
Victim 2

73
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,450
What did I do?

74
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,110
Hello! Please come over here.

75
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,160
It happened when Penalty first appeared on Gaki no Tsukai.

76
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,980
Wakki, who prides himself in having hard abs was attacked by Hamada's Super Sadism.

77
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,020
What? So you got hard abs?

78
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,530
Yes, that's no problem.

79
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,530
Oh really?

80
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,980
I can take even harder.

81
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,510
That's not even his abs!

82
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,530
That's his liver!

83
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,690
Immediately after meeting Wakki, Hamada lands a serious punches on his body.

84
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,520
This man is unthinkable!

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,510
Since then, Penalty haven't returned to Gaki No Tsukai.

86
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,910
Director Onuma

87
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,910
Victim 3

88
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,850
"Super S" Hamada also shows no mercy towards those who can't fight back.

89
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,580
The attacked was the Frozen Mammoth, Onuma.

90
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,050
It's frozen so it's dead.

91
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,080
No, stop! stop!

92
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,240
Ouch!

93
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,300
He wasn't expecting it.

94
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,800
It must be pulsating badly now.

95
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,890
He pulled it out a bit.

96
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,130
The body can't take in such things.

97
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,920
Furthermore, to the red panda, Fuuta-kun....

98
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,850
Super sadist Hamada's harsh hit smacks Onuma in the face.

99
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,210
Extreme pain that even shocked Onuma himself, runs through his body.

100
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,410
Honkon

101
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,410
Victim 4

102
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,150
There'd be heaps for Honkon-san.

103
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,980
Start!

104
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,850
Tragedy struck at the imaginary audition.

105
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,080
Hamada, in the role as film director, assaults Honkon after this.

106
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,430
Acting Proficiency Test

107
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,430
Getting Slapped

108
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,230
The customers are freaked out!

109
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,640
Somebody stop him! This is not good!

110
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,980
What is his problem?

111
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,300
Honkon gets attacked by a storm of slaps.

112
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,510
What does the victim himself think about the "Super S" Hamada?

113
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,470
Bluntly said - I'm afraid of him.

114
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,330
A normal comedian would do one or two slaps but...

115
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,590
I don't know why, but he came back to me

116
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,130
and when our eyes met....

117
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,940
...his eyes didn't show any signs of kindness.

118
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,730
And at those times, if you go against him, he attacks even more.

119
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,750
Maybe it was eye contact telling me...

120
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,450
"You've got no choice but to bring your face to me, yourself"

121
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,580
Does even gender not matter to this man at all?

122
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,060
After the break, we reveal all the proof of Hamada's super sadistic actions!

123
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,600
Morisanchu

124
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,600
Victim 5

125
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,520
Gender doesn't matter to Hamada's sadistic ways.

126
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,410
Morisanchu's Oshima, who came to give him

127
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,490
a Valentine chocolate, was also a victim.

128
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,440
Ready, set...

129
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Hit, wear, jankenpon!

130
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,660
One more time!

131
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,850
You hit her with the handle!

132
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,230
That must hurt!

133
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,480
This face is just wrong.

134
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,210
No holding back, whatsoever.

135
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,410
The shot was so powerful that it even broke the pico-pico hammer.

136
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,380
After that, Hamada's sadism escalates further.

137
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,920
But his target wasn't just Oshima.

138
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,460
The person targeted by Hamada, was Murakami.

139
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,090
Apologize!

140
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,530
Murakami has her breast groped.

141
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,980
Hamada's sexual harassment left Murakami's innocent heart in tatters.

142
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,000
This is what these girls have to say about Hamada.

143
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,280
What's his problem?

144
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,070
That was cruel, Hamada-san!

145
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,220
That was cruel! What's your problem!?

146
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,800
Oshima-san is still a woman you know!

147
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,560
I'm a woman! Was there a need to hit me so hard!?

148
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,650
As for me, he rubbed my breasts and...

149
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,670
he probably was thinking "Oh I did her good".

150
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,670
Don't make a mistake.

151
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:54,930
People say stuff now, like, "Murakami is Hamada's girl now".

152
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,930
That's such a bother.

153
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,360
Guys will find it hard to approach you then.

154
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,250
I seriously can't get a boyfriend because of that.

155
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,180
Hamada's Super Sadist deeds shall not be excused!

156
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,590
Hamada-kun....just how sadistic are you?

157
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,070
Well...I don't think I am a sadist.

158
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,660
Of course you're a sadist.

159
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,180
Yes, and even whilst watching the video footage -

160
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,080
- he was hysterically laughing "hya hya hya hya".

161
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,610
I heard that.

162
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,230
Like 8 monkeys worth of laughs.

163
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,310
That's quite a lot of cackling!

164
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,430
Hosei-san, there was a video involving you so -

165
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,610
- could you please step up as witness?

166
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,700
The death penalty is already decided at this point.

167
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,220
I'd firstly like to talk about the Moriman incident.

168
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,560
Firstly, Moriman and I did a sacred muay thai dance and -

169
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,560
it was decided that Morio would come to me and we'd fight.

170
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,340
Yes, bluntly said, that's a promised event.

171
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,750
I think from about three times ago, Hamada-san would get in between that and -

172
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,440
- as he pushed Morio and I apart

173
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,890
he'd definitely grab my hair and punch me

174
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,170
and would assault me as he separated us.

175
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,820
Honestly, if that got laughs, I'd have no problems!

176
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,060
But not a single person is laughing in regards to that!

177
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,000
I really wish he'd stop.

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,210
Morio doesn't know how to respond either because he's

179
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,990
getting beat up by Hamada before their own fight even starts!

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,320
And the guests don't laugh.

181
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,560
However, his engine revs harder when guests don't laugh.

182
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,860
The reason for that is that, by then, he's no longer a comedian anymore.

183
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,900
He's just simply a sadist.

184
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,210
Well, there were other victims aside from Yamasaki-san but...

185
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,350
...in the case of Morisanchu Murakami's breasts....

186
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,480
...do you have any counterarguments?

187
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,330
What was your intention?

188
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,340
That was my way of tsukkomi.

189
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,340
Tsukkomi !?

190
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,470
Without using words or simply hitting.

191
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,300
Squeezing her tits for her was the tsukkomi.

192
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,160
"Squeezing her tits for her" was??

193
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,880
Hey listen!

194
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,820
Hey listen.

195
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,080
Hey listen !

196
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,400
What's up with ya!?

197
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,390
You've got tsukkomi all wrong!

198
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,030
Didn't you see in the video? She wasn't playing dumb!

199
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,120
She was running away!

200
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,060
You chased after and grabbed her!

201
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,360
We don't know how to react either!

202
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,030
Same thing goes for Onuma-san!

203
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,490
But wasn't he acting dumb like that?

204
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,950
Because you'd be like "What? A frozen mammoth?", right?

205
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,060
Well, I suppose it was but...

206
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,960
Yeah see, it is right?

207
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,610
But Onuma isn't a cointainer to put burdock roots in so...

208
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,510
I'd like to ask him something.

209
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,020
This thing could've split his nose, right?

210
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,780
Because...they're clearly different sizes.

211
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,750
Weren't you afraid of that possibility?

212
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,260
Afraid of what?

213
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,350
Of the nose splitting.

214
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,310
What's the problem with that?

215
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,790
Well splitting his nose with a burdock root...

216
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,180
...isn't exactly a good deed.

217
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,450
Oh...well it may not be a good deed but...

218
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,050
I did that with the intent of it being a tsukkomi.

219
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,240
So if it split -

220
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,780
The splitting would be the tsukkomi.

221
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,000
Splitting it, really ?

222
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,850
It's his debut piece.

223
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,310
"Splitting is the tsukkomi"

224
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,340
Hamada Masatoshi "Unthinkable!" Trial!

225
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,340
"Overacting in Pranks" Section

226
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,220
On a Gaki no Tsukai prank project -

227
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,470
- Hamada's over excessive acting causes colleteral harm.

228
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,280
Tanaka Naoki

229
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,280
Victim 1

230
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,130
It's you Tanaka. We remember this well, don't we?

231
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,460
In this prank, Hamada snaps at Tanaka,

232
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,460
who is acting as foul mouthed character.

233
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,970
Small fry wins!

234
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,550
I'm the champion?

235
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,750
What about us?

236
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,120
Why did that happen?

237
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,430
Are we able to broadcast this on TV?

238
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,620
Are you unsure?

239
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,620
Hm.

240
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,220
What do you think Yama-chan?

241
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,110
Eh?

242
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,510
Yes.

243
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,450
"Yes"? We've done the same thing twice already!

244
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,070
That's really scary!

245
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,920
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,500
Whadd'ya mean you're sorry?

247
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,360
That's scary.

248
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,360
It was scary.

249
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,910
Are you taking it serious? Is this the best you can do?

250
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,250
A foul mouthed...

251
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,290
Mm?

252
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,230
A foul mouthed...

253
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,370
Foul mouthed? You call that foul mouthed!?

254
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,550
That hit him!

255
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,560
Well!?

256
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,560
We're sorry!

257
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,480
What's wrong with you?

258
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,990
This ain't good!

259
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,190
An unthinkable level of overacting!

260
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,920
He knees Tanaka in the face, and as a result...

261
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,960
JUST KIDDIN'!

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,690
Hamada's over excessive acting leads Tanaka really cry.

263
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,600
Victim 2

264
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,600
Manager Fujiwara

265
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,590
In this prank, Matsumoto fakes an injury,

266
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,390
and responsibility falls to his manager, Fujiwara.

267
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,990
Wrong way!

268
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,270
Are you okay?

269
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,490
It hurts! Don't touch me!

270
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,290
As if that would happen from that.

271
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,970
I'll slowly roll your back over.

272
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,440
Can this happen even at that speed?

273
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,570
Hamada Appears!

274
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
The snow is soft so...

275
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,980
Here he comes.

276
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,170
Call the rescue squad!

277
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,110
I told you so, Fujiwara. Didn't I?

278
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,500
Sorry.

279
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,400
I said it didn't I?

280
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,320
Yes.

281
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,070
Didn't I say "What if something happens?"

282
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,070
Yes.

283
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,560
Slap!

284
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,970
This is strictly a prank project.

285
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,230
Get your act together, damn it!

286
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,260
Yes.

287
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,910
It's because you guys said it would be fine, when it wasn't!

288
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,010
Well!?

289
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,010
Yes.

290
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,090
Thud!

291
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,120
His unthinkable over excessive acting even included a head butt!

292
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,340
As a result...

293
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,860
[Gaki no Tsukai Prank]

294
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,620
It's starting to hurt now...

295
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,200
Hamada's over excessive acting forced Fujiwara muster a bitter laugh.

296
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,610
Cocorico

297
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,610
Victim 3

298
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,700
This prank involved scaring the daylights out of young comedians as they wrestled.

299
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,470
However, Hamada's targets were fellow prank insiders, Cocorico.

300
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,700
WHO THE HELL WAS THAT!!??

301
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,560
Hold on a second!

302
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,280
Who just kicked me!?

303
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,220
WAS IT YOU!?

304
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,800
In pursuit for realism, Hamada's fist cleanly hits Endo's head!

305
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,400
Why are you all just standing there?

306
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,000
What the heck is wrong with you guys?

307
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,620
Why did you do that!?

308
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,300
Who kicked me!?

309
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,250
Who did it !?

310
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,080
Who did it?

311
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,590
Tanaka made a mistake in choosing to approach.

312
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,120
Even here, Hamada's slaps explode.

313
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Get friggin' real!

314
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,300
DO IT PROPERLY, DAMN IT!

315
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,600
The youngsters were at a complete loss of words due to Hamada's overacting.

316
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,510
As a result....

317
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,710
I'm so relieved....

318
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,180
Hamda's over excessive acting caused this ugly man to cry.

319
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,890
Hamada's over acting, shall not be forgiven.

320
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,480
So, there you have it.

321
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,930
Tanaka, as you were a victim, could you please step up as witness?

322
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,030
Yes.

323
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,930
Yes sir.

324
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,060
I'm sure you have much to say.

325
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,230
We~ll, we were shown some horrible footage.

326
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,890
This is something I thought while watching it but...

327
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,950
...what do you mean, "It was Tanaka's mistake to approach"?

328
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,810
Frankly that's quite strange.

329
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,260
We were also insiders setting up the prank

330
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,470
and know what the plan is!

331
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,040
Was there a need to hit us? That hard!?

332
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,950
The effect of hitting Endo was already enough.

333
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,280
Right! Everyone there was already scared!

334
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,850
So hitting me was totally unnecessary!

335
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,110
And even the one before it. It was quite an old video.

336
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,170
The prank while playing badminton.

337
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,630
There was no need to hit....that hard!

338
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,050
If he just acted fierce then I'd be scared enough with that!

339
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,110
After I understood that it was a prank, it's an embarrassing story but

340
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,390
I broke down and cried.

341
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,960
Those weren't tears of relief from finding out it was a prank!

342
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,230
It's because I was scared!

343
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,380
I was being held by Suga-san.

344
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,950
It was the first time I cried on someones chest!

345
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,890
Do you have any objections to that?

346
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,890
You're clearly going too far, aren't you!?

347
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,370
Pranks are boring if you do it half-assed though, don't you agree?

348
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,230
Whadd'ya mean?

349
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,070
What do you mean?

350
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,000
The aim is to scare you, so if that's the goal

351
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,950
I've got to at least to do that much.

352
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,850
But, for example, with the skiing prank

353
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,880
we were trying to trick our manager, Fujiwara, but...

354
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,370
the thing I found amazing was...

355
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,930
...that people don't usually get angry and head butt like that.

356
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,970
And usually, you'd realise it's a prank as soon as you get head butted.

357
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,630
But since it wasn't realised even after the head butt...

358
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,870
...you must often be head butting in real life.

359
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,620
Are you a head butting man?

360
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,490
Well I'm annoyed.

361
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,820
Annoyed...?

362
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,800
Do you think he's mixing up words?

363
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,380
What do you mean by annoyed?

364
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,880
It's annoying that I'm being made to sit here.

365
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,690
To be judged on these video footages.

366
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,390
What are you saying?

367
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,930
I just try to do my best at work.

368
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,750
Why is he wearing a T-shirt over long sleeves?

369
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,240
Let's analyse this from a different angle.

370
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,010
Errr...you.

371
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:24,430
Can you come in here, just like the way you come to a shoot?

372
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,290
How do you normally come?

373
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,670
Reenact how you'd come in for shoots.

374
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,010
It's just the same way as before!

375
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,910
HURRY UP!

376
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,570
Die!

377
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,570
Please come in.

378
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,880
' morning.

379
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,860
'morning.

380
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,150
Eh?

381
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,760
No, it's not like that.

382
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,830
Was it like that?

383
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,530
No, and I've never heard him clearly say "Good morning".

384
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,690
Well hear this, defendant.

385
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,230
We have secretly filmed you as you enter shoots.

386
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,900
Oh! I'd really like you to see this!

387
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,800
Please watch!

388
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,620
The video reveals Hamada entering for shoots.

389
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,460
The shocking moment that the camera recorded!

390
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,850
Just what was filmed on there?

391
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,540
....we have secretly filmed you as you enter shoots.

392
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,540
Oh, I'd really like you to watch this!

393
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,260
Let us see this then. Here it is.

394
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,290
Good morning.

395
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,970
See! See!

396
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,870
But I did say "Good morning" then.

397
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,450
Did you see that?

398
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,450
You didn't say that at all!

399
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,410
You were laughing and not listening.

400
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,120
What!? Play it again!

401
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,670
Where?

402
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,090
You just laughed and didn't listen.

403
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,880
Good morning!

404
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,330
Good evening.

405
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,330
Good evening!?

406
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,460
What was that about?

407
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,460
If it's night then it'd be "Good evening" right?

408
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,310
No, no, no.

409
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,820
What's with the walk and not taking off the sunglasses and saying....

410
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,020
"Good evening".

411
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,610
That's scary.

412
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,280
He's totally looking down upon people.

413
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,280
Oh, you're right.

414
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,380
Is that really me?

415
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,470
Seriously what's with the sunglasses?

416
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,120
Are you a mole rat?

417
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,380
Are you a mole?

418
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,540
Take them off!

419
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,720
Idiot!

420
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,150
Die!

421
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,640
Just simply die!

422
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,870
Like this, the defendant Hamada comes to shoots with

423
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:00,010
a fierce face on purpose in order to intimidate us.

424
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,190
And it's not only at shoots for....Gaki no Tsukai.

425
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,850
He does this at various other places.

426
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,900
Could the witness please enter?

427
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,670
Shoufukutei Shouhei

428
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,670
Witness

429
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,780
Hello.

430
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,800
Next week! More unbelievably evil acts by Hamada are revealed!

431
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,800
Also, a famous actress stands at the witness box and confesses for the first time.

432
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,450
And what are the secrets of Hamada after a psychological analysis?

433
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:39,120
We focus on the victims within show business in the next Hamada "Unthinkable" trial!

434
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,690
And what will the judgment given to Hamada be!?
