12
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,630
It was a good bath

13
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,000
Tanaka you want to drink beer, right?

14
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,530

He drinks a lot recently

21
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,870
Tanaka was like "I wanna drink, I wanna drink"

22
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,810

25
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,110
So everyone shall we have a toast?

26
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,110
For real?

Yamazaki Housei

28
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,210
Then I don't want any

29
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,880
Just have one drink, c'mon

30
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,250
Hamada-san, you should have some

31
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,250
Really?

32
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,420
You're gonna wish you had some later

33
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,950
You're gonna wish you had some later

34
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,290
You're gonna wish you had some later

35
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,890
Definitely

36
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,630
It's a good excuse

37
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,360
"I was drunk so it's okay"

38
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,360
If you can say that that's good

51
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,880
But it was a good bath, right?

52
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,810
I could go again though

53
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,180
I could actually go...

54
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,950
Excuse me

55
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,950
... three more times

56
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,420
Maybe it's normal to think that way

57
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,290
Well that's...

58
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,020
At least three times

59
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,020
I'm going again tomorrow

60
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,660
A morning bath's pretty good

61
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,730
Let's take one before going home

62
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:30,670
John McClane
(Bruce Willis)

63
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:30,670
New York police officer John McClane attends
a party on a high-rise, but terrorists arrive...

64
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:30,670
Rec

65
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:30,670
「Die Hard」

66
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,130
I don't really...

67
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,600
I'm not very good with this one...

68
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,600
To tell the truth, I'm not really...

69
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:39,610
Rec

70
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:39,610
Whoever gets the "talker card must
talk about the given movie as their past

71
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,210
Then I'll be taking the middle one...

72
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,810
I wanted the middle one...

73
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,840
1, 2

74
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,050
Yes! That was close...

75
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,880
really close

76
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,750
You take baths many times over?

77
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,520
Isn't it like that? It's an onsen after all...

78
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,520
I would want to go maybe 3, 4 times?

79
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,190
To go again is kind of...

80
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,290
I might go now, actually...

81
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,290
For real??

82
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,830
Right now?

83
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,100
Um, before you go to the onsen again...

84
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,030
can I have a moment of your time?

85
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,030
What is it all of a sudden?

86
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,500
I want to go right now though

87
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,040
It will be really quick

88
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,170
What is it?

89
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,870
I don't

90
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,870
think that you'll believe me

91
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,540
This is from a while ago

92
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,080
but in the past

93
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
when I'd go a journey... or rather trip

94
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
a lot of things would happen

95
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,150
Isn't that something that happens to all of us?

96
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,920
Once, actually,

97
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,590
I was on a very tall building

98
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,160
and it was getting bombed, or no, there was a fire

99
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,630
and I got caught up in the terrorist attack

100
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,200
But I saved everyone

101
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,440
In the end I was just in a tanktop all messed up

102
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,210
I don't get this at all

103
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,010
Who the hell are you

104
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,140
I know you really won't believe me

105
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,250
But a few years later, I went abroad

106
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,250
and there were these bad guys

107
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,520
who took control of all the control towers

108
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
and all of the lights on the runway

109
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,390
went out so the planes didn't know where to land

110
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,030
so all of the planes

111
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,560
kind of fell

112
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,830
No, wait, so what were you doing then?

113
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,500
I was actually just traveling...

114
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,900
well not traveling but just kind of around

115
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,470
I don't get it at all

116
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,470
I'm sorry

117
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,640
Your story is kind of..

118
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,080
Then can I just say how I defeated the bad guys?

119
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,810
You defeated them?

120
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,810
Yeah in the end

121
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,510
That's amazing

122
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,750
There was a lot of engine oil leaking

123
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,720
so I used a zippo lighter or whatever it was

124
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,450
to set in on fire

125
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,790
So when the bad guys tried to leave

126
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,060
the fire flared up

127
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,130
their plane just went "BOOM"

128
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,900
everything ended well... but a few people died...

129
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,200
What are you even saying

130
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,140
Nothing ended well!

131
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,510
But with the least amount of casualties...

132
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,510
But some people died right

133
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,710
"with the least amount"...

134
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,710
"the least amount"...

135
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,110
I don't get it at all

136
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,110
I don't remember that incident

137
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,820
I just remembered it just now

138
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,390
So you stopped us when we were gonna take a bath

139
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,690
that's amazing... You're pretty tough

140
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,690
there was also the subway

141
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,930
when it exploded when I was walking

142
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,370
but I don't really remember that part

143
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,100
No, I get it

144
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,700

146

Yes, let's

159
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,370
I want to go but there was a karaoke too right?

160
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,270
I want to go

161
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,270
For real? Then let's go

162
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,310
Actually can you wait a second

163
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,610
What is it?

164
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,380
Um, there's something I want to tell you I guess

165
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,780
This story is going to go way back, but

166
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,290
I was fishing by the sea and that was how I made a living

167
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,460
What?

168
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,960
You didn't have any period like that

169
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,960
Actually...

170
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,600
it was one day I went fishing like any other

171
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,430
and by the shore I saw a turtle being bullied

172
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,070
Oh really?

173
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,640
"Hey you there"

174
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,070
"Cut it out," and I stopped them

175
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,140
But then the turtle didn't leave

176
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,550
It kind of felt like he wanted me to get on his back

177
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,720
The bullied turtle?

178
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,820
Yes the one I saved

179
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,120
so I get on his back

180
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,250
and he goes straight into the sea

181
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,860
Why didn't you let go?

182
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,860
He was just so fast

183
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,690
So just let go

184
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,690
Just let go

185
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,060
and you can swim back up

186
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,170
Yes, that's true, but it was like he wouldn't let me

187
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,800
Isn't that just you then?

188
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,800
Yeah it's just you

189
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,700
Yes that true but

190
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,040
it was like I had lost the composure to

191
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,740
Y'know like when you go up somewhere too high and you lose the timing to let go

192
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,810
Is this gonna be a long story?

193
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,910
It shouldn't be too long now

194
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,280
What are you even talking about?

195
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,980
I don't understand what you're saying

196
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,150
So we just went and this sea bream and flounder

197
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,150
were really dancing

198
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,690
Dancing?

199
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,930
And this princess person showed up

200
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,430
and was like "if you're leaving"

201
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,560
Wow you really skipped... not that I know

202
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,630
Not that I know but yeah

203
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,730
"If you're leaving take this with you"

204
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,040
You got something?

205
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,040
Is was like some

206
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,400
wooden box and

207
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,010
so I get this wooden box

208
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,610
and I reach the shore and I'm like "What is it?"

209
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,610
It would bother you

210
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,610
She said it was a souvenir

211
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,380
and I opened it

212
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,950
and was very surprised

213
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,950
What happened?

214
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,580
This smoke...

215
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,250
Just came out

216
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,390
and I got the full force of it

217
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,890
and I turned like 80 years old

218
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,860
my aura did

219
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,300
Your aura...?

220
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,260
your aura?

221
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,700
My appearance's aura

222
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,700
Just your appearance?

223
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,370
Just for that moment?

224
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,570
I think he means it like that

225
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,470
But it's not like that now?

226
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,370
Not right now

227
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,210
But I used to be much younger

228
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,610
If it was the real me

229
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,610
I would be much younger

230
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,180
I don't really get it

231
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm sorry, really

232
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,350
I guess we just aren't smart enough to understand

233
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,750
What were you even talking about?

234
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,150
But it's really true

235
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,290
Actually if I think about it now

236
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,560
it was like a dream

237
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,460
It was a dream

238
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,500
I don't really know if it's true

239
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,070
Why do we have to listen to a story about your stupid dream

240
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,070
Really

241
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,040
I just really wanted to say it now

242
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,970
So should we go take a bath?

243
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,140
I wanna go to the rocky one again

I promise it's really quick

258

What is it with you guys?

259
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,170
I'm sorry, I really am

I'm really sorry

266
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,690
I would just sneeze a little

267
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,690
and out of the vase at home

268
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,460
a weird dude would just come out

What's with the weird old dude?

270
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,570

273
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,200
I'm sorry it's just that an old dude from Arabia would come

274
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,470
and he looked maybe 47, or 48?

275
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,610
and he would come out

276
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,010
47, 48?

280
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,480
I would thought that it was really creepy and was wondering

281
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,480
Yeah that is creepy

282
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,490
if you all could help me solve this problem

283
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,190

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,300

A long time ago

300
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,370
I went to Hokkaido

301
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,970
and lived there a while

302
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,670
I've never heard this before

303
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,670
I had no idea

304
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,170
I thought you were from Nishinomiya

305
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,810
Well, Nishinomiya was

306
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,440
a place I lived once, then I went to Hokkaido

307
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,610
and in Hokkaido

308
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,850
I lived with

309
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,580
my dad, and my sister

310
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,150
all three of us

311
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,650
And we were all living together

312
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,890
But my dad

313
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,490
wouldn't really work

314
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,030
He didn't work?

315
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,030
But I guess it happens

316
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,630
So then

317
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,130
he was like "I want to build a bath by myself"

318
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,240
You really skipped huh

319
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,740
Self sufficiency...?

320
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,040
We didn't have water, gas, electricity... we had nothing

321
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,250

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,050

He named you and then

330
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,560
And then he selfishly nicknamed you

331
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,560
Yeah he would nickname me

332
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,930
You were in Hokkaido the whole time?

333
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,830
Me?

334
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,830
Until you grew up I mean

335
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,570
But once

336
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,070
I came out to Tokyo

337
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,070
Oh really?

338
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,080
Did you work in Tokyo?

339
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,780
I did... in like a little factory

340
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,780
Oh really...

341
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,220
Why'd you go back?

342
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,220
Well, this is really

343
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,750
close to my heart but

344
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,190
I mean I don't really want to say but

345
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,490
I got to know this young girl

346
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,530
well...

347
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,160
we had

348
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,830
a child

349
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,400
she got pregnant?

350
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,400
Yes

351
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Really

352
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:36,140
But I was young so we couldn't get married yet

353
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,410
so then my dad came from Hokkaido

354
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,580
and he brought

355
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,280
some radish and then...

356
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,520
he gives it to the young girl's father

357
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,460
right?

358
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,030
And then he got really angry

359
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,030
Well if he only brought radish, wouldn't you?

360
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,430
radish...

361
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,430
It's not much of an apology

362
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,930
some radish and some potatoes too

363
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,930
I don't really get it...

364
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,030
So vegetables, right?

365
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,900
Ones your dad made

366
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
Yes, because we had no money

367
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,910
I see, self-sufficiency....

368
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,010
I can't say any more now because I just remembered

369
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,080
We all cried together though, sorry.

370
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,750
No more

371
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,150
It's tough when you start to remember

372
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,150
What even is this

373
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,150
If he remembers...

374
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,220
It's so fragmented

375
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,220
what is this

376
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,430
Yeah it's too fragmented

377
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,690
I'm sorry, so many in a row

378
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,700
Well you can't help it

379
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,930
Can you just deal these out then

380
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,840
Yes, please

381
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,840
Please

382
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,870
then this one

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,910

00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,120
Yup, let's go

391
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,860
Wait wait wait wait a second, will you?

392
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,390
Wait a second

393
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,030
No we're going

394
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,030
Wait wait wait

395
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,770

my little sister's...older brother...

397
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,210
Your little sister's older brother....

398
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,210
My...

399
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,210
That's a little

400
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,210
What is he saying

401
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,350
He said, "my little sister's older brother"

402
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,820
My wife's

403
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,820
Yes?

404
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,380
older brother

405
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,750
Oh, your wife's older brother

406
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,520
He was a little troubling

407
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,160
Troubling...?

408
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,530
Well what I mean is that he wouldn't really be at home

409
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,360
Well, that's...

410
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,360
So he was wandering around?

411
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,600
He had a lot of wanderlust

412
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
and he was trouble

413
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,100
and a lot of times he would complain about me

414
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,340
why would he do that?

415
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,280
Well, I don't know... there was a factory I worked at

416
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,180
A factory?

417
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,180
You worked in a factory?

418
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,550
Sorry, yeah... I used to work at a factory

419
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,690
And the boss would be so annoying

420
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,020
"your brother...."

421
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,320
The director, huh

422
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,320
And so I would be like

423
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,590
"Octopus Director!"

424
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,830
What director?

425
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,990
The director was completely bald

426
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,630
Oh, I see

427
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,630
the factory director

428
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,530
And I would see that and go, "Octopus Director!"

429
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,830
that's kind of rude

430
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,800
That's a little bad

431
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,800
Yeah yeah

432
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,040
But I guess

433
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,810
he was that kind of person

434
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,540
But he'd still sometimes be a little touching I guess

435
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,810
He'd be a little touching?

436
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,180
I don't get it at all

437
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,180
I don't get it at all

438
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,580
I thought it was just going to be bad things

439
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,090
He wasn't a bad man. he had little henchmen

440
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,090
Henchmen?

441
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,090
His hair was kind of scraggly

442
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,890
But he'd clean the shrine grounds

443
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,530
Was he a volunteer?

444
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,660
I don't really understand

445
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,400
the direction of the story

446
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sorry but anyways

447
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,740
I just wanted to say

448
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,810
that my wife's brother was a handful

449
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,010
I actually hadn't really interacted much with her brother

450
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,780
I only talked to him a little when he came home sometimes

451
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,410
So I never really had too much to do with him

452
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,680
So you were looking at him objectively?

453
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,680
Objectively?

454
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,590
So you weren't really in it

455
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,520
He is really into it

456
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,520
Well he is your brother right?

457
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,290
Step-brother

458
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,460
He was my step-brother but I never really knew him

459
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,460
He'd just come home sometimes and be like "Oh, Hiroshi"

460
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,430
Hiroshi?

461
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,430
Not Masatoshi?

462
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,400
He was probably mistaken

463
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,700
That's pretty...

464
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,240
That's pretty bad

465
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,510
That would suck

466
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,640
He was a handful, but he was a good person

467
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,950
You had such a point in your life?

468
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,950
Yup, yes

469
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,380
Really... In a factory?

470
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,650
that's kind of weird

471
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,650
I'm sorry, I really am

472
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,320
Everyone's weird

473
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,360
1, 2

474
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,500
Ugh~

475
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,900
Well I'm

476
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,900
going to go take a bath now

477
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,900
I wanna go to sleep

478
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,200
Yeah

479
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,200
I wanna go to sleep

Shall we go now?

486
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,080
Should we go?

487
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,210
Wait

488
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,380
Before you go to sleep, will you listen to my story?

489
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,180
What is it now?

490
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,320
I wonder how many years ago it was....

491
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,090
wasn't Earth kind of in danger?

492
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,090
No, no it never was

493
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,290
Yeah there was no such thing

494
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,760
So like Nostradamus

495
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,430
but he was just saying that stuff

496
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,560
But listen

497
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,730
when I was little I was trained

498
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,640
by a lot of old men

499
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,640
What does he mean?

500
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Do any of you know?

501
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,910
Know about the Hokutoken?

502
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,150
Isn't it a school of martial arts?

503
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,150
It is

504
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,610
You don't really hear about it though

505
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,550
So I was just walking down the street

506
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,920
and there are bad guys out there, y'know?

507
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,120
And those guys bring axes, you know?

508
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,890
For real?

509
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,490
An axe out of the blue?

510
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,490
An axe

511
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,800
So it's pretty dangerous

512
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,800
Yeah that is dangerous

513
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
So I was like "Atatatatata!"

514
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,970
What?

515
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,840
What is that?

516
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,510
That's the Hokutoken

517
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,010
Oh, so like a battle cry?

518
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,010
Yes, a battle cry

519
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,810
"Atatatatata!"

520
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,910
So like "Atatatatata!"

521
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,610
and I'd hit them

522
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,880
They taught me that

523
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,520
So...

524
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,220
I'm sorry, but none of this is coming through

525
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,660
So how do you do it? You have to do it more seriously

526
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,660
or we won't get it

527
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,230
Well it's actually pretty straightforward

528
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,160
So you take the stance

529
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,500
Why is it like this

530
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
It's weird, like a cat pose

531
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,900
Well they'd bring axes and stuff, so I dodge, then

532
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,040
"Atatatatata! Atatatatata!"

533
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,970
A lot of "Atatatatata!" is what I'd do

534
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,710
Basically

535
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,810
What happens to the other guy?

536
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,380
The other guy... His face gets messed up

537
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,680
And in the end, he explodes like "boom"

538
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,750
that's amazing

539
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,320
No way

540
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,320
You can do that?

541
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,120
Well, it's not exactly that I can do it

542
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,260
But it looks like I did

543
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,660
And I don't know what happened to that person

544
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,090
Huh?

545
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,730
Did they die?

546
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,930
I don't get it at all

547
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,770
What happened?

548
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,770
It's gone already

549
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,770
What happened?

550
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,770
Well it's gone now but

551
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,870
did you know there were 7 little scars like this?

552
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,110
I've never seen them

553
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,110
I've never seen them either

554
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,110
Did they use to be there?

555
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,110
Yeah, seven right here

556
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,180
I don't recall ever having seen those

557
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,350
I had no idea

558
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,390
Well I guess from now on, with those stories...

559
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,560
You all are really weird

560
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,890
I guess if you come to a place like this that kind of thing happens

561
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,890
You're right

562
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,890
I don't like it

563
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Go ahead

564
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,660
No more

565
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,700
1, 2

566
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,470
Finally

567
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,640
Should we go to sleep?

568
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,640
Yes let's go to sleep

569
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,410
Alright alright alright

570
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,540
Um, everyone

571
00:18:49,640 --> 00:19:01,120
3-B's teacher Kinpachi Sakamoto solves

572
00:18:49,640 --> 00:19:01,120

「3-B Kinpachi Sensei」

575
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,110
Wait a second wait a second wait a second

576
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,110
Shall we sleep?

577
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,750
Wait a second wait a second

578
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,750
What is it? Let's just go to sleep

579
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,590
I have something to tell you

580
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,720
Can you please let us sleep?

581
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,720
Yeah, you're right

582
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,590
Please wait a second! So um...

583
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,200
There's something I've been keeping from you this whole time

584
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,100
And if I think that we're gonna be in this together from now on

585
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,070
I felt like I had to tell you today

586
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,010
So it's a story from back when

587
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,610
I was still in school, but...

588
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,610
Oh really

589
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,450
so when I was in school

590
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,350
I've once been hit by my teacher

591
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,990
Well I guess that's something that happens

592
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,990
Yeah in our age they would do that

593
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,990
So I guess it was...

594
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,430
no joke

595
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,700
Anyways I was with my friend

596
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,270
and he hit me in the police station

597
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,270
You were arrested?

598
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,240
Yeah I guess I was also a little bit...

599
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,410
What'd you do?

600
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,410
Well it's a long story but

601
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,150
basically...

602
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,850
my school's teacher, well, my homeroom teacher

603
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,020
My homeroom teacher...

604
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,050
would say "If you put oranges near oranges"

605
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,160
"If you put them near rotten oranges they'll rot"

606
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,730
I would think, "What is he even saying?"

607
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:21,570
And before I knew it I was getting hit

608
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,570
What the hell?

609
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,800
How are you supposed to know?

610
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,170
"Before I knew it I was getting hit"

611
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,470
No... at my old middle school

612
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,870
I was pretty bad

613
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,140
And you transferred?

614
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,140
Yes I did

615
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,080
Yes

616
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,180
And the teacher I met at the school I transferred to was really good

617
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,750
But he had long hair

618
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,790
Long hair...

619
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,790
Well even if you say "long hair", its...

620
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,620
pretty normal

621
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,620
normal length

622
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,930
yeah, and he was really well-liked

623
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,830
And oftentimes he'd be on an embankment

624
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,230
and yell his class's name

625
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,600
His class name...?

626
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,240
So then I'd actually run to him

627
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,010
And be like this.... But I didn't even like him that much

628
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,480
Anyways he'd yell his class's name

629
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,550
The class he was homeroom teacher for?

630
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,950
Yes the class's name

631
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,950
What happens after that?

632
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,590
So there was like a rule that everyone had to go to him then

633
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,960
Wow that's a drag

634
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,960
What a drag

635
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,390
So what year and class was it?

636
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,390
That was 3-B.

637
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,600
Was it on a particular day?

638
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I feel like it was on Fridays

639
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,400
So every time it was Friday...

640
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,600
What a drag!

641
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,840
he'd say his class's name

642
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:37,680
Well I liked him but in the end he really hit me hard

643
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,280
I didn't think I'd be hit that hard

644
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,550
Why were you hit if he was such a good teacher?

645
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,550
Yeah why?

646
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,250
Well that's because

647
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,020
I did something bad at school

648
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,990
I occupied the school? Well actually the details are a little...

649
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,460
Yeah you were still in school then

650
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,460
And the police got involved?

651
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,730
Yeah the police got involved

652
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,100
and it was a train crossing but

653
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
even though it was a train crossing

654
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,170
he went under it to get to me

655
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,170
in my mind

656
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,070
That long haired teacher?

657
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,270
So basically the police came and took you away right?

658
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,670
Yes they did, but

659
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,650
since it really was the first time it happened

660
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,650
it was kind of...

661
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,980
"If a teacher doesn't believe in his students"

662
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,950
"Then tell me!"

663
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,320
Wow you have a good memory

664
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,320
"Tell me what I should do!"

665
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,200
So it was like that and us students really liked him

666
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
He's a very passionate teacher

667
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,700
But then at a very different time

668
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,240
He'd be saying stuff like "I won't die"

669
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,900
The same person?

670
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,810
The same person, and he'd say stuff like "I won't die"

671
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,810
Why would he say such a thing?

672
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,010
I don't know... he was kind of weird

673
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,820
And sometimes he'd rage holding a hanger

674
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,220
What?

675
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,950
He was unprecedented

676
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,960
Yes he does seem that way

677
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Yeah really

678
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,630
But somewhere along the way he started cold perming his hair

679
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,800
And that became this

680
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,570
That became like this, and after that like this

681
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,170
I'm very sorry, thank you

682
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,510
Congratulations

683
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,550
Thank you very much

684
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,530
This isn't just me, I also have family

685
00:23:34,690 --> 00:24:07,790
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

686
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,260
And there's this too

687
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,470
And because this is this

688
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,470
And sometimes this

689
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,470
I'm very sorry, but thank you

690
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,440
Happy Birthday to You

691
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,450
Why "happy birthday"

692
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,020
Nobody thinks it's funny

693
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,420
Nobody at all!

694
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,390
No it was funny!

695
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,190
Not at all!

696
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,790
Everyone knew it so it was funny!
