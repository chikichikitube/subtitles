00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,920
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,910
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,860
It's Razor Ramon

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,700
Early summer foo~!

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,440
It's so noisy!
-Early summer

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,610
Yes, cheers to the season

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,940
So who do you think is the strongest duo in terms of strength in the entertainment industry?

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,740
Duo?

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,480
A two-person duo that have the best strength

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,050
Strong physique, Onigoe Tomahawk or something

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,180
Sei sei sei Not bad

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,060
These two have also done professional wrestling
-Yes

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,920
You should also be very strong

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,620
We've done professional wrestling. We're confident

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,330
Today we bring you this project to determine who is the strongest

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,810
Double sumo wrestling strongest duo decision tournament

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,820
Double Sumo
-Double Sumo

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,310
A 2-on-2 two-man sumo tournament

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,330
Simultaneous competition

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,170
4 people at the same time

21
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,060
You need to use your head too.
-Yes

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,860
The schedule for this competition is as follows

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,350
Onigoe and Matenrou

24
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,620
Matenrou

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,580
They look strong

26
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,650
Very large

27
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,500
And very heavy

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,200
Timon D also looks very strong

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,180
There are threes?

30
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,200
For the 3-people groups 2 people are selected to participate

31
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,630
Mama Tarte, the one on the right, is it muscle or just flab

32
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,620
Mama Tarte are very big

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,100
Aren't Mama Tarte dead?

34
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,820
So fast?

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,110
There's no such theory, right?

36
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,360
VTR playback!

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,300
You didn't say "foo!"?
-Sei

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,310
I see

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,080
Double sumo wrestling strongest duo decision tournament

40
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,160
This time, we invited 8 groups of artists with excellent physical and motor nerves

41
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,970
All look very strong

42
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,260
For a Special 2-on-2 tournament

43
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,020
To decide on the strongest group

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,810
The 1st match of the preliminary round was

45
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:54,530
Onigoe Tomahawk

46
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Not only do both of them weigh more than 100kg

47
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,240
Sakai also joined the judo division during his high school years

48
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:10,520
And Kin-chan weighed 100kg in elementary school

49
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,790
Often see this photo

50
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,230
A super heavyweight combination that is very suitable for sumo wrestling

51
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,690
Do you know how many years we have argued comedically

52
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,950
We also have physical attacks when we quarrel

53
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,650
We've been sparring for decades

54
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,250
So we are the most suited to sumo

55
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,460
Even if i'm fighting Honkon, i'll go for it

56
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,590
You shut up

57
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,930
The other side is

58
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:42,910
Matenrou

59
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,290
Anthony is okay

60
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,370
The problem is Ontony

61
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:52,150
183cm 128kg Anthony has a professional level physique

62
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,400
And agile Ontony, they make up Matenrou

63
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,890
To be honest I don't think I will lose

64
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,820
I started eating a lot of meals 1 week ago

65
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,430
Weight gain of 7 to 8kg

66
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,860
They're small fry, small fry

67
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,030
They don't matter

68
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,930
Although we're the same generation

69
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,070
Their bad in sumo and comedy contests

70
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,210
The time has finally come for me to become the No.1 in the world of comedians

71
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,240
Onigoe Tomahawk and Matenrou showdown

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,280
What was the result?

73
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,460
So, the contest starts now!

74
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,010
The teamwork that you don't see in ordinary sumo can be the key to victory or defeat

75
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,290
The first is the Onigoe Tomahawk against Matenrou

76
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,910
Although there is almost no difference in the total weight of the 2 groups

77
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,980
Will the winner be Onigoe, both of whom are over 100kg

78
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,260
Or Matenrou with their giant and smaller combo

79
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,350
What happened?

80
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,420
Start!

81
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,460
Both sides are rushing up

82
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,720
Instantly all 4 are huddled together

83
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,150
Now it is a 1 vs 1 situation

84
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,360
Ontony is down

85
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,040
Immediately after Anthony was also dejected

86
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,100
Matenrou have been taken down without damage

87
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,160
Onigoe Tomahawk are the winners!

88
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,080
From the start, Onigoe quickly rushed Anthony

89
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,620
But Ontony forced his way in

90
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,700
And the situation became 1-on-1

91
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,110
Afterwards, the sumo wrestling was performed separately

92
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,770
Onigoe finished with a 2:0 win

93
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,090
We were going to start by targeting Kin-chan

94
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,730
But it's hard to stay on track

95
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,630
Seeing your partner down

96
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,070
Thinking about it being 1 on 2

97
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,130
Its difficult not to lose at that point

98
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,670
After the preliminary round, I want to tell the others

99
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,440
It definitely wont go as smoothly as planned

100
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,570
No, it won't

101
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,580
Absolutely not

102
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,080
Next is the 2nd game of the preliminary round

103
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,000
First of all

104
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:21,700
Timon D

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,820
Good physique

106
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:29,410
Timon D, elite sportsmen from a prestigious high school baseball team

107
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,830
The strongest pitcher in the entertainment industry who was discovered by professional baseball, Takahishi

108
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,200
And Maeda, who won the first place in the nation in physical strength test in high school

109
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,810
The strongest combination of physical ability

110
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,920
No matter what the project is, Takahishi is always throwing things

111
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,660
Yes

112
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,590
Throwing coconuts, throwing barrels, throwing hammers

113
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,780
And today is...

114
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,700
Throwing people out

115
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,710
The other side is

116
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:12,220
Daishizen

117
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,500
Looks strong too

118
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,290
Pretty heavy, huh?

119
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,260
Cooking?

120
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,540
Weighing more than 100kg, but also can dance breakdance, Shin-chan

121
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,320
And Roger, who has practiced Ryukyu karate

122
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,880
The combination of flexible giant men

123
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,650
Impressive

124
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,520
Yesterday, for sumo, to become a little stronger

125
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,740
※Shishoku hot pot is mainly the hot pot eaten by Japanese sumo wrestlers.

126
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,340
I ate cheese and tomato fondue

127
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,740
Assorted hot pot

128
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,570
No matter who the opponent is

129
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,710
I will do my best

130
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,780
Roger
-Hmm?

131
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,910
You can do it with effort

132
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,320
Do not say Timon D's line

133
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,440
Preliminary Round Match #2 Timon D vs. Daishizen

134
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,350
Coming from a prestigious college baseball school, Jimi High School

135
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,450
Timon D, whose physical abilities have been recognized

136
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:11,010
And in terms of the weight advantage: Daishizen

137
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,140
What happened?

138
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,500
Start!

139
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,830
Here we go. Takahashi is the first to pull away

140
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,990
Maeda tightly grasps his opponent

141
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,640
And Shin-chan takes his opponent from behind

142
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,720
It's become 2 on 2

143
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,250
Timon D together

144
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,640
Timon D launches an attack

145
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,120
They're out!

146
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,150
Maeda fell out first

147
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,200
Then wrapped around the neck to drop the opponent

148
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,040
Out!

149
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,590
Timon D gets the win

150
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,570
This is a good one.
-Very interesting

151
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,470
So strong

152
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,310
This is the number one sports entertainer

153
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,120
Completely demonstrates his physical ability

154
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,560
Timon D's Takahishi did not grapple with his opponent

155
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,440
Instead, he shielded his partner Maeda from behind

156
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,630
So the back was attacked and temporarily in crisis

157
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,820
Lastly, he used the weight of his opponent to cause a fall

158
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,060
Finally, victory!

159
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,920
The third match of the preliminary round was a matchup between 3-person teams

160
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,140
So interesting

161
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,590
First of all

162
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,830
Nelsons

163
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,380
Have you decided who will participate?

164
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,410
Me and Wada

165
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,080
Because he has a tattoo

166
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,250
Tattoo on the waist
-Its not there anymore

167
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,480
It's okay not to say

168
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,720
Can't take off
-Can't take it off

169
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,320
No, I can

170
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,590
The Nelsons are two experienced wrestlers

171
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,600
In the Beijing Olympics I made it to the final selection

172
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,320
Very impressive

173
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,000
My experience is significant

174
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,000
Maybe it's a little strange to say that about yourself

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,410
But we should be the most promising to win the championship

176
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,290
The other side is

177
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,110
Babylon

178
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,780
Who's participating?

179
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,180
I definitely want to do it

180
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,290
I have the power to destroy the opponent

181
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,370
Pretty awesome!

182
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,390
What are you talking about?

183
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,290
No, no, no, it must be me.
-What?

184
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,870
After that, an audition was held within the group

185
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,880
The second contestant is 180cm 120kg giant man Chiba

186
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:33,990
He and Nori, whose hobby is to bodybuilding and fighting, are going to the preliminary round together

187
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,780
We are all powerful

188
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,950
Indeed, we are a threesome full of power

189
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,620
Our skits also use power to obtain laughter

190
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,190
To be honest with you, Babylon is just a warm-up

191
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,200
I'm using these muscles to compete

192
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,460
Just for today's practice

193
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,430
Preliminary Round Match 3 Nelsons vs Babylon

194
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,360
The Nelsons, both of whom have wrestling experience and intend to use it as a weapon

195
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,510
Nori, who has honed his tackling experience in fitness and rugby

196
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,420
Plus the giant man of Babylon: Chiba

197
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,020
What will happen?

198
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,380
Start!

199
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,880
It's on. First, it's a 1-on-1 situation

200
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,350
Coming around behind him and taking his legs out

201
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,760
Only Nori is left

202
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,980
He's tripped and put down

203
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,120
Nelsons get the win

204
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,740
Not bad for having wrestling experience

205
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,090
Nothing to do with muscle

206
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,380
Quite impressive!

207
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,230
Babylon's 2 members failed to resist at all

208
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,250
Nelsons Aoyama first uses the push-pull arm technique to turn behind him

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,230
And a one-legged takedown to take out Chiba in seconds

210
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,700
Wadaban also put Nori down with a foot hold

211
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,830
A complete victory over Babylon

212
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,770
Winning is not a problem at all

213
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,980
Nori's muscles are just for show

214
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,580
Not real muscle

215
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,980
Indeed

216
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,960
Ah

217
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,020
Don't be angry Nori

218
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,290
Want to do it again

219
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,120
No more

220
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,660
Next is the 4th game of the preliminary round

221
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,790
First of all

222
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:39,510
Razor Ramon

223
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,790
Good body

224
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,580
Older age

225
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,040
Yes, much older

226
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,310
Salt foo～

227
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,360
OK

228
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,940
Razor Ramon who met as pro wrestling students

229
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,470
After joining the comedy world

230
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,530
They've continued to work as comedians and professional wrestlers

231
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Tell us who you have fought with

232
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,200
Akebono, Abdullah the Butcher, Tiger Jeet Singh

233
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,170
Genichiro Tenryu, Scott Norton, Giant Silver

234
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,700
Fought with many giant wrestlers

235
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,340
Is there a 2m tall one today?

236
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,230
The other side is

237
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:26,420
Mama Tarte

238
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,110
178kg

239
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,990
Sorry, Marjorie

240
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,720
Ma, sorry

241
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,290
The exercise experience is 0 but the weight is the heaviest in the competition

242
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:44,970
The 178kg giant man Otsuru has a sumo level physique

243
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,570
Kashiwara looks small but weighs 83kg

244
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,100
Combined weight: 261kg

245
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,180
I've never fully utilized the strength of 178kg

246
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,260
Using this power may cause tragedy

247
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,780
So i'll use 80% of my force to fight

248
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,460
We have undergone a lot of hardships

249
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,390
Had his head bust open by Tiger Jeet Singh

250
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,830
What a "sei!"

251
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,990
Preliminary Round Match #4 Razor Ramon vs. Mama Tarte

252
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,560
Seeing this huge body caused a lot of noise in the room

253
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,360
Both joined professional wrestling clubs during their college years

254
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,190
Razor Ramon, a solid middle pairing

255
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,600
Against Mama Tarte, the heaviest overall weight in the tournament

256
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,870
The weight difference between the 2 combinations is almost 100kg

257
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,250
What'll happen?

258
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,350
Start!

259
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,570
It's begun!

260
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,070
The two sides rush each other

261
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,910
2 are pushed out

262
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,220
What is this?

263
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,030
2 people rushed in

264
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,400
And 2 were pushed out

265
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,980
Mama Tarte is too strong

266
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,620
Two out simultaneously

267
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,050
This is really "sei"

268
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,410
Mama Tarte gets the win

269
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,610
Razor Ramon together prove useless

270
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,810
2 pushed out together

271
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,740
A total shock

272
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,820
Despite being at a 1 vs. 2 disadvantage

273
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,900
He still knocked out both

274
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,870
178kg monster Otsuru

275
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,540
This is my power...

276
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,780
Don't seem to be aware of the strength

277
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,710
We went according to plan

278
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,580
2 people attack Otsuru first

279
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,890
But 178kg is really "sei"
-"sei"

280
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,360
How many times do you have to say it?

281
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,600
From here, the best pair of sumo wrestlers will enter the semi-finals

282
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,660
The 1st match was

283
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,870
Sorry for losing in the preliminary round

284
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,990
Using power to push down the giant man Anthony

285
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,690
The duo of over 100kg, Onigoe Tomahawk

286
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:10,670
Against Timon D, the first artist in the sport with outstanding physical ability

287
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,320
Who will be able to advance to the final?

288
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,210
The match is about to start

289
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,830
Start!

290
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,280
Onigoe start by targeting Takahishi first

291
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,140
Takahishi is out!

292
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,740
Now its Sakai and Maeda's one-on-one

293
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,010
Maeda's tries to throw his opponent out from the waste

294
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,260
Maeda forces a throw!

295
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,300
Strong core strength

296
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,990
Awesome awesome

297
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,340
Timon D gets the win

298
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,330
But

299
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,000
At this point the deputy referee approaches the playing field

300
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,200
Eh?

301
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,900
Foul?

302
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,160
What's going on here?

303
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,670
Investigating

304
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,470
A disagreement

305
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,410
Referee disagrees

306
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,720
So strict

307
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,310
Need to see a replay to decide

308
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,100
Take a look at the replay

309
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,620
Is it out of bounds?

310
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:31,260
The foot looks out of bounds

311
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,940
What will be the verdict?

312
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,000
Winner Onigoe Tomahawk

313
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,010
The referees have re-ruled

314
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,800
Onigoe Tomahawk reverses the win

315
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,240
Is it necessary to be so strict?

316
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,930
Maeda's foot stepped outside the field a little bit

317
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,000
Very strict

318
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,940
Very interesting!

319
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,290
Next is the 2nd game of the semi-finals

320
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:02,410
The victory went to the Nelsons who won the match with their magnificent wrestling skills

321
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:09,950
They will be facing Mama Tarte's monster Otsuru

322
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,700
Who will be the winner of the match?

323
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,250
This is a duel of skill and power

324
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,060
Who will win?

325
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,630
Start!

326
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,550
It's begun!

327
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,980
One is out first

328
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,570
Then it's a 2 on 1 leg lift out

329
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,500
Aoyama alone takes down 2 people in seconds

330
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,750
Nelsons get the win

331
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,750
Otsuru, who was defeated without being able to use his power, has this look on his face

332
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,830
Aoyama takes out one in seconds

333
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,810
Then rushed up from the side to hold and push out Otsuru

334
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,790
Very weak

335
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,050
Otsuru

336
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,290
Yes...

337
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,230
I don't know why I grew so fat

338
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,790
Not for this, I'm sure

339
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,300
Just as planned

340
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,570
I wanted to defeat them as soon as possible

341
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,500
Wada said he'd hold out.
-Yes...

342
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,510
You were holding out, right?

343
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,810
No, actually...

344
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,380
When Aoyama went to attack Otsuru

345
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,680
I though I better back away

346
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,110
Then I was straight out of bounds

347
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,450
Foot out of bounds

348
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:38,370
Now the final

349
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,170
Onigoe Tomahawk vs Nelsons

350
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,170
Who will be the winner?

351
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,220
The final match is Onigoe Tomahawk vs Nelsons

352
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,450
Is the name Aoyama?

353
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,090
Although you seem to have been a wrestler

354
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
You're a comedian, right?

355
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,520
Do some enjoyable wrestling!

356
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,330
Beating you is enough

357
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,700
The comedian who didn't succeed when he should have, right?

358
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,000
Think about yourself!

359
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,030
Stop it

360
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,490
Psychological warfare

361
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,240
The junior Onigoe Tomahawk against the senior Nelsons

362
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,840
A 4-person showdown!

363
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,120
What will happen?

364
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,470
Start!

365
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,920
It's on. It's 1 on 1

366
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,320
Aoyama and Sakai twist together head to head

367
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,510
Both want to drop each other

368
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,170
Aoyama pushes out his opponent!

369
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,180
Kin-chan is still left!

370
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,470
Aoyama is watching from the side, forming a 2 vs 1 situation

371
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,420
Wada throws hard

372
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,430
Wada throws hard

373
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,900
Nelsons get a nice win over Onigoe Tomahawk

374
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,620
Very frustrating

375
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,920
Sakai is too strong

376
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,530
Several times I wanted to press him down

377
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,300
But I finally got him out

378
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,130
Honestly, I didn't want to lose

379
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,840
Couldn't get a hold

380
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,170
What?

381
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,310
Unhappy?

382
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,880
Especially unhappy

383
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:48,650
But this game does not end here

384
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,190
What's going on?

385
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,550
Eh?

386
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,860
Please welcome these 2 people to the stage

387
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,730
Who?

388
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,700
Forget this!

389
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,310
It's Yunbo Dump

390
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,140
He's called cashew?

391
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:17,290
Yes, after the victory Nelsons will go against Yunbo Dump

392
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:24,470
The one who wins this match is the real king of double sumo

393
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,540
Yunbo Dump, a duo of 2 people over 130kg

394
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,600
Cashew participated in the sumo wrestling national competition during his high school years

395
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,960
He was also selected by the sumo wrestling world and is one of the strongest wrestlers in the entertainment industry

396
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,150
All out attack

397
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,780
This is a problem, we knew nothing about this

398
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,350
But the hopes of all those who have competed

399
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,790
Are my power to defeat you

400
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,750
Nelsons against Yunbo Dump

401
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,920
Who will be the real king?

402
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:18,070
Nelsons

403
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:27,910
Yunbo Dump

404
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,130
Nelsons who are good at wrestling

405
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:43,100
Versus the heaviest group in the entertainment industry, Yunbo Dump with 263kg

406
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,420
What will happen?

407
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,180
Start!

408
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,180
It's on!

409
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,780
Cashew... ah out

410
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,520
Then Fujiwara pushes his opponent out

411
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,470
He's out, and then Fujiwara pushes his opponent out

412
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,690
The referee awards Yunbo Dump the win

413
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,660
The comedians are all standing up

414
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,920
Eh, Yunbo Dump？

415
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,330
Body...

416
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,360
This is determined by the video

417
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,800
Eh, who won?

418
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,070
Watch the replay

419
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,120
Note the 2 people behind

420
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:26,140
Hands on the ground! Hands on the ground!

421
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,680
Did you put your hand down?

422
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,350
Look at the fingertips

423
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,850
There's dirt

424
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,880
Hands covered in dirt

425
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,770
Referee misjudgment: the winner is Nelsons

426
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,330
Great!

427
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,110
A lot of twists and turns

428
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:55,690
Nelsons, who won over Yunbo Dump, are now declared victorious

429
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,870
Nelsons

430
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:08,690
Wada bringing down Cashew

431
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,650
Was a big help

432
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,390
Is your forehead cut?

433
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,460
No its not

434
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,800
Not cut
-It's turning red

435
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,330
It's not that easy for me to get hurt

436
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:28,270
In summary
Nelsons were the first sumo wrestling kings

437
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,260
What do you all think?

438
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,650
Well...

439
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,040
Why are you both the presenters?

440
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,560
Gliding across the floor

441
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,430
That was really a monster

442
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,990
Both pushed out at the same time

443
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,910
So everyone should praise the Nelsons, who beat the monsters

444
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:52,890
We paved the way for the battle against the monster Otsuru

445
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,330
Then Aoyama took over

446
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,690
We started this story

447
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,410
This was pretty interesting

448
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,260
I also want to see who's the worst

449
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,470
I think Karateka should be the weakest

450
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,020
I see

451
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,880
But that's just one person so...

452
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,200
That's exactly what I mean

453
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,060
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

454
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,830
It's Chocolate Planet

455
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,570
It's chocolate.
-We are Chocolate Planet

456
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,840
It's Choco-chan!

457
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,130
The only person who can call us "Choco-chan" is Master Nishikawa Kiyoshi

458
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,680
Basically they're ChocoPla, right?

459
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:44,120
So without further ado, this time we bring you the second edition of a certain theory

460
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,390
The 2nd "Make your Partner Do a Double-take" Competition

461
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,920
This was interesting last time

462
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:56,070
Have you ever done a double-take?

463
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,000
Have you, Kanda?

464
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,800
Once I saw a homeless person, probably on their first day living on the street

465
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,200
A very young person

466
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,140
Who started putting things on the ground

467
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,160
Starting the day?
-Yes, then they went...

468
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,190
I did a double-take

469
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,620
"Okay, let's do it" means
-Well, that's probably what it means.

470
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,670
They put something on the floor and did this action

471
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,920
How can you be so sure its their first day?

472
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,800
The 2nd "Make your Partner Do a Double-take" Competition

473
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,800
Quite difficult, right?

474
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:34,440
This time, we let these four construct a scene that you can't help but look twice at

475
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,660
And set up their respective partners

476
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,480
So, the first challenger was

477
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,350
Nishkikoi's Watanabe

478
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,990
Each group prepares 2 kinds of scenes

479
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,260
Please describe the first scenario

480
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,960
It's "the staff has long fingers"

481
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,600
What?

482
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,460
Long fingers... that's it

483
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,300
Super long

484
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,240
So creepy!

485
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,800
That's good

486
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,810
Would you only look twice at it?

487
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,090
Taking the cup is good

488
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,220
This began with taking a mold

489
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,580
Realistic!

490
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,260
To make the fingers 1.5 times longer

491
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,960
Impressive

492
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,150
Can you touch your hair up a little?

493
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,690
At first glance, you might not notice

494
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
That's awesome. Good job

495
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,310
That's good

496
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:34,430
Acting instructions are given by Watanabe himself

497
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,040
Ah, really well done!

498
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,430
The thumb is also long

499
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,650
Hasegawa comes to a discussion meeting for a fake program

500
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:46,240
This time you are invited to participate in a special program of "Health Survey of Entertainers"

501
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,280
No suspicion at all

502
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,460
Quickly...

503
00:28:51,510 --> 00:29:00,030
It's just a physical test in a studio for entertainers who don't lead a regular life

504
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:04,190
Then you will get the health diagnosis results

505
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,890
After this result

506
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,480
So long
-So realistic!

507
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,130
Didn't notice

508
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,220
Hasn't seen it yet

509
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,040
Although it should be in his field of view

510
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,380
After 5 minutes of not noticing it at all

511
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,200
At this point

512
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,580
Can you stroke your hair a little?

513
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,800
Stroke your hair to show your fingers

514
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,860
Very conspicuous

515
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,630
I presume you haven't jumped continuously for a long time

516
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,520
No not at all

517
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,320
It's been a long time since I've done it

518
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,530
But in spite of this he also did not notice

519
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,040
Can you scratch your head with your index finger?

520
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,210
Before, I would just make some rice and buy some side dishes at the supermarket

521
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,210
Later

522
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,560
There you go!

523
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,690
When you're busy, it's tough

524
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,320
This is a success, right? Definitely a double-take

525
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,630
So, a double-take was successfully induced

526
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,300
Then

527
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,960
A typical example

528
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,350
You'd become very concerned

529
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,500
Yes, you'd care a lot

530
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,230
After all, we saw it once

531
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,690
Always watching

532
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,710
Final Total: 13 glances

533
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,640
Therefore, Watanabe's first time was a perfect success

534
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,930
Next is

535
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,860
Korokoro Chikichiki Peppers Nishino's challenge

536
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,330
The first one is

537
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:56,740
Posters for TKO Kinoshita's radio program are posted in the hallway

538
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:02,410
Nadal has been a bit down on Kinoshita until now

539
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,280
The reaction of "how is it possible?"

540
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,140
Therefore

541
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,020
"TKO Kinoshita's Tonight is also a KO"

542
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:15,220
Just right, how to say, it feels cheap

543
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,660
Because he'll pass the corner here

544
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,070
He'll be able to see it in plain view

545
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,530
The poster is set up in two places in the corridor of the radio station where it will be easily visible

546
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,520
What will happen?

547
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,670
Here we go, here we go

548
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,440
Look! Look!

549
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,480
Looking at the various posters

550
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,380
He's looking, do a double-take, quick!

551
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,950
Although he looked...

552
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,620
He stared at it but just once

553
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:53,000
After finding the poster, his eyes did not move at all

554
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,960
It even held his attention as he turned the corner

555
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,200
Instead of looking back, he stared

556
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,800
It's okay. There's another one. There's another one

557
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,560
Then

558
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,440
He's looking, he's looking

559
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,210
Kinoshita's still working?

560
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,480
Eh? The audacity

561
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,950
The "audacity" is a bit too...

562
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,160
I didn't expect Nadal to despise Kinoshita even more than I thought

563
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,590
Therefore, Nishino's first effort ended in failure

564
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,420
The next one is President of Japan's Tsuji

565
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,800
The arrangement is

566
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:40,880
As soon as he enters the building, he will surely go for a shit

567
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,750
So by the time he's ready to go to the bathroom, the bathroom will be in the process of being cleaned

568
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,550
Then the cleaners will come out

569
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,790
A lot of people will come out

570
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:59,030
Can he make his partner do a double-take by drawing on his daily habits?

571
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,820
What will happen?

572
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,840
Good Morning
-Good morning

573
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,640
Lots of luggage!

574
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,690
Can I go to the bathroom first?
-Yes, no problem

575
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,440
Out to the left

576
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,530
Just as predicted

577
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,930
Just like Tsuji's information, he went to the toilet immediately after arriving

578
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,580
Usually, he goes there after putting his stuff down

579
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,250
It's really the same as usual

580
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,320
Is it working?
-You want to use the toilet?

581
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,860
Yes
-We're almost done. Please wait a moment

582
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,860
Ok, got it

583
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,610
He's looking, he's looking!

584
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,180
Can't take his eyes off of it

585
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,310
He's looking

586
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,150
He's watching, right?

587
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,450
Looking at each person once

588
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,850
Then

589
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,610
Ah he looked!

590
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,800
This is a double-take, right?

591
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,600
Although the battle line is a little long

592
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,390
He just about did a double-take

593
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,250
So, the final challenger is Chocolate Planet's Nagata

594
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,650
When it comes to me, it must be a small prop

595
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:32,750
This time, i'm ready to use my best working chip bag sealer

596
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,080
Is this a masterpiece?
-Yes, my best work

597
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:38,190
The setup is that the chip bag sealer will be sold in large electrical stores

598
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:44,570
It'll be on display when he's on location

599
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:47,070
After a quick glance, he'll do a double-take

600
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,920
That's it, right?

601
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,480
The price is also to ensure a double-take

602
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:01,690
In this way, Nagata completed the setup himself

603
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,400
Also did the outer packaging

604
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,570
Very real

605
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,390
Dondake!

606
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,420
So loud!

607
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,160
He'll definitely say "don't!"
-Don't!

608
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,990
They're really a duo

609
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,470
I knew for sure he'd do it once

610
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,470
Why say this at the start?

611
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:18,760
Don't say that. It's hard work

612
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,620
Then

613
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,670
Coming

614
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:28,770
Finally, he comes to the area where chip bag sealer are sold

615
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,090
Eh, what is this?

616
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,190
Staring

617
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,700
Keeps staring at it

618
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,000
Panasonic...

619
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,640
I think he is now in a completely unknown state

620
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,710
This location shoot can no longer continue, right?

621
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,580
So, the result at the end of round 1 is shown in the figure

622
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,880
Round 2, because it doesn't matter even if it is found to be a trick

623
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,930
The setting will become more daring

624
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,150
First, Nishkikoi's Watanabe

625
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,070
What's the 2nd one?

626
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,070
"Radio Exercises Masanori Dance"

627
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,810
When Masanori passes by

628
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,440
People will be doing radio exercises

629
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,910
The radio exercise they'll do is the "Masanori dance" that Masanori always does

630
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,890
In this way, i'm sure he'll do a double-take

631
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,780
Walking on the road near my hometown

632
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,630
A grandmother passed by and it looked like something came out of her mouth

633
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:58,070
I thought "what?" and looked again, she spat out her dentures and put them back in

634
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,830
Couldn't help but look again

635
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,810
"Radio Exercises Masanori Dance"

636
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,880
Keep going down there
-Okay, got it

637
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,150
The first is to extend the hands from the top to the front

638
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,290
Here we go!

639
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,920
Here we go, here we go

640
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,920
Hand and foot movement

641
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,220
Cross your wrists

642
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,960
Super unnatural

643
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,660
Did you notice?

644
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,170
Noticed?

645
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,510
Mouth is always open

646
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,510
Lean your hands to your face and head, dumb movement

647
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:42,010
Suspicious

648
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,280
What a face

649
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,660
Turn your neck

650
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,880
What a face

651
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,820
Once again, hand and foot movements

652
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,590
This is what you will do every day

653
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:57,990
What's this expression, he's also looking back

654
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:00,270
Becoming restless, right?

655
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:06,530
Open, close

656
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,700
He's stopped

657
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,540
Always watching

658
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,240
Open, close

659
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,110
Always watching

660
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,970
One more time, turn your neck

661
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,110
This isn't a double-take

662
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,880
This is staring

663
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,520
Still greeting them

664
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,640
Afternoon

665
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,050
What greeting?

666
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,120
Masanori!

667
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,860
Noticed quite quickly

668
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:35,500
No, no, because I know this set of movements

669
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,230
Did you think there was anything else strange today?

670
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,630
It's that one, right?

671
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,340
A woman with long fingers

672
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,670
That one was pretty much a double-take

673
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,240
Really?
-Yes

674
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,820
Therefore, Nishkikoi is 1 win and 1 loss

675
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,510
Next

676
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:58,310
Let a fan approach Nadal

677
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,950
Then say, "can we take a picture together?

678
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,620
After the contact

679
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,960
After a dozen meters after the place appeared exactly the same female appears

680
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,800
They're twins

681
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,760
After the girl says, "thank you for your hard work"

682
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:18,300
The next one will appear

683
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,570
What'll happen?

684
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,570
This should be an easy one

685
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,650
Here we go

686
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,310
Sorry.
-What is it?

687
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,680
Are you Nadal?
-Yes, I'm Nadal

688
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,220
I am a huge fan
-Thank you

689
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,250
If you can, can we take a picture together?
-Yes

690
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,720
Thank you so much!

691
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,290
Very well played

692
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,060
I'll take it then

693
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,570
Cheese!

694
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:40,630
Very irritating

695
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:42,000
Ah, super happy, also did the action

696
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,900
Thank you. I will support you

697
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,170
OKOKOK now...

698
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,510
He did a double-take

699
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,850
A nice double-take

700
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,340
This is indeed a double-take

701
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:06,530
Confirming the first person after seeing the second

702
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,950
A beautiful double-take

703
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,230
What what what?

704
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,400
"Make your partner do a double-take"

705
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,440
Yeah, I think I probably did

706
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,080
Had a good look back

707
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,800
A very nice double-take
-Looked back several times

708
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,570
Did you think it was teleportation?

709
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,810
Who would possibly think that?
-What then?

710
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,340
I thought it was someone wearing the same clothes

711
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,150
But you thought something was weird, so you did a double-take, right?

712
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,350
Don't think I'll fall for anything

713
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,120
Who the hell would think of teleportation?

714
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,720
Next

715
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,130
Does this feel out of place?
-It does seem weird

716
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,960
I knew it!

717
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,760
Who wants to listen to that?

718
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:52,000
So, the next one is the second round of President of Japan's Tsuji

719
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,340
"In the lounge, the manager is eating charcoal grilled meat."

720
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,740
If it's just the manager, they might comment

721
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,210
But if they're eating with someone who looks like a producer

722
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,180
Maybe you'd do a double-take instead

723
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,230
The scenario looks like this

724
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:19,120
In order to keep the charcoal stove from being seen immediately

725
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,830
The players are told where to stand specifically

726
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,460
This is it

727
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,470
I see

728
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,230
What will happen?

729
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,030
Good morning

730
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,800
Please come in

731
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,060
Good morning

732
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:47,250
I'm director Kimura

733
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,450
This time it's TBS...

734
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,530
This is a double-take, right?

735
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,530
Probably holding in a laugh

736
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,210
Is it a double-take?

737
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,130
I'm director Kimura

738
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,130
Looked first

739
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,180
This time it's TBS...

740
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,640
Then looked again

741
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,640
It would make you laugh

742
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,810
He's laughing

743
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,970
Then, after the subject of the meeting leaves the room

744
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,970
What will be said?

745
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,360
Sorry, I'm a little late to say hello

746
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,860
I am from President of Japan

747
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,160
Ah, hello

748
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,910
This is the producer, Yoshida

749
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,000
Ah hello

750
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,670
Just kinda...

751
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,440
I think maybe the smoke is not really going out

752
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,000
So, we reveal the truth here

753
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,180
What are you doing?

754
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,850
I don't get it, huh?

755
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,330
What do you think?

756
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,880
I thought these two are completely crazy

757
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,690
So, the President of Japan succeeded twice in a row

758
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:01,330
And finally...

759
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,790
The person working at a Turkish kebab store

760
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,530
Is Dennis's Yukio

761
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,770
Instead of greeting customers, they look at their phones instead

762
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,340
A very idle Turkish kebab store clerk

763
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,700
Is it weird?
-It's not weird at all

764
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,490
It feels like it would be a good match

765
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:20,880
What'll happen in the end

766
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,590
Too integrated into the environment

767
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,590
Here we go, here we go, here we go

768
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,190
Nervous

769
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,220
Will feel "huh? right?

770
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,830
Here we go. Here we go

771
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,930
Ah, didn't notice

772
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,070
Ah, he's gone

773
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,110
That's too bad!

774
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,190
0 views

775
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,680
Hello

776
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,020
What is this? Seriously

777
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,080
Just notice!

778
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:56,780
What?

779
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,950
It's the "make your partner do a double-take" tournament

780
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,820
Ah, that

781
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,060
Did you ever feel like doing a double-take?

782
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,960
The potato chip bag sealer, right?

783
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,990
One more place.
-Really? No way!

784
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:13,970
If you use your special ability, you can see it right now

785
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,610
When it comes to my special abilities...

786
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:18,910
Is there a comedian around?

787
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,510
There is
-No way

788
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,010
It's over, I didn't realize

789
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,180
He is super good at spotting comedians on the street

790
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,080
Let's go back.
-Eh, no way!

791
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,880
Go back a bit

792
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,380
Eh, no way!

793
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,550
Didn't notice at all?

794
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,890
Didn't notice

795
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:39,290
And then there is...

796
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,830
When you get to the computer area

797
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,770
Why? He fits in too much

798
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,330
Go back

799
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,230
Eh? Eh?

800
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,270
Yukio's already done a double-take

801
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,570
Go back a bit

802
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,910
Eh?

803
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,010
Eh? What?

804
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,390
Wow, I'm sorry

805
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:19,000
In Summary
The only pair that didn't do a double-take is Chocolate Planet

806
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,260
That's funny

807
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,570
That's the result

808
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:27,700
Why does this program let the worst performing people host?

809
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,590
The same with Razor just now
-I'm not sure

810
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,110
It was already decided.
-We didn't expect it either

811
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,770
Yukio really fit into the scene

812
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,750
In fact, when waiting

813
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,060
2 customers actually came to try and buy something

814
00:45:42,590 --> 00:46:14,720
