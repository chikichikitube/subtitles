00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,160
Seen last week:

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,140
A series of shocking truths unveiled.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,760
Yamasaki Hosei Sneaky Thief Trial!

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,310
The first one...

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,940
Even though he lost the quiz,

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,720
Yamasaki ignored the rules and asked Umezu for an autograph!

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,980
Excuse me, your autograph?

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,740
Excuse me, your autograph?

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,670
A rule violating sneaky thief!

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,070
Like an autograph,

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,240
It's fine isn't it, to get one?

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,340
No it isn't!
- That's what we're telling you!

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,320
When Tanaka did that thing with Ikko, you didn't even approach her!

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,140
Well I couljn't joo anything then-

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,200
"Couljn't joo" he says.

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,260
And the second one...

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:01,160
When Yamasaki tried an image change, he stole the entire outfit!

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,470
Oh this is kinda scary!

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,250
No way...

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,070
This is straight up theft!

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,070
You can't do this!

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,980
There's a limit to how much you can steal!

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,750
This is horrible.

24
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,000
What did I do wrong here?

25
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,060
And the third one...

26
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,060
An incident where Yamasaki stole gags from two young comedians!

27
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,960
"Cause it doesn't matter, cause it doesn't matter!"

28
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,050
"That don't matter, oh that don't matter!"

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,480
"Cause it doesn't matter, cause it doesn't matter!"

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,840
"Cause that's no problem, cause that's no problem!"

31
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,560
A shameless gag theft!

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,700
But just let me say this,

33
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,600
I used that gag I remembered, the "doesn't matter" gag.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,300
And I remembered his rhythym, and all I did was combine them!

35
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,300
That's what we're saying is wrong!

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,350
We're telling you that's bad!

37
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,730
Why are you calling this theft, you're making me look bad!

38
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,660
You can't copy and combine them!

39
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,270
And tonight, another victim makes an appearance.

40
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,180
A shocking revelation awaits.

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,240
What will Yamasaki's fate be?

42
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,320

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,630
By the way,

45
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,380
all of the gags Yamasaki has done, his material ... it looks like this.

46
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,400
It's not really that special.

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,560
In November 1992, he came up with this:

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,020
This, "Yey yey yey."

49
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,020
This is the one I most...

50
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,240
I wish I could remember them.

51
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,030
There's also "Yosha-Ko", "MA" ... "Chopsticks"?

52
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,640
"Face Paku Paku", "Doi Takako", and "Chucky."

53
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,000
What was this "Face Paku Paku" one?

54
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,500
So it's like this:

55
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,360
Paku Paku, Face Paku Paku

56
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,360
What's with the hands...

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,380
When do you use this...

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,590
When do you pull that out?

59
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,630
When do you use that?

60
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,960
If someone doesn't tell you-

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,000
It's for times like this.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Meaning?

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If someone says "do that one."

64
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,000
If they tell you to do it?

65
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,260
TN: Doi Takako was a prominent Japanese politician

66
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,260
And this "Doi Takako"?

67
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:40,600
"Murayama Tomiichi has been appointed as Prime Minister."

68
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,600
It was that age.

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,250
Well, that's how it is.

70
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,640
So Yamasaki-san, would you say these are you original creations?

71
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,990
Indeed.

72
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,520
You thought up all of these?

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,460
Yes.

74
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,590
I see. Your Honour,

75
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,520
We have another victim in regards to his gags.

76
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,670
Can we call in this victim?

77
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,670
Understood.

78
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,240
Witness, enter.

79
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,700
Haranishi!

80
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,650
You all know him already, this is Haranishi from FUJIWARA.

81
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,850
Yes, that's right

82
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,780
Now, Yamasaki invented everything on this board.

83
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,260
According to him.

84
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,260
As he says.

85
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,580
You know, honestly, up until now he's been changing things other people did.

86
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,360
He straight up stole from me though.

87
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,400
He blatantly stole from me, he didn't change anything.

88
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,740
Really? Exactly the same?

89
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,740
Exactly the same.

90
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,740
This is shocking news isn't it?

91
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,810
Do you have any proof?

92
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,560
Yes, let's watch the VTR.

93
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,680
How he stole "Doi Takako."

94
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,920
September 1999 - 9 years ago

95
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,100
This was material he came up with for Matsumoto's 36th birthday.

96
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,100
So, Yamasaki-san?

97
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:07,220
Using an impression of Doi Takako, I will wi-wish you Happy Birthday.

98
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,910
"Matsumoto-san"

99
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:17,710
"Murayama Tomiichi has been appointed as Prime Min-"

100
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,710
What does that have to do with him?

101
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,710
You didn't say "Happy Birthday" at all!

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,460
On this occasion Yamasaki finally came up with a great new gag.

103
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,920
This became one of his signature acts, and there are many scenes of him doing it.

104
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,530
However, there is one thing that sticks out about this gag...

105
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,240
This happened 1 year before that performance...

106
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:51,240
This was an Osaka TV show that FUJIWARA were regulars on.

107
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,180
This is the scene that sticks out:

108
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,560
An imitation that a comedian shouldn't do.

109
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,240
An impression a comedian shouldn't do? Alright then, do it.

110
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,990
Former speaker of the house, Doi Takako.

111
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,210
Please begin.

112
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:14,840
"Murayama Tomiichi has been appointed as Prime Minister."

113
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,070
You straight up copied him!

114
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,960
"Murayama Tomiichi"

115
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,380
"Murayama Tomiichi"

116
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,840
"has been appointed as Prime Minister."

117
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,620
"has been appointed as Prime Minister."

118
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,980
The exact same performance.

119
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,890
Is Yamasaki a serial gag thief?

120
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,410
You ... you went this far?

121
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,070
It's just one after another!

122
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,420
I guess coincidences do happen.

123
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,360
What'd you say?

124
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Is he laughing?

125
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,980
So you didn't know Haranishi did that a month ago?

126
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,080
Well I've never watched that show before.

127
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,760
I don't mean the show.

128
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,280
In private,

129
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,620
I did it in front of other comedians,

130
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,580
and Yamasaki was there too, no doubt.

131
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,700
He said you were there.

132
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:14,380
First off, the choice of Murayama Tomiichi is outdated.

133
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,380
It was something happened a long time ago.

134
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
It doesn't match his generation.

135
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,100
That phrase is from Haranishi's generation.

136
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,850
You know, I....

137
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,120
I feel really sick all of a sudden.

138
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,120
That's unacceptable.

139
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,280
No way, we're only just starting.

140
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,630
Can I be excused?

141
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,630
No no no.

142
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,960
No way.

143
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,820
Incidentally Haranishi-kun, do you have more to add? Other than that one?

144
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,560
Nothing else?

145
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,560
Actually, can I say it?

146
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,700
There's more?

147
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,720
Can I see that board from before?

148
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,900
Those are supposed to be Yamasaki-san's original creations.

149
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,630
This, "Face Paku Paku"...

150
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,630
He got some laughs with that before.

151
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,480
The discussion before of "When do you use that?"
"What's the setup?"

152
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,080
It does have a setup, because it's my gag!

153
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,900
It's unfortunate.

154
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,900
Really?

155
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,120
What kind of face is that?

156
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,900
Stop your cheap acting!

157
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,670
The origin of how he knows this...

158
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,980
On that TV show, there was a weekly skit corner.

159
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,980
I see.

160
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:26,460
Miyagawa Daisuke and I were supposed to have a conversation.

161
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,470
I thought it would be boring if I did it normally, so I thought up a character.

162
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,680
And it was this, exactly this.

163
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,980
I thought talking like this would be funny.

164
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,160
"Hey dad, dad, listen."

165
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,140
So I was gonna talk with that face, I thought that up.

166
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,620
So I showed that to Yamasaki in the train, since I was scared.

167
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,470
I thought it might not work

168
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,880
You tried it out on Yamasaki.

169
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,580
And he found it really hilarious.

170
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,780
I thought it would work then.

171
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,940
But I never got to do that skit.

172
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,320
I see.

173
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,520
So I never showed that gag to anybody.

174
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,750
But after a while, that person...

175
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:18,480
He was getting big laughs using that "Face Paku Paku."

176
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
What is the meaning of this?

177
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,760
There's no footage bu-

178
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,760
Don't just listen to him.

179
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,240
Look carefully, they're totally different!

180
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
Then Yamasaki-san, how did you come up with that?

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,830
Yes, why that gag?

182
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, certainly, in Osaka we worked on the same TV show...

183
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,540
I might've seen a little bit.

184
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,760
So that was just seared into my memories.

185
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,110
So in regards to him,

186
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:52,290
Um, can you stop that? Looking at me with those dirty eyes.

187
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,620
You guys are all so dirty.

188
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,540
You should apologize-

189
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,560
Apologize! Why do I need to apologize?

190
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,750
Can I say something?

191
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:09,940
Back when we worked together in Osaka on a TV show, there were many times when I went to him for advice.

192
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
Oh really?

193
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,870
It was along the lines of
"We wanna leave for Tokyo soon,"

194
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,870
I see.

195
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,350
So I asked him, and he said "It's the time for you yet."

196
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,620
"I know best about these things. Don't leave yet.

197
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,560
"I'll tell you when you should come to Tokyo."

198
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,360
So he said he'll have your back?

199
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,360
But that's messed up isn't it?

200
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
It is.

201
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,190
The only reason he said that,

202
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,040
If I use that gag he wants to steal before he does...

203
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,700
...everyone will know he stole it.

204
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,700
Exactly.

205
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,180
So because of that, he told me to stay.

206
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,560
That's awful!

207
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,520
For that reason.

208
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,480
And in the end, he never told me to come to Tokyo!

209
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,450
"I know best about these things?"

210
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,560
You're the one who knows the least!

211
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,180
This one is terrible.

212
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,180
It's not terrible.

213
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,920
I need some advice.

214
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,870
Advice?

215
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,900
What do you mean?

216
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,720
For example, if a criminal admits his crime, the punishment is lessened right?

217
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,680
Slightly right? It's only slightly.

218
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,480
How much will it be lessened?

219
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,910
I'm not really sure about that.

220
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,920
Will we still be able to smile together and be friends after this?

221
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,620
If you're found guilty, you'll be banned from using the stuff you stole.

222
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,600
This is a trial after all. You can't use them anymore.

223
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,270
But that "Doesn't Matter" one...

224
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,180
...they were chanting it in the bar.

225
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,180
That made you really happy didn't it.

226
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,440
You keep bringing it up.

227
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,920
And that's never happened to me, in my 20+ years of comedy.

228
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,200
So that made me really happy.

229
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,600
So then shouldn't you make one up yourself?

230
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,900
Yeah, make your own original gag.

231
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,900
It's not my fault I can't think of anything.

232
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,110
You might come up with something right now.

233
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,760
Right now? Maybe, that could happen.

234
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,790
Naits..

235
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,730
I can't think of a thing.

236
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,730
What was that "Naits"?

237
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,100
I heard that "Naits" somewhere.

238
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,190
It's a bad habit of mine.

239
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,050
Finally, it's time for Yamasaki to be sentenced.

240
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,380
Alright, please announce his sentence.

241
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,540
There is no end to the defendant Yamasaki's sneaky thievery.

242
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:57,020
Since he has caused trouble so many people, we had to take that into account.

243
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,380
His sentence is...

244
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,350
...to be slapped by Chono!

245
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,350
WHAT?! HOLD ON!

246
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,630
You're kidding!

247
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,400
You have to be slapped by him, there's no escaping it.

248
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,670
Now come here.

249
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,610
What do you mean "Mouuuu?"

250
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,330
I don't like Chono-san.

251
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,910
I seriously don't wanna!

252
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,910
What the hell?

253
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,860
Also, after this, you can't do those gags anymore.

254
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,920
You're banned from those gags

255
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,710
Hold on...

256
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,050
C'mon, you gotta get past this.

257
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,400
I did, didn't I? I said sorry at the end.

258
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,000
No you didn't say that.

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,040
I did say that! I said it at the end didn't I?

260
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,040
You didn't.

261
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,100
I said "I have a bad habit. Everyone please help me fix it!"

262
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,560
However, the strength of the slap...

263
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:12,410
...if you really ask Chono-san to make it weaker, he just might do it.

264
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,680
Do I absolutely need to take this?

265
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,260
If I have to...let's do it.

266
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,990
I'll take it. I will take the slap, but,

267
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,770
Chono-san, I am genuinely...

268
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,590
...a nice guy.

269
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,400
I'm really a nice guy! So, just...

270
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,760
Chono-san, which is your dominant hand?

271
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,630
Just tell me that.

272
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,080
I'm really sorry!

273
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,080
Check this out!

274
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,960
I'm really sorry! But, this hand, could he use this hand?

275
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,240
I'm not sure about that.

276
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,080
This is supposed to be your sentence after all.

277
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,100
In fact, because it's this hand,

278
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,450
But in the past...

279
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,690
I got slapped on New Years right?

280
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,080
Because of that, three months later...

281
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,730
What happened 3 months later?

282
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,620
I was hospitalized.

283
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,250
That's a lie!

284
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,230
You weren't!

285
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,230
Why?

286
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,580
But I seriously can't do that. For real, and this is true:

287
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,800
...the doctor looked at me...

288
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,420
...and got on the phone immediately...

289
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,110
"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!" he said.

290
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,200
Enough of that lie now.

291
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,480
No really!

292
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,630
It's true!

293
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,630
Idiot! Let's move on.

294
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,620
Wait wait wait wait!

295
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,620
What the hell is it man?

296
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,150
No really, the doctor really did get mad.

297
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,780
Why'd he get angry?

298
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,820
He told me to say "Stop messing around!"

299
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,760
To who?

300
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,490
Chono-san

301
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,490
Chono-san?

302
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes, exactly.

303
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,500
Why do you have to tell him?

304
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,780
Well he didn't know Chono-san's phone number!

305
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,900
No seriously, because what if...

306
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,510
The hospital might shut down!

307
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,510
The hospital will shut down?

308
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,430
That doctor might get fired! Who will treat me next time?

309
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,860
What kind of worry is that?

310
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,860
Let's move on!

311
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,910
Then you get slapped first please!

312
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,130
You get slapped first!

313
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,110
If Hamada-san takes it I'll do it!

314
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,270
Just let Hamada-san do it!

315
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,430
I'll do it if he does!

316
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,760
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

317
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
ENDO!

318
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,340
I'M GONNA GET MAD FOR REAL!

319
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,360
I'M GONNA GET MAD FOR REAL!

320
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,340
Zaki-san, Zaki-san please!

321
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,600
I'M GONNA SNAP FOR REAL!

322
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,540
I'M GONNA SNAP FOR REAL!

323
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,880
What happened?

324
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,880
WHAT HAPPENED?

325
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,250
YOU! YOU STOLE FROM ME!

326
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,140
Enough idiot!

327
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,680
Enough already!

328
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,520
Wait wait wait wait! Hold on, wait!

329
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,720
What happened?

330
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,960
You've become a frantic miserable man.

331
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,880
That's true.

332
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,430
Put your mic on.

333
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,820
I went a bit frantic there...

334
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,400
You just stole that line from Ryu-chan!

335
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,700
Wow, just now!

336
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,620
He just stole that from Ryu-chan didn't he?

337
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,620
That is his phrase.

338
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,120
And he copied the whole thing!

339
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll take it.

340
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,100
I, too...

341
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,450
...am a man after all.

342
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,450
Of course.

343
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,720
So I will take this slap,

344
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,120
...but with your left hand please.

345
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,120
No, you can't do that.

346
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,170
That's not allowed, otherwi-

347
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,160
Then, then!

348
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,990
Then I won't do it!

349
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,600
What the hell!

350
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,180
Where should he stand?

351
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,140
Where should he stand?

352
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,680
He's so uncool.

353
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,480
Are you gonna do this bit again?!

354
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,660
He's doing this shit again!

355
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
Enough already!

356
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,340
I got it.

357
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,260
Come stand here already!

358
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,260
I got it! I got it.

359
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,680
Do it when I say please. When I'm ready.

360
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,520
I'm sorry.

361
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,590
You're making the guy who has to slap you wait.

362
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,110
Yeah if you keep wasting time...

363
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,240
Yes, exactly.

364
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,570
I'm sorry everyone, really, but...

365
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,460
...I'm scared.

366
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,600
Well that makes sense.

367
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,900
Even after all I've been through in life,

368
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,400
I'm scared.

369
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,140
That was funny just now!

370
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,140
Very funny!

371
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,840
It doesn't matter that I'm a fully grown man,

372
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm scared.

373
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,570
Hurry up!

374
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,280
I said I got it!

375
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,730
Did I really do something that bad?

376
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,780
You did!

377
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,000
It's because you did!

378
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,630
I have to get smacked by a Pro-Wrestler?

379
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,140
Did I do something that bad?

380
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,140
Yes, you did.

381
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,760
Sorry, it's just...

382
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,500
...can you not spread your stance like that?

383
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,250
How else would you stand?

384
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,250
Sorry, it's just...

385
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,140
Have you seen a wrestler slap like this before?

386
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,020
HEY ENDO!

387
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,720
I'M GONNA HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU!

388
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,720
Why? Why me?

389
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,480
I'll never forgive you!

390
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,480
What do you even mean?

391
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,180
You know, it's more dangerous if you try to dodge it.

392
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,400
So let's do this.

393
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,400
Wait!

394
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,770
The punishment slap!

395
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,910
That's dangerous!

396
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,620
Put your hands down, your hands.

397
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,830
The punishment please!

398
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,200
Dirty! So dirty!

399
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,540
His shoe!

400
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,310
How did it come off?

401
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,400
That was amazing as expected.

402
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,940
That went like "BACHIKYON!"

403
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,190
So the trial has been decided. Yamsaki-san, never again can you use those gags.

404
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,760
You must promise that.

405
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,180
Do you understand, Yamasaki-san?

406
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,080
Yes.

407
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,200
Hello!

408
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,320
Quiet down!

409
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,940
Shut up!

410
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,910
Go ahead.

411
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,340
How does it feel to see a star in the flesh?

412
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,860
You've been saying that a lot recently!

413
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,000
Recently? I don't know about that, I've always been a star.

414
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,740
You weren't famous.

415
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,100
Some of the guests here might have come again, after last week.

416
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,860
Oh poor things.

417
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,160
Last week we were supposed to have this talk segment right?

418
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,310
But then they told you to come again today.

419
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,450
Do you know the reason why?

420
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,960
For real, last week Hamada said "Let's not do the talk, man."

421
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,630
Because of that, we didn't do it.

422
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,340
It was you.

423
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,220
Hold on, my memories of being hit,

424
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,050
I've been hit 2 times.

425
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,510
I've been hit twice, OK now three times.

426
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,250
And alright alright, FOUR times.

427
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,080
You wanted to skip too didn't you?

428
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,080
What do you mean?

429
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,620
You were feeling sick and said you couldn't do it.

430
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,920
Ah yes, I was feeling a bit sick in the opening.

431
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,740
So we had to stop cause of that, and you had to come again, and we have this bad weather again.

432
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,740
Well, that's-

433
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,630
So I was standing outside with an umbrella. I wanted the staff to bring out a stove.

434
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,720
Did you really?

435
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,040
I did want to.

436
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,300
Well sometimes there's trouble on set when people come to watch.

437
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,940
But you know it was cold.

438
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,740
I was thinking two stoves per person.

439
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,740
Well, I'm sorry, really.

440
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,060
I really did think that.

441
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,170
Things like that happen sometime.

442
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,140
Excuse me sorry, I've been feeling ill lately.

443
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,200
Well yes, last time you were.

444
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,250
I noticed something after getting sick.

445
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,830
I think, if you timed me...

446
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,820
...you'll find I'm really fast at inserting suppositories.

447
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,520
I won't lose to anyone.

448
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,520
Inserting suppositories?

449
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,280
You know, in Japan, uhhhhhh...

450
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,430
I'm the 80th-

451
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,430
Spit it out already!

452
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,430
That pause is unnecessary.

453
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,710
You can stick them right in?

454
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,710
I'm probably the 80th fastest.

455
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,420
For example, have you ever used suppositories?

456
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,420
I have.

457
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,600
Oh really?

458
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,660
They're like these...

459
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,660
These white things.

460
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:52,140
So if you put a bunch of unwa-unwrapped ones on a table, a table like this...

461
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,840
...and I have my hands to the side...

462
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,910
Start the stopwatch and...

463
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,920
That's...

464
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,740
And my fingers will be completely clean.

465
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,080
Are you inserting all the way?

466
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,080
All the way, it's amazing.

467
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,230
If you hold them for too long they dissolve.

468
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,390
Yeah exactly, so I'll just be like this. "Ready, start" ...

469
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,450
Slides right in.

470
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,560
My fingers won't be sticky at all.

471
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,600
They'll be strai-

472
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,450
Enough already.

473
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,860
I can do it with anything.

474
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,520
Why are you eating sushi?

475
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,120
You know, it's not that impressive to be quick at that...

476
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,480
I do want to do that for an episode.

477
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,340
It's amazing you get it in right away, usually you need to look for it a bit.

478
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,250
"Here? Oh here!"

479
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,960
That is just plainly stupid.

480
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,420
It's impossible to be good at it!

481
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,420
You're dumb, you're dumb.

482
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,630
You have a messed up asshole!

483
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,230
Your asshole is all loose is why!

484
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,740
Are you saying you don't know where your anus is?

485
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,760
It's cause your asshole is always wide open!

486
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,960
Are you saying I need to put a cork in it?
