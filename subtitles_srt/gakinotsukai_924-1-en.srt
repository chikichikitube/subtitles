[Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!]

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,310
-This is...
-It's a postcard.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,800
Of that show.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,450
It's me as Hikaru Yuki.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,480
Hikaru Yuki is quite beautiful.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,000
This is it!

7
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,050
He was singing and dancing.

8
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,140
I am thinking of selling these.

9
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,770
Why?

10
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,150
And where would you sell these?

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,210
In Harajuku, of course.

12
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,820
Harajuku?

13
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,800
No way!

14
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,890
Harajuku is hot these days...

15
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,130
You should sell them at Nittere. (Broadcasting Station).

16
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,490
These won't sell in Harajuku!

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,640
-Excuse me...
-We're talking here.

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,480
You again?

19
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,220
Again?

20
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,910
Ehm... I have another letter from our guy, Matsumoto.

21
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,580
-Sorry, please read it.
-Why?

22
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,690
I've had enough.

23
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,010
-The same thing happens every time.
-That's right.

24
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,300
It's happening again.

25
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,420
It's the same pattern.

26
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,550
I hate reading these things.

27
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,990
Let's look at the map first.

28
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,820
Please read the letter first.

29
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,820
Okay, I'll read it.

30
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,330
Sure.

31
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,650
"You lot are asexual lowlife trash comedians that don't understand sexuality."

32
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:14,950
"It pains me to see you act like little high school boys whenever you are faced with the opposite sex."

33
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,510
Here it comes...

34
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,740
Every time...

35
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,100
"So let us see who the real sexual technician is."

36
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,970
"Who will be named 'Beast Don Juan', the 'Manic Sexual King'?"

37
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,510
"That is the purpose of this letter."

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,880
"Come to the specified location."

39
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,290
"Hitoshi Matsumoto".

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,170
Dixie Normous' Mansion!

41
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,100
And Kazuo Umezu's House!

42
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,110
The landmark...

43
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,150
Dixie Normous is labeled as the "Erection King".

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,080
He's the erection king of Japan!

45
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,020
It's a pretty big building.

46
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,040
So we have Umezu's house and Dixie Normous' Mansion...

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,910
But I don't know what this street is.

48
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,290
And he wrote 'Around here'.

49
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,000
-Around?
-So the building could not even exist.

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,030
That's right, it might be the wrong place.

51
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,380
He's not specific at all.

52
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,520
This guy sends us all these letters...

53
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,640
But in the end he's always next to last place.

54
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,460
-That's right.
-Heâ€™s always about to lose.

55
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,970
-Even last time... I couldn't watch him do that...
-Yes!

56
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,260
He's so rude!

57
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,840
-He is!
-Totally!

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,140
We always win so easily.

59
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,320
What should we do?

60
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,450
Is it close?

61
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,750
He's over there.

62
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,060
This map is useless!

63
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,990
Let's just go.

64
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,910
-Isn't it right there?

65
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,010
What the heck?!

66
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,230
The guys have been putting their male pride on the line in these past 5 challenges!

67
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,070
Matsumoto has called upon them once again for another serious match.

68
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,910
What is awaiting them in this next stage?

69
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,050
Over here.

70
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,880
Isn't this the G Studio?

71
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,820
It was just around the corner.

72
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,780
Yes, it's so close.

73
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,170
100,000,001.
100,000,002.

74
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,690
100,000,003.

75
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,110
100,000,004.

76
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,610
100,000,005.

77
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,110
100,000,006.

78
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,740
100,000,007.

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,440
100,000,008.

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,310
100,000,009.

81
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,040
100,000,010.

82
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,960
-100,000,011.
-Stop it already.

83
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,220
Are you a child?

84
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,800
So you came?

85
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,780
Of course we did.

86
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,020
You bastards...

87
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,670
You're always just !%!@$%# around.

88
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,690
Never mind that...

89
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,480
You always call us so late.

90
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,090
Alright!

91
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,000
You guys... are completely hopeless!!

92
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,680
No, you are hopeless.

93
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,470
But I know that you bastards haven't been sucking on any breasts lately...

94
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,800
What does that even mean?

95
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,800
Tell me, when was the last time you sucked on a nipple?

96
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,440
Hamada, go.

97
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,490
That's too raw!

98
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,370
-Yamazaki!
-Yes?

99
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,660
When was the last time you did it?

100
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,800
Sucking a nipple?!

101
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,580
You have to tell me the truth!

102
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,710
-What?!
-What?!

103
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,810
Really, don't lie.

104
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,040
Well, for me it's been about a week.

105
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,980
Really?!

106
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,510
After Gaki's recording.

107
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,190
Whoa, so Wednesday?

108
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,520
So after last week's Gaki recording?

109
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:09,830
Yes.

110
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,040
Endo, how about you?

111
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,580
I haven't done it at all.

112
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,580
I've been single for a while so...

113
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,740
Just tell us about the last time!

114
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,640
-The last time?
-Yes.

115
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,590
Well, it was the other day... In Gotanda...
About 3 days ago...

116
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,280
-You sure talk!
-I sucked and she also sucked back.

117
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,370
Actually I think I saw him there.

118
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,720
I mean, I don't care.

119
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,430
You're single after all.

120
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,540
Alright then.

121
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,150
Draw the curtains!

122
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,650
-You've gone and made something crazy again...
-So many mannequins.

123
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,860
Nipple Speed Sucking Match!

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,010
The challenge consists of sucking all the raisins off the mannequin's nipples.

125
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,760
Contestants have to go back and forth and their time will be measured.

126
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,830
The loser will have to face a harsh punishment.

127
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,300
-Can I ask a question?
-Sure.
-Can we touch them?

128
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,200
-I mean, other than our mouths...?
-Of course, they are women, so please touch them.

129
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,260
Please touch them.

130
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,040
So? Who's going first?

131
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,690
This one looks like a long one.

132
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,400
-Right, right.
-But we still don't know.

133
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,650
-Alright then, let's go with... Endo!
-Me again?

134
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,490
I wanna watch people go first.

135
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,450
Everyone just wants to see how fit you are.

136
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,290
Yeah, we wanna see.

137
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,240
Go, Endo!

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,800
Sure.

139
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,770
As usual, our first contestant is Endo.

140
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,960
What will be his time?

141
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,920
Alright then, Endo!

142
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,300
Yes!

143
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,780
Go!

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,930
Let's go!

145
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,790
He seems nervous.

146
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,580
Oh, I see...

147
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,540
He's stumbling already.

148
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,830
He's doing pretty well.

149
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,310
But you have to go deep or you'll never get the raisins.

150
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,590
Oh right, right.

151
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,190
-He's so gentle.
-He is.

152
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,630
But it's also kinda dirty...

153
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,460
Gentle...

154
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,490
But you really can't be dropping any of the raisins.

155
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,860
-So you have to hold them inside your mouth.
-Oh, right.

156
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,440
Or you could also eat them as you go.

157
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,170
He hasn't been sucking any nipples lately.

158
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,300
-It looks a bit awkward for him.
-Right.

159
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,290
He's also always the one getting stuff done to him.

160
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,110
-Right?
-Oh, right!
-Right.

161
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:25,780
Yes, yes...

162
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,950
He would be the one with the raisins on his nipples.

163
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,330
He's being really gentle.
-He is.

164
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,200
Pretty good, no?

165
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,890
The end!!

166
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,580
How did he do?

167
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:37,840
How did you feel?

168
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
-Can I be honest?
-Sure.

169
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,780
I was like, "What the hell is this?".

170
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,250
"What the hell am I doing?"

171
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,360
As I was doing it, I thought...

172
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,550
"This is so stupid".

173
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,620
-But you kept your rhythm and did it at your own pace.
-Yes.

174
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,710
I don't know if that's good or bad.

175
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,310
-Alright, let's look at Endo's score.
-Yes!

176
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,250
This is it!

177
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,540
43 seconds!

178
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,350
That's fast!

179
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,870
We still don't know if that's good.

180
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,290
-We don't know.
-I mean that's fast!

181
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,020
-It's not slow...
-But he took his sweet time...

182
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,690
Right... He was pretty carefree.

183
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,300
I think he was going pretty slow.

184
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,850
But he didn't miss any.

185
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,500
Right, he got them all.

186
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,330
-And we could feel his love for every single nipple.
-Right, we felt the love.

187
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,780
Right.

188
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,640
Also, there's an old lady mannequin at the end.

189
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,200
-Right...
-So please give that one the most love.

190
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,330
Alright!

191
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,550
Are there any volunteers?

192
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,410
How about it?

193
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,680
-What should I do...?
-I wanna go.

194
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,820
Shall we try you out?

195
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,660
-Really?-You can go next, Yamasaki.

196
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,250
Really?

197
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:36,620
Alright.

198
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay then, let's go.

199
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,650
Yamasaki.

200
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,170
Our next contestant is Yamasaki.

201
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,050
Will he beat Endo's time?

202
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,410
-Alright, are you ready?
-Yes!!

203
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,100
Yamasaki, let's go!

204
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,900
Can he beat 43 seconds?

205
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,500
He's pretty good at these things.

206
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,070
Oh, this might be bad.

207
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,930
-You have to go back and forth!
-Back and forth!

208
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,760
Isn't this pretty slow?

209
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,980
Back and forth!

210
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,600
-Look!
-He's pretty slow.

211
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,220
Was I faster than this?

212
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,800
I don't know...

213
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,400
He's not that slow.

214
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,290
I think it was about the same.

215
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,250
He's not fast enough.

216
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,370
Isn't he getting faster?

217
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,250
-But he's not touching them at all.
-Endo did it like this as well.

218
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,300
That's true.

219
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,790
He's not touching them at all.

220
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,800
I wonder how he'll do...

221
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,450
-Alright, be gentle.
-Gentle, gentle.

222
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,110
Gentle...

223
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,850
With love.

224
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,320
That's good.

225
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,890
The end!

226
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,550
-He was a bit faster.
-I wonder about that...

227
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,730
How did you feel, Yamasaki?

228
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,230
It didn't feel fast at all.

229
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,840
I think he'll be comparable to Endo.

230
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,470
You're right.

231
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:41,850
Yes.

232
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,090
How did you feel?

233
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,710
I was like, "What the hell am I doing?".

234
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,010
Right?

235
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,220
You start to question your actions...

236
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,660
Right, right.

237
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,930
The staff was asking me the same thing in the rehearsal.

238
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,630
What is his score?

239
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,330
Let's see!

240
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,450
So fast!!

241
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,930
-That's fast!
-So fast!

242
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,230
That's crazy! Crazy!

243
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,320
He's safe from the punishment.

244
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,460
That's amazing!

245
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,190
So fast!

246
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,460
That was fast.

247
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,820
Oh, I forgot to tell you, but today's punishment is pretty harsh.

248
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,360
-What?!
-No way!

249
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,010
-It's always harsh though...
-Right...

250
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,830
Okay, I'll go next.

251
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,790
Hamada, are you going?

252
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,890
Are you going?

253
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,390
-Do it gently.
-Be gentle.

254
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,380
Next up we have our local sadist, Hamada.

255
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,670
Will he show a gentler side?

256
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,780
Alright Hamada, let's go!

257
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,700
Alright Hamada, let's go!

258
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,020
The start is looking rough already.

259
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,820
From the start...

260
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,020
From the get-go.

261
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,130
Right, right.

262
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,180
Remember to alternate.

263
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,570
-Oh, he's eating them.
-He's eating them!

264
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,100
He is!

265
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,240
He's the type to eat on the go.

266
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,280
He's eating!

267
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,260
-He's picking up his own rhythm.
-You're right.

268
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,710
Doesn't he look like Shimura?
(Ken Shimura)

269
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,290
Right, his movements!

270
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,680
He looks like Shimura.

271
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,310
-Just like Shimura!
-You're right!

272
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,270
He's moving like Shimura.

273
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,870
-He's doing the Shimura-style.
-Right, Shimura-style.

274
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,860
He's surprisingly fast.

275
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,960
Be gentle here.

276
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,500
-He's pretty fast.
-Yeah.

277
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,390
The end!

278
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,680
-That was fast.
-So fast.
Surprisingly fast.

279
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,450
-It was fast.
-Yeah.

280
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,550
-He stumbled at the beginning.
-Yes, he struggled a bit.

281
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,730
Was that fast?

282
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,770
-I think he was surprisingly fast.
-This one was fast.

283
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,570
-But he looked like Shimura.
-Right, the Shimura-style.

284
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,170
Like this, like Shimura.

285
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,250
He found his rhythm.

286
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,680
While sucking on some nipples.

287
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,480
Okay, what was his time?

288
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,340
37 seconds!

289
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,660
Same time.

290
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,770
Alright!

291
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,280
I see...

292
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,780
-Hamada is also exempt from the punishment.
-Right!

293
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,310
Maybe Endo is the slowest...?

294
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,450
No way!

295
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,770
Our fourth contestant wants to show off his youth.
It's Inomoto from License!

296
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,730
-He's surprisingly slow.
-Maybe...

297
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,290
-He didn't miss any of them.
-Right.

298
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:07,810
Yeah...

299
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,540
He showed off his agility.

300
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,490
And got a high score of 34 seconds.

301
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,450
Next up is his partner, Fujiwara.

302
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,820
He's very gentle.

303
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,490
That's right.

304
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,260
-He's doing pretty good.
-You have to keep up the pace.

305
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,460
-Missing one is the worst.
-Right.

306
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,550
He keeps up the pace and reaches the goal!

307
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,110
He gets today's high score of 32 seconds!

308
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,990
How was it, Fujiwara?

309
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,710
I could smell someone's spit while I was doing it.

310
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,490
-No way!
-That's gross!

311
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,490
I hate that!

312
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,960
I would get whiffs of some foul stench along the way.

313
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,510
I really hate that!

314
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,950
-Please don't!
-That's bad!

315
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,380
Guys! Please clean them properly!

316
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,700
This thing is getting hot.

317
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,040
Endo is in trouble.

318
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,190
We still don't know.

319
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,150
Okay then, let's just go with Tanaka next.

320
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,020
-Let's go with Tanaka.
-Alright!

321
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,660
-Maybe he'll do good today.
-I'll redeem myself.

322
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,800
-Are you ready, Tanaka?
-Yes!

323
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,550
You have to beat 43 seconds.

324
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,640
I can probably make it.

325
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,050
As long as I remain calm.

326
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,930
Now that I look at it again, Endo's time is extremely bad.
-Right.

327
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,710
-It's pretty bad.
-Yeah, it's so slow.

328
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,520
43 is so bad.
So bad...

329
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,060
I guess the first one always has a disadvantage.

330
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,680
That's right.

331
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,150
I've lost 4 out of 5 so...

332
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,530
I've had enough already.

333
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,630
I will win.

334
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,850
Tanaka has been constantly losing throughout this series.

335
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,660
He has to clear his name for the sake of his wife.

336
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Alright, Tanaka!

337
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,420
Let's go!

338
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,130
-Oh no, oh no.
-Why is he so nervous?

339
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,970
Oh no, this is gonna be bad.

340
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,050
Alright.

341
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,400
Oh, he's pretty good.

342
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,250
He's quite fast.

343
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,360
So fast!

344
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,790
Oh, he's going for it.

345
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,190
But he's fine, it's fine.

346
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,570
That's pretty good.

347
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,640
Yes, he's fine.

348
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,820
He can do it.

349
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,670
He's being careful not to miss anything.

350
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,340
Right.

351
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,600
He's being very aware.

352
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,990
He's clinging onto them.

353
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,160
He's very greedy.

354
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,020
He doesn't wanna drop any.

355
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,820
Oh, the wig fell off!
Is that okay to do?

356
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,390
The wig fell off!

357
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,730
-I guess it can't be helped.
-He's really going for it.

358
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,220
He is!

359
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,470
He's panicking a bit.

360
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,140
Here comes the last one!

361
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,210
Almost there

362
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,620
He's got this!

363
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,300
Isn't this close?

364
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,800
Isn't it close?

365
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,040
He went back to the same nipple!

366
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,690
He went back and forth 2 times.

367
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,210
That was hard!

368
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,360
Pulling the wig off was a bit questionable from my perspective.

369
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,010
-In terms of prettiness I mean...
-Right, the beauty points.

370
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,300
-I wonder how you did...
-You were a bit too over-excited.
-But I think I did alright on time.

371
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,260
I wonder about that...

372
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,280
You never know, you never know.

373
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,920
Alright, let's see it.
Tanaka's time!

374
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,150
Here it is!

375
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,920
He made it!

376
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,900
Alright!!!

377
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,410
-For real?!
-Yes!!

378
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,910
Wife! I did it!!

379
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,240
I cleared my name!

380
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,470
-Matsumoto!!
-Sorry about that.

381
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,800
Endo was so slow!

382
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,910
43 is so slow.

383
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,640
It is.

384
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,920
-Everyone else was in the 30s.
-Right.

385
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,820
Yes!

386
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,310
So... Do I really need to go...?

387
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,070
-Of course!
-You have to!

388
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,810
But you know, I have some sore muscles...

389
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,350
I don't care!

390
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,060
And I'm also the organizer... So...

391
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,060
I don't feel the need...

392
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,780
-No, no, no, please do it.
-No way, no way.

393
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,360
-You have to establish your dominance then.
-Right!

394
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,150
Matsumoto, who has barely been able to avoid punishments, will try to aim for the top.

395
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,610
Alright, our last contestant is Matsumoto.

396
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,590
Let's go!!

397
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,720
I just go, right?

398
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,010
Ready?

399
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,980
Start!!

400
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,150
He's going ahead!

401
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,890
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

402
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,070
Stop!

403
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,120
Why?!

404
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,530
-You had a false start!
False start!!

405
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,250
False start!

406
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,020
-You are so desperate!
-So desperate!

407
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,510
You made me look so uncool!

408
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,530
What did I do?!

409
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,740
You went before the last ring!

410
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,290
-Alright, let's go!
-He really wants to win.

411
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,030
Ready...

412
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,490
-Start!!
-Not yet, not yet.

413
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,070
That's crazy.

414
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,490
He's pretty fast.

415
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:11,570
So fast!

416
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,990
Oh! He missed!
-He missed!!

417
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,220
Oh my god!

418
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,490
Alright! Alright!!

419
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,000
I did it! I made it!

420
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,190
This is bad.

421
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,090
It's so bad.

422
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,060
-This is bad!
-So bad!

423
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,650
This is bad!

424
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,620
-This is bad!
-So bad!

425
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,030
-This is bad!

426
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,700
-This is bad!
-So bad!

427
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,910
He already missed two.
Isn't he disqualified?!

428
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,740
He might get the same time as Endo.

429
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
He might.

430
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,570
They might go to a sudden death rematch.

431
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,350
It could happen.

432
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,400
-Look, he's so slow.
-So slow!

433
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,160
-So slow! So slow!
-He's a slug!

434
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,070
So slow!

435
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,900
It's bad.

436
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,160
-Be gentle.
-Gentle!

437
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,740
This is bad.

438
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,850
-This is bad.
-This is bad!

439
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,990
I was set up!!

440
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,970
What do you mean?!

441
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,140
My raisins were so hard to suck!!

442
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,880
There were some really small ones as well!!

443
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,100
Everyone had the same ones!!

444
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,500
I have never seen such small nipples!

445
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,850
Show we open it up this way?

446
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,150
Outside in?

447
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,540
Yes!

448
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,260
Right?
He's definitely not within the 30s mark.

449
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,370
Now way!!

450
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,350
Yeah, no way.

451
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,040
-You were so slow.
-No way you got under 40.

452
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,310
He's definitely in the 40s.

453
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,280
Here I go.

454
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,530
Okay!

455
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,810
Good for you, Endo!

456
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,060
-See?!
-We told you!

457
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,950
-Time to beat is 43 seconds?
-Yes!

458
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,360
Anything below 4...

459
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,790
And Matsumoto gets punished.
Let's go!!

460
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,550
Here it is!

461
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,500
Same score...

462
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,480
Really?!

463
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,750
Sudden death...

464
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,590
Alright!

465
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,640
Whoa, it's sudden death.

466
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,220
Sudden death!

467
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,070
-Isn't this our first sudden death scenario?
-Yes.

468
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,500
Awesome!

469
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,720
But we won't have to do it again, right??

470
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,930
Right?

471
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,170
Endo will go first on the sudden death re-match.

472
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,780
Will he be able to pressure Matsumoto?

473
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,080
Sudden death!

474
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,970
Shozo Endo!

475
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,670
Let's go!

476
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,620
Can he win?

477
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,530
Maybe.

478
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:06,830
He's done it once already.

479
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,650
He's gentle.

480
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,050
That's good.

481
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,110
You won't lose time as long as you don't miss anything.

482
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,670
-What? There's one missing.

483
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,500
One nipple was missing!

484
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,750
He is going for it.

485
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,300
He's going steady.

486
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,580
He's recovering.

487
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,230
I think he's being very gentle.

488
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,750
Like he's never seen a nipple.

489
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,820
He looks at them.

490
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,050
He's that kind of guy.

491
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,820
I don't know about this!!

492
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,610
Endo is pretty slow after all.

493
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,240
-But he really hasn't done anything different.
He was the same last round.
-Right?

494
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,880
But he was speeding up in the middle there.

495
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,540
He hasn't gotten any faster.

496
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,640
That was pretty slow.

497
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,850
No, this is bad.

498
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,130
He was pretty slow.

499
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,970
His time hasn't gone down.

500
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,510
Let's see it after Matsumoto does it.

501
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,720
I'm sure he got into the 40 second slot.

502
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,890
Right.

503
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,660
Matsumoto is feeling confident after seeing Endo's performance.

504
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,650
Who will win?

505
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,040
Sudden death!

506
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,490
Hitoshi Matsumoto!

507
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,660
Let's start!

508
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,060
He wanted to go.

509
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,540
He's not being gentle at all.

510
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,800
Look at his desperation!

511
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,190
Why is he dropping them?

512
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,280
The nipples disappear into his mouth.

513
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,050
It's because he's got a dirty mouth.

514
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,090
But he's picking up the pace.

515
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:28,840
-Oh, that's true!
-Yeah, a bit.

516
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,210
He's picking it back up.

517
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,040
That's fast.

518
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,240
Fail! Fail!!

519
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,650
-He's coming back!
-He's coming back!
-Oh, so fast!

520
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,130
So fast.

521
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,810
He's pretty fast!

522
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,920
Be gentle.

523
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,230
-He's coming back!
-He's coming back!
-Oh, so fast!

524
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:41,910
So fast.

525
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,930
-Huh?
-Huh?

526
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:48,770
Why?!

527
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,140
He was very gentle there!

528
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,990
You went twice!

529
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,790
You went twice!!

530
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,030
What?!
What?!

531
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,810
You went twice over there.

532
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,100
You did!

533
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,110
For real?!

534
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,370
Yes, look at this.

535
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:04,920
Really?!

536
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,680
Yes!

537
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,960
It's true!!

538
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,290
-Alright guys, I'm gonna reveal them at the same time.
-Alright!

539
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,750
This is Endo's time.

540
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,440
So please pay close attention.

541
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,700
This is Endo's time.

542
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,800
And this is Matsumoto's.

543
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,060
-Understood?
-Yes.

544
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,120
-Please!!
-This one is Endo's right?
-Who is the winner of the sudden death?!

545
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,680
-Enough already!!
-Who is the winner...?

546
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,600
Here it is!

547
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,850
Please!!

548
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,180
-This one is Endo's right?
-Who is the winner of the sudden death?!

549
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,290
-Enough already!!
-Who is the winner...?

550
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,260
Here it is!

551
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,940
Oh! 38 seconds!!

552
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,440
Endo won!!

553
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,120
No way!!

554
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,440
No way!

555
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,990
I did it!!

556
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,310
Let's go!!!

557
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,990
Yeah!!

558
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,330
-I'm telling you, it's wrong!!
-Alright!!

559
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,230
Okay, Matsumoto will receive the punishment!!

560
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:09,280
-Matsumoto's punishment is titled, "Screaming Out Loud Feat. Weather Camera!!".

561
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,970
What does that even mean?

562
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,050
It means that they'll film you from the top of a building.

563
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,800
Oh right!

564
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,190
Like an ant.

565
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,530
There won't be anyone nearby.

566
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,330
-I see...
-That's gonna be embarrassing...

567
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,440
Hello everyone.

568
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,170
I'm Hitoshi Matsumoto.

569
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,690
I actually have a bit of a cold.

570
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,960
So my doctor gave me some medicine...

571
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,350
My nose is also pretty blocked up.

572
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,320
But I guess that's all besides the matter...

573
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,420
Anyways... With all the medicine and all...

574
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:01,120
You know... I don't think I should be moving much but...

575
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,680
But I can't do anything about it...

576
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,950
So I'll just do this...

577
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,970
Talking about it won't change anything...

578
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,140
Here I go.

579
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,930
I'm here!

580
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,080
I'm here in Ginza!

581
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,880
I'm here!

582
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,870
That was the worst

583
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,470
I'm here in Shimbashi!

584
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,020
I'm here in Shimbashi!
