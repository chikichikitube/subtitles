00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,700
Gaki no Tsukai's famous series: Shichi Henge

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,000
In this series we see how a true comedian behaves

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,600
In a harsh situation in which they cannot fail

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,300
Last time we had Bananaman's Himura, who made everyone laugh

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:21,570
Bananaman Himura's Shichi Henge is already subbed and online @ shionnotsukai.wordpress.com!

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,800
He got fifth on the Shichi-henge ranking

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,000
And today is time for Himura's partner, Shitara!

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,150
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai!

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,400
Bananaman Shitara's Shichi-Henge!

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,680
Is it our first time?

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,130
We have Shitara today, Matsumoto

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,920
You know, I wanted Himura to be the first between them

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,840
I mean, that's how I think it's supposed to be with them

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,840
Is that so?

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,040
Also I happened to see him before, he looked like a member of the Blue Man Group

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,340
Not his best face

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,740
Here's our protagonist
- Yes

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,540
Let's bring him in

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,100
Thanks for having us

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,800
He's not showing his best face here

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,800
I'm feeling tense

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,200
You did great last time

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,680
Yeah, he is in 5th place

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,680
That's right

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,740
46'000 yen

26
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,080
I remember how happy I was when I got home that day

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,090
We got lots of positive feedback too

28
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,480
I thought you were just a human billboard promoting bobcuts

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,480
Guess you're not just that

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,690
He's gonna be great too

31
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,880
He's our brain, you know

32
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,560
We can say he himself is Bananaman

33
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,080
Yeah, I'm not as much as Bananaman as him

34
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,080
I have nothing to do with that

35
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,720
The hell are you sayin'?

36
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,600
Let's start by asking you which place are you aiming for

37
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,600
I'm guessing higher than him

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,600
I think I'm aiming for 10'000 yen

39
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,840
Gimme a break, man!

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,330
You can't aim that low

41
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,720
Yamasaki only made 10'000 yen?!

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,680
You never cease to surprise me

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
Impressive, right?

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,720
Don't talk shit about me, hey!

45
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,760
Such potential!

46
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,320
I didn't mean to target you

47
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,570
Anyway, anyway...

48
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,240
How are you feeling today?

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,740
How? Pretty shitty

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
Shitty, huh...
- Why?

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,270
It's true, you can tell

52
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,400
Look at his dead eyes

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,370
He has no sparkle in his eyes
- Yeah

54
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,480
Before entering this building, I walked around it for minutes

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:23,970

66
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,600
What should we do?

67
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,640
There's a lot of stuff on the whiteboard

68
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,420
"Matsumoto Zombie goes to New York!!"

69
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,420
Can I say something about the first one, "Matsumoto Zombie"?

70
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,420
We did that, yeah?

71
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,520
It was terrifying

72
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,520
What?

73
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,360
Being buried under the ground

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,360
Tell us about it

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,220
It was incredibly scary

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,090
I mean you're completely in the dark and you can only hear voices

77
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,370
Maybe zombies are more scared than we are

78
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,410
I think they're the scared ones

79
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,600
You endured it pretty good

80
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,600
I was freaking out, really

81
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,170
It was around 25 minutes

82
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,930
Really?
- Yeah, around that

83
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,810
ADs too told me to get out

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,760
Really?

85
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,240
Around 10-15 minutes

86
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,650
Incredible

87
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,600
Why bother enduring it, then?

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,940
You have a point

89
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,280
Long story short, I'm done with zombies

90
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,800
What if we do it in New York?
- No way

91
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,830
He'd still be buried underground, you know

92
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm never doing it again, for real

93
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,370
You know

94
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,520
When you arrived you were like "we're here"

95
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,480
I heard it through my in-ears and I wanted to get out in that moment

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
That only makes the whole situation more hilarious

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,580
I'm scarred for life now

98
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,400
I wanted to see your live reactions

99
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,480
What should we do...

100
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,700
We can use Endo's obsession with Frisk...

101
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,360
Yeah, that---

102
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,900
I bought a large bowl today

103
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,360
Man, I love seaweed with vinegar

104
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,480
Is there anything to do?

105
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,500
Put 'em in

106
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,600
Not so many laughs, huh?

107
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,400
Wasn't that funny? It was to me

108
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,880
Yes, it was

109
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,400
Hurry up and pay

110
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,000
Did you feel that smell?
- It was something

111
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Alright then

112
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,200
Real talk now, what are we doing next?

113
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,360
Which one?

114
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,600
Yama-chan performs "Annie - the musical"

115
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,300
This one?

116
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,530
Have you done it before?
- No, I haven't

117
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,640
I used to have an hairstyle like Annie's before, though

118
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,520
I remember that

119
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,160
The fluffy one, right? It was more than 10 years ago

120
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,160
I remember that pic with your surprised face, hilarious

121
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,940
And you always wore that suit

122
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,480
I'm glad you managed to get over that phase

123
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,760
You opened your eyes and realized your mistakes

124
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,300
Was it that bad?

125
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,160
The fact I only wore that?

126
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm sorry, hold on

127
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,700
Hello?

128
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,200
Hi, it's mom

129
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,380
Doing well?

130
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,380
Yes I'm fine, listen...

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,770
I'm working right now, so...

132
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,560
Oh? Yes? Are you working? What are you doing?

133
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,700
I'm working with Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai, so I'm quite busy now...

134
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,840
Are they here? Can you let me talk to them?

135
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,280
No way I can't, I shouldn't even be on the phone...

136
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Come on, let me talk to them

137
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,280
I'll call you later, ok?

138
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,200
No wait, wait, don't hang up

139
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,200
I can't, really

140
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,960
Who's there?

141
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,900
There's Downtown, Cocorico, Yamazaki and others...

142
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,800
Eh? Who's that?

143
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,320
Who's that?

144
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,320
Tanaka from Cocorico...

145
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,080
And...?

146
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,080
And Yamazaki

147
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,920
Hm? Who's that?

148
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,920
You know, Hosei

149
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,480
Who's that?

150
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,100
Hosei Yamazaki

151
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,080
Come on mom, I'll call you again later...

152
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,880
You know, you said there's Downtown here...

153
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,480
I don't really like Matsumoto, be careful, ok?

154
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,040
Don't say that, mom... really, not now

155
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,560
Please it's my only wish, let me talk to them

156
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,040
Are you kidding me?

157
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,400
Just few seconds, would you?

158
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,200
Alright, but don't be rude, ok?

159
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,220
It's my mom, she just wants to say hello, can you talk to her?

160
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,460
Please, sorry about this... please

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,700
Hello?

162
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,880
Oh, hello, I'm Shitara's mom

163
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,100
Oh, nice to meet you, I'm Matsumoto from Downtown...

164
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,100
Thanks for taking care of my son

165
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,780
We're in the middle of a meeting, so maybe later...

166
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,520
I'm glad I got to talk with you

167
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:55,120
Same here, I'm glad

168
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,520
Thank you so much for everything

169
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,940
Satisfied now?

170
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,520
Don't you think he changed?

171
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,360
He's becoming more gentle, you know

172
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
How can you tell?

173
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,720
I think that having a child made him become more gentle

174
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
You think so?

175
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,340
Do you think he was nice?

176
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,600
Can I talk to Hamada too?

177
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,600
Mom, please... Give me a break

178
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,720
Come on, just a little...

179
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,720
For real?

180
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,300
Hamada, sorry... it's my mom, she wants to say hi

181
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,700
Hello?

182
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,960
Ah, hello, Hamada?

183
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,360
Thanks for always taking care of my Shitara

184
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Thanks to you, ma'am

185
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,640
You have such a wonderful voice

186
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,280
I think you're really my type, Hamada

187
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,520
You're flattering me

188
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,160
Best regards for what's coming next

189
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,160
Thanks, same here

190
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
Hello?

191
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,640
Hello

192
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,600
Hey, I think I got a little w▀t down here...

193
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:04,140
The hell are you saying, mom? That's embarrassing

194
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,680
This is ridiculous

195
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,320
Wait-- w-- excuse me...

196
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,360
I want to talk some more

197
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,360
You just did it, mom, isn't this enough? Come on

198
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,760
Let me talk to them some more

199
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,760
We're done here, mom

200
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,760
What the hell

201
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,480
She had no idea who you are

202
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,120
Yeah, I wonder why...

203
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:33,000
Even though he's appearing so frequently on "Drive A Go! Go!"

204
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,220
Yeah, he's spending a lot of time in that show

205
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,900
He's always there
- Is he?

206
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,840
You won't believe how many times I saw him there

207
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,810
I remember

208
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,680
When I saw him on the preview for next episode, I laughed so much

209
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,680
I laughed aloud in front of my tv

210
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,980
That much?
- Yes, I swear

211
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,980
Like "It's him again!"

212
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,980
"There he is!"

213
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,950
[idle chat] Yes, it doesn't match up with his character

214
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,000
[idle chat] Always doing crazy stuff...

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,920
He really enjoys making a mess

216
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,440
That was hard to bear, man

217
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,900
I have no idea how to explain that

218
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,900
That's the main issue

219
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,920
It's hard

220
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,080
We have to hurry up and choose something

221
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,920
Excuse me, are you Mr. Shitara?

222
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:05,780
Yes

223
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm a huge fan of yours

224
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,620
Oh, thank you

225
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,640
I have a request if you don't mind...

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,500
Can you show me your d▀ck?

227
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,600
Eh?

228
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,400
I'd like to take a look at your d▀ck...

229
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,940
My d▀ck?

230
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,940
Yes, I want you to show me your d▀ck

231
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,540
I'm so happy!

232
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,680
Ohh, amazing! Thank you very much!

233
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,000
Pardon me?

234
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,620
I'm a fan too

235
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,130
Oh, thank you

236
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,300
Can you please draw me your d▀ck?

237
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,300
You don't want my sign?

238
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,800
No, your d▀ck

239
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,620
Do I have to draw my d▀ck?

240
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,620
Yes please

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I mean, no big deal...

242
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,440
Amazing!

243
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,260
Thank you so much!

244
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,860
I'm really a big fan, can you please take a photo with me?

245
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,860
A photo?

246
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,860
If you please

247
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,700
A picture with your d▀ck

248
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,750
Yes please

249
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,750
With my d▀ck?

250
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,240
How should we--- can I do this?

251
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,700
Here I go!

252
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,000
Ohhhhh, amazing! Thank you so much!

253
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,920
Don't put that on your blog, please

254
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,400
That was so random

255
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,180
You gotta be kidding me

256
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,180
Made it  - He's the worst

257
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,300
That was really something
- Incredible

258
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,960
He did really good, those girls were amazing too

259
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,200
He got me so quickly, even before the pants
- It's the angle

260
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,780
Yeah, you had him right in front of you

261
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,960
Himura, would you please stop laughing so nonchalantly?

262
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,210
You're making us laugh too
- You can tell he's genuinely having a blast

263
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:33,260
But it's like my first time ever in 17 years watching him going all-out like this alone, I'm having so much fun

264
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,960
Is it?

265
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,560
You're really enjoying this

266
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,570
I won't deny it

267
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,000
Pay up

268
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,320
That frickin' mouse!

269
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,320
That guy is a huge sadist, isn't he?

270
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,400
I don't get him, doing that thing all over again, it got on my nerves

271
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,740
He just couldn't stop

272
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,800
Hamada is the same type

273
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Sadists are so insistent

274
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,400
He's so insistent
- He is

275
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,140
We still have no idea what to do

276
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,180
How do you like this one, sir?

277
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,320
Sure

278
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,200
Sorry to have kept you waiting

279
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,240
Here's your Martini

280
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,440
He's the worst

281
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,200
He's really the worst

282
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,640
That was disgusting

283
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,420
Heipo made us all laugh

284
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
'Cause the girl almost hit the trumpet

285
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,900
Yeah, I laughed at that too...

286
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,960
I hated it

287
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,100
Is this the last one?
- Yep

288
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,900
What's this? "Producer Oonuma's office is a ghost mansion!?"

289
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,620
What's that place like?

290
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Akira Onuma
Producer

291
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,620
You know the company's office

292
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:07,700
It's 40 years old and its walls are so thin

293
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,180
It's... it's not a ghost mansion, I wonder what that means...

294
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,820
Nothing special about it?
- Not really

295
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,880
But it's really something
- That guy is such a mood killer

296
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,060
I mean, the place is great and all, but his office alone has this weird aura around it

297
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,720
Heipo

298
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,240
Why is he so excited about it?

299
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
He wants to work on that

300
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,540
"Producer Nakamura's secret midnight girls meeting"?

301
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,960
That's not true, am I right?

302
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,540
Are you kidding me? That's all he ever does

303
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,380
Don't say it

304
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,320
How do you know that?

305
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,380
Oh, sorry

306
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,500
Senpai, please give me some clothes

307
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,700
Why are you always asking that?

308
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,540
That's not true

309
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,900
No way my clothes will fit you

310
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,090
Killer Khan

311
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,700
But I've lost so much weight

312
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,640
Really?
- Yes

313
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,900
I have some clothes here... but will they fit you?

314
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,000
I really like this one

315
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500
Isn't that too small for you?

316
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,940
I've lost some weight, it should be ok

317
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,620
Maybe it fits

318
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,380
See? It fits

319
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,080
It looks tight to me

320
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,420
Small clothes are this year's fashion

321
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,420
Is that true?

322
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,000
Seriously? If you're ok with that I'll give it to you, but...

323
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,640
That's trendy

324
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,640
Is it?

325
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,800
- Really?

326
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,800
Thank you

327
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,000
You can have it, then

328
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,780
Alright!

329
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,380
I also have this one if you want it

330
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm worried about its size too

331
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,260
This... yeah it's fine, thanks!

332
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,260
But you're so big

333
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,700
Can you wear it?

334
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,100
I can, don't worry

335
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,480
You sure you're ok?

336
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,300
That's its back

337
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,300
That's how I do it

338
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,000
See?

339
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,340
Is it going to fit?

340
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,440
It's creaking... is it really ok to you? Looks small...

341
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,700
You sure you're ok?

342
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,340
I'm fine

343
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,340
Is it ok?

344
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,340
It's so hip

345
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,160
If you like em they're yours, man

346
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,340
Thank you so much

347
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,100
Yeah, don't worry about it

348
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,080
Wanna go grab a bite?

349
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,920
Is there anything you wanna eat?

350
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,160
Jingisukan

351
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,980
Jingisus--kan?

352
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,320
Jinjs--- Jingisukan

353
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,100
Jingisukan? Let's go

354
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,400
Can't wait to eat it!

355
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,300
Incredible

356
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,460
That's a nice sum there

357
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,580
One, two, three...

358
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,660
Alright, let's see...

359
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,180
37'000 yen!
- He scored 13th place

360
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,800
You scored as much as hip-shaking Obasan

361
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Thank you very much!

362
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,460
You did pretty great, you know?
- You think so?

363
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,040
I thought "man, he's such a bad guy" more than once, you know

364
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,340
Me? A bad guy?
