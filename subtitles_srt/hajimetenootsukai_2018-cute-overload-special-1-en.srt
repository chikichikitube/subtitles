00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:11,030
My First Errand. Cute overload special.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,680
Hakusanrenpou

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,270
My First Errand has been on the air for 27 years.

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,100
27 years?

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,170
We've been all around from the north of Hokkaido down to Okinawa.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,350
It's easy to think we've run out of places, but there are still places to explore.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,060
There are?

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,780
Here at Ishikawa prefecture the water is delicious.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,150
The water flows from the snowy mountain tops of Hakusan.

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,940
and it is called "the water of life".

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,700
It's our first time coming here and
it will be the first errand for someone...

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,050
This little girl.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,530
She's wearing sunglasses.

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,640
Amazing.

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,640
She's too small.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,010
Ao is almost 3 years old.

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,000
So cute.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,960
2 years and 11 months?

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,910
She's so fashionable.

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,910
Ao and her red sunglasses.

22
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,030
The mother is a nursery school teacher.

23
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,290
This is also where Ao is enrolled.

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,230
The mother is in her 9th month of pregnancy, so Ao will become a big sister.

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,230
- I see.
- An important time.

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,820
She keeps asking when he will be born.

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:21,910
And as an experience before becoming
a big sister she will go on an errand.

28
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,490
But she's still 2 years old. Will she be fine?

29
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,150
I got it.

30
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,440
Did you get the stem? We will use it
to make scrambled soup. With tofu.

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,270
Ah, I forgot to buy tofu.

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,600
I forgot to buy scrambled tofu.

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,600
It's an errand.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,140
Scrambled tofu?

35
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,720
At this tofu shop they boil soy milk and make tofu from it.

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Scrambled tofu is served before being made firm from weights.

37
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,670
Absolutely tasty.

38
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,250
It's fluffly and delicious.

39
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,830
Can you go buy it?

40
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,430
I can.

41
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,670
By yourself?

42
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,180
I can go by myself.

43
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,820
Seriously?

44
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,720
She can do it?

45
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,500
Scrambled tofu.

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,570
Scrambled.

47
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,570
Scrambled.

48
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,800
Scrambled tofu.

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,960
Go and buy one.

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,290
Yep.

51
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:19,550
The tofu is 250 yen. The mother put 500 yen in her wallet.

52
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,440
One more thing.

53
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,440
One more thing.

54
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,230
Also go and visit the shrine.

55
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,640
From the 500 yen she will get her
change and can use it at the shrine.

56
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,920
I see.

57
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,630
Heading off.

58
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,320
Can you do it?

59
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,320
Yes, I can.

60
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,460
Buy tofu and visit the shrine.

61
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,400
She's so reliable.

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,740
It's the same route as usual.

63
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:49,970
Buying scrambled tofu, getting change from the 500 yen and then visiting the shrine where she was told to give one coin.

64
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,080
Off you go.

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,390
Off I go.

66
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,420
Amazing.

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,100
So amazing.

68
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,710
- She's motivated.
- She's so focused.

69
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,500
She's merely 2 years and 11 months
old and moves with small steps.

70
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,330
Do your best.

71
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,180
Is she not getting lonely?

72
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,810
That's right.

73
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,980
The one who is getting lonely is the
mother who keeps watching her.

74
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,570
Wait, what's wrong?

75
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,760
The shop is straight ahead.

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,470
What's wrong?

77
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,840
She crossed.

78
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,840
She did.

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,180
Wait, she wants in there?

80
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,960
A shortcut?

81
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,720
The cameramen are chasing her.

82
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,850
They are hurrying after her.

83
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,940
Not as planned

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,940
Where is she going?

85
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,440
Actually, this neighborhood is full of houses and there are plenty of secret pathways.

86
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,490
Since she walks around every morning with her grandmother her mother is confident she can find the way.

87
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,490
So she knows what she's doing.

88
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,000
Is she worried?

89
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,530
The shopping part.

90
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,530
What about it worries you?

91
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,240
Since she doesn't have much experience with it, I'm not sure if she can pay properly.

92
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,120
I see.

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,870
But she's still heading straight for the shop.

94
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,780
She looks so serious.

95
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,290
She found something.

96
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,350
The house with a chimney blows its smoke.

97
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,310
A house with a chimney?

98
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,710
What's that?

99
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,620
Ah, the ladder. It's used to clear the snow in winter.

100
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,240
I see.

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,230
This is an area of the most prominent heavy snow fall.

102
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,060
I see.

103
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:35,840
Around town there are many ways to get rid of the snow.

104
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,840
Amazing.

105
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,390
How smart.

106
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,230
The big crossing. She will arrive
at the shop if she goes left here.

107
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:51,940
She trots along when crossing. But she went that way. That's not where the shop is.

108
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,750
She should know the way.

109
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,690
They are being played by a 2 year and 11 month old.

110
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,690
Run for it.

111
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,160
Where Ao is heading is...

112
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,140
Where?

113
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,970
The shrine.

114
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,130
She wants to visit the shrine first.

115
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,460
Why is she taking her backpack off?

116
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,040
She's taking out a blue towel.

117
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,400
She's grabbing the shaku.

118
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,060
Remarkable.

119
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,080
This is "the water of life" from the mountain top of Hakusan.

120
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,460
She's scooping it with the shaku.
She knows exactly how to do it.

121
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,440
Grabbing it closely and... perfectly done.

122
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,440
She knows exactly how to do it.

123
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,700
The one most moved by it is the cameraman close by.

124
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,790
After the purification, the stairs lead to the front of the shrine.

125
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:01,050
For a 2 year and 11 month old each step is a hurdle.

126
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,660
Does she know the rites of visiting a shrine?

127
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,710
Huh, she's taking her backpack off again?

128
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,030
Could it be...

129
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,090
Oh no, she's taking out her wallet.

130
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,610
There's only one 500 yen coin in it which is intended for the tofu.

131
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,960
Wait. Wait.

132
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,390
She's putting it in.

133
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,450
- She put it in.
- She put it in.

134
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,070
What will she do?

135
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,180
She's praying with 500 yen worth.

136
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,290
I hope the baby will be big and healthy.

137
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,640
I hope that I will become a big sister.

138
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,220
I love my mother.

139
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,880
Her wishes echoed throughout the shrine.

140
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,500
What will she do about the tofu?

141
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,250
She's leaving the shrine and heading towards the shop.

142
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,870
She has arrived at the scrambled tofu shop with an empty wallet.

143
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,870
What will she do? She doesn't have any money.

144
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,580
She opens the automatic doors.

145
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,240
Welcome to the shop.

146
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,240
Welcome to the shop.

147
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,390
The old man who is always there.

148
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,910
What's up?

149
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,550
We didn't have tofu.

150
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,430
Tofu?

151
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,430
We didn't have tofu.

152
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,400
The same tofu as usual?

153
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,400
We ran out of the usual tofu.

154
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,410
The usual tofu?

155
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,410
Scrambled tofu.

156
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,960
She remembered.

157
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,510
This one? Which one was it?

158
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,510
This one.

159
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,200
She found the scrambled tofu however...

160
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,510
That will be 250 yen.

161
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,400
I don't have money.

162
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,870
You don't? Could you show me?

163
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,440
Doesn't have money.

164
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,610
You don't have money? What will you do? Without money you can't buy it.

165
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,200
You didn't receive any money?

166
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,690
Yep.

167
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,480
He's trying to get the crew to help out.

168
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,350
Why don't you go back to your mom and... What will you do? You can't buy it without money.

169
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,250
Even if she's asked what she intends to do.

170
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,250
That's right.

171
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,970
Can you go back home and retrieve some money?

172
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,970
Don't wanna.

173
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,860
Can't do it?

174
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,860
Can't do it.

175
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,100
She doesn't want to go home empty-handed.

176
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,970
That's right.

177
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,780
The old guy figures out a solution.

178
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,110
Then...

179
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,530
Go back home.

180
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,880
And get one like these from your mother.

181
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,250
A 500 yen coin. Like the one
she donated at the shrine.

182
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,870
Go back home and get one.

183
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,630
Okay.

184
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,220
Can you do it?

185
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,220
I can do it.

186
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,360
That's amazing.

187
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,150
You are amazing. I will keep the tofu for you.

188
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,620
Haha, can't believe it all came to this.

189
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,710
I couldn't get the tofu.

190
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,780
Because she doesn't have money.

191
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,280
Impossible.

192
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,610
Impossible.

193
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:16,740
She understands that you have to pay money to get things, but she doesn't understand how change works.

194
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,660
That's right. She's only 2 years old.

195
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,310
I'm home.

196
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,310
Welcome back.

197
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,310
She's still energetic.

198
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,850
You were fast.

199
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,960
Tofu   money   didn't get.

200
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,670
No money.

201
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,930
She couldn't explain it well.
She's only 2 years and 11 months.

202
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,250
Why didn't you have money?

203
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,030
What? What about the scrambled tofu?

204
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,440
No scrambled tofu.

205
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,500
There was.

206
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,900
The scrambled tofu that Aochan loves so much?

207
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:51,270
For Aochan, this kind of money...

208
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,400
There's so much she wants to convey
but she can't find the words.

209
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,980
The mother tries to figure it out.

210
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,900
Were you told the money isn't enough?

211
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,900
I was told the money wasn't enough.

212
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,670
Where did the money go?

213
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,990
The money disappeared.

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,170
Who did you give it to?

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,170
Well...

216
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,580
Even if you ask me "who" it's not like I've seen the spirits.

217
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,570
To the shrine. I gave it to the shrine.

218
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:28,400
You did? So you also rang the bell?
And then clapped your hands?

219
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,480
That's right. She gave the money and all.

220
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,700
I didn't ring the bell at the shrine.

221
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,420
What?

222
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,730
Which is it?

223
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:43,020
Just like Aochan is saying. She didn't actually ring the bell.

224
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,490
I didn't ring the bell.

225
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:50,110
What a puzzling conversation it turned into.

226
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,000
The mother thinks of changing her way of asking.

227
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,090
Aochan, which one did you go to first?

228
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,100
That's the one.

229
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,220
Umm.

230
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,940
Ring the bell.

231
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,940
You went to ring the bell first?

232
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,940
That's right.

233
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,250
I see. So that's what it's about.
I finally get it.

234
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,560
This time she's getting 3 100 yen coins.

235
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,550
Please go and get tofu.
Can you do your best once again?

236
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,420
Yes, I can do my best once more.

237
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,060
Alright. Her energy is coming back to her.

238
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,550
Toooooot

239
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,270
She's laughing.

240
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,440
Her fart shows that she's come back to life.

241
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,680
What an amazing character.

242
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,460
He's been waiting with the tofu in the bag.

243
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,020
Do your best old man.

244
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,710
I had money put in.

245
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,710
You did? That's amazing.

246
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,410
The old man is the one who's nervous here.

247
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,330
She brought 300 yen this time. It's fine.

248
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,110
Here's the tofu.

249
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,280
Here you go.

250
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,280
Oh, thank you very much.

251
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,790
But she only put out one coin.

252
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,720
Eh!? Only got one?

253
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,830
One of them was meant for the shrine.

254
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,040
I see.

255
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,070
Please show me.

256
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Oh, there were more.

257
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,540
How great. There were more.

258
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,940
I will take all three.

259
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,960
You really surprised me.

260
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,480
Your change is 50 yen.
Can you take it?

261
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,670
See? This is what's called change.

262
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,820
Please don't drop it.
Thank you very much.

263
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,590
Thank you for your hard work.

264
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,190
Alright, she bought it.

265
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,500
How great.

266
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I didn't ring the bell.

267
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,520
It's been on her mind that she didn't get to ring it the first time.

268
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,080
Is she going again?

269
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,910
This time she went directly towards the bell.

270
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,070
She's back at the shrine.

271
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm home.

272
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm home?

273
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,650
Oh, she did it.

274
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,960
Ring ring ring.

275
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,240
Today she's ringing it with all her might.

276
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,150
Alright.

277
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,210
Motheeeer.

278
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,890
Welcome home.

279
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,890
I'm home.

280
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,930
Did you purchase it?

281
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,930
I did. Here you go.

282
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,790
Amazing.

283
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,350
The scrambled tofu she bought
is served in miso soup.

284
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,050
Thank you for the meal.

285
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,460
The father came back during his lunch break.

286
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,360
It's delicious.

287
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,360
Go ahead.

288
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,520
Scrambled.

289
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,610
Did you say "scrambled please"?

290
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,610
Yep.

291
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,560
The taste of scrambled tofu that
you bought yourself is exceptional.

292
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,450
Aochan, you will become a big sister.

293
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,450
Aochan will become a big sister.

294
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,300
That's right. You will be a cherished sister.

295
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,360
Nom nom cherished nom nom.

296
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,500
She even asked the gods for it.

297
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,480
Then 2 months later...

298
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,770
The wish she loudly asked for came true.

299
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,280
- It's great.

300
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:07,280
- Isn't it great.

301
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,290
Happiness right there.

302
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,820
Can a single clip contain this much happiness?

303
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,850
- Yeah, wasn't it great?

304
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,850
- Yes, it was truly wonderful.

305
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,880
Let us briefly introduce you to our guests

306
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:28,600
Itou, the archetypical Japanese father
and Suzu the ideal young lady.

307
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,790
and next to her is Kadono Takuzou.

308
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,420
Male actor.

309
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,790
I'm not Kadono Takuzou!

310
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,060
- Thank you for being here.

311
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,060
- What did you think about it?

312
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,840
She's completely cute. From
what she does to what she says.

313
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:48,140
If the old guy at the tofu shop gave her the tofu and said, "Your mom can pay me later.", we wouldn't have gotten that fart.

314
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,380
That's right.

315
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,500
She's so mature. She even knows the shortcuts.

316
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,540
Father of a 5 year old.

317
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,380
- That's right.

318
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,380
- Thus perplexing the staff.

319
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,690
- And she raises her hand when crossing the street.

320
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,120
- She's much more mature than me.

321
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,060
Now for the next errand. With only a years difference the mission changes completely.

322
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,360
Ishikawa ● Hakusan city

323
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,780
Here we find the talkative girl who is almost 4 year old.

324
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,360
"Isn't the reason she knows many words because she reads so many picture books?" her mother says.

325
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,410
Mio
3 years 9 months

326
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:31,760
Since she's already 3 and a big sister
she frequents this place often.

327
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,420
Before going to bed she always reads one picture book and they even enact it.

328
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:45,840
In this bookshelve there is only on book that hasn't been borrowed by the library. A book they've written themselves.

329
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,960
By dad and mom: Thank you Mio.

330
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,280
A picture book from when Mio was born.

331
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,780
So much love.

332
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:01,540
And now she's showing the newest creation:
Mio's First Errand.

333
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:10,440
But it's not complete yet. They will
change it after today's errand.

334
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,920
I see.

335
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,900
Can I read a bit for you?

336
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,920
Yep.

337
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,820
See? It says: My first errand.

338
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,840
She's been reading the book before bed for several days to teach her how to go on an errand.

339
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,480
The soon-to-be 4 year old Mio will go on her first errand.

340
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,220
True, today is my first errand.

341
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,340
Give me a mackerel from Ishikawa with its head and guts removed, filleted into two.

342
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,560
If there aren't any?

343
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,720
Sounds complicated.

344
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,950
If there aren't any then dottybacks, sailfin or sandfish and if possible, from Ishikawa.

345
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,840
Not if possible. Definitely, right?

346
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,420
She's buying locally sourced ones.

347
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,240
Amazing.

348
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,400
And if they don't have any then she shouldn't purchase anything.

349
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,300
They only buy fresh laid Yanagihara eggs.

350
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,180
Furthermore... okra.

351
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,160
Okra.

352
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,800
And nameko.

353
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,180
Those two weren't included in the picture book.

354
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:10,840
She remembers the things in the picture book well but she's still only 3 years old.

355
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,060
You have money here and the loyalty card.

356
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,640
You are even making her use the loyalty card?

357
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,780
It's a simple route along the huge street to get to the shop.

358
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:28,120
But she needs to get mackerel from Ishikawa prefecture, eggs from Yanagihara, tofu, lotus root, okra, nameko mushrooms.

359
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,840
Even adults would forget.

360
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,620
Be careful. Bye bye.

361
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,620
Heading off.

362
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,380
She picked the straw hat at the shop
because she thought it was cute.

363
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,720
And she likes to walk without socks which she is used to so her mother lets her do it.

364
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,420
I can go on an errand.

365
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:51,180
It's nice autumn weather which the picture book didn't mention.

366
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,640
Huh!? What's up?

367
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,980
Hello.

368
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,600
The cameraman is surprised that she spoke to him.

369
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,360
All by yourself? You are awesome.

370
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,360
I'm going on an errand.

371
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
3 years old.

372
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,760
Only 3 years old?

373
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,560
It's rare to find such a talkative 3 year old.

374
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
Amazing.

375
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,420
Do your best.

376
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,300
Since the conversation could go on the camera man moves away.

377
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,860
Mio no longer has anyone to talk to.

378
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,100
Wait... is she going home?

379
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,260
She's running home.

380
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,960
A gust of lonely air hit her.

381
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,460
Oh, what's up?

382
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,040
You didn't draw me a map.

383
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,780
A map? You need a map?

384
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,840
Please put it in.

385
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,900
She doesn't know how to read a map or characters.

386
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,660
She always has to remember.
That's why her memory is so great.

387
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,980
She changed hats. This one is a camouflaged patterned. Ready for battle.

388
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,960
She's adding a smiley face so that
she can know which one is her left.

389
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,400
Okay? Remember to turn left.

390
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,980
I will be here for sure.

391
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,140
She departs with a new map and a smiley face.

392
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,740
Huh? That face. Could it be?

393
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,220
Is she feeling lonely?

394
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,130
Back to the spot where she last turned around.

395
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,130
She won't go.

396
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,050
She can't seem to cross this iron grate.

397
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,640
I'm lonely.

398
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,440
Turning at this corner she will
no longer be able to see her home.

399
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,940
Because she can't see back.

400
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,310
She's 50 meters from her house.

401
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,660
In her mother's book it says:
"It's alright. Do your best!"

402
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,320
And to cross the road.

403
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,520
She couldn't do like it says in the book.

404
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,780
Mommy.

405
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,880
She's walking back crying unlike in the book.

406
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,170
Why are you back?

407
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,170
Did you go shopping?

408
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,290
I feel lonely.

409
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,290
Do your best and go.

410
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,720
Her mother shows her determination.

411
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,210
I asked you, Mio.
I didn't ask anyone else to do it.

412
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,140
It won't be good if you don't go.

413
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:15,070
"I want to be a better big sister since my little sister was born." is what she said.

414
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,850
Perhaps a bit too optimistic

415
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,460
but she does want to be helpful

416
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,610
is how she wants to be seen by her mom.

417
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,650
Don't come back.

418
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,880
She's strict.

419
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,880
You understand?

420
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,310
Do your best and go.

421
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,620
Off you go.

422
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,190
You will soon be 4 so you can definitely go.

423
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,260
Go forward.

424
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,260
Yep.

425
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,590
"Big sister bye."

426
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,060
I'm lonely but...

427
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,600
She's lonely but.

428
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,900
Do your best.

429
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,180
Go forward.

430
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,800
I'm lonely but I will go.

431
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,570
I'm lonely but I will go.

432
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,290
Even if you are lonely then go.

433
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,090
I want to become a big sister.

434
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,080
Off you go.

435
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,110
Yep.

436
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,480
Off you go.

437
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,980
Off you go.

438
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,900
That's wrong.

439
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,520
Off you go.

440
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,350
Off you go.

441
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,260
Off you go.

442
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,260
Of I go.

443
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,540
Of I go.

444
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,030
Off you go.

445
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,310
Do your best.

446
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,860
The start of a big sisters journey.

447
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,900
Her sigh.

448
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,750
That iron grate.

449
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,150
Here again.

450
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,150
Here again.

451
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,170
Take a step forward.

452
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,970
This is the borderline.

453
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,780
Left, left.

454
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,630
Yes, left.

455
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,830
Go along the parking lot.

456
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,420
The big sister has finally crossed the iron grate.

457
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,350
This is it.

458
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,320
Wonder if your sister left.

459
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,390
I wonder.

460
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,130
The map for good luck.

461
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,300
If you cry then wipe the tears with your towel.

462
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,300
She's busy.

463
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,090
She's lonely but she will go.

464
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,420
On a day with beautiful cirrocumulus clouds​.

465
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,540
Surrounded by lucious green.

466
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,210
She's walking way over there.

467
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:17,860
When grandpa came to visit from the countryside, she remembered walking down this road and singing.

468
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:25,460
The moon, came out out, the moon came out.

469
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,110
Because he's a grandfather.

470
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,950
What an old song.

471
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,530
A yoi yoi.

472
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,950
She has learned this song.

473
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:34,640
The chimney is so high up there.

474
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:44,980
Surely the moon will be covered in smoke. Yoi Yoi.

475
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,250
She remembers it completely.

476
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,970
Is she dancing the second chorus?

477
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,640
It's the shop!

478
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,360
While lost in song she's already arrived.

479
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,610
It's right ahead.

480
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,270
Eggs and lotus root.

481
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,840
I must buy a lot.

482
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,550
Her energy is back.

483
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:12,110
This supermarket is for locally sourced fish and vegetables.

484
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,880
That's nice.

485
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,460
She was asked to get many things.

486
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,880
How much of it will she remember?

487
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,780
She can't read yet.

488
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,620
Can she do it?

489
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,420
Did you give birth to eggs?

490
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,420
Eggs?

491
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,600
Yanagihara eggs.

492
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,380
Amazing, she remembers.

493
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,550
They are here.

494
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,550
There are some?

495
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,220
They are freshly laid today.

496
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,650
Since her birth she's only had these Yanagihara eggs.

497
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,170
It's been a while since Mio has seen them last.

498
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,780
What about other shopping?

499
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,210
I want to buy handaga tofu.

500
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,180
You want hankata tofu?

501
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,480
This tofu has a hard exterior but is soft on the inside. She also got this right.

502
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,590
And then?

503
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,400
Lotus root.

504
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,400
Lotus root?

505
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,660
Her memory is amazing.
She instantly remembers.

506
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,460
Not only does she remember their name...

507
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,600
It's better if they have many internodes.

508
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,130
She's a housewife.

509
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,440
She chooses the one that seems to be high in mineral content.

510
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,120
Is that alright?

511
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,120
Yep.

512
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,280
And then what?

513
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,280
And fish.

514
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,380
In the book:

515
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,260
Good day!

516
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,600
Do you have mackerel from Ishikawa prefecture?

517
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,630
Gut it and remove the heads.

518
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,490
I want 2 fillets, please.

519
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,920
That's hard.

520
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,290
That's what it says. I wonder if she can say it.

521
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,760
Even adults would forget.

522
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,670
Even adults would forget.

523
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,160
Good day.

524
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,710
Do you have mackerel from Ishikawa prefecture?

525
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,350
This one.

526
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,020
Oh you!

527
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,290
Filleted into two, please.

528
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,890
Cut their heads.

529
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,240
Amazing.

530
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,370
Is it okay with just one?

531
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,510
Just one.

532
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,510
One cut into two fillets, right?

533
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,640
Please wait.

534
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,340
Yes.

535
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,450
I'm moved.

536
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,180
She was able to say it with vigor.

537
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,330
She didn't ask them to gut it but

538
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,320
she asked them to fillet it so the guts are already removed.

539
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,290
Is that all?

540
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,220
Only the mackerel.

541
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,760
Only the mackerel. Haha.

542
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,330
Thank you very much.

543
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,260
Please take care.

544
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,760
Thank you.

545
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,260
Thank you.

546
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,240
She even ad libbed a thanks outside of the book.

547
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,500
Only okura and nameko left.

548
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,140
So... Wait...

549
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,410
She went to the cashier.

550
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,470
Alright.

551
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,960
Heave-ho.

552
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,310
It looks like she forgot.

553
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,230
Her mother just added those two.

554
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,230
They were not in the book.

555
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,020
It can't be helped then.

556
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,460
Paying 2000 and receiving 940 yen back.

557
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,890
It's extraordinary that a 3 year old can do all that.

558
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,790
It is. Truly extraordinary.

559
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,080
Drinking cold bancha.

560
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,450
And then she remembers...

561
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,140
Ah...

562
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
I want to buy nameko mushrooms.

563
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,000
You need nameko?

564
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,470
She remembered.

565
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,640
I will show you to the nameko.
Let's go together?

566
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
Right th..

567
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,640
Mom also...

568
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,010
Ah, I will also buy okura.

569
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,980
She remembered the okura.

570
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,400
She remembered everything.

571
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,900
Small nameko would be better.

572
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,900
Small would be better?

573
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,240
Since there are sizes of nameko.

574
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,960
The big ones are for stir-frying.

575
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,260
But the small ones are good in miso soup.

576
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,750
There are various.

577
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,830
Let's go with this one.

578
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,830
This one?

579
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,920
Yes, these are good with miso soup.

580
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,670
And okura?

581
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,670
Okura is...

582
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,910
This is the last item. Where are they?

583
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,610
They usually can be found here but are sold out.

584
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,280
We don't have anymore today.

585
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Will this do?

586
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,350
While there were eggs...

587
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,820
there were no okura. What a rarity.

588
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,560
That's true. Usually there are okura.

589
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,860
The hat on tight. Job well done.

590
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,450
Marvelous.

591
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,340
A suspicious cloud surrounds the mountain.

592
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,740
She talked with many and purchased a lot. Now she only needs to head home.

593
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,000
What's wrong?

594
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,810
She's dawdling.

595
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,640
My legs hurt.

596
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,110
The book didn't mention that
the groceries would be heavy.

597
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,730
Or that her legs would hurt.

598
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,960
The road along the rice field.

599
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,480
She's not singing the Tanko-bushi song this time.

600
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,890
Do your best.

601
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,590
She's 3. And a big sister.

602
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,140
She struggles between wanting to exert herself and wanting to be treated sweetly like a child.

603
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,900
Her heart is wavering.

604
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,130
I want to help her.

605
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,850
Did she reach her limit?

606
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,520
But wait...

607
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,320
Her tears stopped.

608
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,070
She found something.

609
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,360
What is that? The white thing?

610
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,110
That's bad. She spotted our drone.

611
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,710
She spotted the drone.

612
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,160
Stop right there.

613
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,750
She's looking at it.

614
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,540
It goes up and down.

615
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,410
It took her mind off the heaviness of the bag.

616
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,960
Good evening.

617
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,660
Good evening.

618
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,050
An old lady is picking flowers.

619
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,530
Good evening.

620
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,000
Huh!?

621
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,300
Good evening.

622
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,650
Ah, good evening.

623
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,440
It's not the afternoon yet but the old lady goes along with it.

624
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,370
Which one do you want?

625
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,570
Can I??

626
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,110
I want this one.

627
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,330
Pink and orange?
That's pretty.

628
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,810
Do you want only 2?

629
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,880
Thank you.

630
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,250
Thank you very much.

631
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,300
Thanks to you the tears have stopped.

632
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,340
Your big sister is doing her best.

633
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:19,710
As soon as she sees the house
she lets out all the tears she held back.

634
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
Mommy.

635
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,520
Yes?

636
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,910
Yes?

637
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,040
Welcome home.

638
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,990
Thank you. What's up?

639
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,230
What's up?

640
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,100
The important words to tell mom...

641
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,700
They didn't have okura.

642
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,700
They didn't have okura?

643
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,040
It was bothering her.

644
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,100
Then let's make tofu and nameko miso soup then.

645
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:52,160
She wants to be held like a baby.

646
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,120
Mommy. This is a present for you.

647
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,380
Thank you for the present.

648
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,490
You brought me a gift.

649
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,820
I'm happy. I'm happy.

650
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,450
Thanks. Thanks.

651
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,310
That's right. The picture book.

652
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,260
Must complete it.

653
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,760
Mio, tell me how you did it.

654
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,910
I missed you, mom.

655
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,120
Because it was so tough.

656
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,150
If you write it here.

657
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,590
And so, a lot was added to the book.

658
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,510
That she cried from loneliness before departing.

659
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,860
And that she sang Tanko-bushi with joy.

660
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,560
Or that she received flowers.

661
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,600
And much more.

662
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,670
Mom, you've completed a great book.

663
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,690
Well... It's all thanks to me.

664
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,130
She did well.

665
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,370
What a marvelous errand.

666
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,790
It's a top score.

667
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,790
A top score.

668
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,140
Walking aimlessly at first.

669
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,110
Mother of boys of these ages

670
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,660
The she remembered it all and to say thanks.

671
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:05,630
When she said: "They don't have okura"

672
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,070
She's truly laudable.

673
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,990
I want to go back to those times.

674
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,580
When she asked the shopkeeper

675
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,180
did you give birth to eggs?

676
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,000
That was really funny.

677
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,970
Things not written in the book are bound to happen.

678
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:32,750
During the errand of the youngest of 3 brothers the shop will be thrown into disarray.

679
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,840
Tochi ● Tochigi City

680
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,750
Here's a house that likes to keep thing neat and tidy.

681
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,320
Time for cleaning.

682
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,740
Inside the house looks like a showroom.

683
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,630
The mother's philosophy is to put everything orderly.

684
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,900
Everything has its place.

685
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,640
Amazing.

686
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,380
The youngest of 3 at 3 years and 9 months, Masashi.

687
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,750
The other two haven't returned from school.

688
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,560
Who wants to help?

689
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,750
Alright then...

690
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,350
There's a place in the storage room that she isn't satisfied with.

691
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,590
There is?

692
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,710
Listen up Mr. Masashi.
Mama wants another of those baskets.

693
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:24,900
What if there were 3 or 4 of those baskets here?

694
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,900
Yep.

695
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,520
I see. Measuring it so he can purchase the right size.

696
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,670
About this high.

697
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,840
Go and purchase them.

698
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840
About thi...

699
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,840
That's right.

700
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,040
And adding an errand for the dinner.

701
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,180
For remuneration let's get the expensive bluefin tuna.

702
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,160
Does he understand "remuneration"?

703
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,350
Toro

704
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,670
Toro (the fatty belly meat of the tuna)

705
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,790
Does he understand toro?

706
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,560
For remuneration (as a reward) he will get toro.

707
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,190
On the way back from the fishmonger there is a home center close to home.

708
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,100
He was asked to buy 3 white baskets.

709
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,670
That's difficult.

710
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,440
Please help your mother in cleaning up.

711
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,300
Later.

712
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,420
Later.

713
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,070
It was raining until yesterday.

714
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,010
So she gave him rubber boots in case of puddles.

715
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,140
I'm happy.

716
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,800
He was looking forward to going on errand.

717
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,300
So he wanted to.

718
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,580
Usually his brothers are asked to do it.

719
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,300
The third in the row who is expected less of.

720
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,360
He's called cute and treated like a baby.

721
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,260
Masashi dislikes those times.

722
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,760
Closed?

723
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,400
Today is the first time he is being relied on.

724
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,720
The stakes are high, third son.

725
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,450
Do your best.

726
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,450
Did you come by yourself?

727
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,450
Where's your mother?

728
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,460
Welcome.

729
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:41,940
Home.

730
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,640
Waiting at home?

731
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,450
Aren't you usually with your brothers?

732
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,590
What do you want?

733
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,590
Toro as remuneration, right?

734
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,520
The similar thing as tuna, please.

735
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,790
Tuna and salmon?

736
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,100
Both?

737
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,520
He neither understood remuneration or toro.

738
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,640
Poor thing. It changed.

739
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,800
When the old man heard the word similar he gave him the same thing his mom usually buys.

740
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,100
Will this do?

741
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,630
What about the toro?

742
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,400
The lean tuna meat and salmon. Not exactly renummeration.

743
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,970
That will be 1080 yen.

744
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,270
Ended up being cheaper.

745
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,030
This triumphant face.

746
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,440
What a nice face.

747
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,300
It will do even if it isn't toro.

748
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,110
That's right.

749
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,900
The shop owners are observing.

750
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,680
Eaten together isn't it like Toro anyway?

751
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,860
He looks happy.

752
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,860
With great delight.

753
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,960
He picked something up.

754
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,610
A single leaf.

755
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,990
And now for the 3 white baskets.

756
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,760
He's arrived at the home center.

757
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,260
Going well.

758
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,460
It's so spacious inside. Will he find it?

759
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,130
About 19000 stock units are sold here.

760
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,250
Finding things can be hard even for adults.

761
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,370
Will he get it?

762
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,950
Isn't it faster to ask a store worker?

763
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,070
He should ask: "Where are the wide baskets?"

764
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,560
Welcome.

765
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,960
Ah, it's the store manager.

766
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,900
Pigeons

767
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:17,740
Pigeon: hato
Heart: ha-to
Basket: hako

768
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,180
The same pigeons.

769
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,120
Hearts?

770
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,870
Baskets for storage.

771
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,440
What did you come to buy?

772
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,070
Pigeon

773
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,820
The same pigeons.

774
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,670
What do you mean by heart?

775
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,040
The same one.

776
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,040
The same one?

777
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,090
Like that one?

778
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,160
Oh no, he shouldn't have brought this.

779
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,260
Pigeon.

780
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,260
Heart.

781
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,450
Pigeon.

782
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,450
Heart.

783
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,330
That's not it.

784
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,670
The store manager...

785
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,650
Pi-geon.

786
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:34,250
It's not a heart. A basket.

787
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,420
Manager, you don't sell hearts, right!?

788
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,390
Do you want to try and look for it?

789
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,590
Looking for a heart-like thing?

790
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,930
Well, it isn't a heart.

791
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:48,050
Do you remember what color?

792
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,550
Green.

793
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,550
You came looking for a green thing?

794
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,690
The green leaf is confusing him.

795
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,360
We have green things.

796
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,130
It's not like they have green hearts.

797
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,130
Like this...

798
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,080
It's heart shaped.

799
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,530
They did have it.

800
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,530
It's there!

801
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,750
It looks like that.

802
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,290
They did have such a thing.

803
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,540
It was a green heart, right?

804
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,890
That's wrong.

805
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,890
It's not this?

806
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,110
- That's great.
- Do your best.

807
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,630
We also have green things here.

808
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,570
The store manager is focused on finding green things.

809
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,050
It's not even green.

810
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,280
Green. What about this?

811
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,470
There are so many green things.

812
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,170
Or like this?

813
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,170
That's close!

814
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,340
Nope.

815
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,080
Besides the color

816
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,730
what do you remember?

817
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,730
Nothing.

818
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,150
In spite of being right next to it.

819
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,850
Since I don't know

820
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:46,060
can you ask your mother and come back?

821
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,060
Yep.

822
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,610
Alright, go and ask and come back.

823
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,080
I will be waiting.

824
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,720
He decides on asking her.

825
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,630
Their house is close by.

826
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,040
Do you understand what he needed?

827
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,440
I couldn't imagine it.

828
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,340
I apologize.

829
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,340
No need.

830
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,230
It's on us. Thanks for being polite.

831
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,380
My apologies.

832
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,480
Even though he managed to buy the tuna he returns dejected.

833
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,690
Mother.

834
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,690
Ma-.

835
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,010
I titn't unterstant.

836
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:20,280
He makes the same mistake here of pronouncing the k sound as t.

837
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,020
Did you go to the home center?

838
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,360
What did you ask?

839
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,490
Green pigeon.

840
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,200
You said green basket?

841
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,270
And he heart it as heart?

842
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,270
He heard it as heart?

843
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,840
But it's not heart is what I said.

844
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,790
Even if you said it's not heart he didn't understand?

845
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,710
So his mother thought of this...

846
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,110
You explained that this is a green basket, right?

847
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,880
But mama wants white.

848
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,170
That's right. It should be white.

849
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,820
I accidentally said green.

850
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,820
Next time say white.

851
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,710
Try to say basket.

852
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,960
I couldn't say taro (yam).

853
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,030
Try to say ka like in karasu (crow).

854
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,860
Ta as in tarasu.

855
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,930
Crow.

856
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,670
Tarasu why do you cry.

857
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,710
Ta as in tarasu, right?

858
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,580
Thank you very much.

859
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,580
It's ka not ta.

860
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:20,070
Masashi who can't say ka is kaming back.

861
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,400
The store manager was waiting.

862
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,280
Again the difference between "went" and "ask" is "k".
The manager picked up on it this time.

863
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,120
I went and came back.

864
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,720
You went and asked?

865
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,870
Do your best, manager.

866
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,260
What was it?

867
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,060
If you turn where the slippers are then it should be there.

868
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,900
Turning where the slippers are?

869
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,700
The slippers are over there.

870
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,220
Looking for it...

871
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,510
What do you use it for?

872
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,010
To put things in.

873
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,010
To put things in?

874
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,600
What do you put in it?

875
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,350
T(p)aper tand stuff.

876
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,170
Accumulations?

877
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,170
Taper (paper).

878
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,680
You put paper in it.

879
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,690
Taper!?

880
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,300
Paper?

881
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,150
That's right!

882
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,690
Taper.

883
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,690
You put that in it?

884
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,420
If it's something to stor

885
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,530
White.

886
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,530
White?

887
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,290
Back on track.

888
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,290
He noticed.

889
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,900
This?

890
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:03,900
No.

891
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,150
That's not it.

892
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,830
Those are plates.

893
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,400
Dude, he's not here for plates.

894
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,930
It can't be folded.

895
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,000
It can't be folded.

896
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,000
It shouldn't be foldable.

897
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,810
Is it hard?

898
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,240
A white stuare.

899
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,080
A white square?

900
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,010
He understood "square".

901
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,120
It's not disposable chopsticks, right?

902
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,120
Why disposable chopsticks?

903
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,450
What about a lunch box?

904
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,450
While white and square that's not it.

905
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,220
Nope.

906
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,120
I beg of you, store manager.

907
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,290
It can't be eaten.

908
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,810
Can't be folded.

909
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,810
Can't be folded nor eaten.

910
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,460
It's turned into a puzzle.

911
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,810
Right where they are at.

912
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,080
Down the aisle around the slippers.

913
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,830
They are here?

914
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,870
There they are the white taro (yam)... oops, I meant baskets.

915
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,870
Let's go back again.

916
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,570
Despite it being further ahead.

917
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,340
They came back.

918
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,540
Back to the slippers.

919
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,260
What's this?

920
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,610
He noticed something good.

921
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,130
The same thing.

922
00:39:59,130 --> 00:39:59,900
The same thing?

923
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,590
A basket of this height.

924
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,500
Mama...

925
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,860
Mama told you to bring it?

926
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,030
Is this a hint?

927
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,680
Show your detective skills.

928
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,930
The hint is too difficult.

929
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,970
But you use this with pencils.

930
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,590
You use it with pencils?

931
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,540
Borrowed from his brothers' stationary.

932
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,540
An irrelevant piece of information.

933
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,660
A ruler, after all.

934
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,800
Do your best store manager.

935
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,860
Can you go back and ask?

936
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,080
Yeah.

937
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,680
This turned into the store managers' errand.

938
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,720
Will you? Go and ask?

939
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,250
I can.

940
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:38,740
Once more, go back and then tell me.

941
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,740
Yeah.

942
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,110
Why can't the man find him a taro (yam).

943
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,250
I apologize.

944
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,990
He has kids in primary and junior high school.

945
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,120
They've outgrown that phase.

946
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,410
I apologize.

947
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,480
No need to apologize that much.

948
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,680
Masashi is returning home.

949
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,550
Having so much fun.

950
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,700
Mother is waiting.

951
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,030
How was it?

952
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,940
Mama

953
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,050
It wasn't there.

954
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,620
What did you tell them?

955
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,930
They didn't have a single thing to put taper in.

956
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,210
You said "for putting paper in"?

957
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,570
The mother naturally hears taper as paper.

958
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,730
Basket, basket, basket.

959
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,490
Say basket while you walk.

960
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,470
Basket, basket, basket.

961
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,770
Taro, taro.

962
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,340
Just like that.

963
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,550
Despite trying to say "basket" why doesn't the manager listen?

964
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:40,450
That's because he's not able to say basket at all.

965
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,570
The store manager is on Masashi duty today.

966
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,880
Again he meant to say asked not came back.

967
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,390
I went and came back.

968
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,190
Do your best, manager.

969
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,880
Do you get it now?

970
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,880
Yep.

971
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,390
It's around the slippers, right?

972
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,150
Let's go over there.

973
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,630
Let's go.

974
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,850
What did she tell you to say?

975
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,140
She said taro (yam).

976
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,140
Barrel?

977
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,570
Taro.

978
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,450
Taro.

979
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,370
Haro?

980
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,770
Taro.

981
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,770
Taro?

982
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,780
Stuare taro.

983
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,780
Barrel?

984
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,410
They turned where the slippers are.

985
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,780
Calm down.

986
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,890
To.

987
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,700
What if you try to say it slowly?

988
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,690
What if you try to say it slowly?

989
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:19,690
Tell me.

990
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,090
Pigeon.

991
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,980
He's back to pigeon.

992
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,460
Heart?

993
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,100
Something that you put things in.

994
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,100
You put things in it?

995
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,120
Pigeon.

996
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,670
Pigeon.

997
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,140
Basket?

998
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:33,920
That's it!

999
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,140
Yeah.

1000
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,340
Not pigeon but basket?

1001
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,060
This is a breakthrough.

1002
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,260
A breakthrough.

1003
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,210
Like this?

1004
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,620
They did it.

1005
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,620
Found it.

1006
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,180
There, there.

1007
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,870
Will this do?

1008
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,220
This is it.

1009
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,090
This?

1010
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,020
This? Did we find it?

1011
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,820
He looks so happy.

1012
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,930
He found the taro.

1013
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,960
I'm so relieved.

1014
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,470
Manager, about the height...

1015
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,890
Isn't the height right for this one.

1016
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:05,890
Yep.

1017
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,240
The height is perfect.

1018
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,290
Alright.

1019
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,210
He finally bought it. Three white taro.

1020
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,500
Be careful on your way home.

1021
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,780
The manager's eyes are gleaming.

1022
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,330
Thank you very much.

1023
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,920
At that moment...

1024
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,110
Thank you very much.

1025
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,940
- Manager.

1026
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:25,940
- Admirable.

1027
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,330
Let's shake hands on it.

1028
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,330
You really did well.

1029
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,950
Thank you.

1030
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,570
The manager is such a nice person.

1031
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,020
He's no longer a baby.

1032
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:39,240
He executed his errand properly.

1033
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,280
He bought it. He bought it.

1034
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,600
Finally.

1035
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:49,930
Ma-.

1036
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,540
His proud smiling face is dazzling his mother's eyes.

1037
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,770
You are back.

1038
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,460
You are back.

1039
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:02,330
See?

1040
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,330
It's right.

1041
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,210
The shop keep finally understood.

1042
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,260
But he said heart again.

1043
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,260
He said heart?

1044
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,590
And for the purchased white basket....

1045
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,590
Nice.

1046
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,260
Will it fit?

1047
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,610
It fits!

1048
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,240
It fits nicely.

1049
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,040
That's great.

1050
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,350
Just how his mother wanted it.

1051
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,980
Useful for a long time.

1052
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,260
You did it.

1053
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,290
Not how his mother wanted it with toro as a renummeration.

1054
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,590
But it's salmon and lean tuna as they usually get.

1055
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:35,760
How is it?

1056
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:39,350
Nothing beats the usual taste.

1057
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,620
What a childlike errand.

1058
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,400
It's remarkable that he tried so many times.

1059
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,630
That's how children run errands.

1060
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,630
That's right.

1061
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:05,960
The store manager has never been
so happy in his life to sell a basket.

1062
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,760
He hasn't.

1063
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,680
Like he was about to cry during the departure.

1064
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,700
He was so happy.

1065
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,320
Emotional bond.

1066
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,170
During the entire thing

1067
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,570
Mr. Tomida was crying the entire time.

1068
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:18,770
Full of tears.

1069
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,820
You can empathize, right?

1070
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,600
Father of 2 sons with these ages.

1071
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,820
That's right.

1072
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:25,440
When I saw the on-air of me crying it made me cry even harder.

1073
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,800
Annoying person.

1074
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,720
How annoying.

1075
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,670
During Halloween the Japanese who are thought of as being shy

1076
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:40,460
have started wearing clothes and parading down the street.

1077
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:45,230
It's a magical day where you get
the chance to overcome shyness.

1078
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,580
Here's a household intending on having a first errand.

1079
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:50,140
Shinyu   ●  Yuzawa city

1080
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,960
The big sister tends to get easily embarrassed

1081
00:45:50,500 --> 00:46:00,170
Chihana
4 years 11 months

1082
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,210
except for on this day.

1083
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:00,170
Momoka
2 years 10 months

1084
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,740
The 2 year old Momoka is always chill.

1085
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,180
She doesn't know about shyness yet.

1086
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,330
They will call over friends to their house today and have a Halloween party.

1087
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:09,120
They will hollow out the pumpkin to use it as a cheese fondue bowl.

1088
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,370
It's always the brother who goes on errands.

1089
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:18,030
They insist on being useful to their mom, so the mom thought of this errand.

1090
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,080
Momo, what about milk?

1091
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,350
This is the little sister Momoka.

1092
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,950
Milk is needed in cheese fondue.

1093
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,860
Momokas role in the home is to bring the milk.

1094
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,080
Then at first...

1095
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,530
Please buy milk.

1096
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,700
I want to go with mama and buy it.

1097
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,430
Perhaps Momoka can't do it?

1098
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,180
What about big sis?

1099
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,050
Can you go buy milk?

1100
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,050
Yes.

1101
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,920
She can do Momokas part.

1102
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,760
Yes, I will go an buy it.

1103
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,710
The big sis was asked to get shredded cheese and a slab of bacon

1104
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:52,730
and about the milk

1105
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:56,250
unlike the usual one, the stronger unprocessed one will do.

1106
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,700
The mom went for a difficult request.

1107
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,070
Difficult indeed.

1108
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,670
Unprocessed.

1109
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,270
The shop is right there.

1110
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,930
50 meters from the house.

1111
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,450
The mom went with the closest option because of Momoka.

1112
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,420
Wait, so Momoka is going after all?

1113
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,390
Off you go.

1114
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,350
Off we go.

1115
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,350
Do your best.

1116
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,040
Big sis, Momoka is now in your hands...

1117
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,990
... then where are you going?

1118
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,280
What, what, what.

1119
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,630
Off the bat?

1120
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,020
She's going out back. That's not good.

1121
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,020
In front of our film crew campout.

1122
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,420
Apparently there was a shortcut through the parking lot.

1123
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,510
But there's an obstacle here.

1124
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,350
This water ditch.

1125
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,980
It's not a problem for the big sister but for Momoka it's impossible. And then...

1126
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,890
Go down.

1127
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:55,510
Do I have to go here in order to go to the shop?

1128
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,410
Here we go.

1129
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,070
Do this.

1130
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:05,950
Momoka is already regretting that she went with her.

1131
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,240
- Do your best.

1132
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,240
- Do your best. Do your best.

1133
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,640
Oh no, I got all dirty.

1134
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,030
Momoka is pouting a bit.

1135
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,050
That's right.

1136
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:23,350
Because the milk has to be unprocessed

1137
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:27,340
Momoka can't, but the big sister seems able to do it.

1138
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,010
Milk first.

1139
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,700
Cherfully running towards the milk.

1140
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:38,170
It's not this one.

1141
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,920
Since they need the unprocessed one.

1142
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,460
Momoka can't but the big sister can.

1143
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,570
This one perhaps.

1144
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,790
Welcome.

1145
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,900
This is the same milk as usual. Not the unprocessed one.

1146
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,150
And what about the grated cheese and bacon?

1147
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,540
That's right.

1148
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,210
Momo wants to give it.

1149
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:02,990
As the person in charge of the milk, Momoko wants to pay.

1150
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,810
She wants to feel like she's the one who purchased it.

1151
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,860
The sister knows about the melted cheese and bacon

1152
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,110
but she's too shy to say anything.

1153
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,670
She's too dejected to take the shortcut on the way back.

1154
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,450
She's downtrodden from her embarrassment.

1155
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,070
Is she embarrassed?

1156
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:30,970
She couldn't purchase her part.

1157
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:32,240
She couldn't say it.

1158
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,310
Welcome back.

1159
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,280
I could only get the milk.

1160
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,580
I was too embarrassed to ask.

1161
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,400
Embarrassing.

1162
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,880
The magic of Halloween didn't do its trick.

1163
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,170
Fine fine. It's so close so you can go as many times as you like.

1164
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,040
Go see the lady again.

1165
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,890
At first she intended to make her
go on the errand in a princess dress but

1166
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,460
because of the rain she's wearing a rain coat instead.

1167
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,950
The big sister will always hide behind her mom.

1168
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,120
It's okay because you did your best so far.

1169
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,000
Let's go.

1170
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,260
Momo is cool as a cucumber.

1171
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,710
Then Momo, can you go alone?

1172
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,710
Yep.

1173
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:08,560
By yourself?

1174
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,040
This is the usual milk.

1175
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,830
Not this one but unprocessed.

1176
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,930
Ask for unprocessed.

1177
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,930
Big sis, it's impossible for Momoka.

1178
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,070
It's difficult.

1179
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:19,340
- Unprocessed, right?

1180
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,340
Yeah unprocessed.

1181
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,970
Ask for unprocessed milk.

1182
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,970
Yep.

1183
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,210
Will she go alone?

1184
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,750
Surely the big sister will worry and chase after her.

1185
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:31,150
Her mother believes that.

1186
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,300
She's going through the arcade this time.

1187
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,990
Do your best.

1188
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,660
Can she say "unprocessed"?

1189
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,480
Please return this.

1190
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,800
Please return this.

1191
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,880
She understands returns.

1192
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,440
Unprosshd.

1193
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,400
Unprosshd?

1194
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,870
Unprosshd.

1195
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,660
That's a hard one.

1196
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,480
Which is unprosshd?

1197
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,840
She even remembers to say unprocessed.

1198
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,900
Which is unprosshd?

1199
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,900
Which do you always get?

1200
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,080
Unprosshd.

1201
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,030
Unprosshd.

1202
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,600
She thinks she's saying it right but...

1203
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,320
The old lady doesn't understand.

1204
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,920
She's saying it.

1205
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,260
Please give me the big cheese.

1206
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,540
The big sister has still not changed her mood.

1207
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,930
I was so embarrassed.

1208
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,000
Embarrassed.

1209
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,600
Too embarrased to ask?

1210
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:23,600
Yeah.

1211
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,340
The mom stops holding her.

1212
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:30,980
But if you don't go then we won't be able to have a party.

1213
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,090
Let's cancel it then.

1214
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,700
Let's call them and say "hey, we can't do it".

1215
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,270
Cancelling todays halloween party?

1216
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,650
Or to do the errand despite shyness.

1217
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:43,520
One of these two.

1218
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,060
Go and look at how Momoka is doing.

1219
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,490
Why don't you take a look if she's getting the unprocessed milk.

1220
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:50,180
If it's only a peek then it's fine.

1221
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:54,630
She's worried about her little sister
so she will go for her little sister.

1222
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:58,550
Do your best for your sister.

1223
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,080
The big sister has arrived.

1224
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:09,830
Unprosshd.

1225
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,630
She's still doing it.

1226
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,630
The one your mom asked you to buy is...

1227
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,080
She doesn't get unprosshd.

1228
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,120
Unprosshd.

1229
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,370
Now her big sister arrives.

1230
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:20,140
Is it this one?

1231
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:20,140
Unprocessed.

1232
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,530
If it's unprocessed then it's this one.

1233
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:26,150
She immediately understood thanks to big sister.

1234
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,300
Alright.

1235
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:27,000
Thanks to her indeed.

1236
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:30,100
Yes, that's right. The unprosshd one.

1237
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,570
Is this the unprosshd one.

1238
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:37,670
The lady didn't think that a 2 year old was trying to say such a difficult word.

1239
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,940
Sorry for not noticing.

1240
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,500
The big sister started moving.

1241
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,300
And melting cheese.

1242
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,070
Melting cheese?

1243
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:50,070
She overcame her shyness.

1244
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,530
She only came to watch, but is she going to buy some?

1245
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:55,540
Is this okay?

1246
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,130
This is for putting on bread. It will melt but it's not enough.

1247
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:59,500
I see.

1248
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,570
What will you make with this?

1249
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:04,840
Cheese fondue.

1250
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,840
Cheese fondue? That's amazing.

1251
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,750
The old lady doesn't know such luxurious cuisine.

1252
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,210
Round bacon.

1253
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,510
Not exactly round. It should be a slab of bacon.

1254
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:14,580
This is a bacon slab.

1255
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,050
We only have a big one.

1256
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:21,940
What about this slab? Will it do?

1257
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,500
Okay, please this one.

1258
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,620
No, this is ham.

1259
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,350
It's ham.

1260
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,260
Will loin ham do?

1261
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,790
She's so embarrassed that she can't stand it.

1262
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,000
This is for toast.

1263
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,930
Whatever. She just wants to leave.

1264
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:34,870
It turned into ham and cheese toast.

1265
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,750
But she was able to go to the checkout properly.

1266
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,270
Hurry, hurry. I want to go home.

1267
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,240
I see. She's too shy.

1268
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,640
She can't even lift her eyes.

1269
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:47,780
She knows that she got the wrong things.

1270
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,680
She does?

1271
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,860
She knows it's no good.

1272
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:55,720
She's not even holding Momoka's hands.

1273
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,850
Oh no no.

1274
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:58,760
Oh, I see.

1275
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,820
This is ham.

1276
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,960
The mother isn't scolding them but greeting them warmly.

1277
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,660
But it's no good. She won't go back.

1278
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,420
I'm embarrassed.

1279
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,420
It's fine because you did your best so far.

1280
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,670
I will buy bacon for you.

1281
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:12,670
Is that alright?

1282
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,400
Momo will you go?

1283
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,400
Yep.

1284
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,320
Momoka will be useful again.

1285
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,540
Well see ya later then.

1286
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,800
Momoka.

1287
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:28,840
Momoka is always cool as a cucumber. She can do anything.

1288
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,570
She will be soaking by the end of the day.

1289
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,260
Momoka come back.

1290
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,260
What is it?

1291
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,790
I want this kind of cheese.

1292
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:38,410
For the Halloween party this won't be enough cheese.

1293
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:42,400
Momoka won't understand. I better go with her.

1294
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,140
There you go.

1295
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:52,890
The big sister didn't take the shortcut for her sisters sake this time.

1296
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,210
They've walked through this door so many times today.

1297
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,690
Welcome.

1298
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,680
Don't lose to your shyness.

1299
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,910
Was it wrong?

1300
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,850
Sorry to hassle you, old lady.

1301
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,120
We need a bacon slab.

1302
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,040
Where do you have bacon slabs?

1303
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,040
You want a bacon slab?

1304
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,360
What about this one from before? The big one?

1305
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:33,850
This is the right one. No doubt.

1306
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,750
That's great.

1307
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,200
The big sister is finally laughing.

1308
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,670
This slabs.

1309
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,590
And the cheese was wrong too.

1310
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,110
She's riding on a high.

1311
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,930
Right right.

1312
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,820
This small one.

1313
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:48,820
That's right. That's the one.

1314
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:51,600
With this they can make cheese fondue.

1315
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,550
I did it.

1316
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,960
Returning the wrong things and purchasing these. Perfect.

1317
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,180
She has overcome her shyness.

1318
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,160
She's smiling now.

1319
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,480
Thank you very much.

1320
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,480
Thank you very much.

1321
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,290
She was even able to properly show gratitude.

1322
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,290
It's done now.

1323
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,570
How nice. A proper big sister.

1324
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:15,160
A face full of pride.

1325
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,200
The big sister takes the shortcut.

1326
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,150
I'm going this way.

1327
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:25,870
They are both walking different paths.

1328
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,710
The mother is wondering why they are separated.

1329
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:32,610
But it's okay.

1330
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,480
Going each their own way they will still make the same memory of this errand.

1331
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,330
"I want to be helpful."

1332
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,070
She really did her best.

1333
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:50,290
Welcome back. What's with that expression.

1334
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:48,910
She's grinning.

1335
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:54,460
This. This. This is it.

1336
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,630
You did well carrying this heavy thing.

1337
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:58,640
Welcome back Momo.

1338
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,000
Welcome back. Enter. Enter.

1339
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,690
Please enter.

1340
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:07,660
Thank you for helping me so much.

1341
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,860
To be helpful towards your mother.

1342
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,050
I did try it.

1343
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,970
Ah Momo, get your thank you hug.

1344
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,650
Thank you.

1345
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:16,650
You and your sister did well together.

1346
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:19,320
The uprocessed milk from Momoka

1347
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,490
melted with her sister's cheese.

1348
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:25,600
Cheers.

1349
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,120
As a Halloween specialty: "Pumpkin cheese fondue".

1350
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,050
Looks good.

1351
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,550
Their friends also came while all dressed up.

1352
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:33,950
That's right.

1353
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,910
The bacon is delicious.

1354
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,910
Their big brother agrees.

1355
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:38,810
She overcame and bought it.

1356
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,940
She was able to help everyone out.

1357
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,750
Yeah, we poured all of Momo's milk into it.

1358
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:47,200
You are such a helpful child.

1359
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,000
Also Momo.

1360
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,660
Both of them love being sung their praises.

1361
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,760
Right?

1362
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,760
What a nice party.

1363
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:02,050
Right?

1364
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:02,050
What a nice party.

1365
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,270
Splendid.

1366
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,520
Both of them are really well behaved.

1367
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,120
She said unprosshd.

1368
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,120
Unprosshd.

1369
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,540
- If you say unprosshd in the milk aisle in can only mean unprocessed.

1370
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,540
- That's right.

1371
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:16,060
Suzu, if you had a little sister like that...

1372
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:21,440
5 year older brother and
4 year older sister

1373
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:22,020
I really thought that it was like my relation to my brother and sister.

1374
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:26,610
The idea that the sister was without any fear.

1375
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,790
While the big sister looks out and is serious.

1376
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,260
She thinks about the bigger perspective?

1377
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,260
That's right.

1378
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:40,870
I have a big brother and our grandparents really were affectionate with me.

1379
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:40,360
2 year older brother

1380
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:45,140
They would take me out every day like department stores

1381
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,580
or Japanese confectionary shops.

1382
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,730
So it's all their fault how I've turned out.

1383
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:55,600
Fault? Don't you mean thanks to them?

1384
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,600
Yeah, thanks to them.

1385
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,490
Yeah, thanks to them.

1386
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:58,440
Speaking about grandchildren

1387
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,690
both you, Tokoro, and Ito have them.

1388
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,590
You will do anything they ask you to?

1389
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:04,590
Of course.

1390
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:07,100
The heck are you saying?

1391
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,330
The same is true for me.

1392
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,070
Nothing hurts when it comes to grandchildren.

1393
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:11,400
No matter what they do to you.

1394
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,340
Being hit.. like...

1395
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,210
being stabbed with a toy sword.

1396
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,370
Nothing beats that.

1397
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:21,380
Nothing hurts.

1398
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:26,070
Miyagi ● Matsushima City

1399
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:26,260
The sunrise in one of the three beauty spots of Japan

1400
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,720
Matsushima where you can also see the Shiogama shrine

1401
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,310
a tradition that has been carried on for over 1200 years.

1402
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:37,940
It's a shrine that draws attraction from all over Touhoku.

1403
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,480
It's this amazing on the first day after New Year.

1404
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:40,680
It's bustling.

1405
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:44,120
In the past, only men of the Date clan were allowed to climb this.

1406
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:48,510
It is here, they will climb these stone steps as their first errand.

1407
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,610
The steps
stretch far here.

1408
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,080
But it's a great view.

1409
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:57,610
Children aged 3, 5 and 7 have come to visit on this autumn day.

1410
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,770
The boy who will go on an errand lives at a candy shop.

1411
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:05,340
It's like living in a dream.

1412
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,290
To be surrounded by a ton of toys every day

1413
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:11,140
Ramune, fugashi and dried apricot sticks.

1414
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,730
It's like heaven.

1415
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,300
The boy to envy is Naoki.

1416
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:18,770
He's always energetic and his favorite game is to play house.

1417
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,360
The one appearing here is....

1418
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,360
Morning.

1419
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,610
It's his girlfriend, Seina.

1420
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,150
A month older, at 3 years and 11 month old

1421
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:33,420
they've known each other from birth.

1422
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,990
Let's go.

1423
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,760
Don't go too far.

1424
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,260
We were asked by daddy to visit the shrine and purchase a charm.

1425
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:44,780
Nao.

1426
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,800
Do you know of any good charms?

1427
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,550
To smoothen things.

1428
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,330
Huh? Ah yeah what was it...

1429
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:53,090
What type of charm is that?

1430
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:56,570
To smoothen things.

1431
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:56,570
To smoothen things? Is there one like that?

1432
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,040
The very popular charm at Shiogama shrine.

1433
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,380
A charm to smoothen things.
Could be useful for the errand.

1434
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,510
A charm to smoothen things.

1435
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,750
- What if you went together?

1436
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,750
- Will you go?

1437
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,720
I could even go by myself.

1438
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,690
No way you could.

1439
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:11,620
Yes, I can.

1440
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,520
What are ya saying.

1441
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,590
Okay but...

1442
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:17,890
Can you go along with Seina? The two of you.

1443
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:20,500
Yeah...

1444
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:23,580
Here are two charms.

1445
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,580
Hidden mic charms.

1446
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,390
This one.

1447
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,390
Boys prefer blue.

1448
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,810
Huh!? He wants the red one?

1449
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:31,640
Do you know what's on it?

1450
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,860
Touch yours to Seina's.

1451
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,690
How nice.

1452
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,750
So please get along all lovey-dovey.

1453
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,290
All lovey-dovey.

1454
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:47,270
The soy sauce shop is at the foot of the shrine.

1455
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:51,410
they were asked to get round-shaped konjaku called Tama-kon.

1456
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:57,030
Then it is a 202 stairs climb up Omotesando.

1457
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:00,270
*It was a hill only men of the Date clan were allowed to climb.

1458
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:04,500
Mens' climb: The steeper one.
Womens' climb: The least steep one.

1459
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:02,670
Then they enter the grounds to purchase the charm.

1460
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:08,650
On their way back they will go down the women's climb.

1461
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,510
Do you know which hill to go up?

1462
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,720
The male climb.

1463
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,280
And what about the return?

1464
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:15,570
The female climb.

1465
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:18,020
As expected from a local boy.

1466
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,960
I've started craving dango.

1467
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,960
That's nice.

1468
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,160
Will you then go and buy some?

1469
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,160
Yeah.

1470
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,470
This adds a new errand. Dango, enough for 5.

1471
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:29,280
Oh my.

1472
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,870
Who will command the male climb?

1473
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:31,850
Seina.

1474
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:33,850
Seina will command the steep climb?

1475
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,590
Who will command the female climb?

1476
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:35,970
I will.

1477
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,720
Nao will? Isn't it reversed?

1478
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,630
Commanding officers do your best.

1479
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,580
Hoping to get along. Smooch.

1480
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:48,230
Off you go.

1481
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:49,350
We will rely on you.

1482
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:15,810
The long-established soy sauce shop.

1483
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:17,910
Huh? The bamboo blinds are down.

1484
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,170
Here perhaps?

1485
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,470
Is it locked?

1486
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:21,970
Ah, must be closed today.

1487
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,590
It's before the opening hours.

1488
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:28,090
They haven't opened? Let's tell mama.

1489
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,090
Too early.

1490
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:31,630
Nao, please wait.

1491
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,100
Don't run.

1492
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,100
Since they came all the way.

1493
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:37,600
Ah, we must get the dango first.

1494
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,570
They're running back and forth.

1495
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,310
Will they have enough stamina for the climb?

1496
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,330
Right at that moment the shop is opening up.

1497
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,730
It's good that they went back.

1498
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,600
Huh? It's opening now?

1499
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,280
They were early.

1500
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,220
"Phew, we made it" the camera man thought.

1501
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:58,120
What do you want?

1502
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,990
I want that.

1503
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:01,090
Round konjyaku?

1504
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,330
How many do you want?

1505
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:04,160
The always reliable Seina.

1506
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,830
3 please.

1507
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,830
3? Alright.

1508
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:08,030
Do you want it in a bag?

1509
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:10,320
Yes, to go.

1510
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,470
So adult-like.

1511
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:12,600
She's amazing.

1512
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,540
The Tama-kon steeped in soy sauce are only sold on holidays.

1513
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,110
How nice.

1514
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,930
Smells nice.

1515
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:22,200
Here.

1516
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,420
I will take the 500 yen. Please wait.

1517
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,780
Since it's cold outside

1518
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,040
please have one each.

1519
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,890
The traditional preparation of konjac that has been steeped in soy sauce.

1520
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,680
Delicious.

1521
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,390
That's right.

1522
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:42,070
Leaving the soy sauce shop they have a steep climb ahead.

1523
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:46,020
Kids love to run.

1524
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:51,310
It was delicious.

1525
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,310
Yep.

1526
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:53,510
The dango shop is next.

1527
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:53,510
Yep.

1528
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:55,280
And the charm.

1529
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:57,810
This is it.

1530
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,350
202 steps.

1531
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:00,750
202 steps.

1532
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,440
Just as they said. It's 202 steps.

1533
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,020
Not an easy climb even for adults.

1534
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,230
Are you scared?

1535
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:12,500
I'm not scared.

1536
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,600
Please hang in there.

1537
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,520
I will.

1538
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:17,220
He's making her carry it.

1539
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:18,330
I have no power.

1540
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:19,590
What about Seina?

1541
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,290
And she's the girl.

1542
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,290
I do have power.

1543
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,290
Where is the power?

1544
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:24,660
Nao is losing.

1545
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,790
It's a guarding lion-dog.

1546
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,030
Guarding lion-dog.

1547
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:29,810
But he's still buzzing full of words.

1548
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:32,280
It's a guarding lion-dog.

1549
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,120
He knows a lot.

1550
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:35,440
Hurry, let's go up.

1551
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,040
A guarding lion-dog.

1552
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,120
Next let's go this way.

1553
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,670
It's easier to go this way.

1554
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,740
Is it?

1555
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:44,230
I will climb this way.

1556
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:45,860
It's smarter the other way.

1557
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,230
It's easier this way.

1558
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,430
It's easy, see!

1559
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:52,300
It's not easier.

1560
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:56,290
Nao is climbing the area where people stand to view the portable shrine.

1561
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:00,710
I'm full of vigor.

1562
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,710
Tough!

1563
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,410
Just a bit more.

1564
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:04,500
Not even close.

1565
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:07,970
Seina is climbing the stairs

1566
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:11,640
while Nao is climbing the area where people stand to view the shrine.

1567
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,470
I'm full of vigor.

1568
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:17,560
The 202 step climb to Shiogama shrine.

1569
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,830
It would even exhaust adults.

1570
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,630
Wait. Don't leave.

1571
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:23,580
What?

1572
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,690
Seina also ended up giong that way?

1573
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:27,700
She did?

1574
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,390
Today you win, okay?

1575
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:32,140
They get along so well.

1576
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,550
It's a horse!

1577
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:37,410
Don't run!

1578
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,460
It's a horse!

1579
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,550
A horse is there?

1580
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:41,220
It's a cow, though.

1581
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,720
It was a cow.

1582
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,050
A cow.

1583
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:47,060
I wonder if we can get a balloon.

1584
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:51,080
Wonder if Seina understood Nao's wish to get one.

1585
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,910
She did.

1586
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,170
Nao also got one.

1587
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:57,970
How great.

1588
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:01,000
Yellow.

1589
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,840
I wanted a pink one.

1590
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,730
Go get one yourself.

1591
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,910
We have to put money in, right?

1592
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,750
Yes, money.

1593
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:11,750
It's saisen.

1594
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:14,080
We give all of our money, right?

1595
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:14,980
No.

1596
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:17,900
Seina puts 500 yen in.

1597
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:19,610
And Nao?

1598
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:22,710
There we go...

1599
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:24,330
Next...

1600
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:26,430
It doesn't ring...

1601
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:27,250
Huh.

1602
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,750
It won't ring.

1603
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,220
He doesn't have the power.

1604
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,700
Seina is thinking.

1605
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,300
Ring ring

1606
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,170
Ring ring ring

1607
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:37,610
Nao, it rang.

1608
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,940
Okay.

1609
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,610
Okay.

1610
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,190
That was good.

1611
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,810
Let's go. Next is the charm.

1612
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,230
I see.

1613
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:46,620
Let's get one.

1614
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:48,680
They will buy a charm.

1615
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:53,190
What a grand atmosphere.

1616
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,830
It's a wedding.

1617
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:58,580
How nice.

1618
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:00,750
To be able to honor your ancestors.

1619
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,930
Thinking that they might stand by and watch...

1620
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:04,500
It's this one.

1621
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,170
They weren't even watching it.

1622
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:06,540
Not at all.

1623
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,600
Not even a bit.

1624
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,870
To smoothen things.

1625
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:11,960
See?

1626
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,240
They can read?

1627
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,340
Let's buy this.

1628
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:16,210
Seina bought the charm to smoothen things.

1629
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:26,040
There are so many cute girls.

1630
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,620
He's a boy after all.

1631
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,260
I wanted a pink one.

1632
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:35,830
He's still harping on that.

1633
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,180
Nao, please don't run, okay?

1634
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,000
Seina is getting tired.

1635
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,370
Dango shop.

1636
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:43,510
Don't run!

1637
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:47,040
You were told not to run, weren't you!

1638
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,560
He's being told so many times.

1639
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,680
Nao, you will trip.

1640
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:51,480
Ah!

1641
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,550
There are so many!

1642
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,030
He's sprinting.

1643
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:54,980
Cotton candy too.

1644
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,820
Yay, so much.

1645
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,110
The adults can't keep up.

1646
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,520
What about the dango?

1647
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,720
Look!

1648
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,560
Dango.

1649
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,030
There's so much.

1650
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,030
Won't you purchase dango?

1651
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:07,280
They sell the masks at your home, don't they?

1652
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:09,750
They were asked to get dango for 5 people.

1653
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:12,800
Dango, please.

1654
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:12,800
Dango, please.

1655
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,520
With this kind of money.

1656
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,710
You were given this much money?

1657
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,140
And...?

1658
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,740
3 boxes? 2 boxes?

1659
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,810
Or 5?

1660
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:24,410
Yep, 5 boxes.

1661
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:24,800
Wouldn't 5 be a wee too heavy to carry?

1662
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,230
We can.

1663
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,250
I see. Roger that.

1664
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,770
Won't 5 be a bit too heavy?

1665
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:32,740
Seina is worried.

1666
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:38,430
We will eat for two.

1667
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,200
And then we bring it to our mamas.

1668
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,530
That would be nice.

1669
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:42,170
I see...

1670
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,430
They were planning to eat them all there?

1671
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:48,400
If they both eat and take 3 back with them.

1672
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,910
Looks nice.

1673
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:53,240
We thought of a nice thing.

1674
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,240
What nice thing?

1675
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,040
If we eat for two and for out moms...

1676
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,040
If we eat for two and for out moms...

1677
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,300
A present?

1678
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:58,300
Yep.

1679
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,780
I see. You will only eat your portion. Got ya.

1680
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,300
Right?

1681
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:10,240
For mama and papa, right? I'm writing
a letter to them so please wait.

1682
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,700
She's writing a receipt.

1683
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:18,000
This old lady will hold them for you so please give them

1684
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,350
since you plan on eating dango first.

1685
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:24,920
If the wind blows hard they will fly away.

1686
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,230
That's right. Which is why this old lady will hold them.

1687
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:29,610
Please wait.

1688
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:32,150
But what if you forget them?

1689
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,150
It's fine. I won't forget.

1690
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:33,950
He's afraid she will keep them.

1691
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:37,200
This is your spare change cause you gave me 3000 yen.

1692
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,360
Tell them you purchased 5.

1693
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,560
And the two of you will eat your part, right?

1694
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:42,560
Wow!

1695
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,440
So this is a freebie for your hard work.

1696
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,250
Since you are such good kids.

1697
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:48,230
Who understood it?

1698
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:49,900
We did!

1699
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,430
I love this dango.

1700
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:53,670
Thank you so much old lady.

1701
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:55,090
Grace.

1702
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,320
What about saying grace.

1703
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,340
Grace.

1704
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:59,340
Grace.

1705
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,590
Grace.

1706
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,590
Grace.

1707
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,410
Thanks to you the two of them are enjoying themselves.

1708
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:05,650
How nice.

1709
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,070
Two warm teas, please.

1710
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:11,520
He loves dango.

1711
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:14,860
Um, how delicious.

1712
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:16,490
Mama is waiting...

1713
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:20,200
Just like the old lady the dango has a kind taste.

1714
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:23,780
How nice.

1715
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,970
Is this free service?

1716
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:25,970
Yes.

1717
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,910
Thanks for the meal.

1718
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:34,480
Thanks for the meal.

1719
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:34,480
Thank you very much.

1720
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,650
They properly said "thanks for the meal".

1721
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:41,620
Since the dango they ate were freebies they are bringing 5 back.

1722
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:43,570
Cotton candy.

1723
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:43,970
Looks heavy.

1724
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:45,670
They have cotton candy and masks.

1725
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:49,140
Don't they sell lots of masks at the shop where Nao lives?

1726
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,830
You forgot something.

1727
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:55,830
The balloons!

1728
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:58,430
This old lady forgot.

1729
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,270
So close.

1730
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:59,590
Just like he said.

1731
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,590
They did forget it.

1732
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:04,170
I can only hold 2.

1733
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:04,170
Hold 1 and she will hold 1.

1734
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:08,640
Glad she didn't have to chase them down the stairs.

1735
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:08,860
Excuse me.

1736
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:11,110
How many yen are these?

1737
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:12,580
One is 100 yen.

1738
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,480
I will get one for 100 yen.

1739
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,790
Despite them selling so many at home.

1740
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,190
It's still tempting.

1741
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:22,060
Not the blue, he likes the red one.

1742
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:25,040
I will get this one.

1743
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,760
They have those at home too.

1744
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,170
Must be different to him.

1745
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,400
It's so loud.

1746
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,210
Want to do it?

1747
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,750
This is the smaller slope of higashisando.

1748
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:46,780
Please go slow.

1749
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:48,100
The cameramen are tired too.

1750
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:53,460
Huh, what's going on?

1751
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,310
It's fine. Thanks.

1752
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:56,810
He called out to the cameraman.

1753
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:59,500
This one is so loud.

1754
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,180
Nice chance. Make use of the time.

1755
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:06,670
Meanwhile the cameramen are running ahead.

1756
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,840
This must be tough.

1757
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,820
Wait.

1758
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,010
Wait.

1759
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:16,330
We were able to get a shot from the front.

1760
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:18,500
Nao, you might trip.

1761
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:22,170
Our mamas must be worrying.

1762
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:29,640
Errand errand how fun.

1763
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,500
A dango order coming up.

1764
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,330
It's Shiro from next door.

1765
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,770
Shiro you can't eat the dango.

1766
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,340
He's not even saying anything.

1767
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:43,320
Go... errand...

1768
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,720
They've arrived home.

1769
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,840
I'm tired by now.

1770
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:48,840
Yeah.

1771
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:55,230
They didn't fall once and now that they are here.

1772
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,200
Oh no, the tama-kons.

1773
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:01,520
The tama-kons...

1774
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:02,790
It's fine if they just wash it.

1775
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:07,250
Mothers, the two of them did it all the way without any hiccups.

1776
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,850
Let's wash and eat them.

1777
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:14,620
Since the soy sauce has permeated it.

1778
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,220
Did you buy a charm?

1779
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:18,220
What's with this balloon?

1780
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,810
How come?

1781
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,290
Did you buy it?

1782
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,300
Let's eat them together!

1783
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,650
Nao is the one who settled things.

1784
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:27,970
It's delicious.

1785
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,090
I ate one of these.

1786
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,720
Did you eat dango there?

1787
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:36,360
Huh. How unfair.

1788
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:40,850
They went on their first errand in 2008.

1789
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:43,170
9 years later

1790
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:44,880
from the errand when they were 3.

1791
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,950
Shiogama was hit by the Great East Japan Earthquake

1792
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:51,570
People had to evacuate to the hilltop shrine.

1793
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:55,980
Seina and her family moved to Kanagawa prefecture after the earthquake.

1794
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:59,100
In all those years it's the first time that she has returned.

1795
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:05,170
First year students of junior high school.

1796
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:05,700
Seriously?

1797
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,700
They've become so big.

1798
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,390
They still get along.

1799
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,910
It rings this time.

1800
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,530
Their moms are best friends so they'll always have a connection.

1801
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:22,570
Since they've come all this way they better get a charm to smoothen things.

1802
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:24,810
How nice.

1803
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:30,310
As junior high students what do they wish will go well?

1804
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,620
What do you wish will go well?

1805
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,330
Club activity and study.

1806
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,320
Study?

1807
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,770
Studying doesn't matter.

1808
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:40,640
What's he saying? Actually Nao is performing well in his studies.

1809
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,660
He's completely into tennis after school.

1810
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,370
"Please, only edit in the good parts" he told us.

1811
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:57,020
Something he's more into is...

1812
01:15:57,020 --> 01:16:00,860
He wants to become a pâtisserie when he grows up.

1813
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:06,230
Once he heard that Seina was coming he's been making cakes since morning.

1814
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:12,220
With various decorations.

1815
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:13,370
So?

1816
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:16,040
Wonder which one is for Seina.

1817
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,550
Huh? One of them is special.

1818
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,900
This one is for Seina.

1819
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:28,200
It's actually Seina's birthday tomorrow.

1820
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:32,270
Surprising her with two gifts, eh? I see...

1821
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:33,790
Amazing.

1822
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:37,010
Seina is in the brass-band club.

1823
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:39,930
She's playing the biggest instrument: The tuba.

1824
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:40,220
Looks heavy.

1825
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:43,490
After trying out several students she was able to play it best.

1826
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:46,740
She's been playing since junior high school.

1827
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:49,540
Before that was karate, gymnastics, swimming.

1828
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:54,480
An instrument that requires force and lung capacity. A true match for Seina.

1829
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:59,050
To carry a 10 kilo tuba lightly

1830
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,240
That's heavy.

1831
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:04,610
and to make it look fun during performances.

1832
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,380
She's practicing that right now.

1833
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:14,030
During the earthquake, it caused a tsunami so great...

1834
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:16,900
that it carried tour boats, docked in the marina, onto land.

1835
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,970
The two don't bring those times up.

1836
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:23,510
The dango shop used to be right there.

1837
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:24,330
And then...

1838
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,500
You sure grew up.

1839
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:29,050
The old lady has also become quite old.

1840
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:31,720
It's been a long time.

1841
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,200
How has everything been?

1842
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,200
Good.

1843
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:37,170
It's been such a long time since you tried my oden.

1844
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:39,340
These oden will be a freebie.

1845
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,390
Thank you very much.

1846
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:43,280
Thank you for coming and visiting me.

1847
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:47,150
I've made these.

1848
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:49,590
He decided they will eat them at the dango shop.

1849
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:50,850
Amazing.

1850
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:53,120
Please eat the one you like.

1851
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:57,210
I don't know if they taste good.

1852
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:58,760
Incredibly delicious.

1853
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,360
He won't give her the birthday special?

1854
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,130
Huh. That's true.

1855
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:05,230
What about the birthday present?

1856
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:07,300
I forgot to bring it.

1857
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,690
That can't be.

1858
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:09,960
It finally came out.

1859
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:10,910
Really?

1860
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:14,740
Can't be helped. And he woke up early because of it.

1861
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,950
When we get back.

1862
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:16,950
When we get back?

1863
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:19,620
This is Naoki who hasn't changed.

1864
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,100
What was he thinking?

1865
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:21,100
At such an important time.

1866
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,600
His store managed to be spared, but...

1867
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:28,540
the seawater came up to waist height and many of the shops were severely damaged.

1868
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,180
This. This.

1869
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:31,990
The important thing.

1870
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:38,300
It's a bit early but happy birthday.

1871
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,300
Thank you very much.

1872
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:41,200
It's made from choco-chip banana.

1873
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,210
Thank you very much.

1874
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:45,120
Why are you speaking so formal?

1875
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,610
This awkward distance is normal for first year junior high students.

1876
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:50,610
Nice.

1877
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,100
I got really nervous.

1878
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:03,080
Just like Naoki all boys that age when they get excited they run around a lot.

1879
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,790
She told him: "Don't run!"

1880
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:07,560
He's so energetic.

1881
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:10,050
Apropos Miyagi Prefecture, Sandwich Man you...

1882
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,970
That's right, it's my home area.

1883
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:12,030
Yeah, your home area.

1884
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:12,030
I often go to Shiogama.

1885
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:14,170
Does it bring up some memories?

1886
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:19,320
When I was in kindergarten and living in Ishinomaki

1887
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,580
there was a butcher not close by.

1888
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:25,010
I was told to go get 500 g. minced meat.

1889
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:26,520
I went by myself.

1890
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,200
And when I arrived at the butcher

1891
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,590
I said: "Please give me 500 g. of muscle."

1892
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:37,460
I was told to go back and ask again.

1893
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:41,450
And on the way back there was a big street that I had to cross.

1894
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:44,970
And as I put my hand up to cross a taxi stopped by.

1895
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:47,840
When a child rasies their hands

1896
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,120
it's not to hail a ride.

1897
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:53,310
I remember it vividly.

1898
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:57,730
What do you think about the chance
if your kid could go on an errand?

1899
01:19:57,730 --> 01:20:00,830
I want to let them but I'm also afraid.

1900
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:04,390
I would probably dress up like the staff here and follow him.

1901
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:09,040
Yeah, the parents must be so worried.

1902
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:09,040
That's right.

1903
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:13,200
But there will be a day when they
have to be allowed out on their own.

1904
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:17,950
A father who has made this decision is here today.

1905
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:20,730
Special Guest will appear

1906
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:20,740
Everyone, let's welcome him.

1907
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:24,040
Papa, please enter this way.

1908
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,840
Please enter.

1909
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:32,870
Pro-boxing's former WBC World Bantamweight Champion

1910
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:36,770
Yamanaka Shinsuke.

1911
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:40,390
Yamanaka papa who was the strongest in the world.

1912
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:42,640
Will send his children on an errand.

1913
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:47,530
Heave ho!

1914
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:49,770
He's different from inside of the ring.

1915
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:50,620
I beg of you.

1916
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:52,630
He's riddled with anxiety.

1917
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,950
Totally worried.

1918
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:18,810
You will continue to be moved.

1919
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:22,030
A first errand in the harsh nature of Hokkaido.

1920
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:26,300
A girl who gives it her all even in the face of challenges.

1921
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,740
A whirlwind of emotions from the studio!

1922
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,560
Let me introduce you to

1923
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:40,880
the former WBC bantamweight world champion: Yamanaka Shinsuke.

1924
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,440
Pleased to be here.

1925
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:43,440
Welcome.

1926
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:47,660
You made your young go on an errand.

1927
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:47,660
Amazing.

1928
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,960
How was it?

1929
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,860
I never imagined this day would come.

1930
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:55,930
My wife and I were in high spirits...

1931
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:57,130
We were however...

1932
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:58,650
just before the shooting

1933
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:02,640
we were so anxious.

1934
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:02,640
That makes sense.

1935
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:07,890
4 days in advance we thought "it might not be possible".

1936
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:11,750
Please let's not do it.

1937
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:15,380
We didn't have the confidence.

1938
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:17,600
And you haven't seen the footage, have you?

1939
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,720
Of course not.

1940
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,120
This is gonna be interesting.

1941
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:21,120
Anxious

1942
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,530
Please face camera 2 and

1943
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:27,060
introduce the clip, please.

1944
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:30,750
While my heart is beating fast, please enjoy this clip.

1945
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,470
The pro-boxer Yamanaka Shinsuke

1946
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:46,880
famously nicknamed "God's Left".

1947
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:51,690
He defended the world title 12 times in a row.

1948
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:54,620
The "God's Left" is strong.

1949
01:22:55,240 --> 01:23:00,010
For 5 years and 9 months he didn't lose once.

1950
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:01,650
For such a man...

1951
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:05,300
His first son was born merely 5 years ago.

1952
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:20,220
Gousuke

1953
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,460
When Gousuke was born

1954
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,650
his father was already a world champion.

1955
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:23,320
This is Gousuke.

1956
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:29,820
Ririno

1957
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:27,370
Winning and being able to hold my kids in the ring gives me great joy.

1958
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:29,830
I'd still like to continue with one or more of these.

1959
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:32,430
Just like he said.

1960
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:34,200
Papa continued to win.

1961
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:36,720
Let's play when we get home, okay?

1962
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,000
Let's play.

1963
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Congratulations.

1964
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,550
And the kids.

1965
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:45,260
They grew outside of the ring.

1966
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,510
Congratulations papa.

1967
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:50,280
While defending his championship for 12 consecutive times.

1968
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:54,080
Gousuke became 4 years and 4 months old.

1969
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:58,320
And then during August last year.

1970
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:03,790
Where he had to defend the title for the 13th time.

1971
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:07,260
"God's Left" Shinsuke.

1972
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:11,070
They had come to support outside of the ring.

1973
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:13,200
Gousuke and Ririno.

1974
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:17,260
Alright, round 4.... Hard left!

1975
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:20,830
Right! Left! He's backing up!

1976
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,260
The champion is backing up!

1977
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,760
What is this!? My goodness!

1978
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,280
What should I say? Oh my God!

1979
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,730
Just keep swinging!

1980
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:29,220
The champion swings back!

1981
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:31,170
The towel is thrown!

1982
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,820
My God! Yamanaka Shinsuke...

1983
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,860
on the verge of a Japanese record...

1984
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:38,230
loses by TKO!

1985
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,310
Papa lost.

1986
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:46,100
It's the first time seeing that.

1987
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:49,490
The memory of God's Left will never be lost on fans.

1988
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:51,670
This can never be forgotten.

1989
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,260
Shiin-suke! Shiin-suke!

1990
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:58,630
It's the first time experiencing the hardships of a loss since his birth.

1991
01:24:58,930 --> 01:25:02,020
The same as dad, no no, even more so.

1992
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:03,870
That day...

1993
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:06,300
he decided that he would fight along with papa.

1994
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:09,720
The gong in Goutske's heart rang that day.

1995
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:11,960
After the match.

1996
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,900
Q: What will you do next?

1997
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:23,290
I haven't thought about that.

1998
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,540
Boxer Yamanaka began to avoid the media.

1999
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:32,080
When he said he had lost, his son responded:

2000
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,220
"But papa did his best 12 times".

2001
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:36,490
Gousuke consoled him.

2002
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,990
2 months after that match.

2003
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:43,180
The staff of "My First Errand"

2004
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:46,700
came to meet Yamanaka in his training room.

2005
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:50,000
Good morning.

2006
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,000
Good morning.

2007
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,080
May I intrude?

2008
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:53,080
Yes, please.

2009
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:58,090
The fact that you lost, I think Gousuke

2010
01:25:58,090 --> 01:26:02,340
feels the same amount of hardships over it as you.

2011
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:05,180
He suddenly said:

2012
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:10,750
Papa, next time I think you will win.

2013
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:16,260
That rang in my ears.

2014
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:19,430
Those words sound great.

2015
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,250
The kids want one more time

2016
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:26,670
to be taken to that place again.

2017
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:31,370
Yamanaka finally made the decision.

2018
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,880
Yamanaka held a press conference.

2019
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,350
Does that mean that you will continue being active?

2020
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:41,350
Yes. Yes.

2021
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,730
Once more

2022
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,890
I want it to be thought that Yamanaka

2023
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:47,840
still packs a punch with his left.

2024
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:50,430
I want to win.

2025
01:26:51,690 --> 01:26:54,330
It was his kids that made him go back to the ring.

2026
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:58,530
And as a thanks he wants to bring his kids back to the ring.

2027
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:01,200
The thing that Yamanaka thought of

2028
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:05,070
is a first errand

2029
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:07,410
that he will have both of his children go on.

2030
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:12,300
Ririno is a sweetheart who leaves everything to her big brother.

2031
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:17,500
She uses her tears to get what she wants.

2032
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:22,960
Gousuke has a sense of justice but he gets distracted sometimes.

2033
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:25,830
The day before the errand.

2034
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:28,560
The couple pay a visit to the shrine.

2035
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:37,160
He always comes to pray before his match.

2036
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:41,530
For my childrens first errand

2037
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:44,880
I hope they make it out safe.

2038
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:47,230
I beg of you.

2039
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,650
Staff: Are you nervous?

2040
01:27:49,650 --> 01:27:51,350
I really am.

2041
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:53,540
But it will feel good in the end.

2042
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:54,640
That's right.

2043
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:57,560
It's like with boxing.

2044
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,080
Errands are like that too.

2045
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:04,920
And now it's finally the day of the errand.

2046
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,570
Yamanaka papa brought up the topic.

2047
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,140
Both of you go buy... get this fixed.

2048
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:11,810
Um.

2049
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:11,810
Got it.

2050
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:13,220
Go go!

2051
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:14,610
Oh-!

2052
01:28:14,610 --> 01:28:16,610
And the errand has started.

2053
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,380
Ey ey oh.

2054
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,680
See you.

2055
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:21,180
Bye bye.

2056
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:21,180
Be careful. For real.

2057
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:22,350
Yeah.

2058
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:25,190
I will go for a run.

2059
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,190
Okay.

2060
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:26,960
Got it.

2061
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,790
I'm asking you.

2062
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:28,790
Yep.

2063
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:32,330
Father, that's the eye of a champion.

2064
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:33,460
That face reveals worry.

2065
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:36,260
Too worried.

2066
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:36,260
He's so worried.

2067
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:38,030
I made that expression?

2068
01:28:39,030 --> 01:28:42,170
It's not only Yamanaka papa who has to do their best.

2069
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,670
It's best to do you best.

2070
01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:47,290
Exerting herself in the harsh nature of Hokkaido.

2071
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:49,430
Even the studio is moved to tears.

2072
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:51,110
You did your best.

2073
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,190
The errand that the father asked them to go on.

2074
01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:03,390
To get the broken scale fixed by a repair shop.

2075
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:07,010
The scale is in Gousuke's backpack.

2076
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,400
Many bicycles are coming.

2077
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:11,970
Two of them.

2078
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:12,750
Responsible big brother.

2079
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:15,840
He is able to do the traffic safety check.

2080
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,240
Looking right, then left

2081
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:21,110
even though they get confused which is which.

2082
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:21,660
That happens.

2083
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:23,780
But it's fine today. They didn't make a mistake.

2084
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,080
I've practiced so many times.

2085
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,880
I probably got it.

2086
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:28,880
That's right.

2087
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,750
They've walked this path many times with your mom and dad.

2088
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:33,640
What great siblings.

2089
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:35,720
It's fine, isn't it.

2090
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:35,720
Yes, it is.

2091
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:39,890
And in no time they've arrived at the big street.

2092
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:44,080
Checking right and left and...

2093
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,090
go. No need to worry daddy.

2094
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,670
Was it okay?

2095
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:51,670
Completely fine.

2096
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:53,110
Did they do it right?

2097
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:53,680
For real?

2098
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:54,310
They did. Yes.

2099
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,310
I'm just full of wondering

2100
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:03,920
if I forgot to teach it to them properly.
If I forgot something.

2101
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,790
But it's fine.

2102
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:08,020
Forgetting the father who is worrying by himself.

2103
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:10,790
The two of them are proceeding on their route.

2104
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:14,990
You are noisy.

2105
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:18,700
Hey, Riri. Behave!

2106
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:23,200
Riri always ends up crying when the two of them are fighting.

2107
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,460
But she won't cry today.

2108
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,830
She's holding it in.

2109
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:30,900
Because her charm says: "Ririno won't cry!!"

2110
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:36,500
She's looking at it and deciding not to cry.

2111
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,460
On her brothers' it says: "You are strong"

2112
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:42,820
So he's not just about arriving.

2113
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:44,710
Come.

2114
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:47,230
He makes sure to bring his sister with him.

2115
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:47,230
Come.

2116
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:51,800
Me too.

2117
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,590
I will go work.

2118
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,900
Running is his job.

2119
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,990
To become a champion again

2120
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:02,290
he needs to redo his training.

2121
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:06,920
Oh, they made it.

2122
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,920
They are crossing here.

2123
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,640
It's not here.

2124
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,120
He's not crossing here?

2125
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:15,240
It's there. Can you see it?

2126
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:18,390
There is another crossing ahead.

2127
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:20,460
There.

2128
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:23,310
From the convenience store.

2129
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:25,250
There are several crossings.

2130
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:28,170
Their mother has showed them various crossings.

2131
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:30,790
But Gousuke doesn't remember.

2132
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:32,590
Not yet.

2133
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:34,040
It's green.

2134
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:37,410
But they are crossing at just the right one.

2135
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:43,120
Despite the big brother always running ahead...

2136
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:45,670
not today.

2137
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:48,520
That's why Ririno won't cry today either.

2138
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:51,990
I can't fathom it.

2139
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:51,990
Really?

2140
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:56,970
This is the shopping street from the supporting hometown of Yamanaka.

2141
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:00,100
This is the shopping street.

2142
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,740
You got it?

2143
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,740
Yep.

2144
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:06,270
There's a small crying girl walking in front of them.

2145
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,480
Really resembles Riri.

2146
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:13,920
Really resembles Riri.

2147
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,720
Though she usually cries she won't today.

2148
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:18,620
Bakery.

2149
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:22,120
Uuh, smells nice.

2150
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:24,830
They usually drop by but not today.

2151
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:26,730
Don't kid around.

2152
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:28,800
Because today is...

2153
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,550
Going on an errand.

2154
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:33,480
their first errand, you see?

2155
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:35,650
What a sense of responsibility.

2156
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,710
Denka Land.

2157
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:41,540
They've arrived at the electronics store.

2158
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:45,060
The cameraman is waiting inside.

2159
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:49,470
Papa's picture is on display.

2160
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,550
So cool.

2161
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:52,970
For real. It's papa.

2162
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:55,890
Good day.

2163
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,890
Good day.

2164
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:59,390
Thank you for the continued support.

2165
01:32:59,390 --> 01:33:02,130
Thank you for the continued support.

2166
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,660
Amazing.

2167
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,200
How amazing.

2168
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:06,050
After the greetings they take out the scale.

2169
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:07,900
This.

2170
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:07,900
What is it called?

2171
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:11,710
This scale is broken so please repair it.

2172
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:12,940
He carried this heavy thing.

2173
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:12,990
Repair?

2174
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:15,260
Yes. He was able to say it properly.

2175
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:16,430
How about it?

2176
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:18,400
Can it be fixed easily?

2177
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:22,030
Ah, the battery is missing.

2178
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:23,300
Battery?

2179
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,270
The battery is missing?

2180
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:27,710
Since there is no battery I will put one in.

2181
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:29,910
So it was just missing a battery?

2182
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:32,640
So there was no need to bring it?

2183
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,050
For real.

2184
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,050
For real.

2185
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:37,130
Alright, try to step on it.

2186
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:40,640
Yep, seems fine.

2187
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,640
That's right. It was the battery.

2188
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,640
50 yen, that's right.

2189
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,920
Papa is being shown.

2190
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:49,110
I hope this is not from the other day?

2191
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:50,700
It's papa.

2192
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:50,700
It's papa.

2193
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,010
How great.

2194
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:54,180
It's from his winning match.

2195
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,420
Gouchan, where's papa today?

2196
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:59,850
I was asked to go on an errand.

2197
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,850
Ah, you were asked to go on an errand.

2198
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:02,160
Remarkable the two of you came.

2199
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:02,160
Yep.

2200
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,830
He will have another match, right?

2201
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:06,660
Thank you for your continued support.

2202
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:10,100
Thank you for your continued support.

2203
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,100
We are the grateful ones.

2204
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,280
Hope he does his best.

2205
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:11,850
Yep.

2206
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:11,850
Yep.

2207
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:14,100
Gouchan, hope you also support him.

2208
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,100
Yep.

2209
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:16,150
When it comes to daddy's matches

2210
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:17,940
he comes to watch.

2211
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,570
It has been repaired

2212
01:34:34,570 --> 01:34:35,960
and they did the greetings

2213
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:39,890
and they paid the bill.
The did everything perfectly.

2214
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:43,000
At that time the father is...

2215
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,280
Hello?

2216
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,360
Phoning
his
wife.

2217
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,370
He's fidgeting.

2218
01:34:47,370 --> 01:34:50,740
When you get home

2219
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:53,290
He's rummaging around.

2220
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,740
Do it properly!

2221
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:56,180
Yep.

2222
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,510
I was thinking about how to set it up.

2223
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,320
He's planning to put them on a different errand.

2224
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:05,640
200 g. of tenderloin and some shoulder roast?

2225
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,640
Like that?

2226
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:11,440
While he's planning that the kids are coming home.

2227
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,280
We are almost back home.

2228
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:16,400
They are already at their limits.

2229
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:20,550
Forget the tenderloin...

2230
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:20,550
He's still contemplating.

2231
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:22,590
Make a decision!

2232
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:24,470
You had to include this?

2233
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:24,470
Yes we did.

2234
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,040
Here it is.

2235
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:28,460
They are already in.

2236
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:31,050
We're home.

2237
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:31,050
What?

2238
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:34,000
Papa, we are home.

2239
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:34,000
That's really amazing.

2240
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,780
Yep.

2241
01:35:35,050 --> 01:35:35,920
What?

2242
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,750
You were able to do it?

2243
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:37,750
Yep.

2244
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:38,820
Amazing.

2245
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,710
How was it?

2246
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:44,210
The father is in utter disbelief.

2247
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:45,960
What did you say?

2248
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:48,130
The scale is broken

2249
01:35:48,130 --> 01:35:49,330
please repair it.

2250
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:50,330
You said that?

2251
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:51,470
How amazing.

2252
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:52,780
I can go on errands now.

2253
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:53,750
How amazing.

2254
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:56,240
Alright, check the scale.

2255
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,370
Will it turn on?

2256
01:35:57,370 --> 01:35:59,240
Is it connected?

2257
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:02,040
Now papa can continue to do his best.

2258
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:05,660
Papa weighs himself 4 times a day.

2259
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:07,820
61.9

2260
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:09,820
That's right.

2261
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,150
From here on...

2262
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:13,890
For when mama comes home

2263
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:15,720
let's make fried rice.

2264
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,980
This is round 2 of the errand.

2265
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,340
Gousuke.

2266
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:21,340
There's no spring onion.

2267
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:21,930
Will it be alright, papa?

2268
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:24,350
And we also don't have rice.

2269
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:25,400
We do have rice.

2270
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:28,390
We have rice and eggs but

2271
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:31,290
we don't have spring onion and
without it we can't make fried rice.

2272
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:33,070
Here we go.

2273
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:34,210
Spring onions and

2274
01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:37,710
to make papa stronger

2275
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:38,900
meat is missing.

2276
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,160
To become stronger?

2277
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,870
I got it.

2278
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:43,520
Leave it to me.

2279
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,970
The brother can do it.

2280
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:45,550
Alright

2281
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:49,060
In round 2 he has to pay attention to Ririno.

2282
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,080
About the spring onion.

2283
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,560
The spring onion is Gousuke.

2284
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,610
I will leave it up to you.

2285
01:36:55,610 --> 01:37:00,330
So the Ririno's responsibility will be

2286
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:02,340
the tenderloin.

2287
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:03,920
And then...

2288
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,590
the thing both of you like

2289
01:37:05,590 --> 01:37:06,520
shoulder roast.

2290
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,810
Shoulder roast?

2291
01:37:07,810 --> 01:37:10,090
Meat from the shoulder.

2292
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:13,310
Yes, also get the meat from the shoulder roast.

2293
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:14,120
Do you remember?

2294
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,780
Yep.

2295
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:19,320
I remember.

2296
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:20,220
Alright what should you say when you arrive at Takagi Meats?

2297
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:22,760
The worried father is double-checking.

2298
01:37:26,490 --> 01:37:28,430
Gousuke, do you remember?

2299
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:31,420
Tenderloin and shoulder roast.

2300
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:32,520
And the shoulder roast?

2301
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:35,270
200 grams.

2302
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:36,970
As expected from Gousuke.

2303
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:39,840
If Riri doesn't remember

2304
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:43,540
Gousuke will give a hint to Riri.

2305
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:44,760
You got it?

2306
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:47,010
By tapping her shoulders etc.

2307
01:37:47,010 --> 01:37:48,650
And saying "tend.."

2308
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:49,380
Tenderloin.

2309
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:51,750
Like saying the "tend" in "tenderloin".

2310
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:53,120
Saying the "tend" of "tenderloin".

2311
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,710
If you say that then Riri might remember.

2312
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:57,910
Now it's practice time.

2313
01:37:57,910 --> 01:38:00,190
When you arrive at Takagi Meats.

2314
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:01,730
Spring onion, please.

2315
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:02,860
Also have to get onions.

2316
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:03,610
Yep.

2317
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:06,570
And Riri what will you say?

2318
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:07,570
"Tend" "Tend".

2319
01:38:07,570 --> 01:38:09,570
Tenderloin please.

2320
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:10,790
And what else?

2321
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:13,610
Tapping her shoulder.

2322
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:16,110
Shoulder roast.

2323
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:18,510
Right right. Just like that.

2324
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:19,720
However...

2325
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:20,560
Can they do it.

2326
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:24,490
The dad did perfect training for the second round.

2327
01:38:24,490 --> 01:38:27,300
Oh no, it's scary. One more time.

2328
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:28,760
It's alright.

2329
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,510
What will you buy, Gousuke?

2330
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:31,690
Spring onion.

2331
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:34,300
And Riri?

2332
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:35,600
Tenderloin and

2333
01:38:36,230 --> 01:38:38,350
aaaaand...

2334
01:38:38,650 --> 01:38:40,070
Shoulder roast.

2335
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:41,200
That's right.

2336
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:41,800
That's enough already.

2337
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,700
Alright. Say it one more time.

2338
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:44,410
Yet again.

2339
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:45,620
How many times.

2340
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:48,540
Alright, say it one more time.

2341
01:38:47,110 --> 01:38:48,540
Eeh...

2342
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:49,780
And how ever many times.

2343
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:50,710
Do you remember?

2344
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:52,280
Say it one more time.

2345
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:53,310
Eeh.

2346
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:56,750
He has knocked them out. What a champion.

2347
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:57,450
Do your best.

2348
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:59,500
We already got it.

2349
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:59,500
You got it?

2350
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:01,110
Do you feel like doing your best?

2351
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:01,110
He wants perfection.

2352
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:03,520
Because of his anxiety he allows no slip-ups.

2353
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,980
This is how a world's best does it.

2354
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:07,130
Alright, we are heading off.

2355
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:10,930
Be careful of all the cars and bicycles.

2356
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:13,470
Riri, I'm begging you.

2357
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:15,090
What was it again?

2358
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:16,620
He's still doing it?

2359
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:17,640
Tenderloin.

2360
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,170
You should just go then.

2361
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,110
Shoulder roast.

2362
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,540
This is the 15th time.

2363
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:21,110
That's right.

2364
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:22,640
Okay.

2365
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,280
He finally said okay.

2366
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:27,210
Leave it to me.

2367
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:28,370
Believe in him.

2368
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,740
Alright. Do your best.

2369
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:34,640
They've finally been allowed to depart.

2370
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:37,530
Be careful of the cars.

2371
01:39:38,530 --> 01:39:39,660
And bicycles.

2372
01:39:39,330 --> 01:39:41,450
It's like before a boxing match.

2373
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:47,250
If they don't scurry away he will make them do it again.

2374
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:49,170
He's too intense.

2375
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:50,570
His stare is amazing.

2376
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:00,550
I wonder if it will be fine.

2377
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:00,820
Of course it will.

2378
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:02,400
If you were to compare it to boxing?

2379
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:02,650
It's alright.

2380
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:03,650
Well...

2381
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:04,840
with boxing I'm full of confidence before a match.

2382
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:08,360
with boxing I'm full of confidence before a match.

2383
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:11,960
Now I'm full of worry.

2384
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:14,080
Takagi meats.

2385
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:30,640
Takagi meats.

2386
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:31,810
We've arrived.

2387
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,300
We are here.

2388
01:40:33,810 --> 01:40:35,380
Tenderloin please.

2389
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:37,180
It's too fast.

2390
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,840
She said tenderloin right away.

2391
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,690
Tenderloin please.

2392
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:41,010
Yes.

2393
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,160
Tenderloin please.

2394
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:44,780
And the other thing?

2395
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,460
Your father...

2396
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:50,730
Shoulder roast please.

2397
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:50,730
Alright.

2398
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:52,250
How much?

2399
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:52,580
Cause they did it 15 times.

2400
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:54,440
She was able to say both.

2401
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:56,350
200 grams.

2402
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:58,610
200 grams.

2403
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,610
200? Okay please wait.

2404
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:02,110
The two of them are a nice combination.

2405
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:03,890
See? Right on the mark.

2406
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:06,080
Right on the mark.

2407
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:09,080
The shoulder roast is for the kids.

2408
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:13,670
And 100 gram of the luxurious tenderloin is for their father.

2409
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:16,570
It's high on power but low on fat.

2410
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:19,630
He often eats it prior to matches.

2411
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:22,500
And spring onion.

2412
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,360
And what?

2413
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,330
Spring onion.

2414
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:24,330
Spring onion?

2415
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:25,030
And spring onion.

2416
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:27,050
Ririno was able to do her errand.

2417
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,970
Now it's his part.

2418
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:32,070
The big brother was able to do all this.

2419
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:34,510
One please.

2420
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:36,910
With this papa will be ecstatic.

2421
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:39,910
Yay.

2422
01:41:40,410 --> 01:41:42,850
I can do errands now!

2423
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:47,200
It's the brothers responsibility to pay.

2424
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:48,490
Please wait.

2425
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,230
Since this is 2500 yen

2426
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:52,680
I will go get your change.

2427
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:53,930
Gousuke.

2428
01:41:53,930 --> 01:41:58,150
He has become a reliable man in no time.

2429
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:00,000
Please hold this.

2430
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:03,470
Ririno takes care of carrying the groceries.

2431
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:05,220
Come come.

2432
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:07,440
Please take care.

2433
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:07,440
Yep.

2434
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,240
Alright...

2435
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,230
Father is waiting at home.

2436
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:13,050
They are becoming adults.

2437
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:16,350
The street to go home is that way however...

2438
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,440
Where is Gousuke going?

2439
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,310
If we go that way will we return?

2440
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,430
Yep.

2441
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:29,050
The cameramen are now running in the opposite direction.

2442
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:29,660
What happened?

2443
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:32,820
Are they going to the park?

2444
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:36,040
Despite having made it this far.

2445
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:36,620
Where are they going?

2446
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:42,140
While holding Ririno's hands Gousuke is heading towards...

2447
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:44,350
Okay, shrine.

2448
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:45,880
The shrine!

2449
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:50,020
Their father always comes here before a match.

2450
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:52,340
Do not run.

2451
01:42:56,890 --> 01:42:58,060
Gousuke.

2452
01:42:58,310 --> 01:43:00,490
What will he wish for?

2453
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:09,720
Hold this.

2454
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:19,050
Let's hope that father wins his matches again.

2455
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:21,050
How amazing, big brother.

2456
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:25,770
Phew.

2457
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:28,020
He loves his parent.

2458
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:43,900
Gousuke did the errand to his best so that his father can win his next match.

2459
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:45,250
So irresistible.

2460
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:53,100
Wondering why Riri was able to do it today without crying.

2461
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:57,620
I love papa's cooking.

2462
01:43:57,620 --> 01:43:59,470
Right, Gouchan?

2463
01:43:58,670 --> 01:43:59,470
Yeah.

2464
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:01,060
Is that right?

2465
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:03,460
She wanted to eat your father's cooking.

2466
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,800
Both of their errand has been perfectly carried out.

2467
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:12,970
That's right. Cause they rehearsed 15 times.

2468
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:15,020
We are almost there.

2469
01:44:15,670 --> 01:44:17,270
Sparta upbringing.

2470
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:21,610
Yay, we did our best.

2471
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:21,610
Yay, you did your best.

2472
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:25,430
We are home.

2473
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:27,200
We are home.

2474
01:44:26,410 --> 01:44:27,200
Did you do it?

2475
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,000
He's so anxious.

2476
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:29,000
The way he says "eeh!?".

2477
01:44:28,070 --> 01:44:29,200
Did you?

2478
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:30,780
Thank you.

2479
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:32,850
Papa.

2480
01:44:31,450 --> 01:44:32,850
Amazing.

2481
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,170
How amazing.

2482
01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:37,140
I'm so surprised.

2483
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:39,060
At Takagi meats.

2484
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:40,260
You were able to go?

2485
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,260
Thank you. Come here.

2486
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:45,700
You two are amazing.

2487
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:45,480
How great.

2488
01:44:47,470 --> 01:44:48,740
I'm so happy.

2489
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:49,720
Gousuke.

2490
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:52,090
Riri. I'm happy.

2491
01:44:52,090 --> 01:44:53,060
Thank you.

2492
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:54,640
Thank you.

2493
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:54,640
Thank you.

2494
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:55,790
Thank you.

2495
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:58,130
He cuts the spring onions using the "God's left".

2496
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:04,550
Actually since becoming a pro

2497
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:06,850
he's been working part-time at a Ramen joint.

2498
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:09,240
Skillful movement.

2499
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,760
The 1200 yen 100 grams of tenderloin.

2500
01:45:14,130 --> 01:45:15,380
Looks good.

2501
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:16,930
And at that moment.

2502
01:45:16,930 --> 01:45:18,530
I'm home.

2503
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:19,820
Mama.

2504
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:20,770
It's their mother.

2505
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:21,900
It smells good.

2506
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:23,990
It's fried rice.

2507
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:28,680
Pork shoulder roast and lots of spring onion fried rice.

2508
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,890
Looks delicious.

2509
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:32,260
Their fathers cooking is like a pros.

2510
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:37,120
And as the soup is also ready.

2511
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:39,700
Thank you for the meal.

2512
01:45:40,490 --> 01:45:44,490
This is the famous daddy's fried rice that he hasn't been able to make recently.

2513
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:47,580
Delicious.

2514
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:51,230
It's the best.

2515
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:51,840
Delicious.

2516
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:55,300
For this errand mom worked behind the scenes.

2517
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:57,710
The meat is delicious too.

2518
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:00,140
He ate the meat.

2519
01:46:00,390 --> 01:46:01,390
Gousuke.

2520
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:03,890
He usually doesn't eat meat.

2521
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,900
Ririno eats anything.

2522
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:09,920
Aaah, delicious.

2523
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:11,890
Papa can do his best again.

2524
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:12,720
Yep.

2525
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:12,720
Right?

2526
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:14,290
I will become strong again.

2527
01:46:14,290 --> 01:46:15,910
For the next match.

2528
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,890
One more time?

2529
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:17,890
Yes, I will fight again.

2530
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:19,260
We did it.

2531
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,060
Let's do this.

2532
01:46:22,150 --> 01:46:25,330
Hey hey ho!

2533
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:26,770
Riri.

2534
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:28,170
It's with your left.

2535
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:30,120
That's your right arm.

2536
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:32,170
Do it with your left.

2537
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:33,440
This one.

2538
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:35,740
That's right. With the "God's left".

2539
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:37,310
Papa will do his best from here on.

2540
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:39,930
Let's go. Hey hey ho!

2541
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:41,150
With a bigger voice.

2542
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:44,440
Hey hey ho!

2543
01:46:42,670 --> 01:46:44,650
He always makes them do it many times.

2544
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:48,290
Yamanaka gains his strength from... his family.

2545
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:51,830
Bringing both of them in the ring

2546
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:55,850
he will soon again be embracing the two like this.

2547
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:04,040
You did it.

2548
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:07,140
The rice looks delicious.

2549
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,790
Yamanaka papa.

2550
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:08,790
Yes.

2551
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:10,710
First time seeing this. How is it?

2552
01:47:10,830 --> 01:47:15,180
I understimated my son and daughter.

2553
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:17,970
You made them do it 15 times.

2554
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:17,970
That was too much.

2555
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:21,190
This is just how parents feel.

2556
01:47:21,190 --> 01:47:22,460
When you look at the clip

2557
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:31,250
you get a clear sense that they got it however

2558
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:33,370
and I made them do it many times but

2559
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:35,300
I still feel like they didn't get it.

2560
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:37,170
For real?

2561
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:40,270
They got it by the 2nd or 3rd time.

2562
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:42,710
It was excessive.

2563
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:46,280
Even looking at it I was surprised at how persistent I was.

2564
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:48,920
You really are persistent.

2565
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:55,090
Since Riri practiced it 15 times the moment the doors open she shouted "tenderloin".

2566
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:57,090
You overdid it.

2567
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:57,090
As the doors were sliding.

2568
01:47:58,230 --> 01:48:01,650
When they went to the shrine to pray

2569
01:48:01,650 --> 01:48:05,530
and said "hope papa will win" and how they were holding hands.

2570
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:07,180
I felt so good looking at this imagery.

2571
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:08,700
That's right.

2572
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:13,370
I didn't think I would cry while watching this clip.

2573
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:15,510
You could cry at any point.

2574
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:15,510
That's right.

2575
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:16,980
Alright dad,

2576
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:20,450
you have an important match coming up. Are you prepared for it?

2577
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:23,530
Since my son and daughter did their best

2578
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:26,040
next is my turn.

2579
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:26,040
That's right.

2580
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:27,370
You better do.

2581
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:30,760
We will be supporting you.

2582
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:30,760
Thank you very much.

2583
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:33,490
Ah, it's snow.

2584
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:35,150
An errand while waiting for spring.

2585
01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:38,050
With -20°C in the middle of winter.

2586
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:41,080
The frozen plain of Shikaoichou in Hokkaido.

2587
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:42,780
Hokkaido ● Shikaoichou

2588
01:48:41,070 --> 01:48:42,890
From November to April

2589
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:45,420
the ground remains covered in snow.

2590
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:49,880
The Tokachi Plain was first settled 120 years ago.

2591
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:53,150
People used axes and saws...

2592
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:57,890
to cut through the thick growth of bamboo grass and oak trees turning it into farmland.

2593
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,750
What an amazing thing.

2594
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:01,270
Anything that can be done will be done by the people themselves.

2595
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:06,590
That spirit from the pioneer days is still rooted in their daily lives.

2596
01:49:06,830 --> 01:49:09,710
And the long winter comes to an end by the end of April.

2597
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:12,150
Farmers get busy at once.

2598
01:49:12,850 --> 01:49:16,450
Fields, as far as the eye can see, all belong to them.

2599
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:19,210
They've lived here for 100 years.

2600
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:22,930
This is an errand among huge agricultural fields.

2601
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:27,380
Their farmlands are larger than Tokyo Disneyland.

2602
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:30,470
Cabbage, wheat, potato and more.

2603
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:33,140
It's another world, like a storybook.

2604
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:37,670
Here lives Mirei and Kaori who are siblings that get along.

2605
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:41,130
The proper big sister and the shrewd little sister.

2606
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:44,250
They help out in the fields every day.

2607
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:47,600
They are given a lot of freedom by their mother.

2608
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:50,020
They know no fear of strangers.

2609
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:51,370
Which means...

2610
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:58,860
at Mirei's house people come to learn about Hokkaido's agriculture from China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.

2611
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:01,650
People come to study from all over the world.

2612
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:05,300
They eat with the trainees

2613
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:07,870
and they live like a family.

2614
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:12,310
And next to the log cabin where everyone eats is their home.

2615
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:16,100
Today they are making food for 12.

2616
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:18,230
They better go on an errand.

2617
01:50:18,750 --> 01:50:21,870
We have to prepare the stew already.

2618
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:21,870
Yes.

2619
01:50:22,290 --> 01:50:23,490
Daikon.

2620
01:50:23,490 --> 01:50:25,910
They are making homemade stew for lunch.

2621
01:50:26,290 --> 01:50:30,960
Daikon, onions, carrots.
All ingredients are from their farm.

2622
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,650
What else do we need?

2623
01:50:32,850 --> 01:50:33,980
Don't we need potatoes?

2624
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:35,820
Ah, we do.

2625
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:35,820
Yes, we do.

2626
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:37,700
Will you get it at the storage?

2627
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:37,700
Yes.

2628
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:38,640
Which means...

2629
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:41,510
Ah, good luck charms!

2630
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:43,810
First their errand is to the snow storage.

2631
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:46,940
Today is both of yours job.

2632
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:48,510
That's right. This isn't a game.

2633
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:52,630
What's inside the good luck charm?

2634
01:50:50,930 --> 01:50:52,630
Mama's feelings.

2635
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:53,400
Show it.

2636
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,940
No way I can show that. That's too embarrassing.

2637
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:00,390
To commemorate this day

2638
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:02,390
she made them yesterday.

2639
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,310
Heavy.

2640
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:04,310
Is it heavy?

2641
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:07,110
Mama's heart is really heavy, right?

2642
01:51:07,110 --> 01:51:08,250
Right? It's pretty heavy.

2643
01:51:08,370 --> 01:51:09,950
I can't stand this.

2644
01:51:09,950 --> 01:51:11,590
It also has Shiji's feelings in it.

2645
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:14,140
She will give birth to a younger brother next month.

2646
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:17,170
Do you job right or I will be angry.

2647
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,760
Don't play around.

2648
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:21,630
The mother moved here from Kyoto after marriage.

2649
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:25,770
She has placed her children in the care of the majestic nature of Hokkaido.

2650
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,080
I'm relying on you.

2651
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,320
Alright.

2652
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:28,320
Please do.

2653
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:29,200
Alright.

2654
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:31,290
One Two One Two

2655
01:51:31,290 --> 01:51:34,730
They are looking for their father to open the snow storage.

2656
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:37,710
I wonder if papa is around.

2657
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:37,710
I wonder if papa is around.

2658
01:51:39,030 --> 01:51:39,650
There.

2659
01:51:40,250 --> 01:51:41,380
Asparagus.

2660
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:42,480
Papa.

2661
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:43,350
Growing it on your own is so nice.

2662
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:43,530
What's up?

2663
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:45,620
Please open the snow storage.

2664
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:47,000
Why?

2665
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:51,440
Because mama told us to get potatoes.

2666
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,040
Weren't there any in the fridge?

2667
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:53,790
Nope.

2668
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:57,130
And we got good luck charms.

2669
01:51:57,930 --> 01:52:01,270
And mama's feelings are inside.

2670
01:52:01,270 --> 01:52:02,650
And mama's feelings are inside.

2671
01:52:02,650 --> 01:52:03,340
See.

2672
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:05,340
Must be really heavy.

2673
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:07,810
Because your mom does her best.

2674
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:09,390
Doing her best.

2675
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:12,430
And we will do our best getting the potatoes.

2676
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:19,890
This is all is needed for happiness.

2677
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:20,700
That's right.

2678
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:21,570
It's like an anime.

2679
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:25,010
The snow storage uses natural snow to freeze things.

2680
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:29,200
The air inside is so refreshingly cold.

2681
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:30,250
Where is it?

2682
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:31,650
Over here.

2683
01:52:31,650 --> 01:52:32,670
Here.

2684
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:37,540
At the snow storage the potatoes have been set aside for half a year

2685
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:39,990
which makes them really sweet.

2686
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:42,830
Even if you ask for just a little bit.

2687
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:45,010
This is the portion.

2688
01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:46,530
It's heavy.

2689
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:47,780
That's enough.

2690
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:49,320
This is Hokkaido!

2691
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:50,720
Let's carry it together.

2692
01:52:49,950 --> 01:52:51,050
Looks heavy.

2693
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:53,490
They carry it together.

2694
01:52:55,110 --> 01:52:57,120
Since I have work to do please carry it.

2695
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:57,970
Yes.

2696
01:52:57,970 --> 01:52:59,990
The two of them can carry it together.

2697
01:53:00,110 --> 01:53:02,060
Kaori will be back.

2698
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:04,330
Where is Kaori heading?

2699
01:53:05,650 --> 01:53:08,690
Kaori is running.

2700
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:10,140
Why is she running?

2701
01:53:10,050 --> 01:53:11,540
She doesn't want to carry them?

2702
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:14,570
It always ends up like this.

2703
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:17,890
Mirei carries the burden

2704
01:53:17,890 --> 01:53:20,360
while her sister does what she wants to do.

2705
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:22,700
One could say that she's stubborn.

2706
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:26,440
She will shout when things aren't going well.

2707
01:53:27,150 --> 01:53:30,790
If you don't hurry up and help then they will scold you, Kaori.

2708
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:32,630
Kaori, hold here.

2709
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:33,510
Yes.

2710
01:53:33,630 --> 01:53:35,750
One two and go.

2711
01:53:35,950 --> 01:53:38,500
That's right. Now both of them are carrying it.

2712
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:40,470
Heavy ho, heavy ho.

2713
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:42,470
Both of you carry it.

2714
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:44,670
Heavy ho, heavy ho.

2715
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:49,510
If they can do this they can also go to the neighbors.

2716
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,560
Mama.

2717
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:51,560
Yes.

2718
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:54,360
We brought it.

2719
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:54,360
Thank you.

2720
01:53:54,450 --> 01:53:55,570
It was heavy.

2721
01:53:55,570 --> 01:53:58,120
You really helped out. Wow, you brought so many.

2722
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,670
What else does our stew need?

2723
01:53:59,670 --> 01:54:01,620
Now is the errand for real.

2724
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:04,440
Oh that's right. We don't have any milk.

2725
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:07,530
Can you get some from Mana's mother?

2726
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:09,130
Mana's house is a dairy farm.

2727
01:54:09,130 --> 01:54:11,670
They always get milk in a pot.

2728
01:54:13,170 --> 01:54:16,250
Go to Mana's and get it half filled up.

2729
01:54:16,590 --> 01:54:18,390
Since it will be heavy half is fine.

2730
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:21,420
To avoid spillage the lid can sit on tight.

2731
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:22,760
Furthermore...

2732
01:54:23,610 --> 01:54:25,610
Also get sausages from the "Warm cafe".

2733
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:28,220
It's pretty far away.

2734
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:29,650
Mi you're the milk minister.

2735
01:54:30,020 --> 01:54:31,650
You're the Minister of Milk.

2736
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:32,550
And what about me?

2737
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:34,350
You will be the minister of Sausages.

2738
01:54:34,350 --> 01:54:35,760
Yes.

2739
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,320
Delegating the important tasks.

2740
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:37,420
Promoted to minister.

2741
01:54:39,010 --> 01:54:41,360
Fatty sausage.

2742
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,360
That's right, fatty sausage.

2743
01:54:41,390 --> 01:54:42,500
Kao can say it.

2744
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:42,810
Four of them.

2745
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:44,500
That's right four. Four fatty sausages.

2746
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:46,720
She has learned her numbers recently.

2747
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:50,920
They will get milk at their neighbors'.

2748
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:52,920
Which is about 1 kilometer away.

2749
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:56,910
And the closest shop is 2 kilometers away.

2750
01:54:56,910 --> 01:55:00,210
Where they will get 4 packs of sausages.

2751
01:55:00,210 --> 01:55:02,000
- Hokkaido is so big.

2752
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:02,000
- Huge.

2753
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:03,070
Heading off.

2754
01:55:03,070 --> 01:55:07,300
If they don't get it before 8 the pickup truck will be there ahead of them.

2755
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:08,840
They better hurry.

2756
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:12,660
I have the duty of a mother towards you.

2757
01:55:12,730 --> 01:55:14,540
Heavy ho. Heavy ho.

2758
01:55:13,630 --> 01:55:14,540
Heavy ho.

2759
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:17,330
Errand. Errand. Err

2760
01:55:17,330 --> 01:55:18,130
Heavy ho.

2761
01:55:18,130 --> 01:55:18,900
Wait.

2762
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:20,430
Say: Errand. Errand.

2763
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:23,370
Errand.

2764
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:23,370
Errand.

2765
01:55:23,370 --> 01:55:26,310
Kaori is bringing potatoes as thanks.

2766
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:28,890
And her sister is bringing the pot.

2767
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:30,080
Do your best.

2768
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:33,050
If we don't hurry the milk truck will leave.

2769
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:37,780
Mana's house

2770
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:34,860
At this pace they will make it.

2771
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:37,780
They can't see a sign of the big truck yet.

2772
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:40,670
Mama.

2773
01:55:40,890 --> 01:55:41,940
Kaori.

2774
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:43,510
Mama.

2775
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:44,890
She's becoming homesick.

2776
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,690
You can't go after all.

2777
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:48,900
Jeez.

2778
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:52,650
Kaori, you are my little sister.

2779
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:54,990
Since you are my little sister act properly.

2780
01:55:55,150 --> 01:55:57,340
Mana's house is straight ahead.

2781
01:55:57,550 --> 01:56:01,980
I wanna go by bicycle.

2782
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:01,980
No good.

2783
01:56:02,530 --> 01:56:05,360
The three wheeled bike is for people who can't walk.

2784
01:56:06,530 --> 01:56:08,110
That's only for adults.

2785
01:56:08,850 --> 01:56:11,480
What about this kid. Can't they walk?

2786
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:12,720
Yep.

2787
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,320
Yes, this person can't walk.

2788
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:18,650
Veteran staff member

2789
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,410
The old man and old lady

2790
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:18,660
they usually can't walk.

2791
01:56:17,710 --> 01:56:19,690
The old man and lady.

2792
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:20,260
Got it?

2793
01:56:20,860 --> 01:56:22,900
That's why a three-wheeler

2794
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:24,900
is faster but

2795
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:26,900
She was curious.

2796
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:26,900
Let's go.

2797
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:29,590
The two young ones started walking.

2798
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:32,010
Inside of the good luck charm

2799
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:35,680
mom's heart and the gods are in it.

2800
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:37,840
The gods?

2801
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:37,840
Yes.

2802
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:40,850
Kaori loves the gods.

2803
01:56:40,850 --> 01:56:43,920
Right? That's why I'm telling you to run.

2804
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:46,590
I will run now.

2805
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:47,840
See? You've become energized.

2806
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:50,240
See? You've become energized.

2807
01:56:49,210 --> 01:56:50,240
Yep.

2808
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:53,640
And as they've become energized and all is fine...

2809
01:56:54,630 --> 01:56:56,950
Miiilk and...

2810
01:56:55,810 --> 01:56:57,550
It's so far.

2811
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:58,970
potatoes

2812
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:02,620
While it has become Spring it's still only 3°C.

2813
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,560
The weather is rather volatile.

2814
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:08,070
Everything is tasty.

2815
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:09,330
This is amazing.

2816
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:11,290
Over here.

2817
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:13,290
Mana's house is a lifestock farm.

2818
01:57:12,580 --> 01:57:13,960
They've finally arrived.

2819
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:15,960
They always get their milk from here.

2820
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:18,320
They have a great neighborly relationship.

2821
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:20,890
This house also delivers the neighborhood circulars.

2822
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:23,090
Mana's mama.

2823
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:24,840
Mana goes to the same kindergarten.

2824
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:27,390
Kaori delivers the cold-stored potatoes.

2825
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:31,060
Here it is. Potatoes.

2826
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,060
You brought potatoes?

2827
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:32,500
Fill it half up

2828
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:34,230
with milk, please.

2829
01:57:34,230 --> 01:57:37,200
Half filled with milk. Let me pour some.

2830
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:40,670
Mana's place is a dairy farm of the latest style.

2831
01:57:40,670 --> 01:57:42,240
We made it.

2832
01:57:43,090 --> 01:57:45,580
The cows go the milking machines by themselves.

2833
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:50,070
And as they go round like a merry-go-round they will be completely milked in no time.

2834
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:53,020
And this freshly squeezed milk

2835
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:56,110
is collected in a tank in the adjacent room.

2836
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:01,310
Ew.

2837
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:02,110
Hey! Hey!

2838
01:58:02,110 --> 01:58:03,900
It's warm here.

2839
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:06,000
Big sister with the compliment.

2840
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:08,020
It's fine with this much.

2841
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:10,650
It's so cold outside that the lens is getting foggy.

2842
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:13,190
They asked for half so that they can carry it.

2843
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:15,210
It's pouring.

2844
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:16,580
I see.

2845
01:58:16,810 --> 01:58:19,180
That's why they're using a pot.

2846
01:58:19,310 --> 01:58:21,200
Who poured this?

2847
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:24,870
By gathering it from the cows it adds up to this.

2848
01:58:25,150 --> 01:58:26,690
This is fine.

2849
01:58:26,690 --> 01:58:28,790
Too much and it becomes too heavy.

2850
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:30,010
That's right.

2851
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:30,520
That's enough.

2852
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:35,530
The condensation from the fresh milk is covering the lens.

2853
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:38,570
Let's bring it home.

2854
01:58:39,630 --> 01:58:42,400
The made it before the 8 o'clock truck arrives.

2855
01:58:42,690 --> 01:58:45,260
As expected from the minister of milk responsibilities.

2856
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:47,340
Next are the sausages.

2857
01:58:47,610 --> 01:58:48,090
Huh?

2858
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,480
What about the milk?

2859
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,360
- Huh?

2860
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,360
- The milk?

2861
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:52,210
What will you do about this?

2862
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:53,710
Aren't you gonna bring it?

2863
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:55,520
Please keep it for now.

2864
01:58:56,050 --> 01:58:57,370
She will keep it?

2865
01:58:57,800 --> 01:59:02,260
When we come back please hand it over.

2866
01:59:02,790 --> 01:59:04,610
Where are you going now?

2867
01:59:05,090 --> 01:59:06,560
The "Warm cafe".

2868
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:09,660
The two of them are here.

2869
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:14,550
Going to the closest shop the "Warm cafe" is all the way over there.

2870
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:19,210
I see. It's better to leave the milk
in their care and take it on the way back.

2871
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:19,490
That's better.

2872
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,270
We are heading off.

2873
01:59:21,270 --> 01:59:24,690
We will fill this bag up with sausages.

2874
01:59:24,690 --> 01:59:26,690
This is the minister of sausages.

2875
01:59:26,690 --> 01:59:27,780
Yes, 4 packages.

2876
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:28,630
Bye bye.

2877
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:31,890
Hurry up, minister.

2878
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:34,590
They will be back.

2879
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:38,580
It was a great success.

2880
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:40,440
They also gave the potatoes

2881
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,310
and the pot is ready for pickup.

2882
01:59:42,310 --> 01:59:44,310
They finally feel agile.

2883
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:45,350
They've become light.

2884
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:48,400
At that moment.

2885
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:52,560
The truck that takes the milk.

2886
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:55,590
How great. How great.

2887
01:59:56,740 --> 01:59:58,850
How great.

2888
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:02,370
Today is great.

2889
02:00:02,370 --> 02:00:05,130
Kaori is dragging behind.

2890
02:00:06,150 --> 02:00:09,090
Michan, I'm tired.

2891
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:09,090
I see.

2892
02:00:09,090 --> 02:00:10,320
Let's hold hands.

2893
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:12,530
This way.

2894
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:14,030
Jeez.

2895
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:17,210
Despite their age difference their personalities are similar.

2896
02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:21,570
Even though Kaori can do it she pretends not being able to.

2897
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:24,190
The little sister likes to be treated sweetly.

2898
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:26,240
Let's go all the way there.

2899
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:28,060
Let's go. A bit further.

2900
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:32,500
Big sister can't help but look after her little sister.

2901
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:33,850
The big sister is remarkable.

2902
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:43,090
Who is walking to the "Warm cafe"?

2903
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:43,090
Here.

2904
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:48,090
The cows of the "Warm cafe".

2905
02:00:48,650 --> 02:00:52,830
The owner, Sei, is very kind and is loved by both of them.

2906
02:00:52,830 --> 02:00:53,670
She's looking.

2907
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:56,540
Where your soul can take a respite and warm up: Warm cafe.

2908
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:58,720
They will purchase the homemade sausages.

2909
02:00:58,970 --> 02:01:02,160
The minister of sausages is the little sister: Kaori.

2910
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:04,260
Good day.

2911
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:05,910
Seichan.

2912
02:01:05,910 --> 02:01:07,450
I'm Seichan. Good day.

2913
02:01:07,450 --> 02:01:08,920
Seichan.

2914
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:10,580
What about mama?

2915
02:01:11,630 --> 02:01:12,970
Oh no.

2916
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:13,300
It hurts.

2917
02:01:13,770 --> 02:01:14,550
Are you okay?

2918
02:01:14,550 --> 02:01:16,090
The minister has fallen.

2919
02:01:16,090 --> 02:01:18,090
Are you okay?

2920
02:01:19,530 --> 02:01:21,380
- Minister of sausages.

2921
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:21,380
- Do your best.

2922
02:01:21,690 --> 02:01:23,550
Are you okay?

2923
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:25,830
She seems okay.

2924
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:28,230
What about mama?

2925
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:32,090
Mama has sent us on an errand.

2926
02:01:32,090 --> 02:01:33,810
Sei is giving them a wet towel.

2927
02:01:33,810 --> 02:01:35,980
Is mama not coming? Just you two?

2928
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:39,030
Are you helping out?

2929
02:01:39,030 --> 02:01:40,850
Everytime we get hurt

2930
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:42,800
she worries about us.

2931
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:45,770
Minister of sausages. Please step up.

2932
02:01:46,150 --> 02:01:47,320
Kaori.

2933
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:47,320
Did it hurt?

2934
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:50,240
Fatty sausages please.

2935
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:52,260
Her big sister said it instead.

2936
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:54,260
But Kaori...

2937
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:56,050
4 packages?

2938
02:01:56,050 --> 02:01:57,130
Yep.

2939
02:01:56,100 --> 02:01:57,130
She was able to say it.

2940
02:01:56,430 --> 02:01:58,680
But she was still able to say how many.

2941
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:00,300
Money. Money.

2942
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:03,390
The minister of sausages is carrying the money.

2943
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:04,570
Money.

2944
02:02:04,570 --> 02:02:05,670
Amazing.

2945
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,320
Here.

2946
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:08,840
Are you giving me all this?

2947
02:02:10,610 --> 02:02:13,150
This is 2000 yen.

2948
02:02:14,550 --> 02:02:17,200
Seichan is making such a shady expression.

2949
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:19,270
One is 700 yen.

2950
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:21,420
700 yen?

2951
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:21,420
That's right.

2952
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:23,090
One package is 700 yen.

2953
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:24,020
Not enough?

2954
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:26,790
It's not enough.

2955
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:29,930
There are four but these aren't the four to get.

2956
02:02:30,150 --> 02:02:31,710
Four packages.

2957
02:02:31,900 --> 02:02:33,430
2000 yen is just not enough.

2958
02:02:34,030 --> 02:02:34,770
What to do?

2959
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:37,490
What will we do. We can't go home without it.

2960
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:39,240
Yeah, you can't go home.

2961
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:42,040
Their mother has miscalculated it.

2962
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:44,910
Since 2000 yen isn't enough.

2963
02:02:44,910 --> 02:02:46,510
What should we do?

2964
02:02:46,510 --> 02:02:48,310
Giving them less or...

2965
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:51,570
will Seichan give them for free?

2966
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:52,840
Seichan. Seichan.

2967
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:54,390
One of these two.

2968
02:02:53,020 --> 02:02:54,970
She's curious.

2969
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:58,020
For the insufficient part

2970
02:03:00,030 --> 02:03:01,890
what should I do?

2971
02:03:01,890 --> 02:03:04,030
What a weird feeling.

2972
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:07,030
What should we do?

2973
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:07,030
Weird feeling.

2974
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:10,000
Maybe I will just get it from your mother later.

2975
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,870
Finally a new proposal.

2976
02:03:11,870 --> 02:03:14,810
I will write down the missing amount.

2977
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:16,790
800 yen.

2978
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:19,160
800 yen, right?

2979
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:21,160
Seichan is so gentle.

2980
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:25,500
Oh no. This isn't good.

2981
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:27,250
Yeah, it started raining.

2982
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:30,590
It's not only cold but it has started raining.

2983
02:03:31,210 --> 02:03:33,790
It's not only cold but it has started raining.

2984
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:38,250
Seicchan is dressing them in the raincoats from their bags.

2985
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:41,070
And he's giving them hot patches to warm them up.

2986
02:03:40,580 --> 02:03:41,870
He's so kind.

2987
02:03:41,070 --> 02:03:43,290
Seichan is so kind.

2988
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:48,160
Further more, further more. He's also giving them warm milk for free.

2989
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:48,160
How good.

2990
02:03:48,890 --> 02:03:50,160
Looks delicious.

2991
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:53,410
Kaori and Mirei.

2992
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:54,880
The milk is ready.

2993
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:56,450
It's so warm.

2994
02:03:56,850 --> 02:03:58,150
Looks good.

2995
02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:04,220
It melts.

2996
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:06,310
What a nice face.

2997
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,930
It's warm.

2998
02:04:06,310 --> 02:04:07,410
How nice.

2999
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:10,280
Kaori is also enjoying it.

3000
02:04:10,430 --> 02:04:12,830
It's warm.

3001
02:04:13,230 --> 02:04:15,140
Old man, are you also cold?

3002
02:04:15,140 --> 02:04:16,120
I'm cold.

3003
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:17,970
It looks cold.

3004
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:20,310
So kind.

3005
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:19,570
Is it okay?

3006
02:04:19,570 --> 02:04:20,490
It's warm.

3007
02:04:20,490 --> 02:04:21,570
Giving it to the man?

3008
02:04:21,570 --> 02:04:22,840
Yes, it's warm.

3009
02:04:21,810 --> 02:04:23,210
So kind.

3010
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:29,000
Kaori has been influenced by Seichans kindness.

3011
02:04:32,540 --> 02:04:34,650
Micchan give yours.

3012
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:38,420
And Kaori's kindness has been conveyed to her sister.

3013
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:39,730
Warm dr...

3014
02:04:39,730 --> 02:04:41,930
She's even giving hers to the camera man.

3015
02:04:41,930 --> 02:04:42,760
Is it okay?

3016
02:04:46,430 --> 02:04:48,180
It's warm.

3017
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:49,920
A chain of kindness.

3018
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:51,900
Everyone is feeling warm and fuzzy.

3019
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:53,210
This is happiness.

3020
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:53,940
Seichan, I drank it all.

3021
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:55,040
Thank you.

3022
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:56,910
It was warm and delicious.

3023
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:01,350
Thanks to the cafe they've become warm.

3024
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:02,700
I want to do this.

3025
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:03,920
If you have a dream.

3026
02:05:07,670 --> 02:05:08,990
Goodbye.

3027
02:05:08,990 --> 02:05:10,990
Goodbye.

3028
02:05:10,990 --> 02:05:13,440
And for the last time.

3029
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:16,250
The two of them are departing with renewed energy.

3030
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:18,460
Seichan is becoming soaked.

3031
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:18,970
Bye bye.

3032
02:05:18,970 --> 02:05:19,830
At that instant

3033
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,290
the rain has become stronger.

3034
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:26,510
This is normal in early spring.

3035
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:29,180
Despite having warmed up.

3036
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:31,240
It's so cold.

3037
02:05:30,330 --> 02:05:31,880
- It's pouring down.

3038
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:31,880
- Looks cold.

3039
02:05:31,730 --> 02:05:32,850
- Looks cold.

3040
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:35,630
It's so cold that the lens has fogged up again.

3041
02:05:35,850 --> 02:05:38,100
In the harsh nature of Hokkaido.

3042
02:05:38,330 --> 02:05:40,620
If we don't hurry.

3043
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,240
They are soaked.

3044
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:43,060
If we don't go.

3045
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:45,020
Makes me sad.

3046
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:48,010
The big sister can't go ahead.

3047
02:05:48,830 --> 02:05:50,460
She's looking at Kaori's face

3048
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:52,080
and adjusting her pace

3049
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:53,530
while encouraging.

3050
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:56,040
Do your best.

3051
02:05:56,820 --> 02:05:59,470
I can only do a tiny bit of my best.

3052
02:05:59,470 --> 02:06:00,140
Huh?

3053
02:06:00,370 --> 02:06:01,690
She's honest.

3054
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:04,640
Will you go home?

3055
02:06:03,530 --> 02:06:04,640
Yeah.

3056
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:07,250
"But Kaori can still go on"

3057
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:09,920
is what her sister felt.

3058
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:13,290
We don't need the milk?

3059
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:15,820
I forgot.

3060
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:18,370
Let's do our best.

3061
02:06:18,370 --> 02:06:20,030
Their mother always tells them

3062
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:22,280
"It's more fun to give it your all."

3063
02:06:22,280 --> 02:06:22,960
So that's why...

3064
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:27,280
Do our best. Do our best. Do our best.

3065
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:29,340
Mana's house is within sight.

3066
02:06:29,670 --> 02:06:32,150
They will get the milk and take it back home.

3067
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:38,130
It's warm again.

3068
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:40,580
It's not here.

3069
02:06:40,580 --> 02:06:42,750
Ah, it's here. On top.

3070
02:06:42,750 --> 02:06:44,680
Will you take it?

3071
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:48,200
Alright, Mirei do your best.

3072
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:53,140
The big sister carries the milk.

3073
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:53,730
Hard.

3074
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:55,710
Kaori is carrying 4 packages of sausages.

3075
02:06:55,710 --> 02:06:57,330
I'm tired.

3076
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:59,930
Everyone is bringing home their own things.

3077
02:06:59,350 --> 02:07:01,880
You would get tired from this.

3078
02:07:00,250 --> 02:07:01,770
Their house is within sight.

3079
02:07:02,020 --> 02:07:03,550
Just a bit more.

3080
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:08,220
Their mother is waiting for them on the road.

3081
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:12,360
If they turn around here their mother is waiting for them.

3082
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:16,000
If she can power through then it's just a bit more.

3083
02:07:15,630 --> 02:07:16,820
Ah, the milk is heavy.

3084
02:07:16,820 --> 02:07:17,780
It must be.

3085
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,250
I'm tired.

3086
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:20,900
She wants to go to them

3087
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:23,110
but she's holding that in.

3088
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:26,090
Better than quitting, exerting yourself is the way.

3089
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:28,460
I will do my best.

3090
02:07:28,460 --> 02:07:31,450
It's better to do my best.

3091
02:07:31,450 --> 02:07:33,770
At first she could easily carry it.

3092
02:07:34,130 --> 02:07:36,050
But it has become heavy.

3093
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:49,020
Are you okay?

3094
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:51,630
Kaori kept looking over her.

3095
02:07:52,350 --> 02:07:53,790
Mirei.

3096
02:07:53,790 --> 02:07:55,040
Kaori.

3097
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:57,040
Do your best.

3098
02:07:59,510 --> 02:08:01,430
Mama.

3099
02:08:02,090 --> 02:08:03,280
Mama.

3100
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:07,050
Michan is crying.

3101
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:12,890
Mirei, do your best. I'm waiting for you.

3102
02:08:11,250 --> 02:08:12,890
Mama.

3103
02:08:13,910 --> 02:08:15,880
Alright, wait a bit.

3104
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:17,530
I will walk over there.

3105
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:19,880
Big sister, I will do something for you.

3106
02:08:20,410 --> 02:08:23,380
Kaori has forgotten how heavy her own bag is

3107
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:25,790
and is completely focused on her sister.

3108
02:08:34,230 --> 02:08:35,530
Mirei.

3109
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:39,500
Mirei can't carry it.

3110
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:42,080
She can't carry it?

3111
02:08:42,470 --> 02:08:45,740
Wanting to convey to her mother about her sisters situation

3112
02:08:45,740 --> 02:08:48,360
she's made it to the goal without even paying attention.

3113
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:50,640
The sausages have arrived.

3114
02:08:52,010 --> 02:08:53,610
You did your best.

3115
02:08:53,010 --> 02:08:53,610
Yeah.

3116
02:08:54,230 --> 02:08:57,550
Micchan is still sitting over there. What should we do?

3117
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:02,050
Because Michan is exhausted

3118
02:09:02,050 --> 02:09:05,360
I came to mama.

3119
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:08,360
You came to tell me?
That Michan is exhausted?

3120
02:09:10,830 --> 02:09:12,230
Mirei.

3121
02:09:13,620 --> 02:09:14,930
The big sister

3122
02:09:14,930 --> 02:09:17,690
becomes decisive while seeing her sisters resolution.

3123
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:23,480
Mirei.

3124
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,250
It's better to give it your all.

3125
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:39,020
Michan.

3126
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:40,130
Michan.

3127
02:09:40,130 --> 02:09:42,290
Papa and mama are waiting.

3128
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:44,430
I'm doing my best walking over.

3129
02:09:44,430 --> 02:09:46,550
Papa was watching while hiding.

3130
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:48,380
Mirei come over here.

3131
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:51,390
Let's make this the goal.

3132
02:09:51,390 --> 02:09:52,300
Come here.

3133
02:09:57,930 --> 02:09:59,780
Just a bit more.

3134
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:03,820
You are remarkable.

3135
02:10:05,990 --> 02:10:08,570
Thank you.

3136
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,090
How great.

3137
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:10,610
This is the goal.

3138
02:10:11,410 --> 02:10:13,360
Your mama has...

3139
02:10:14,990 --> 02:10:17,730
Did you bring the milk all by yourself?

3140
02:10:19,170 --> 02:10:21,300
It was heavy, wasn't it? You did your best.

3141
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:23,070
You did your best.

3142
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:26,870
Kaori also did her best.

3143
02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:27,740
That's right.

3144
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:32,060
It was truly better to have given it their all.

3145
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:34,410
You were remarkable.

3146
02:10:34,650 --> 02:10:37,250
Let's go home. To a warm place.

3147
02:10:40,170 --> 02:10:44,020
Since Kaori went to mama

3148
02:10:44,020 --> 02:10:47,280
I became decisive

3149
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:49,200
You became decisive?

3150
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,810
You were remarkable.

3151
02:10:51,810 --> 02:10:53,600
The two of them were able to do it till the end.

3152
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:57,350
It was cold but everyone was warm.

3153
02:10:57,740 --> 02:11:02,070
Today's sausage stew will be a warm stew.

3154
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:06,710
Looks delicious.

3155
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:10,280
It's done.

3156
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:09,970
There are so much sausage in it.

3157
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:10,280
Okay. It's done.

3158
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:20,260
They are bringing it over to eat with the helping hands from all over the world.

3159
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:22,360
The stew is done.

3160
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:24,260
The stew is done.

3161
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:25,380
Thank you.

3162
02:11:25,380 --> 02:11:27,880
The camera is fogging up again.

3163
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:31,200
Thank you for the meal.

3164
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:33,840
Everyone try and taste it.

3165
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:34,870
Yes.

3166
02:11:34,990 --> 02:11:38,410
Sausage. Sausage.

3167
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:38,710
Yes, the sausage...

3168
02:11:38,710 --> 02:11:40,010
It's huge.

3169
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:42,180
Wow, it's delicious.

3170
02:11:40,530 --> 02:11:42,180
It's great.

3171
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:43,630
Thank you.

3172
02:11:43,630 --> 02:11:45,800
The minister of sausages.

3173
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:47,750
And...

3174
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:51,010
thank you to the minister of milk.

3175
02:11:51,670 --> 02:11:55,060
Today I will sleep all day.

3176
02:11:55,060 --> 02:11:56,460
Thank you for your hard work.

3177
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:56,850
She's so tired.

3178
02:11:56,850 --> 02:11:58,000
Because she's tired.

3179
02:11:57,700 --> 02:11:58,980
Next is spring

3180
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:02,640
and after the short Hokkaido summer

3181
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:08,040
and then they will be back to the harsh winter.

3182
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:10,590
Due to the coldness of midwinter

3183
02:12:10,590 --> 02:12:13,180
The nature raises you to become stronger.

3184
02:12:14,060 --> 02:12:15,160
Ah, that's right.

3185
02:12:15,310 --> 02:12:17,480
Their younger brother Shinji was born.

3186
02:12:17,480 --> 02:12:22,200
The two of them will help out lots from now on.

3187
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:44,510
The grandness of Hokkaido sure is nice.

3188
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:45,340
That's right.

3189
02:12:45,930 --> 02:12:48,780
But the mother is remarkable too.

3190
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:52,250
Insisting on not going over to her

3191
02:12:52,250 --> 02:12:55,840
but to declare her place as the goal.

3192
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:58,760
This type of mother and father

3193
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:02,750
will raise children who are happy.

3194
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:09,300
Not only just saying that "doing your best is better" but they get to watch their parents constantly doing their best.

3195
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:15,470
I have a big sister and we have a lot of fun together.

3196
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:21,010
But when I think that things are tough just seeing my mother gave me a sense of security.

3197
02:13:21,010 --> 02:13:23,770
The sense of security at home

3198
02:13:23,770 --> 02:13:26,340
is truly something worth appreciating.

3199
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:28,150
To look up to your mother, right?

3200
02:13:28,150 --> 02:13:30,610
It really influenced me.

3201
02:13:28,470 --> 02:13:30,610
It really influenced you.

3202
02:13:30,890 --> 02:13:31,920
For the last goal

3203
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:33,780
Yamanaka papa, would you wait it out?

3204
02:13:33,780 --> 02:13:36,630
No, I would go right away.

3205
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:37,780
I would.

3206
02:13:38,700 --> 02:13:44,340
If this entire segment was Yamanaka and his children then they wouldn't even start.

3207
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:46,390
It wouldn't even work.

3208
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:46,390
Wouldn't even work.

3209
02:13:46,390 --> 02:13:47,360
That's right.

3210
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:52,800
The closest JR station is Katsunuma-budoukyo station.

3211
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:54,350
Yamanashi ● Katsunuma-budoukyo

3212
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:55,080
It is also the birthplace of Japanese wine.

3213
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:59,070
During autumn many tourists come to pick grapes.

3214
02:13:59,670 --> 02:14:03,790
Three siblings have grown up at this vineyard.

3215
02:14:04,610 --> 02:14:07,740
The ones going on an errand is the 2nd and the 3rd.

3216
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:12,650
Kaori who can take care of those below her is hoping to be the mature older sister.

3217
02:14:12,650 --> 02:14:16,670
Kozue just wants to be strong and happy.

3218
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:21,070
For the grape picking customers, miso soup is offered for free.

3219
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:23,070
Bringing the empty bowls back is how they help.

3220
02:14:23,540 --> 02:14:25,730
Kozue doesn't bring them back.

3221
02:14:25,730 --> 02:14:26,410
Is that right?

3222
02:14:26,410 --> 02:14:29,300
There's not enough tofu for the next customers.

3223
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:31,300
What will we do?

3224
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,050
Will you go and buy some tofu?

3225
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,170
Five packages.

3226
02:14:35,170 --> 02:14:37,120
Five packages if they are small

3227
02:14:37,120 --> 02:14:41,560
but if they are large then five will be too heavy so only get three.

3228
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:46,230
And you know that grandma needs her hip medicine...

3229
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:45,710
That's difficult.

3230
02:14:46,230 --> 02:14:49,800
that she rubs on. If you mention it they will know.

3231
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:51,070
Go to the pharmacy.

3232
02:14:51,070 --> 02:14:53,310
Yeah, I got it.

3233
02:14:51,950 --> 02:14:53,860
Her explanation is kind of crude.

3234
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:58,130
At the pharmacy she needs to get medicine for her grandma

3235
02:14:58,130 --> 02:15:02,580
and tofu at the supermarket. Today is the grape festival so there will be many people.

3236
02:15:03,550 --> 02:15:05,830
The town is different today.

3237
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:09,090
It's the once-a-year grape festival.

3238
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:13,860
The sound of fireworks.

3239
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:14,990
She looks surprised.

3240
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:18,860
The big sister always reacts poorly to loud noises.

3241
02:15:19,410 --> 02:15:24,970
On top of her first errand the loud sounds are reverberating.

3242
02:15:25,490 --> 02:15:26,490
Do your best.

3243
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:30,690
The always crying kitten...

3244
02:15:30,690 --> 02:15:33,210
That's not true Kozue.

3245
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:36,030
The portable shrine has come out.

3246
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:38,480
The adults are shouting loudly

3247
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:41,320
and big sister's heart pounds even harder.

3248
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:45,790
They are surrounded by a wall of butts.

3249
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:52,150
While dragging her little brother by the hand they've finally arrived at the pharmacy.

3250
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,070
Did you two come by yourself?

3251
02:15:57,070 --> 02:15:58,490
You did well.

3252
02:15:58,490 --> 02:16:01,070
It's medicine for her grandmas hips.

3253
02:16:01,070 --> 02:16:02,540
What have you come to purchase?

3254
02:16:04,330 --> 02:16:05,610
What will it be?

3255
02:16:05,610 --> 02:16:08,750
You rub on your buttocks...

3256
02:16:08,110 --> 02:16:09,280
Buttocks?

3257
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:11,120
Grandma. Buttocks.

3258
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:15,840
That you rub on, please.

3259
02:16:11,230 --> 02:16:13,000
For her grandmas buttocks?

3260
02:16:13,850 --> 02:16:15,870
Got it. For your grandmas behind.

3261
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:16,840
TEXT5

3262
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:20,660
It's not for her buttocks but her hips.

3263
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:21,790
Close.

3264
02:16:24,580 --> 02:16:28,200
Must be based on the view.

3265
02:16:29,150 --> 02:16:31,150
Ah, because that's all she saw on her way.

3266
02:16:31,970 --> 02:16:35,610
Oh no, she gave her hemorrhoid cream.

3267
02:16:36,810 --> 02:16:37,930
And they purchased it.

3268
02:16:37,930 --> 02:16:40,130
I will bring the reward. Please wait.

3269
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:41,240
Even though she doesn't have hemorrhoids.

3270
02:16:40,130 --> 02:16:42,450
The old lady always gives them something.

3271
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:44,280
Be careful on your way home.

3272
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:45,880
Today is big.

3273
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:47,720
What's inside?

3274
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:50,410
Mandarins and manjuu buns.

3275
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:50,920
How great.

3276
02:16:50,310 --> 02:16:53,990
Manjyuu?

3277
02:16:51,790 --> 02:16:53,060
You going to be okay? Be careful.

3278
02:16:53,990 --> 02:16:56,660
Big sister doesn't have the composure to give thanks.

3279
02:16:56,660 --> 02:16:58,750
Sorry old lady.

3280
02:17:00,380 --> 02:17:03,850
They've arrived at the supermarket. They will get tofu.

3281
02:17:03,850 --> 02:17:06,970
There are policemen everywhere because of the festival.

3282
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:10,190
Please be careful.

3283
02:17:10,190 --> 02:17:12,180
Please help us cross.

3284
02:17:10,710 --> 02:17:12,180
That's oka... huh?

3285
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:14,700
Please help us cross.

3286
02:17:12,810 --> 02:17:14,700
Help you cross? Just a moment.

3287
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:18,520
She has calmed down and finally acting like a big sister.

3288
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:20,700
Please help us cross.

3289
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:21,940
She said it properly.

3290
02:17:23,190 --> 02:17:27,990
Her mother told her to ask the cashier where the tofu is.

3291
02:17:27,990 --> 02:17:31,150
But she doesn't know when to ask.

3292
02:17:31,660 --> 02:17:33,820
That's difficult indeed.

3293
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:39,290
She waited 10 minutes for the customers to leave.

3294
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:42,310
Where's the tofu?

3295
02:17:42,310 --> 02:17:44,230
Where's the to...

3296
02:17:44,690 --> 02:17:46,850
Where's the tofu?

3297
02:17:46,850 --> 02:17:50,450
It's to the furthest in this direction.

3298
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:53,350
She finally asked.

3299
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:56,570
If they are small then five packages

3300
02:17:56,570 --> 02:17:59,590
or three of the big ones.

3301
02:17:59,590 --> 02:18:03,900
She has picked the big ones.

3302
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:07,320
They are given to the grape picking customers.

3303
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:05,410
Be careful.

3304
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:09,570
They're expecting a big group today.

3305
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:14,510
They won't get any rewards here.

3306
02:18:17,930 --> 02:18:20,700
They are taking a route back where cars don't go.

3307
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:23,050
But the road her mother told her to take...

3308
02:18:23,780 --> 02:18:26,350
Is overflowing with people.

3309
02:18:26,350 --> 02:18:31,570
Her mother forgot about all the stalls filling up the road.

3310
02:18:30,710 --> 02:18:32,410
Makes you hungry.

3311
02:18:31,570 --> 02:18:36,410
The sister is always really interested in toys but not today.

3312
02:18:36,410 --> 02:18:39,230
But Kozue can't take his eyes away.

3313
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:41,630
It's all so seducing.

3314
02:18:43,770 --> 02:18:47,390
Hey hey, don't get carried away and dance along.

3315
02:18:48,090 --> 02:18:49,470
I get this mood.

3316
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:52,560
Kozue.

3317
02:18:54,430 --> 02:18:56,880
They've finally beat the crowds.

3318
02:18:59,230 --> 02:19:02,050
It's not like Kozue is walking fast

3319
02:19:02,050 --> 02:19:05,940
it's the sister who is becoming slower and slower.

3320
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:06,810
Is it heavy?

3321
02:19:06,810 --> 02:19:08,430
It's heavy.

3322
02:19:10,730 --> 02:19:14,270
Kaori the doooog

3323
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:17,840
is in trouble woof woof wooof

3324
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:20,790
woof woof wooof

3325
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:25,980
Among the three siblings the sister is the most prone to crying

3326
02:19:25,980 --> 02:19:27,850
that's what the mother told us.

3327
02:19:27,850 --> 02:19:31,070
But even when she cries she carries out her duty till the end.

3328
02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:33,940
Do your best.

3329
02:19:41,290 --> 02:19:44,410
Suddenly her legs stopped moving.

3330
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:46,900
And Kozue only looks forward.

3331
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:49,380
Please notice her.

3332
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:49,380
Kozue.

3333
02:19:49,150 --> 02:19:50,540
Aah, he noticed.

3334
02:19:52,350 --> 02:19:54,240
Kozue who only looks forward.

3335
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:55,640
Aah, he noticed.

3336
02:20:03,350 --> 02:20:05,680
He runs to her in full force.

3337
02:20:10,670 --> 02:20:12,320
And tells her this:

3338
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:14,830
It's okay.

3339
02:20:30,230 --> 02:20:34,150
Kozue is matching his pace with his sister.

3340
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:40,020
It's okay.

3341
02:20:40,020 --> 02:20:42,650
But he doesn't help carry the bags.

3342
02:20:45,470 --> 02:20:48,180
And his sister insists on carrying them herself.

3343
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:54,350
The two of them alone in the grape fields

3344
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:58,400
arriving in the twilight of the mountain region.

3345
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:01,940
We've arrived.

3346
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:03,610
Mom is there.

3347
02:21:04,910 --> 02:21:07,630
They live in a grape field.

3348
02:21:07,630 --> 02:21:10,130
This is a shortcut to the front door.

3349
02:21:14,690 --> 02:21:19,320
Their mother has turned on all the lights in the house.

3350
02:21:21,860 --> 02:21:24,710
Kaori cried.

3351
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:29,450
Even if she cried, she still did it till the end.

3352
02:21:30,570 --> 02:21:33,720
Kozue is tough even though he's only 2.

3353
02:21:37,290 --> 02:21:38,840
Is this the drug?

3354
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:40,200
It's hemorrhoid medicine.

3355
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:41,650
I completely forgot.

3356
02:21:41,650 --> 02:21:42,650
I forgot.

3357
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:48,800
I asked for some cream for grandmas hips, this is slightly different.

3358
02:21:49,090 --> 02:21:50,290
But it's fine.

3359
02:21:50,770 --> 02:21:53,460
The customer have gone home for today but

3360
02:21:53,460 --> 02:21:57,130
the mother is making her specialty miso soup.

3361
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:00,830
How is it? Delicious?

3362
02:22:03,150 --> 02:22:05,890
It's warm. Be careful.

3363
02:22:07,390 --> 02:22:12,040
22 years have passed since then...

3364
02:22:14,410 --> 02:22:15,880
A wedding!?

3365
02:22:16,230 --> 02:22:17,280
Which means?

3366
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:18,520
Which one, which one.

3367
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:20,250
Kaori is 27 years by now.

3368
02:22:20,250 --> 02:22:22,440
Kozue is 25 years old.

3369
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,560
Which one?

3370
02:22:23,610 --> 02:22:24,560
Which one is it?

3371
02:22:28,340 --> 02:22:30,760
It's the younger brother Kozue.

3372
02:22:31,060 --> 02:22:32,160
It's Kozue.

3373
02:22:34,030 --> 02:22:35,470
She's marrying someone cool.

3374
02:22:35,470 --> 02:22:37,100
Yeah, he's handsome.

3375
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:40,490
He was just 2 year old

3376
02:22:41,090 --> 02:22:43,020
He's grown so much.

3377
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:46,280
and in no time 22 years have passed.

3378
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:47,580
Mother.

3379
02:22:49,030 --> 02:22:52,120
Grown to a spectacular 1.85 cm.

3380
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:56,520
He's tall and they've met at a volleyball club.

3381
02:22:57,890 --> 02:23:00,360
I'm sorry I didn't help you carry anything back then.

3382
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:02,810
He has apologized by now.

3383
02:23:02,810 --> 02:23:03,930
That's right.

3384
02:23:03,930 --> 02:23:05,930
Where is his big sister?

3385
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:08,870
There she is.

3386
02:23:10,970 --> 02:23:14,010
Kaori hasn't married yet.

3387
02:23:14,010 --> 02:23:14,870
That's fine.

3388
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:16,870
Working as a travel agent

3389
02:23:17,130 --> 02:23:21,230
She lives on her own and helps out at the vineyard on her days off.

3390
02:23:21,500 --> 02:23:25,600
The one sibling who does it till the end even through tears

3391
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:28,170
she still helps out at home.

3392
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:33,440
Do you feel like continuing to help out here?

3393
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:36,960
I have thought about this and that but...

3394
02:23:35,090 --> 02:23:36,960
This and that?

3395
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:42,000
She's a reliable helping hand.

3396
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:43,520
You couldn't do it without her?

3397
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:45,600
Please advertise that we are looking to hire.

3398
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:48,690
That's not needed with her around.

3399
02:23:50,090 --> 02:23:53,190
She has grown this much however...

3400
02:23:53,190 --> 02:23:56,080
She served as both the little and the big sister.

3401
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:57,630
How nice.

3402
02:23:58,550 --> 02:24:00,490
Isn't that just nice?
