00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,780
Subbed and timed by Outlaws0023

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,350
Gaki no Tsukai backstage

3
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,980
Gaki no Tsukai.. as always they're being kids.

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,220
Nothing to do, huh?

5
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,290
Hamada Masatoshi

6
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,290
Matsumo Hitoshi

7
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,350
Downtown

8
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,290
Because of the economy?

9
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,060
Yea, yea, yea. That's why we only get water.

10
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,090
Cocorico

11
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,090
Endo Shozo

12
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,090
Tanaka Naoki

13
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,920
We do get a lot of water, don't we?

14
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,230
It's gone this far?

15
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,190
Soon we'll only get nuts to eat.

16
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,830
Yamazaki Hosei

17
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,060
It'll never go that far!

18
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,200
So it'll stop at the water?

19
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,070
We're sitting and dreaming, huh?

20
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,140
Good morning.

21
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,040
Gaki Chief

22
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,040
Suga Kenji

23
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,340
So what's the program for today, chief?

24
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,780
We've got a request.

25
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,080
Every summer, there's Niterejanbori, right?

26
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,080
Niterejanbori is a camping festival held by the japanese scouts.

27
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,780
Oh, that's right...

28
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,220
So I thought "why don't we get gaki to take some pictures".

29
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,860
The gaki.. staff.. and members..

30
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,000
But after a lot of thinking...

31
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,930
I reached the conclusion, that Heipo pictures would be the cutest.

32
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,300
Cutest?!

33
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,240
Heipo

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,940
He's the image you get in the head when thinking about gaki.

35
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:11,150
Our theme for today will then be "surprise".

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,920
Everytime Heipo get "surprised" you have to take the pictures.

37
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,060
Sekai no Heipo - The worlds Heipo

38
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,060
The always petrified man: Sekai no Heipo

39
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,060
And today we're gonna show you some
of the funniest reaction from him!!

40
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:34,070
Every time he gets scared, the gaki cast will take pictures of it!!

41
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,510
The place Heipo will have to go to, is written in here.

42
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,140
Wha..what?

43
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,580
I don't like the surprise thing.

44
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,590
Can I read it now?

45
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:00,030
A noise maker

46
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,430
Was that the surprise?

47
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,880
Go to a café and get something to eat.

48
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,880
That's all?

49
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,510
Yeah, that shouldn't be too hard.

50
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,580
Then there's no need for a surprise, right?

51
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,950
We've already told you it's gonna happen.

52
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,080
It's today's theme.

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,420
What are you to this program?

54
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,920
I'm the assistant director!

55
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,790
You've never directed us! Not even once!

56
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,580
Today the gaki team is gonna take pictures
of Heipo at 3 different locations.

57
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,580
First up is the café.
What surprises are waiting?

58
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,090
And how will Heipo react?!

59
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,660
Okay everyone, Heipo will soon arrive.

60
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,830
We've got to do our best!

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,240
I really wanna start taking some pictures!

62
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,010
- He is! He is!

63
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,010
He's here?

64
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,580
Photo taking START

65
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,230
Excuse me..

66
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,500
Can I place my order?

67
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,000
Can I?!

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
You don't say that...

69
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,710
Welcome!

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,210
What have you chosen?
- You don't have to use that loud voice!

71
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,450
The waitress's voice is very loud

72
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,280
What are you doing?

73
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,090
1 black tea, please.

74
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,300
Okay, please wait a moment.

75
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,500
Why black tea? He's supposed to eat here.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,240
Noise from the kitchen in...

77
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,610
What is it with this café, it's so wrong.

78
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,720
You seriously can't say that...

79
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,750
Watch him!

80
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,590
If you're going home, then say it!

81
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,590
No way he should.

82
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,870
It's hard to get a picture of
the exact moment he gets surprised.

83
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,500
Noise from the kitchen in...

84
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,140
What's wrong with this shop?!

85
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,820
Waitress happening in...

86
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,730
Here's your tea.

87
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,090
Black teeth

88
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,230
What is that?! Wha...

89
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,240
What kind of café does he normally go to?

90
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,080
What's this?

91
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,650
Tomato juice

92
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,080
It's kinda red...

93
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,230
Oh, it's good. Nothing wrong with it.

94
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,360
Sorry.
- Did he think anything was wrong with a tomato juice?

95
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,940
Excuse me, sir.

96
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,740
A sleepy old man.

97
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,670
Sir?

98
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,310
I don't want to be a bother, but...

99
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,880
Stop fooling around you stupid bastard! Get up!

100
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,780
A waitress with a lot of power

101
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,650
Get up when I say it! Look, look, look! You're
a bother to the other customers.

102
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,230
This is so wrong...

103
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,100
This is difficult, huh?
- Yea.

104
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,400
Surprise in...

105
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,320
That's gotta hurt.

106
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,650
What's wrong with this café?!

107
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,960
What now? Did something happen?

108
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,240
Heipo's instructions

109
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,470
This is almost like bullying.

110
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,810
Let's hear what it says.

111
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,010
Go to the fortune-teller.

112
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,650
- I'll go to the Fortune-teller, then.

113
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,650
More?

114
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,030
He really is a one of a kind.

115
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,730
He looked so~surprised. Unbelievably scared.
is it really possible to get that scared?

116
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,670
I'm in the TV business, but I have no idea.

117
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,310
It feels like I'm taking pictures of an elementary
school class on a school trip.

118
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,810
The pictures they took will be revealed at the end of the show.

119
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,080
Heipo's feeling troubled...

120
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,590
I don't wanna go.

121
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
You're already done with the café.

122
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,660
This can't be just as scary...

123
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,390
But I still don't wanna go.

124
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,230
And why did I have to eat something at the café?!

125
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,670
So unnecessary.

126
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,800
I really don't like this.

127
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,380
But in the end, they somehow managed to persuade
the petrified and complaining fool.

128
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,780
Fortune-teller

129
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,780
Location 2

130
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:29,650
Even more surprises!!

131
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,020
At this place there are waiting many more surprising things for Heipo.

132
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,590
Here he comes.

133
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
Excuse me.

134
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,230
What is this place?

135
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,240
Take a seat

136
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,120
Please write your name here.

137
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,820
Electric shock in...

138
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,390
Here?

139
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,170
Why this Ballpoint pen?

140
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,310
I'll try to see you in my crystal ball.

141
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,050
What?

142
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,450
What can you see?

143
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,390
I can se something black.
- What? Black?!

144
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,520
That black object is the girl...

145
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,030
from your future private wedding.

146
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,530
He said something really good!

147
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,600
He laughed.

148
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,040
Now that was a real surprise.

149
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,940
Tha person is 30 years old.

150
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,110
Wait a second.

151
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,110
What's with the face?

152
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,450
So now I would like to show you some pictures from my older visitors.

153
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,700
Uh! I don't want to see it!

154
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,560
Picture of a ghost/spirit

155
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,400
You only see 3 persons on this photo, but...

156
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,250
I can see it! No~!

157
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,770
Actually they're 4.
- I know!

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,640
Actually, the girl to the left had a twin sister.

159
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,600
Scary~.
- So they're 4.

160
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:35,310
Surprise in...

161
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,550
Eh?
- They're 4.

162
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,900
You scared me!

163
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,460
What are you doing?!

164
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,520
Who is that?

165
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,630
No idea.

166
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,430
An unknown person entered!

167
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,800
How can a person you don't know just go in like that?

168
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,510
There's 1 more thing I want to show you.

169
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,980
Take a look at this.
- I really don't want to see it!

170
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,820
Ghost/spirit video

171
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:17,190
No~! I don't want to see it!

172
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,990
A small group enters an old university with a camera.

173
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,460
I'm really bad with these things.

174
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,470
He really hates this. In a split second
it looked like he was hit by an arrow.

175
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,810
Huh? Looks as if someone has just dropped this.

176
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,780
We haven't dropped anything.

177
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,870
Heipo jumped off his chair even tho nothing happened

178
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,170
What going on here?!

179
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,410
This is making me crazy.

180
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,410
No! I don't wanna watch it!

181
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,750
Once again Heipo got freaked out.

182
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,050
The next place is...

183
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,920
Go to the amusement park and ride the "Wanpakubasu".

184
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,590
What's that?

185
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,670
Some good surprises they made.

186
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,950
Now what?

187
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,880
What is it with him?!

188
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,020
There's no cameras out there, right?

189
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,390
The pictures will be shown in the end of this program.

190
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,090
Next up is the amusement park. The
last chance to get some good shots.

191
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,400
Heipo is now at the amusement park as
instructed to ride the "Wanpakubasu".

192
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,470
He's here.
- All he has to do is the ride the "Wanpakubasu", right?

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,710
Then let's just go straight to it and get some good shots.

194
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,450
Even at a cute ride like this, Heipo's got a very surprising reaction.

195
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:27,250
He really can't take amusement parks.
- What will happen?

196
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,960
I wonder how many years it's been since he's ridden such a thing.

197
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,000
He probably won't look too good up there.

198
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,800
Wanpakubasu

199
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,300
It's as if he's flying!

200
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,300
This is a great chance for some good pictures!

201
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,290
Please stop it.

202
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,190
Scary~!

203
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,560
This is great!

204
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,630
Some great pictures I get.
- Yea, I'm confident in mine too.

205
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,970
A surprise that'll make him scream even louder.

206
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,970
After this

207
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,370
Stop it! Onii-san!

208
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,040
That was some reactions we got.

209
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,880
Next up Heipo's got to but some popcorn.

210
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,580
He's here!

211
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,350
Thank you very much!

212
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,220
Why did he get scared?

213
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:46,230
Excuse me. Could I get some popcorn?
- Yes, just a second.

214
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,970
Surprise in...

215
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,840
Sorry to make you wait!

216
00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:01,680
"Sukekiyo" is from the japanese movie "Inugamike
no ichizoku" (The Inugami Family)

217
00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:01,680
She turned into "Sukekiyo"

218
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,840
That's good!

219
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,950
This is great!
- But a bit scary, huh?

220
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,920
She's rough!

221
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,290
Why's she spinning around all the time?

222
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,530
That's her way of handing over the popcorn.

223
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,960
Thank you very much.

224
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,100
Oh, the popcorn!

225
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,300
That's some great pictures!

226
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,610
Now what?

227
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,950
Ride the "Sky trip". That impossible!

228
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,750
Many funny things has occurred, but it's not over yet!

229
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,890
This is the last chance for some good pictures.

230
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,900
And at the next ride, Heipo will get a really scary surprise.

231
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,200
How do I do this?
- Just sit right here.

232
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,310
Uwa~ this is impossible!

233
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,670
Eh, scary! Scary!

234
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,810
No, I can't do this! Can't! Can't! Can't!

235
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,570
No! No! No!

236
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,800
How do I do this?

237
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,650
This is gonna take a long time!

238
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:17,690
Sky trip

239
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,650
Uwa~! Scary! So high!

240
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,400
He's really slow.
- Scary!

241
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,400
Watching this makes me angry!

242
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,640
So high!
- What's he doing? What's high?

243
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,950
Surprise in...

244
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,680
Ain't I going fast?!

245
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,550
Behind you! Oh, that can't be good!

246
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,130
Collision!

247
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,570
Save me!

248
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,540
Stop it!

249
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,040
Stop!

250
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,120
That's kinda scary! It really is.
- (Heipo) Save me

251
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,780
Enough already! Please stop!

252
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,850
I can't take it.
- Is he saying he want him to stop?

253
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,220
As if he wasn't scared enough when he was alone.

254
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,730
But it really was scary.
- And he wasn't able to move.

255
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,490
I felt there were something dangerous going to happen.

256
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,270
He was as strong as 24 people.

257
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,570
He's here!

258
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,070
His face looks so white.
- You're right.

259
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,140
Is there a next place?
- Oh, they saw him!

260
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,910
This looks bad.

261
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,150
Don't lift me!

262
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:37,560
The students start lifting Heipo

263
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,560
Too high! Too high!
- That's not high!

264
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:53,680
That's great!
- Pitiful... He's so pitiful

265
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,250
Got some good pictures.

266
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,020
Then where do we go next?
- We'll probably find out soon.

267
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,390
He looks so exhausted.

268
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,830
He looks like someone from "Life".

269
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,830
Next up are the tea cups.

270
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,270
We've got enough pictures by now, right?

271
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,170
I don't think anything will happen here.

272
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,840
What are you doing?

273
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,950
Together!!

274
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,950
What are you doing?

275
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,890
Together!!

276
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:54,140
Small Tea Cups

277
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,370
This is fine..
- Fine?

278
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,800
I can't do this..

279
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,750
No.. No~

280
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,400
No wait! It's scary!

281
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,500
That's dangerous!

282
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,250
Heipo-chan let's go!

283
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,350
I can't.. can't

284
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,050
That was really dangerous.

285
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,780
Looked like he was about to fall out.

286
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,500
He's feeling so bad he can't move.

287
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,000
Can't help it... it really was funny.

288
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,400
I can't go on.
- He won't move.

289
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,850
It just keep on coming!

290
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,940
Go to the "Bake Yashiki".

291
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:02,700
Means something like "Disguise mansion"

292
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,950
Looks like he's had enough.

293
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,150
Just before it looked like...
- He wanted to kill someone.

294
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,000
I won't go.
- He's saying he can't even go into a "Bake Yashiki".

295
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,000
I really can't go in there.

296
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,500
I'm going home.

297
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,950
Just go in there!

298
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,150
I can't!
- Just go in!

299
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,600
I can't! No~
- It's not like you're gonna die!

300
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,800
I won't go into such a place.

301
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,180
After this

302
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,910
What's gonna happen at the "Bake Yashiki"!?

303
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,520
Nothing will happen
- Because it's still bright.

304
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,290
Please go in first.
- It's alright, just go.

305
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,290
Hamada, please go in.
- No, I'm taking pictures.

306
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,000
Please let me go.

307
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,070
No~
- Then we'll help you a little.

308
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:08,440
I can hear some weird sounds.
- Weird sounds? From where?

309
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,580
No, no, no, no!

310
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:18,380
Please go with me.
- We can't go with you, cause then we wont't get any pictures.

311
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,390
Then get one from the crew to do it.

312
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,360
Let me out!...

313
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,430
He's so strong!
- Please let me out!

314
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,500
Hurry up! Let me out!

315
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:45,510
"Pinku" is an adult movie genre.
Sadako is from the movie "Rngu" or "The Ring" in english

316
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:45,510
Outside, a pinku actress has been dressed as Sadako.

317
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,410
How will Heipo's reaction be when he see her?

318
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,020
Scary!

319
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,560
Heipo take a look at her.
- Take a look.

320
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,890
Eh? I think I've met you before.
- What the hell!

321
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,230
Where?!

322
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,200
What's going on?! That can't be right!

323
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,400
Heipo's

324
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,400
Surprise pictures

325
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,210
