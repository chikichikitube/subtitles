00:00:00,010 --> 00:06:24,360
This is a recap, skip to 6:24 for new stuff or download the hardsub version.

2
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,900
The game continues

3
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,900
Will they succeed?

4
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:37,880
This is a non-profit sub by a fan for fans

5
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:37,880
This sub is provided as is with all errors

6
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,110
It ended like this, huh

7
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,880
This is okay right?

8
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,820
No this is not okay

9
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,320
I thought he had the 100 card

10
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,420
But this is still pretty high

11
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,420
Or maybe the 99 card

12
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,020
See if Matsumoto only had one card left,
then I might've played my card

13
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,130
But he still had two

14
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,800
Sorry but, just one more time!

15
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,100
Any objections? None right?

16
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,040
Well for the 2 card version

17
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,040
I want to end on a good note

18
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,540
Well it was pretty fun so

19
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,540
It's fine if just end here

20
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:19,380
One final round, will they succeed?

21
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,350
That was fast wasn't it

22
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,350
It was fast

23
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,290
I see

24
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,760
But that's how it is

25
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,100
So it's like this huh

26
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,370
Let's begin

27
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,570
Ready, Start

28
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,740
Let's finish this

29
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,810
I want us to win

30
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,720
Are you serious

31
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,660
No, definitely some of you are

32
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,960
Overthinking this

33
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,660
What is that face?

34
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,130
What is that face?

35
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,710
What does that face mean?

36
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,680
Well yeah, that makes sense

37
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,230
Well

38
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,730
It's scary isn't it

39
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,110
This is good, this is good

40
00:08:51,040 --> 00:09:01,250
Remaining Cards
Housei  Matsumoto  Hamada    Endo     Tanaka

41
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,260
He's not even being the master

42
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,290
He's probably like

43
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,660
Putting on a comedian vibe

44
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,700
Such a subtle point

45
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,970
He's just making funny faces

46
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,540
Probably

47
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,870
I had to point that out

48
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,150
You're done?

49
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,420
I'm all out

50
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,820
I'm counting on you

51
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,450
It's become precarious

52
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,720
Indeed

53
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,670
Done!

54
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:19,760
Remaining Cards
Housei  Matsumoto  Hamada    Endo     Tanaka

55
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,860
How many cards are left? Three?

56
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,160
Only three, definitely doable

57
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,060
Each of them has one, we can do this

58
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,140
I don't understand their faces at all

59
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,680
I see

60
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,040
It's the last 2 cards

61
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,540
Seriously, please

62
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,810
Eh? Seriously?

63
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,380
It's Tamura Masakazu

64
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,790
He's pretty master-like now

65
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,570
But he's also kind of...

66
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,570
You're right

67
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,400
Please, it's the last card

68
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,300
It's the last one

69
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,550
He's checking your master level

70
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,980
He really is pretty master-like

71
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,660
He's pretty master-like

72
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,330
He's performing at a high level

73
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,500
Whether his audience is big or small

74
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,770
He properly does the same bit

75
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,000
He's unwavering

76
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,540
Once he's decided he's completely set on it

77
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,240
Exactly on time!

78
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,750
Please be it

79
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,160
It would have been better if he was more master-like

80
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,830
But he was making such a face

81
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,270
But you had a 90

82
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,200
That was great

83
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,210
That felt good

84
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,710
This is pretty fun

85
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:53,990
Up Next: A French Strategy Game!

86
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,960
Let's Play World Tabletop Games!

87
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,730
The next tabletop game is-

88
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,390
This one

89
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,100
Is called "Quoridor"

90
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,100
Each of us will pick a piece

91
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:10,270
France: "Quoridor"

92
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,240
Each piece starts on one side of the board

93
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,880
The first one to reach the other side wins

94
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,680
But also

95
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,480
Each of us gets 5 blocks we can place

96
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,650
I see, we can't go through them

97
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,250
On your turn, you can move your piece or

98
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,990
Or you can place a block between the tiles

99
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,390
And it blocks two tiles

100
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,030
And if this happens then

101
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,200
You have to go around it

102
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,200
Exactly

103
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,200
You use the blocks to force paths

104
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,840
It's that kind of game

105
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:53,010
This time the four will play the game without Tanaka

106
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,480
Then let's start from Endo

107
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,750
I see

108
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,900
No big moves, just a slow advance

109
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,980
I place it on its side?

110
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,980
Yes on its side

111
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,110
It blocks two tiles?

112
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,110
Yes

113
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,520
It blocks two tiles...

114
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:43,330
If you use a block, you must block two tiles

115
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,520
So you have to block two

116
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,190
I wish I knew that earlier

117
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,330
That's huge

118
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,600
You can't block just one

119
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,340
You might obstruct yourself too

120
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,070
I see, I see

121
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,480
Right in front of Endo

122
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Now it's Hosei's turn

123
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,800
To the side right, since you couldn't go forward

124
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,310
This is bad isn't it

125
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:33,040
Your own wall has come back to bite you

126
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,050
What do you think you're doing

127
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,450
What are you doing, this is terrible

128
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,120
It's become like this?

129
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,890
This guy is so unreasonable

130
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:55,730
Endo and Matsumoto both blocked, a big play!

131
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,100
But we only have five blocks

132
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,740
If we only have five...

133
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,040
Not much you can do

134
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,710
So I can't move forward?

135
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,610
Right, you can't move into another piece's space

136
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,960
Nice

137
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,960
Oh, nice

138
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:32,200
Hosei's path is blocked!

139
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,300
Nice, Endo

140
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,940
Ah I see, you're blocking Hosei

141
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,540
Matsumoto and Endo both blocked!

142
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,540
What are you doing?

143
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,150
You're not even a part of this

144
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,490
I'm just planning ahead

145
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,330
This is bullying!

146
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,330
Quite a barricade has formed

147
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,230
Quite a detour now

148
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,970
Hosei is boxed in!

149
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,570
Hosei is seriously...

150
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,350
Matsumoto and Endo both blocked!

151
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,920
Now wait a minute this isn't funny

152
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,820
Me and Endo

153
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,820
only have one tile to use!

154
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:30,830
Only path

155
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,190
Seriously this is impossible for me

156
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,130
Me and Endo are in the worst position

157
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,160
What do we do?

158
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,770
Even if I move down there

159
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,230
That makes sense

160
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,940
Hamada's path is blocked!

161
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,940
If you put it there it's hard for me

162
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,510
Matsumoto

163
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:53,920
The blocks have slowed the game down

164
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,960
Eh!?

165
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,060
Is he allowed to do that!?

166
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,200
Their only path is even more blocked

167
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,730
Matsumoto this is impossible

168
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,730
Why would you do that?

169
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,570
I've never even blocked you before

170
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,870
A Super Spartan State!

171
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,440
No it's just that kind of game

172
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,440
Why are you going after me so hard

173
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,320
This became incredibly Spartan

174
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:35,930
It continues! The crushing battle

175
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:44,140
"Quoridor"

176
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:44,140
The French Strategy Game

177
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,370
Who will be the first to reach the goal?

178
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,010
Eh, hang on

179
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,110
Yeah he needs to be stopped

180
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,550
Hamada's path's path is blocked!

181
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,620
But Hosei needs to be blocked too

182
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,450
Hosei is just 1 tile away

183
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,420
I can block Hosei but...

184
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,760
Hosei's path is blocked!

185
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,760
Then I'll stop him here

186
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,300
Yeah, right there

187
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,700
Hosei's path is blocked!

188
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,140
So here, this is the end

189
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,340
Right, that's the end

190
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,580
Hosei can reach the end in 3 moves

191
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,280
If I do this we'll be good right?

192
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,880
Hosei's path is blocked!

193
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,620
Just now I

194
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,520
Used my last piece for everyone's sake

195
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,400
You're really angry aren't you

196
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Matsumoto's path is blocked!

197
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,730
So blatant

198
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,640
He's incredibly angry

199
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,310
We need to stop him too

200
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,680
Only two more tiles

201
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,750
Endo's path is blocked!

202
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,710
I expected as much

203
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,250
So hostile!

204
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,490
There's no more blocks

205
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,060
We're in the endgame now

206
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,230
What do I do?

207
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,370
Well of course

208
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,980
This isn't blocked

209
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,980
Hosei isn't blocked

210
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,950
My goal is over here?

211
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,820
No it's here

212
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Eh, hang on, seriously?

213
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,020
Matsumoto's path is blocked!

214
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,960
This has nothing to do with you!

215
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,270
Me and you are aiming for different schools

216
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,740
You can just go to whatever school you like

217
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,110
This is weird

218
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,110
It's not weird

219
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,240
You're out of walls now right?

220
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,240
Yeah I'm all out

221
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,050
Eh, hang on

222
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,050
Now that it's like this, I'm in a pretty bad spot

223
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,960
Endo's path is blocked!

224
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,330
Of course

225
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,860
But now Hosei is out of walls too

226
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,130
Yeah and I'm all out too

227
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,970
My turn right?

228
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,710
What's up with this? Shouldn't it be like this?

229
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,580
Each of them blocks two so

230
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,090
This makes a huge difference

231
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,060
I wish their size was correct

232
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,730
Such a narrow passage

233
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,860
It's my dream school, why is everyone getting in my way?

234
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:06,000
I didn't choose such hard place

235
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:15,950
Finally, the battle reaches its conclusion!

236
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:24,290
"Quoridor"

237
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:24,290
The French Strategy Game

238
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,690
It's finally settled, who is the winner?

239
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,510
It looks like

240
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,510
The only thing I can do

241
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,510
Is this

242
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,780
Hamada's path is blocked!

243
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,350
I have two blocks left...

244
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,420
Wait you still have two blocks!?

245
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,420
Yeah I do

246
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,150
Incredible

247
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,650
But still

248
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,160
This is bad, he's only two away

249
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,360
I'm already

250
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,360
unstoppable

251
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,500
He's right, we can't put block him

252
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,470
Before this we must've screwed up

253
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,300
Aah, we've lost

254
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,610
You guys ****** me way too much

255
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,640
Well it can't be helped

256
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,950
You absolutely would not let me go to my school

257
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,820
No we weren't doing that

258
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,520
You just can't help but get in my way

259
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,490
Matsumoto's path is blocked!

260
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,460
Sorry this was the only play left

261
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,420
Wait wait wait

262
00:23:31,990 --> 00:24:09,990
Translation - Tekno, Typesetting - Teknova, Timing - Teknonavi, QA - TeknoProasheck

263
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,460
It was the only move left

264
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,800
You keep increasing it

265
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,560
An amazing road has formed

266
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,570
This is so stupid

267
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,770
What the hell is this!

268
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,370
This one is Hosei's too

269
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,810
And now I win

270
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,880
Hosei's Victory!

271
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,480
That took quite some time

272
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,950
Yes, surprisingly so

273
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,950
That was fun wasn't it?

274
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,550
Yeah it was
