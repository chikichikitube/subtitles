2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,780
We're doing something different today.
Why are you so tired?

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,790
Well, you know, I don't know
what's happening on today's show

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,060
We've been watching those
Obon Kobon guys until recently

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:26,070
Obon Kobon

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,430
I'm so tired

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,230
It's like I've been made to do
40 laps around the track

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,900
Because it was two weeks long

9
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,900
Really, that was...

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,570
Well, yeah, but it ended well

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,570
traumatic, wasn't it?

12
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,540
My emotions are still
running high

13
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,410
Well, this is something
completely different

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,410
Well then, she we call them out?

15
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,410
Who is it?

16
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,180
Presenter, come in!

17
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,720
It's Viking's Kotōge!

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,720
Kotōge?

19
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,720
Hello!

20
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,390
No no, definitely at this point...

21
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,320
Obon Kobon are going to come out

22
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,760
No they won't!

23
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,760
That's impossible

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,630
They definitely won't come
out now. Definitely

25
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,960
We've given up on you

26
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,900
I didn't expect to be rejected

27
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,930
Really? Well, Kotōge...

28
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,940
Thank you

29
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,940
welcome to today's show.

30
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,940
What have you got for us?

31
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,840
Today it's the 3rd installment

32
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,710
of something we haven't
done for a year and a half

33
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,680
And here it is:

34
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,550
Panelist's Theories
Investigation Special

35
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,550
I'm sure you already
remember what this is

36
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,560
Yes, yes, yes.
It's when people here are talking

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,030
They talk a bit at the start

38
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,030
But we don't use that much do we?

39
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,400
When we record this show, during the opening,

40
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,730
this is what the panelists are doing:

41
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:34,740
Every time at the start of recording, the panelists tell us their own theories but this is cut from the show

42
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,400
We ask them theories
they'd like investigated

43
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,210
But we don't air it at all

44
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,480
Why not?

45
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,210
Why not? I think it's strange

46
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,780
Sometimes it's funnier than the rest of the show

47
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,810
Sometimes

48
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,320
I put so much effort into it
sometimes too

49
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,330
Once again we've ammassed a collection
of theories presented during the opening talk

50
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:00,000
So tonight we will introduce and investigate some of these theories

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Panelist's Theories
Investigation Special

52
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,010
First, Nonomura Yukiko's theory

53
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,880
I, um, love movies and

54
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,880
After a movie has finished, you know the end credits?

55
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,350
It seems like..

56
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:20,520
If you leave the cinema in the middle of them, you're not a movie lover

57
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,380
Doesn't it?

58
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,380
That's the impression

59
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,450
But sometimes,
if they're really long→

60
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,730
and in English, it feels like all I'm doing is just searching for Japanese names.

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,730
Ah, yes.

62
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,400
So if there's a personality who's
professed to be a movie lover,

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,870
If the end credits are as long as the actual movie, they will leave before they're over.

64
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,240
(Nonomura) Don't you think?

65
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,240
I want to try it

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,070
Theory: If the end credits are the same length as the rest of the movie, even a movie lover will leave in the middle of them

67
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,910
As long as the movie?

68
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,910
I want to try it. I want to.

69
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,210
That'd be quite hard

70
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,240
It'd be fine if we looped it.
I want to try it

71
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,120
Next is JOY's theory

72
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,080
You know those otakus who support an idol?

73
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,930
They really hate when the idol they like has a relationship with a guy or a male acquaintance, don't they?

74
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,530
They'll get angry, won't they?

75
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,000
But I think if an otaku could get involved with their own idol, they'd do it without thinking.

76
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:17,240
Theory: Even an otaku who hates their idol associating with men wouldn't mind if it were them

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,030
Ah, yes

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,030
That's true

79
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,540
They'll get so angry won't they?

80
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,540
To someone else

81
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,540
Well yes to someone else

82
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,310
But if it were them,
they'd do it straightaway

83
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,080
You've told us something extremely obvious

84
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,220
Huh? Really?

85
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,220
I'm kind of surprised

86
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,220
Wait a second, Matsumoto-san

87
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,390
Is this your first appearance?

88
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,390
Next is a theory from Kirin's Kawashima

89
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,390
Someone who's angry

90
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,760
can get away with using words that don't exist.

91
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,730
Ah

92
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:47,610
Theory: Someone who's angry can get away with using words that don't exist.

93
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,100
Like when someone's being lectured

94
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,100
and apologizing like this,

95
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,640
if ithe person lecturing them is being pretenious and says something like...

96
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,680
"You don't have enough pollination"

97
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,780
They'd probably just say "Yes. I'm sorry"

98
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,080
Even if they don't know the word

99
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,080
Like a loanword from English

100
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,120
An English word?

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,120
If someone says to them a word like that,

102
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,050
they definitely won't say
"What does that mean?"

103
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,060
If someone told them jibberish like "dobengasongeka" they'd just think it's a regional word

104
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,730
They'd probably think you meant "We have to do something" ("Dogyankasentoikan")

105
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,730
Next a theory from Masuda Okada's Okada

106
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,970
My theory is one that I can think
all men will understand.

107
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,940
Everyone here has been to many tourist spots both for work and privately

108
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,950
And according to my data often these will be...

109
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,180
Shrines and temples

110
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,980
And the toilets they have there,

111
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,950
when you're peeing in the men's room

112
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,220
you can almost be seen from outside.

113
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,460
Theory: When peeing in the men's room at temples and shrines you cam almost be seen from outside

114
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,260
It's like "Can't they see me?"

115
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,260
What do you mean?

116
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,760
It's true. There are just
some dead plants there

117
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,830
It's like "From this angle, if a bus arrives now,

118
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,830
"everyone getting off will see me."

119
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,830
Ah, so it's surprising how people aren't more defensive

120
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,800
Ah, yes.

121
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,800
Yes, that's the theory

122
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,140
Next, Horan Chiaki's theory

123
00:04:53,670 --> 00:05:00,480
Sometimes, on this show, you broadcast a collection of theories that panelists have introduced during the openings, right?

124
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,380
So I have one that I've always wanted to tell you

125
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,220
and I think it could be investigated too.

126
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:13,790
If you replaced the caramel part of a custard pudding with cough syrup, no one would notice.

127
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,230
(Horan) Yes →

128
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,230
Because it's kind of sweet, right?

129
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:25,770
Theory: If the caramel in a custard pudding were replaced with cough syrup, no one would notice.

130
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,230
That sweet,
kind of bitter taste

131
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,030
Doesn't caramel-flavored
cough syrup taste the same?

132
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,070
I love it.

133
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,870
I don't really know anything about cough syrup

134
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,170
What?

135
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,870
"It's kind of sweet"?

136
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,080
It's gross that you know that, Hamada

137
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,210
Why? It's sweet, isn't it?

138
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,250
Because I've drunk it

139
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,250
But why do you know that?

140
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,920
When?! Why would you be drinking
cough syrup at your age?

141
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,820
It's because he's that age that he's drunk it

142
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,360
Everyone's had it

143
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,360
Really?

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,160
Next, Miyagawa Daisuke's theory

145
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,460
I've been
thinking a bit

146
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,070
You know André the Giant?

147
00:05:51,700 --> 00:06:09,810
André the Giant

148
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,870
His hair, during his prime--

149
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,240
Well, no one here knows him

150
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,410
A pro wrestler

151
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,410
He was a huge person

152
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,410
At that time,
in his heyday, his hairstyle

153
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,010
If the amount of hair on his head
were yakisoba,

154
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,050
What the hell?

155
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,050
it'd be about 14 portions.

156
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:16,590
Theory: If the hair on André the Giant's head during his heyday were yakisoba, it could feed 14 people

157
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,090
What are you talking about?

158
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,090
What kind of theory is that?

159
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,690
I was thinking it's about that much

160
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,690
You've thought that?

161
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,860
I have, yes. I'm sorry

162
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,390
What are you thinking here?

163
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,100
Theory: Even an otaku who
hates their idol associating
with men wouldn't mind if it
were them

164
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,100
Theory: If the caramel in a
custard pudding were replaced
with cough syrup, no one
would notice.

165
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,100
Theory: If the end credits are
the same length as the rest of
the movie, even a movie lover
will leave in the middle of them

166
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,100
Theory: If the hair on André
the Giant's head during his
heyday were yakisoba, it could
feed 14 people

167
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,100
Theory: Someone who's
angry can get away with using
words that don't exist.

168
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,100
Theory: When peeing in the
men's room at temples and
shrines you cam almost be
seen from outside

169
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,530
Out of these theories...

170
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,360
the one we will investigate is...

171
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,370
this one.

172
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:34,440
Theory: Someone who's angry can get away with using words that don't exist.

173
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,880
And so,

174
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,180
(Staff) Good morning

175
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,180
Good morning

176
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,220
Our challenger will be Saraba Seishun no Hikari's Morita.

177
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:53,060
I think that he will think they're just words he doesn't know

178
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,230
And our target is...

179
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:03,670
Invited to appear on a fake show in which comedians have revealing talks about senpais they're close to,

180
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,300
it's Pumpkin Potato Fry's Tani.

181
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,580
What kind of..

182
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,880
Do you have something to talk about? Like, what topic?

183
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,750
What should we do?

184
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,120
I'll probably be talking about you Morita-san, right?

185
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,720
So... well...

186
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,960
Hmmm

187
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,530
You've been on TV how many times?

188
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,100
This will be my 10th

189
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,130
Yes

190
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,130
Your 10th?

191
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,770
So at this point, you should be getting results

192
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Yes, that's right

193
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,170
Right?

194
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,900
and that means...

195
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,740
So to put it simply

196
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,310
You need actually do some preparation in advance

197
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Yes…

198
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,250
You came in today saying "What should we talk about?"

199
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,220
Honestly, I just think that's ridiculous.

200
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,220
Ah, I'm sorry.

201
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,360
Using his approach to work as
an entry point,

202
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,730
Lecture Mode is turned on.

203
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,700
Then, without delay...

204
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,630
So, today, when I called you here,

205
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,070
that means you've been licked, doesn't it?

206
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,070
Ah, it does. Yes.

207
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,070
And when you've been licked, then

208
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,880
at the very least you need to have thought about

209
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,280
what you're going to talk about.

210
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,280
I see... I'm sorry.

211
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,550
First he hits him with a quick jab,
in the form of a short word...

212
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,120
That means you've been licked, doesn't it?

213
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,120
Ah, it does. Yes.

214
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,590
It's completely ignored.

215
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,390
Then...

216
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,690
It's not like I'm ordering you to get excited here but

217
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,200
I call you because I want you to get excited.

218
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,670
I see. Thank you very much.

219
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,670
If you turn up, but →

220
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,200
it all comes to nothing,

221
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,240
the attitude you've brought with you...

222
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,180
It's probably sogo's profit.

223
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,280
I want you to try your best

224
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Yes

225
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,020
It wastes my time too if I appear with you like this

226
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,460
Is wasting my time something you enjoy doing?

227
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,890
No. That's not ... really

228
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,900
Right? No, if we appear with this, it'll just be...

229
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,100
Jizō's grave, right?

230
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,070
a\And if that happens, what then?

231
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,670
There's no point in doing it

232
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,710
No no, It's like I'm also wasting my time here

233
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,980
That's right

234
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,310
It's probably sogo's profit.

235
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,150
It'll be Jizō's grave, right?

236
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,880
Two unfamiliar idioms in a row also get ignored

237
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,620
After that...

238
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,820
I'm really wondering what you do when you're with other comedians senior to you

239
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,260
I keep telling you this

240
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,360
It's probably Tengen theory but...

241
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,770
It wouldn't hurt to try, right?

242
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,530
In the end...

243
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:54,340
You just think I'm nothing but a sparse youth

244
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,340
That's how I see it

245
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,340
Yeah

246
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,980
Something like that, when it happens, I won't think

247
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,550
with the Breck Effect, "ah this guy is good", will I?

248
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,280
It's all →

249
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,590
Murasame Koji and that's not alright

250
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,890
This is too much

251
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,560
This one is too much

252
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,560
You're overdoing it!

253
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,630
(Morita) Honestly, yeah.

254
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,200
Yes...

255
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,230
Huh, what? Got something to say?

256
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,230
No...

257
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,600
I think it's as you say

258
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:32,040
And asking "How many jokes do you write a week?" or thinking "Just writing one is enough" just won't do

259
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,080
You think you're going to M-1. You want to, don't you?

260
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,320
That's right. Of course, yes

261
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,520
Because it's like doing manzai on the Tengu stage

262
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,590
A young person like you
needs to do it right

263
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,260
I like this kind of thing

264
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,060
And the other day you competed in the Kansai competition but didn't get anything right?

265
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,860
That's right.

266
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,660
That's right. It wasn't good.

267
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,130
So you got nothing, didn't you?

268
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,130
Correct

269
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:59,500
So it ended super flat

270
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,070
(Morita) If you do it, do it right

271
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,500
I see...

272
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,470
It'll always be like that

273
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,410
You'll end up as just a scoop saint

274
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,320
People who keep doing that don't get treated well

275
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,320
No... that's right

276
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,250
Right?

277
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,720
If you don't do it right...

278
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,890
it's going to be over for you, as a scoop saint

279
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,360
Wh- What...

280
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,830
It'll be over?

281
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,830
Yeah

282
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:31,500
If I keep messing up, it'll be over for me?

283
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,500
Yeah

284
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,770
Well, if you don't have the skills...

285
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,670
Right. I understand.

286
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,140
Don't you think?

287
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,140
I think so, yes

288
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,940
"Scoop saint"

289
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,940
In reaction to this word,

290
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,580
it seemed as though Tani was going to
ask for an explanation for the first time.

291
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,850
It'll be over?

292
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,850
Yeah

293
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,350
It's going to be over for me ...

294
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,890
And then...

295
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,860
I guess you don't know
what to do

296
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Of course I do

297
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,290
No, you don't. Seriously

298
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,500
I think I just don't have a stung face
("have a stung face" = to feel uneasy)

299
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,400
Huh, what does "stung face" mean?

300
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,640
You're the one saying things people don't know

301
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,610
Now he's doing it

302
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,080
What you said ... stung

303
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,280
I know what that means. Did it sting or not?

304
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,340
It didn't, did it?

305
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,580
No, it did

306
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,750
The gyōtan is not good enough,
so I don't think so.

307
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,750
"Gyōtan"?

308
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,990
The gyōtan's not good enough, is it?

309
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,990
"Gyōtan"...

310
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,560
No, the words stung, but my face is probably...

311
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,330
No. If they had, I'd feel it. That's what I'm saying, OK?

312
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,470
I'm sorry, you're right

313
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,040
Safe

314
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,540
People who make it in this world, definitely have something, right?

315
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,610
They hold on to that something and succeed

316
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,580
All of them

317
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,580
They all have some →

318
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:55,620
King Venus On, so they-

319
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,620
Is that like a weapon?

320
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,390
Is it a weapon or something?

321
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,560
Seriously

322
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,930
That's...

323
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,960
Hold on. Sorry. This is unrelated but...

324
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,830
Wh- what is...

325
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,230
What?

326
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,540
There was a long word I don't know

327
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,980
And so, because he clearly asked for
an explanation...

328
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,980
we end it here.

329
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,180
Prank Reveal

330
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,720
(Tani) Is that a weapon?

331
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,590
(Staff) Thanks for your help

332
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,590
I knew it...

333
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,960
(Staff) Good work

334
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,390
Ah, it has to be...

335
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,890
(Staff) That went well

336
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,260
I think so, yes

337
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,160
Wh... What was it?

338
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,840
The wrong words?

339
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,840
I thought I just didn't know them...

340
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,570
So you're not really angry?

341
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,480
I'm not worried about the words

342
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,210
The words were all I cared about

343
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,950
(Tani) Really?
You're not angry?

344
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,690
Seriously,

345
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,790
I was thinking this guy is so full of himself, maybe he's made his own company

346
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,760
Because he can't get along with others

347
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,530
Next is a theory from Knights' Hanawa.

348
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,030
'For the last 20 years, Naitō Takashi
has played only detectives' is my theory

349
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:26,740
Theory: For the last 20 years, Naitō Takashi has only been doing detective roles

350
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,710
I'm currently co-starring with him as one too

351
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,710
Slander…

352
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,780
I've only seen him playing a detective

353
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,780
Oh really?

354
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,750
Always, without any interruptions?

355
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,750
for 20 years.

356
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,750
He's done almost nothing else

357
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,720
For the last 20 years, really.
He's said it himself

358
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,190
"I only play a detective."
So because of that,

359
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,560
I was thinking I'd like for it
to be properly verified.

360
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,390
I see

361
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,900
His shoes are probably as worn down as much as a real detective's

362
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,370
Even if he commits a little crime, he won't get caught

363
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,370
Next, a theory from Ogi Yahagi's Yahagi

364
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,470
I'm not really picky when it comes to food

365
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,980
so if it's some stirred-fried vegetables,

366
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,750
if there's something weird inside,
someone like me would still eat it

367
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,820
What do you mean?
Don't you look at it a bit?

368
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:15,730
Theory: People who aren't picky eaters will eat something weird if it's in a vegetable stir-fry

369
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,790
I'll just eat it without checking

370
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,260
Unlike a picky eater

371
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,260
Someone who
hates onions will check

372
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,230
Or bell peppers for example

373
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,930
I don't need to check,
so I'd probably eat anything

374
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,200
What if there's some excrement in there?

375
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,470
Excrement?

376
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,240
Well... probably

377
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,610
Why?!

378
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,510
Next, Ahn Mika's theory

379
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,950
You know, if all toilets in the world now
were made to have swinging saloon doors

380
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,280
everyone would definitely use them.

381
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:47,830
Theory: If all toilets in the world had saloon doors everyone would definitely use them

382
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,790
Sorry but could we stop with the toilet talk?

383
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,620
That give me a shock

384
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,960
Talking about toilets is still banned

385
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,930
You just spoke without thinking

386
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:50,930
I'm surprised

387
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,300
I think if you think about it, it makes sense

388
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,630
So it would be like this?

389
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,670
Yes, yes, yes!
For many reasons

390
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,640
Because it'deters you, right?

391
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,640
Yes, it puts me off using them

392
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,910
I'm a person who hates
touching doorknobs

393
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,510
Are you teasing me?

394
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,580
(JOY) You're too sensitive

395
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,580
No, I'm not!

396
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,520
Next, a theory from Untouchable's Yamazaki

397
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,920
My theory is that the general public

398
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,420
think that all comedians
work for Yoshimoto

399
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,360
Theory: The general public think all comedians work for Yoshimoto

400
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,930
That can't be true!

401
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,930
They don't!

402
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,230
I don't want to
dig up the past but

403
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,260
there was a big fuss 2 years ago, wasn't there?

404
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,270
Ah the so-called Yoshimoto scandal, yes

405
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,940
At that time, when I was shooting in public
people started telling me

406
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,010
"It must be hard but keep it up!"

407
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,580
And for me it was a hassle
to keep saying "no, you're wrong"

408
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,610
because it had nothing to do with me.

409
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,620
So I'd just say "I'll do my best!"

410
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,920
I wasn't telling them I'd do anything about it

411
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,290
So anyone in the comedy industry --

412
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,260
I work at a place called Jinrikisha

413
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,960
We may work for
Jinrikisha or Sun Music

414
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,930
but the general public will

415
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,400
just think we all work for Yoshimoto.

416
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,370
Next, Hotta Akane's theory

417
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,240
If you go to somewhere like
a big hardware store or airport,

418
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,880
the car park will have sections from A to Z won't it?

419
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,380
So if you park somewhere like section L...

420
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,880
when you say it alphabetically

421
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,020
Can you say it normally?

422
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,220
Huh?

423
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,220
What do you mean?

424
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,890
If I don't sing in my head...

425
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,890
If you don't start from A...

426
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,920
Are you able to say it?

427
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:36,630
Theory: You can't say the alphabet without singing the ABCD song

428
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,930
Well, I kind of get it

429
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,930
If I don't sing
A-B-C-D

430
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:36,570
If I don't say it, that melody
is definitely playing in my head.

431
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,270
At the Disneyland car park,
they have the Goofy section

432
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,210
I don't know where Goofy is

433
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,950
Are you visiting Disneyland?

434
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,750
There are times when I go there.
Why wouldn't there be?

435
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,420
And when did this occur?

436
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,290
What's with the sudden ambush?

437
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,290
No, when was this?
I was under the impression→

438
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,060
that you hadn't been there
when you were growing up.

439
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,030
So this Goofy story,
when did it happen?

440
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,530
I am

441
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,530
Is anyone interested in this?

442
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:11,200
In my being interrogated by Hamada on whether I go to Disneyland or not?

443
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,870
We are interested

444
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,870
We are. We are.

445
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm extremely interested

446
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm interested. What's wrong with that?

447
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,910
I'm just asking you
when this happened.

448
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,350
This is too much trouble. Can we do it tomorrow?

449
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,750
What is this?!

450
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,420
Actually I'm going tomorrow too

451
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,120
No! You're definitely not

452
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,120
Next, Nishno Miki's theory

453
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,760
The first boyfriend a girl gets after graduating from AKB is almost always a bad one.

454
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,900
Theory: The first boyfriend after graduating from AKB48 is almost always a bad one

455
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,760
I can tell you. It's not a good story but

456
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,770
in my experience,

457
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,300
I got stuck with two bad guys in a row

458
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,600
No, it's too gross

459
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,600
What kind of bad guy?

460
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,910
Isn't it just you?

461
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,910
No, it's really nasty

462
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,440
(Fujimoto) It's just you, isn't it?

463
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,440
But it's not only AKB...

464
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,750
Idols can't date →

465
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,750
It's idols

466
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,380
so their expectations are too high.
They fall for a guy who looks good

467
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,390
Were you tricked?

468
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,390
and get tricked.

469
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,420
Yes...

470
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,360
How were you tricked?

471
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,260
It's so gross

472
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,390
(Fujimoto) Tell us!

473
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,390
Was it money?

474
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,400
No, a woman.

475
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,200
When I looked at his phone,

476
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,240
I saw him ******* with another woman 3 days prior

477
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,210
That's enough! Quiet, you!

478
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,210
Out of these theories,

479
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,750
Theory: For the last 20 years,
Naitō Takashi has only been
doing detective roles

480
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,750
Theory: If all toilets in the world
had saloon doors everyone
would definitely use them

481
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,750
Theory: People who
aren't picky eaters will eat
something weird if it's in a
vegetable stir-fry

482
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,750
Theory: The first boyfriend
after graduating from AKB48
is almost always a bad one

483
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,750
Theory: The general public
think all comedians work for
Yoshimoto

484
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,750
Theory: You can't say the
alphabet without singing
the ABCD song

485
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,550
the one we will actually investigate is...

486
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,670
Theory: For the last 20 years,
Naitō Takashi has only been
doing detective roles

487
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,670
Theory: If all toilets in the world
had saloon doors everyone
would definitely use them

488
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,670
Theory: People who
aren't picky eaters will eat
something weird if it's in a
vegetable stir-fry

489
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,670
Theory: The first boyfriend
after graduating from AKB48
is almost always a bad one

490
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,670
Theory: The general public
think all comedians work for
Yoshimoto

491
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,670
Theory: You can't say the
alphabet without singing
the ABCD song

492
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,980
Out of these theories,
the one will investigate is

493
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,990
this one:

494
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:55,870
Theory: For the last 20 years,
Naitō Takashi has been
doing only detective roles

495
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:03,380
And so without delay we will start going back from 2021,
investigating all dramas he has appeared in.

496
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:09,820
First, this work, which aired
this year from April to June.

497
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:09,820
Tokyo MPD, Chief of Investigation 5

498
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,250
What?

499
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,530
Murdered because the cake was too different from its photo?

500
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,590
What's this?

501
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,620
I'm curious

502
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,440
Regardless of what the murder motive was, it's a detective role

503
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,230
Continuing, in this work too..

504
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:38,680
MPD Violent Crime - Higuchi Akira

505
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,920
Kikuchi, the cuffs!

506

Here

507
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,980
Detective role

508

Full-body Detective

509
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,750
And in this one too

510
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,360
Out of the stalkers I arrested three years ago...

511
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,720
Detective role

512
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,690
Estimated time of death

Going back 4 years...

522
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:07,710
2021 to 2018
A total of 104 works. All detective roles

523
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:05,030
all dramas he appeared in up to
autumn 2018...

524
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,240
But in this drama
aired in August 2018,

525
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:31,100
Funakoshi Eiichiro Murder Case

526
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,810
I told Ayano-san→

527
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,810
Wh- why?

528
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,780
to bring you here.

529
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,950
What are you doing?!

530
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,790
As usual, another detective role

531
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,090
Or so we thought...

532
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:37,740
Performing the duties of MC in a talk show
Naitō Takashi appears as himself

533
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,270
But because playing oneself
is an irregular situation,

534
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,770
we decide this doesn't count

535
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,640
and continue our search.

536
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,610
Naitō-san

537
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,610
What?!

538
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:59,460
Forensic Woman (Special)


Special Crime Division - Hanashima Wataru 2



Inspector Totsugawa Series 3

539
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,480
Then in 2017...

540
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,150
we finally discover a non-detective role.

541
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,060
And it is...

542
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,970
Firstly, we only managed to collect a tiny amount of blood from the area where the body was found

543
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,970
Public Prosecutor

544
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,010
However, even though this isn't a detective role,

545
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:19,180
it deals with catching criminals and is extremely close.
Thus, for the time being we continue our investigation.

546
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:27,890
Tokyo MPD, Chief of Investigation 2

547
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
After that...

548
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,770
aside from occasionally
playing a public prosecutor,

549
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,280
Naitō plays a detective repeatedly.

550
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:36,430
Tokyo MPD, Chief of Investigation


Forensic Woman



Beat (MPD Violent Crime - Higuchi Akira)

551
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,110
Then, in 2015,

552
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:35,320
we at last find a role that has nothing to with a detective.

553
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:41,440
Naitō Takashi not playing a detective

554
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,990
And it's this:

555
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:53,550
Mito Kōmon (Special)

556
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,970
In Mito Kōmon,

557
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,440
Naito was the second
actor to play Kazaguruma
no Yashichi

558
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,640
And with that,

559
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,260
Theory disproved

560
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,240
By the way, in movies,

561
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,560
Naito regularly plays
non-detective characters

562
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,500
such as this main role.

563
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:15,470
Naito Takashi's drama detective proportion from 2015 to 2021

564
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:15,470
Period drama: 2 roles

565
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:15,470
Himself: 1 role

566
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,820
In the last 7
years,

567
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:15,470
Detective: 205 roles

568
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:15,470
Public prosecutor: 3 roles

569
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,790
out of the dramas
he starred in

570
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:15,430
an astounding 97.16%
were detective roles.

571
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,400
Isn't it?

572
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,400
That's really amazing

573
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,940
But Kazaguruma no Yashichi,
in the modern version...

574
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,940
He kind of is one, yes

575
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,910
He fights evil

576
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,980
He really only plays good people

577
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,980
That's the impression I have

578
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,010
Amazing

579
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,010
Definitely

580
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,020
Great

581
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,020
That wasn't bad

582
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,450
No, it wasn't. Also,
what did you think of Morita?

583
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,960
Ah, I think it was good but

584
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,460
the bit at the end...

585
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,930
So many words came out,

586
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,340
I can't really remember much of it

587
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Definitely

588
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Not really, no

589
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,010
Base something...

590
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,010
He said something about a base

591
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,680
I only remember bits and pieces

592
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,750
Next, Tsuchida Teruyuki's theory

593
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,820
Often in the comedy industry, a senpai will say

594
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,760
"Live somewhere where you can barely afford rent"

595
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,230
They say "if you push yourself,
you'll definitely get work" don't they?

596
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,300
So the kōhai will listen
and do what the senpai says but

597
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,740
my theory is that of the ones
who do that, a majority fail anyway.

598
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,810
Theory: The majority of the comedians told by their senpai to live somewhere unaffordable still don't succeed

599
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,940
They just suffer

600
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,940
Well...

601
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,450
Because only those who
succeed are considered?

602
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,480
Yes. At their workplace,
all the senpais will be doing well

603
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,950
If they weren't, you'd
stop seeing them there

604
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,250
So you listen to senpais doing well

605
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:41,660
But what the unsuccessful senpais say
doesn't really get listened to

606
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,990
Because they don't admire them

607
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,290
So my theory is

608
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,860
If you do what others tell you,
you'll probably regret it.

609
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,300
I see, I see

610
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,870
Next, Kondō Chihiro's theory

611
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,640
My husband's
Ōta  from Jungle Pocket and-

612
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,740
Didn't know that

613
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,270
Really? Hamada-san you've
done a lot to help him

614
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,310
Ah, thank you

615
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,310
He appears so often so

616
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,340
You do?

617
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,340
we do know that

618
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,250
You know that? I'm glad

619
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:07,280
Well, we have two daughters. And my theory is most comedians' children are daughters.

620
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,590
Ah, surely

621
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,590
Aren't there a lot?

622
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,020
Theory: Most comedians' children are daughters

623
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,120
(Kondō) There's so many, right?

624
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,120
I think it's reality rather than a theory

625
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,430
The comedians my husband knows...

626
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,460
Fujimoto-san has
two daughters,

627
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:27,500
FUJIWARA
Fujimoto Toshifumi

628
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:27,500
Nelsons
Wada Manjū

629
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,930
Wada Manjū-san
has a daughter too

630
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,900
Hold on!
You need a bit...

631
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,600
There's quite a gap
between them

632
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,610
Because lots of comedians
are womanizers,

633
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,280
they're more likely to have daughters.

634
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,150
... is what I was about to say, but then you mentioned Wada Manjū and now that theory's iffy too

635
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,280
It doesn't apply to him

636
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,280
You think so?

637
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,190
Next, a theory from Kis-My-Ft2's Nikaidō

638
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,320
It's about Miyata from my group

639
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:59,640
Kis-My-Ft2
Miyata Toshiya

640
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,690
He really never gets angry

641
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,690
Ah...

642
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,690
No wonder what you do, he won't get angry

643
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,670
No matter how tired he is,
or if plans go wrong

644
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,630
He doesn't get angry at all

645
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,240
So, I'd like to know just how much
he can take until he gets angry

646
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,370
Theory: Kis-My-Ft2's Miyata won't get angry no matter what happens

647
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,270
I want to try

648
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,270
You'd like to make him angry?

649
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,470
So it's like you can do this much

650
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,410
Hamada-san is like that too

651
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,310
He doesn't get angry ever

652
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,310
Right?

653
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,310
No way

654
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,150
Isn't Hamada-san like a T-Fal kettle?

655
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,320
Both heat up instantly

656
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,420
Next, a theory from Harisenbon's Haruka

657
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,890
When I'm riding the bullet train,
I'll be there for a while, so

658
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,930
I take off my shoes to relax

659
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,930
While they're off, if those shoes
got a little bit smaller

660
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,400
I wouldn't notice but rather
think my feet had swelled.

661
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:38,610
Theory: If the shoes you took off on the shinkansen got a bit smaller you wouldn't notice

662
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,970
If they'd been switched?

663
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,040
Yes, if swapped in secret,
I think they wouldn't notice

664
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,080
What a simple prank

665
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,080
Next, Kazlaser's theory

666
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,590
Lots of famous people
like manga, right?

667
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,390
Yeah

668
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,420
Deciding which manga is the best always causes arguments. But when I debate it,

669
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,890
it's always with people around my age.

670
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,960
So I really have no idea what manga
young people would find interesting

671
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,930
To find out the best one,

672
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:07,400
I'll have everyone bring the first volume of the manga they think is most interesting

673
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,010
And we'll leave them all in the green room.

674
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:13,040
Then we'll call a young model
for a plausible-sounding job

675
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,650
and make her wait for ages there.

676
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,010
She'll have nothing to do
so she'll read them

677
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,380
Then she'll do the fake job
and go home.

678
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,220
If on the way home she buys the second volume of your chosen manga, you win

679
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:31,260
Theory: A manga is really interesting if you buy
the second volume on the way home

680
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,030
How about it?

681
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,030
Well, it depends if they want to read it

682
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,400
It'll be like buying 2 volumes of "Ashita no Joe"
and then going home

683
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,270
Next, Jinnai Tomonori's theory

684
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,000
If Downtown were
newcomers now,

685
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,710
they wouldn't be this successful.

686
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:47,340
Theory: If Downtown were new comedians right now they wouldn't be so successful

687
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,710
(Jinnai) You wouldn't, right?

688
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,710
We wouldn't be

689
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,740
We would not

690
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,740
You're sure about it?

691
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,740
Of course I am. With a guy like you...

692
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,740
So...

693
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,710
No, no, no. It's nothing to do with me

694
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,710
So if you were young now, Downtown...

695
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,080
Yep, totally impossible

696
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,080
would probably not be possible.

697
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,090
Well, I'd do my best.
But even if I did,

698
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,750
this guy's sexual harrassment
would ruin it all.

699
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,420
(Cookie!) For sure

700
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,320
It's awful how he holds me back

701
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,390
I watched something
from when you were about 24

702
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:08,470
Hamada-san with sunglasses on
and Matsumoto-san in slip-on shoes

703
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,470
What's wrong with that?

704
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,470
With a long stick like Iwaki Masami

705
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,100
That's totally fine

706
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,100
held in his mouth

707
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,770
Are there any 24-year-old
comedians like that now?

708
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,740
Hey, it's strange

709
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,740
It's weird

710
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,740
No no

711
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,740
Then at the teppanyaki restaurant

712
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,410
The owner had just had a baby so

713
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,220
was like "Macchan, hold my baby!",
but the moment he took it

714
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,850
he pretended he was trying to grill it on the hot plate

715
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,560
You can't talk about that now

716
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,120
A scary joke

717
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,590
We can't even use that as a topic now

718
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,100
Then Hamada-san was
screeching with laughter

719
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,100
The mother was too of course

720
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,130
That was the plan,
to put it on the grill

721
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,400
No way, you can't have done that

722
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,610
Because I was totally against it

723
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,610
In that case...

724
00:28:48,610 --> 00:29:00,550
Theory: A manga is really
interesting if you buy
the second volume
on the way home

725
00:28:48,610 --> 00:29:00,550
Theory: If Downtown were new
comedians right now they
wouldn't be so successful

726
00:28:48,610 --> 00:29:00,550
Theory: If the shoes you took
off on the shinkansen got a
bit smaller you wouldn't notice

727
00:28:48,610 --> 00:29:00,550
Theory: Kis-My-Ft2's Miyata
won't get angry no matter what
happens

728
00:28:48,610 --> 00:29:00,550
Theory: Most comedians'
children are daughters

729
00:28:48,610 --> 00:29:00,550
Theory: The majority of the
comedians told by their
senpai to live somewhere
unaffordable still don't succeed

730
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,440
And so, out of these,
the theory we'll actually investigate is...

731
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,700
Out of these,
the theory we'll actually investigate is...

732
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
this one:

733
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:10,660
Theory: A manga is really interesting if you buy the second volume on the way home without thinking after reading the first

734
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:17,730
And so, we will take 3 mangas recommended
by these 3 manga-loving entertainers,

735
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:23,540
and leave the first volume of each in the green room.

736
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:31,110
High school student and popular model
Hinata Maru is the target.

737
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:38,260
Manager

738
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,520
I want plastic surgery

739
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,790
I keep saying that recently

740
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,420
You can't do that

741
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,230
Hinata has no idea at all she's being recorded

742
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,960
Kendō Kobayashi

743
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,680
First, the manga chosen by Kenkoba is...

744
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,170
"Asahinagu"

745
00:29:51,170 --> 00:30:00,410
34 volumes, published from 2011 to 2020 in Big Comic Spirits

746
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,720
As you can see
from the cover,

747
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,090
it's about a high-school girl who's
in the naginata (pole weapon) club

748
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,560
It's a sport manga, which
is quite rare nowadays.

749
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,280
At the start of chapter one,

750
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,350
Even when
weird stuff
like this
happens

751
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,350
What...?

752
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,350
a weird guy on the train

753
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,190
You're cute
so I'll show
you especially,

754
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,190
shows her his crotch. And then,

755
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,260
because It's the first time she's seen one,

756
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,560
she starts hallucinating that an UFO is taking her away.

757
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,160
As for what that has to do with naganata,

758
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,670
it's saying you'll meet all kinds of people.

759
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,370
That's what the first volume's about. I hope you read it

760
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,310
Throughout the whole thing I cried at least 20 times

761
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:32,180
Rereading it now, the part most likely
to make me cry is that flasher

762
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:36,950
Next, it's Kamaitachi's Yamauchi, whose chosen work is...

763
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,880
Here it is.

764
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,590
Wayama Yama's
"Onna No Sono no Hoshi "

765
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:52,400
2 volumes published so far from 2020 to present in monthly magazine "FEEL YOUNG"

766
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,380
It's already been nominated

767
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,010
for pretty much every award.

768
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,320
It's always ranked high.

769
00:30:52,800 --> 00:31:01,370
It's about the daily life of a girls' high school teacher called Hoshi-sensei.

770
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:05,640
A situation arises where he has to keep a dog in his classroom

771
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,180
*CLICK*

772
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,180
One day, the dog→

773
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,890
has someone draw eyebrows on him.

774
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,890
... drew eyebrows
on Setsuko - I
mean Tapioca,
or is an
accomplice,

775
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,890
He asks "who drew eyebrows on the dog?",

776
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,890
raise
your
hand.

777
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,660
and nearly all the girls were involved.

778
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:29,030
This much is about the dog being drawn on.

779
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,470
It's not laugh-out-loud funny but

780
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,140
it's the kind of humor that'll really make you chuckle.

781
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:40,810
And the manga chosen by the theory's proponent, Kazlaser, is...

782
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,230
I've thought about it and it's this

783
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,250
Kawaguchi Kaiji's "Boku wa Beatles"

784
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:54,090
10 volumes published from 2010 to 2012 in "Morning"

785
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,070
A Beatles tribute band
travel back in time

786
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,990
to before the Beatles' time

787
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,090
so they start releasing
Beatles songs.

788
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,490
But they're not just using The Beatles' songs

789
00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:00,630
What if
we released
"I Want to Hold
Your Hand",
"Please Please Me",
and "Yesterday",
then made them
big hits all over
the world?

790
00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:00,630
What
would
John and
Paul do?

791
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,630
to make money or become famous. Rather,

792
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,000
it's to reach the 4 people who should've been The Beatles.

793
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:05,600
Don't you
think those
two would
come up with
songs that
are even
better?

794
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:05,600
with songs
that we've
never
heard.

795
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,600
They think that perhaps

796
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,540
it'll cause them to make new
Beatles songs they don't know.

797
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,310
New
Beatles
songs...

798
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,310
That's
what
I want to
listen to

799
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,310
It's like a great experiment

800
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:15,810
There's also a bit about how the Beatles' songs didn't resonate with people at the time

801
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,350
It's like it's too new to get a reaction

802
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,750
It's like the first time everyone saw
Madical Lovely-san's manzai

803
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,660
If a girl who's probably never listened to The Beatles enjoys this,

804
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,230
then it must be really good, right?

805
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,860
That's why I'd like to try this one

806
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,250
And so, with three very different choices...

807
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,370
The first manga Hinata picks up is...

808
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,440
Ah, this looks good

809
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,780
"Onna no Sono no Hoshi"

810
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,030
Yamauchi's "Onna no Sono no Hoshi"

811
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,000
Then...

812
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,140
she starts to read
while eating a bento

813
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,950
She has a nap along the way

814
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,840
Maru-chan

815
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,880
She finishes the 3 mangas in 2 hours

816
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:25,780
Then, after a fake 10-minute interview, the preparations are complete

817
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,950
I have to buy a book for work.

818
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,760
Do you mind if we stop by the book shop on the way to our next booking?

819
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,760
Sure

820
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,020
Guided by her manager, they pay
a quick visit to a local book shop

821
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,070
(Manager) We're buying together anyway, so I'll pay

822
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,070
Yay

823
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,800
Then I want this

824
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,800
(Manager) Ah, this?

825
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,340
15 minutes later, Hinata comes out having bought something

826
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,080
So, which manga did she buy?

827
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,180
Prank Reveal

828
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,100
We go check

829
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,050
Huh?

830
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,550
What?

831
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,560
Huh, what is it?

832
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,990
(Staff) Could you show us what you just bought?

833
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,070
What?

834
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,870
It's "I Tried Drowning in a Swamp"

835
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,340
(Staff) What is that?

836
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,340
It's like...

837
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,910
Numa de Oboretemitakeredo
by HIRARISA

838
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,910
A collection of essays looking into women's money and desire

839
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,910
Now everyone knows I read this kind of thing

840
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,000
And the other books she bought
weren't manga either

841
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,780
Otsukare Joshi no Fuchō wo Kaizen suru Iyashi Zukan
by Shinoda Hiroaki

842
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,020
Otome Roppō,
by Kamitani Sakura

843
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,020
She purchased in total of 3 books
containing essays for girls

844
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,160
(Staff) We thought you might buy manga since you went to the book shop

845
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:45,030
Ah, I liked them but I thought not today

846
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,200
Huh?

847
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:52,670
(Manager) How about more of those mangas you read earlier?

848
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,670
Ew, no thanks

849
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,410
I didn't really want to read them

850
00:34:55,410 --> 00:35:04,280
Asahinagu






Onna no Sono no Hoshi






Boku wa Beatles

851
00:34:55,410 --> 00:35:04,280
Despite that, here's how she ranked them if she had to choose:

852
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,280
Next, Takahashi Maasa's theory

853
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,940
The first person to go home
when we do All-Star Thanksgiving is →

854
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:21,560
Theory: The first person to go home after All-Star Thanksgiving is Katsumata

855
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,650
Katsumata-san.

856
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,020
Really?

857
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,020
We don't know that

858
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,480
There's around 200
people there, right?

859
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,520
I also try to go home quickly

860
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,520
So you're looking?

861
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:44,690
Katsumata Kunikazu

862
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,030
When I manage to slip out quickly
and think I must be first,

863
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:33,360
as I'm getting in my car,
I always see Katsumata-san in his car

864
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,670
That's amazing. Really?

865
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,670
leaving ahead of me.

866
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,670
I want to catch it
on hidden camera

867
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,970
To always be first, out of so
many entertainers, is impressive, isn't it?

868
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,010
I wonder what his secret is

869
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,690
Next, Kanda Sayaka's theory

870
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,930
I think a manager wouldn't notice if a really good lookalike of the personality they work for got into their car

871
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:04,570
Theory: A manager wouldn't notice if a lookalike got into their car

872
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,550
Ah, that's probably true

873
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,550
Ah...

874
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,520
Now especially,
because of masks

875
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,190
If you just say "good morning"

876
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,190
They don't really look that hard

877
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,190
trying to imitate their voice

878
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,200
We could investigate that,
couldn't we?

879
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,230
I think ours wouldn't

880
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,080
Even if Dowsotowso got in

881
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,080
Next, Ichikawa Saya's theory

882
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,570
I love sumo and

883
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,640
I often go to see it and
report on it too

884
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:33,800
TL note: "dosukoi" = word often used in sumo songs and as a chant

885
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,080
But I've never heard a sumo wrestler
say "dosukoi"

886
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:39,510
Theory: Sumo wrestlers never say "dosukoi"

887
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,580
Ah, they just have that image

888
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,390
It's in sumo songs

889
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,720
Or in training

890
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,720
so they might use it there

891
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,600
I think they never say it
how we imagine it

892
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,550
I've never heard an octopus make kissing sounds either

893
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,810
TL note: referencing a children's game called "chuuchuutakokaina"

894
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:45,070
Right, it's just the shape of their mouth

895
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,100
It's just how we imagine it

896
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,100
The expression

897
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,070
It's like I thought it up for no reason

898
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,440
Dosukoi? For sure

899
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,440
I feel like they don't say dosukoi

900
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,750
But they do say "gocchan desu"

901
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,750
I've heard "gocchan desu"

902
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,660
Next, Katsumata Kunikazu's theory

903
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,650
Mothers will often

904
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,600
Sing a lullaby to make their child fall asleep

905
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,020
They're sleeping
only because of the melody

906
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,530
I think the lyrics don't matter

907
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:15,040
Theory: No matter what a lullaby's lyrics are, a baby will fall asleep

908
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,060
with that "go to sleep"
melody

909
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,530
even if the lyrics
are really weird

910
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,000
They'd never know

911
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,000
or badmouthing people.

912
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,040
A kid'd just fall asleep anyway

913
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,460
Next, Chihara Junia's theory

914
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,750
When I'm watching talk shows
during the day

915
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,680
I won't watch anything specific
but just channel surf

916
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,050
Miyane Seiji from "Miyane-ya"

917
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,760
To a panelist, he'll be like
next up it's you!

918
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,720
Mr. So-and-so, this is like this, this and this

919
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,590
I think for a panelist to pass a question from him

920
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,060
if he's on good form, can take over a minute

921
00:37:45,440 --> 00:38:01,260
Theory: On "Miyane-ya" Miyane can take over a minute to pass a
panelist if he's on good form

922
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,530
First he says their name
quickly, right?

923
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,070
Taka-san, you know this?
It's like this, that and this

924
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,100
But there's this view too,
saying this

925
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,770
And you may think it's like this
but it's actually that

926
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,040
So it's that but this too.
What do you think?

927
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,250
He does

928
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,250
It's true

929
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:07,100
Then Taka-san finishes saying something harmless and inoffensive

930
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,550
And that's pretty much the whole package

931
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:14,000
Next, Suzuki Fuku's theory

932
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,030
Ever since I was young, people have told me

933
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,860
that their son,
or grandson

934
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,530
or friend,
or they themselves

935
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,480
look just like me. All the time.

936
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,690
I've already been told it 100 times

937
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,320
So I'd like the theory that there are
1,000 people who look like me,

938
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,390
Theory: Over 1,000 people look like Suzuki Fuku

939
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,550
to be investigated.

940
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:41,200
In the past we were looking
for people who look like Hamada-san

941
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,830
and Thailand was full of them.

942
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,550
It's true

943
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,620
About 20 in the airport

944
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,620
There were so many

945
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,090
Guys working in farms
looked just like me too

946
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,860
Ah, yes. Really

947
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,860
Definitely

948
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,960
And at Abashiri Prison

949
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,730
There's that doll

950
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,730
Yeah

951
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,390
Exhibition at Abashiri Prison Museum

952
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,700
Like this with a shaven head

953
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,390
Sitting like this on the floor in the prison

954
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,320
Exhibition at Abashiri Prison Museum

955
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,320
That's me

956
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,940
No matter how you look it

957
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,760
Exhibition at Abashiri Prison Museum

958
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,940
That's right

959
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,530
That was his style during high school

960
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,930
Theory: A manager wouldn't
notice if a lookalike got into
their car

961
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,930
Theory: No matter what a
lullaby's lyrics are, a baby
will fall asleep

962
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,930
Theory: On "Miyane-ya"
Miyane can take over a
minute to pass a panelist if
he's on good form

963
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,930
Theory: Over 1,000
people look like Suzuki Fuku

964
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,930
Theory: Sumo wrestlers
never say "dosukoi"

965
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,930
Theory: The first person to
go home after All-Star
Thanksgiving is Katsumata

966
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,180
And so, out of these,
the theory we'll actually investigate is...

967
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:34,580
Theory: A manager wouldn't
notice if a lookalike got into
their car

968
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:34,580
Theory: No matter what a
lullaby's lyrics are, a baby
will fall asleep

969
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:34,580
Theory: On "Miyane-ya"
Miyane can take over a
minute to pass a panelist if
he's on good form

970
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:34,580
Theory: Over 1,000
people look like Suzuki Fuku

971
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:34,580
Theory: Sumo wrestlers
never say "dosukoi"

972
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:34,580
Theory: The first person to
go home after All-Star
Thanksgiving is Katsumata

973
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,750
Out of these,the theory
we'll actually investigate is...

974
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,750
this one:

975
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,690
Theory: No matter what a lullaby's lyrics are, a baby will fall asleep

976
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,860
For this we will have
two entertainers

977
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,030
think up some lullaby
lyrics for us.

978
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,900
First it's...

979
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,770
Let's say good luck. Good luck!

980
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,810
"Good work"

981
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,810
Yes, thank you very much. Excuse me

982
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,710
(Staff) What was that?

983
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,710
No, it just reacted on its own. Sorry

984
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,550
(Staff) Siri?

985
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,550
I think it might be. I'm sorry

986
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,020
Cookie!

987
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,020
Yasei Bakudan

988
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,290
(Staff) "Nen-nen kororiyo"

989
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,920
"Nen-nen korori yo", yes

990
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:13,590
(Staff) We'd like some new lyrics. Is that alright?

991
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,590
Oh, totally totally. Super easy

992
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,360
New lyrics are easy, so easy

993
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,690
Yeah, easy, easy

994
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:24,370
"Nen-nen kororiyo"

995
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:24,370
Time for bed, roll over easily
Good boy, go to sleep

Where's the little one's souvenir gone?
I went over those mountains and
villages to buy a souvenir for the boy

I got some souvenirs from the village,
a denden drum and a shō flute

Wake up Koboshi with a hand drum
Wake up Koboshi with a hand drum

996
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,430
To think up some new lyrics for "Nen-nen kororiyo"

997
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:24,100
takes him 20 minutes

998
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,240
Done

999
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,470
I think what I've written will work

1000
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:32,110
I think they'll sleep. I do

1001
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:37,580
With the cooperation
of this nursery school

1002
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:43,690
Ukima Kizuna Nursery School

1003
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:42,760
we'll be investigating on 1-year olds as they still don't understand words

1004
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,890
OK, time for bed Mei-chan

1005
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,890
Nursery staff
Asahi-san

1006
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,890
Will it work?

1007
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,260
Mei-chan

1008
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,860
Mei-chan good night

1009
00:40:51,830 --> 00:41:04,010
Four, five, six silver-capped molars

1010
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:17,750
Seven, eight teeth in total

1011
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:22,660
What if she remembers it?

1012
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,990
Kids do...

1013
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:35,840
Gather them up and melt them down

1014
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:49,690
Just enough to make a Zippo

1015
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:56,690
The front teeth fall out

1016
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,000
She's asleep

1017
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,930
Even a song about silver teeth worked

1018
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,210
The next person who'll be writing lyrics for us is...

1019
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,510
Shooo!

1020
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,320
Yeah! Yeah!

1021
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,280
Hollywood Zakoshishō

1022
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:36,330
Schubert's Lullaby

1023
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:36,330
Sleep, sleep, sleep, in Mother's arms
Sleep, sleep, sleep in Mother's hands
To the sound of a good song
In the joyful dream

Sleep, sleep, sleep, in Mother's arms
Sleep, sleep, sleep in Mother's hands
In the warmth of her sleeve
Sleep in her arms

1024
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,520
And the lullaby this time

1025
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:29,360
♬～ Sleep, sleep, sleep

1026
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,530
is a song that has been putting
children across the world to sleep:

1027
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,040
Schubert's Lullaby.

1028
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,600
I'm done. Yeah

1029
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,640
This is good

1030
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,740
I thought about the baby and
put my feelings into words

1031
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,810
It's a soothing feeling

1032
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,180
And so...

1033
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,720
Hiroto-kun, time for bed

1034
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,190
Hiroto-kun

1035
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,090
OK then, I'll hold you

1036
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,970
This time the difficulty level has been raised as we investigate with a crying baby

1037
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
Let's see what happens

1038
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:23,410
(TL note: Hollywood Zakoshishō's usual jibberish)
Ambaran Kambaran Hanmakanma Hanmakanma

1039
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:34,660
Bonboron Dondoron Hanmakanma

1040
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:40,500
She succeeds in calming him down by doing
Hanmakanma while holding him

1041
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,140
Can she keep going and put him to sleep?

1042
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:57,780
Jonjoron Beronberon Hanmakanma

1043
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:05,490
Atatata Atetete Tetetetei Atatetete

1044
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:12,330
Result: the baby didn't fall asleep but became Zakoshi-like

1045
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,330
He's been hypnotized

1046
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,130
I see

1047
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,200
That's how it is

1048
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,170
The teacher learned the lyrics well, didn't she?

1049
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:23,540
She did, and without laughing

1050
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,110
We can laugh but as Matsumoto-san
said earlier

1051
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,710
What if they remember it?

1052
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,220
A child saying that

1053
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,220
Such strange lyrics

1054
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,650
It's scary if they start singing it at night

1055
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,320
Yes, but...

1056
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:40,760
if they fall asleep to "a tooth fell out!", that's perfect.

1057
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,730
It'll just roll out

1058
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:43,060
It would be

1059
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:43,060
Just right, timing-wise right?

1060
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,060
And Kazlaser's?

1061
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,430
Also

1062
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,430
She didn't take it, as expected

1063
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:51,770
Theory: A manga is really interesting if you buy
the second volume on the way home

1064
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:51,900
I wanted to hear more of the high-school student
and her manager's conversation

1065
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,040
She's stopping the plastic surgery

1066
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,840
She's like "I want surgery!"

1067
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,840
We had a glimpse of reality

1068
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,540
The manager's stopping it

1069
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:03,180
It's like "No way!"

1070
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:03,580
Per the company's rules

1071
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,550
OK well,

1072
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,090
Next time the theories pile up,

1073
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,620
I didn't really remember much of it

1074
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,620
shall we do this again?

1075
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,590
I couldn't tell you one if you asked me

1076
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,590
Really?

1077
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,890
I can't remember even one

1078
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,890
Not even one?

1079
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:20,560
I think it's your brain that's the problem

1080
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,130
Hamada-san did you?

1081
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,600
Kacchan's was...

1082
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,400
Huh, what was it again?

1083
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:28,470
I totally forgot

1084
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:28,470
You forget that?!

1085
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,340
No, Kacchan's was...

1086
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,340
What the hell

1087
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,710
I was thinking about
what he said

1088
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,740
The lullaby, right?

1089
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,740
Yes that's it

1090
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:38,550
Don't act more stupid than me

1091
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,350
I'm not

1092
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,350
It's awful, really

1093
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,820
Your stupidity's starting to exceed mine

1094
00:45:42,820 --> 00:46:14,750

1095
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,770
Next week

1096
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:50,040
Did I need to fall so far?

1097
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:50,040
This hole's so deep!

1098
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,110
A hole over 3 meters deep that
can't be escaped without help

1099
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:56,080
An extremely evil prank

1100
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,080
When are the staff coming? So lazy

1101
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,050
Have they forgotten about this?

1102
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,120
After falling in a hole,
the Prank Reveal doesn't come

1103
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,590
If left there until sunset,
can they stay sane?

1104
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:10,060
Hey! Help!

1105
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:10,060
What's the point of this?
