What did you do?

Masatoshi Hamada

16
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,340
What'd you do?

17
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,900
You just gave me a look

18
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,900
Yes, I just looked at you but...

19
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,180
I get yelled at just for that??

20
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,860
I don't know how you can ever work together

21
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,980
You must've woke up on the wrong side of the bed, Hamada-san

22
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,160
Trust me, I won't look your way

23
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,420
He got you good

24
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,420
I'm scared now

25
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,960
By the way, what's with your small bag?

26
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,120
That's new, right?

27
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,480
No, I've had it for awhile

28
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,600
You're serious?

Naoya Orita

31
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,180
Good morning

32
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,220
Matsumoto-san has requested that all of you...

33
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,500
Oh, I just assumed he was running late

34
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,360
Me too

35
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,920
What do you want?

36
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,760
Well, he was wondering

37
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,260
how well you know his likes and dislikes

38
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,060
He seemed very preoccupied with this idea

39
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,220
He's that curious?

40
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,380
I don't get it

41
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,640
So what should we do?

42
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,560
Well, he wants you to come to studio

43
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,940
But why?

44
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,040
Why can't we talk about it here?

45
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
We can discuss it here, right?

46
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,040
He was very set on having it in the studio

47
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,460
How can I feel good about this?

48
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,220
Am I right?

49
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,040
Downtown Presents:
Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahende!!

50
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,140
Wow!

51
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,520
What a huge space we've got here!?

52
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,620
He's in here?

53
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,860
They get invited into one of largest studios

54
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,560
Yes

55
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
In here?

56
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,820
But why in this studio?

57
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,320
Yeah, why?

58
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,640
Wow!

59
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,940
How big is this studio?!

60
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,600
It's gigantic

61
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
It feels huge when there's nothing in here

62
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,460
Where's Matsumoto anyhow?

63
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,140
Matsumoto-san is...

64
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,360
What's that say?

65
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,680
What's this?

66
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,040
What's that sign say?

67
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,600
"Present Something Matsumoto Likes and Win His Heart!"

68
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,640
There used to be a show like this

69
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,100
What?

70
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,180
This will tell us if he likes certain things?

71
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,360
So we put an object here?

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,560
His favorite things go there

73
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,520
I see

74
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,320
Should we go for it?

75
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,980
Win him back?

76
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,240
Let's go find stuff he might like

77
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,600
Since we're here, there's no turning back

78
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,960
What can we find around here?

79
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,920
They search for items Matsumoto might like...

80
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,040
30min later

81
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,040
We got some stuff...

82
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,320
We got some random things...

83
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,140
Now what?

84
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,380
What's first?

85
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,060
Let's just pick one

86
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,680
We can pick whatever

87
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,800
He likes these kind of snacks...

88
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,380
Yes he does

89
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's start with one of them

90
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,160
Which one first?

91
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,720
Beef jerky or...

92
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,900
Beef Jerky

93
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,580
Dried squid?

94
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,900
Dried Squid

95
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,200
Which would you pick, Hamada-san?

96
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,620
He likes both of these

97
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,740
But he's getting too old to chew on these...

98
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,020
Too old??

99
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:08,740
Beef Jerky

100
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:08,740
Dried Squid

101
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,060
I know that makes two of us but...

102
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,660
But you're not that old

103
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,500
C'mon, you can still chew on it

104
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,360
I know but this one seems a bit...

105
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,160
I know he's a big fan of this!!

106
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
You sure?

107
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,700
He has always liked gnawing on them

108
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,720
Could you say it any more foul sounding?

109
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:20,660
Beef Jerky

110
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:20,660
Dried Squid

111
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,880
Go with this one?

112
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
That's it

113
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,900
I'm positive about this

114
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,180
You're 100% sure?

115
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,980
Let's see if we can win him over

116
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,460
Here's beef jerky

117
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,320
Beef jerky!!

118
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,520
I'm 100% sure

119
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,040
So that idiot's been hiding in there

120
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,680
Yes, I can her him inside

121
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,020
There's he is!

122
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,680
That's him

123
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,820
What a moron!

124
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,940
That's him alright

125
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,400
Oh, he's taking it!

126
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,000
He's taking it

127
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,060
I thought he'd go for the dried squid but...

128
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,400
I wish he'd hurry up

129
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,400
He's contemplating

130
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,800
Which is it?

131
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,880
He took it!

132
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,620
But seriously, what the hell's wrong with him?

133
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,060
What's that all about?

134
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:23,100
I still

135
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:23,100
have a fond memory

136
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,100
of trying this for the first time...

137
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,780
He remembers liking it the first time he tried it

138
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,140
He remembers that?

139
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,420
That's why he likes it

140
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,880
Seriously, what is this?

141
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,960
How irritating...

142
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,160
So he likes it?

143
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,300
That's why he took it!

144
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,820
So you were right!

145
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,580
Right?

146
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,280
You got it, Yama-chan

147
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,280
I knew he liked Beef Jerky

148
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,920
Is that so?

149
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,920
Does he have a sweet tooth?

150
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,960
Like this Swiss roll?

151
00:04:41,960 --> 00:05:05,760
Swiss Roll

152
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,300
Right, the Swiss roll

153
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,020
I'm stumped...

154
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,120
Does he eat sweets when you guys go out?

155
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,960
He started to recently...

156
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,240
He never used to

157
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,380
Right, he never touched sweets

158
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,500
until recently

159
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,400
So he orders dessert?

160
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,480
Yeah, I catch him munching on dessert all the time

161
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,200
Can you be less graphic?

162
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,580
Did that sound bad?

163
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,860
I didn't mean to...

164
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,940
I'm curious about what would happen with the roll

165
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,280
It's a mystery item

166
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,080
I would like to know his position on this one

167
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,920
Next up is the Swiss Roll

168
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,880
Is Matsumoto a fan?

169
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,500
He started to eat sweets recently

170
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,160
You sure?

171
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,700
Yes...

172
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,240
Even Swiss rolls?

173
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,100
What's with the sound effects?

174
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Please let me smack him once

175
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,980
Seriously, what the hell do you think you're doing?

176
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,100
Take it already!

177
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
He must be contemplating

178
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,720
He's thinking about it?

179
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Does he like it or not?

180
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,320
Can't you reach?

181
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:50,900
See?

182
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,500
You were right!

183
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,440
You got it?

184
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,360
Why the stare down?

185
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,020
Very hard stare down

186
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,140
I wish he'd hurry up

187
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,860
Incredible!

188
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,000
I didn't know...

189
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,560
I had no idea...

190
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,320
Right?

191
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,280
Because of its

192
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,280
robust flavor...

193
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,360
Shut the hell up

194
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,260
he likes it because

195
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,940
I don't get it

196
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,360
What's a robust flavor?

197
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,840
He lost me

198
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,530
Let's yank him outta there and beat him up?

199
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,640
Is that OK?

200
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,220
If Hamada-san if giving us permission, then...

201
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,220
We'll gladly help you

202
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,720
What a combo though

203
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,020
Beef Jerky and Swiss roll

204
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,460
He likes them for sure

205
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,750
We pretty much got things we like

206
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,700
You're right

207
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,300
I don't know if it's a coincidence but...

208
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,790
But who from Osaka wouldn't be into Takoyaki?

209
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,040
Of course, he likes it

210
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,360
Or the pork buns

211
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,900
Hit him with the Takoyaki?

212
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's go for it

213
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,060
He's 100% into this

214
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,680
We did something like this before...

215
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,020
That's right!

216
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,360
I'm pretty sure he likes these

217
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,960
Let's put them right here

218
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,060
Right on the line

219
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,280
What?

220
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,020
This thing isn't designed well

221
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,820
Not only that, but something's wrong with his teeth

222
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,600
Where's his other tooth?

223
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,560
What happened?

224
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,120
Can he take it?

225
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,120
He needs to find a way to grab it

226
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,640
If he likes it enough, he'll get it

227
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,520
That's right

228
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,750
He can make it happen

229
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,700
It's still inside the square

230
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,060
He's gonna pull a muscle

231
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,100
That'll hurt

232
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Where there's a will, there's a way

233
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,340
If he wants it bad enough...

234
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,960
If he likes it, he'll get it

235
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,720
He got it!

236
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,520
He loves it

237
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,000
Incredible!

238
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,800
Because Takoyaki always

239
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,800
makes me ecstatic

240
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,120
It doesn't take much...

241
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,600
All it takes is Takoyaki to make him ecstatic

242
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,400
Only Takoyaki...

243
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,560
He's from Osaka after all...

244
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,950
You got a point

245
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,540
Good point

246
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,880
Yama-chan, your turn

247
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,800
Offer him something

248
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,580
Well, well, well...

249
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,580
Endo and Tanaka just went so...

250
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,800
I see...

251
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
How about this one?

252
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,360
What's that?

253
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,520
This is more like a "necessity"

254
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,300
It's a hair clipper!

255
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,750
What did you think it was?

256
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,720
I thought it was an electric razor

257
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,860
It looks similar

258
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,020
OK, so you choose the clipper

259
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,020
Matsumoto's good friend, Yamasaki, chooses the hair clipper

260
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,680
I'm sure he likes this

261
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,760
A different movement

262
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,260
What's he doing?

263
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,200
Is he confirming something?

264
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,600
He's looking at it

265
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,240
Oh, he can pick things up

266
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,560
I thought he could only pull things in

267
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,020
He's still looking at us

268
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,240
He's got it in his hand

269
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,800
How's it gonna be?

270
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
Which is it?

271
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,700
It's not something

272
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,700
to like or dislike,

273
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,700
right?

274
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,550
It's neither, I guess

275
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,800
It's not a "like" or "dislike"

276
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,450
See, you shouldn't have picked something like that

277
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,450
From now on...

278
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,480
If you're wrong, you will be

279
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,480
slapped in the face

280
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,480
I don't want that

281
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,920
Seriously, what's this all about?

282
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,860
By the way, his voice is way too distorted

283
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,660
His voice isn't clear

284
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,980
It's hard to understand

285
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,760
Endo, you go again

286
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,400
Shall I?

287
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,840
I don't want to be wrong

288
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,860
A face slap?

289
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,060
I don't want to be slapped

290
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,700
Who's slapping us anyhow?

291
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,500
I choose the socks

292
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,920
Just pick what you like

293
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,780
You're right

294
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,260
These are quite useful...

295
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
See these toe socks?

296
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,720
You're going for it?

297
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,160
That's your final pick?

298
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,580
Yes

299
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,160
Go for it then

300
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,200
Here we go

301
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,780
Here's a pair of toe socks

302
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,720
He sounds a little different

303
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,660
He's got a different set of teeth, too

304
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,540
His character keeps changing

305
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,460
Take them!!

306
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,400
There! He got them!

307
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,040
Take them already!

308
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,600
Keep it down!

309
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,700
The machine's broken

310
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,180
It's completely out of order

311
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,700
It's sweating bullets too

312
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,780
He doesn't like them...

313
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,800
A slap

314
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,800
from Tanaka

315
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,420
From Tanaka?

316
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,900
So I slap him?

317
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,080
I'm supposed to slap Endo then?

318
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,860
I see, Tanaka gets to slap me

319
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,920
Me?

320
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,380
This sucks

321
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,380
I don't like it either

322
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,720
What're you gonna do?

323
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,040
Shouldn't it be Yamasaki or Hamada-san?

324
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,700
Well, it was an order

325
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Ok, I'm ready

326
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,120
This sucks

327
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,280
You ready?

328
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,860
He's looking!

329
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,660
He witnessed it

330
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,920
He peeked

331
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,100
Yes, he was looking

332
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,360
Was that good?

333
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,720
Was that good?

334
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,980
OK, I'll take it

335
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,600
OK

336
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,680
That was good

337
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,360
He sounds very easy going

338
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,580
He's really pissing me off now

339
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,960
Well, not much I can do now

340
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,820
I'm feeling this one

341
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,120
This comes in handy when your face is sweaty

342
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,840
I choose the wet wipes

343
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,120
I've got a good feeling

344
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,240
Go for it

345
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,080
I'll get him

346
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,080
Good luck!

347
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,840
Here's a set of wet wipes

348
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,900
What the...?

349
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,160
He's looking!

350
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,620
There he is!!

351
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,160
He's out!

352
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,160
Using both hands even!

353
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,980
Pretty good

354
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,300
That's a new move!

355
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,920
He's acting like he's into them

356
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,180
Hurry the hell up!!

357
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,180
Don't try to break the machine!

358
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,380
He breaks easily

359
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,360
You hurt his feelings!

360
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,360
Why didn't he hurry up and grab it?

361
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
I mean, he's already sweaty and gross

362
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,800
Because you tore my spirit in half

363
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,520
See that?

364
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,040
It's not about just the things he likes

365
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
Slapping him was a bad move?

366
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,720
Sorry about that

367
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,000
I apologize

368
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,760
Endo slaps Hamada

369
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,220
No way

370
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,280
Phew!

371
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,960
I was just thinking, "Please don't make me slap Hamada-san"

372
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,280
This sucks!!

373
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,880
Hamada-san, I don't know if I can...

374
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,680
I need to watch this closely

375
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
You don't get to see this too often

376
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,140
This never happens

377
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,460
I'm sorry in advance

378
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,560
Please don't take this personally

379
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,660
Damn, he's been staring the whole time

380
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,000
Right, he's been staring with both eyes

381
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,080
He's not even trying to hide

382
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,120
That's beyond peeking

383
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,820
He might as well come all the way out

384
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,960
Please excuse me

385
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,720
Look at him chuckling

386
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,240
No hard enough

387
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,060
I thought that was good enough

388
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,500
I disagree!

389
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I slapped him fair and square!

390
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,980
Hit him a little harder

391
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,540
What a nightmare

392
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,940
Yeah, pretty hellish

393
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,600
This is the worst

394
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,420
What a bad deal for both of us

395
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,800
Endo, there's not much you can do now

396
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,260
Even Hamada-san can't do anything about this

397
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,660
Just make this one count

398
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,720
What the...

399
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,520
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKING AT!!??

400
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,520
He's not shy about this

401
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,740
Just get over with

402
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,000
Right, I don't want to have to do this again

403
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,640
Agreed

404
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,320
Try to ignore him

405
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,660
I won't hold back then

406
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,200
Here I go!

407
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,520
Ready?

408
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,300
You OK, Hamada-san?

409
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,160
OK, Hamada-san!!??

410
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,160
Hamada-san!!

411
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,900
Tell me you're OK

412
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,000
You OK?

413
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,100
My ear is ringing

414
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,220
Ringing ear

415
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,980
That was

416
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,000
awesome

417
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,160
"That was awesome"

418
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,440
How dare you hide behind there and laugh hysterically

419
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,240
That shook my head

420
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,740
I'm so sorry

421
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,480
I'm mature enough to keep my composure in front of the camera

422
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,860
Wait, you'd be pissed if there were no cameras?

423
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,300
What would the viewers think if I got seriously pissed off?

424
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:38,180
Next up, Tanaka chooses an electric toothbrush

425
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,260
Electric brush?

426
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,060
Electric or not,

427
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,140
He'll like it

428
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,900
Who doesn't like brushing his teeth?

429
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,500
Come on!

430
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,960
Get it!

431
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,880
Yes, it's electric

432
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,440
Just scoot it in

433
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,080
Bring it home

434
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Just take that with you

435
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,420
Drag it in

436
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,160
It's electric

437
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,960
Hurry the hell up!!

438
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,200
Don't discourage him!

439
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Hamada-san!!

440
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,280
You knew he'd retract once you hit him!?

441
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,240
We don't have all day here

442
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,540
But he went away because you hit him!

443
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,880
Maybe he just didn't want it

444
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,080
Right, he didn't like it from the get go

445
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,960
I agree!

446
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,440
Well, can we ask him why he left?

447
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,620
Could you tell us why?

448
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,600
Because I was physically violated

449
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,260
Hamada-san...

450
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,560
So it was Hamada-san...

451
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,180
It makes no sense!

452
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,700
Otherwise, he would have taken it

453
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,580
And here come the slap

454
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,380
Hamada slaps Tanaka

455
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,260
Let's make it quick

456
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,000
Go easy on me

457
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Don't worry, I'll go easy

458
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,820
Slap him

459
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,820
using bad aim

460
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,800
Bad aim?

461
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,780
Not good

462
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,900
So not directly on the cheek?

463
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,340
He could get hurt

464
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,840
So hit me over here?

465
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,500
Like towards the back of my head and stuff?

466
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,220
What if I just graze your face?

467
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,220
That's bad aim

468
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,580
It'll hurt either way

469
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,980
So that's how it is

470
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,280
He's looking

471
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,580
He gets shy once we look at him though

472
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,540
Ready?

473
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,420
That's the painful type

474
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,040
What do you want from me?!

475
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,050
That's what I was told to do!

476
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,200
You did that perfectly

477
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,540
Right!

478
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,860
It was a badly aimed face slap

479
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,320
Your turn, Yama-chan

480
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Can I choose pork buns?

481
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,900
No, I don't think so

482
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,040
Why not?!

483
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,000
It's my turn, and I get to choose!

484
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
You can't offer him that

485
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,820
Nonsense! This is a game!

486
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
Of course, he'll like this

487
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,020
Well, there's no guarantee

488
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,450
He can choose what he wants

489
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:58,880
Thank you

490
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,480
How's Osaka's favorite pork buns?

491
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,580
Here they are

492
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,900
Pork buns...

493
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,300
He can talk now?!

494
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,420
I did it!!

495
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,400
Of course!

496
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,020
He even said "pork buns"

497
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,840
He'll definitely take it

498
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,040
Looking good

499
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,380
He opened it!

500
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,100
I don't want this

501
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,100
right now...

502
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,060
He can talk now

503
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,490
See?
He doesn't want this right now

504
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,760
From Hamada...

505
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,960
No way...

506
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,940
This is so rigged!

507
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,720
What?
I get slapped too!!

508
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,420
He seems to have changed the rules of the game

509
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,960
He didn't say what I'm supposed to do to you

510
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,100
Hamada will...

511
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,100
kick his front

512
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,800
Wait, this show took a weird turn just now

513
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,780
Agreed

514
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,160
What happened?

515
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,980
It didn't start this way...

516
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,320
Why a kick?

517
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Why should we even participate?

518
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,300
Seriously, why are we putting ourselves through this?

519
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,660
He won't miss this...

520
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,880
Man, I hate how he acts timid

521
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
I'm terrified

522
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,140
A frontal kick sounds...

523
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,940
It sounds scary

524
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,920
Seriously...

525
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,280
Ready?

526
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,300
Stomp on his leg

527
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,600
Stomp on leg?

528
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,300
No, no, no, no!

529
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,800
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

530
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,840
He's looking!

531
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,000
He did!

532
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,240
That's good

533
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,700
That's good

534
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,540
I'm done with this...

535
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,360
I don't want to play anymore...

536
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,920
Let's do the last item

537
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,400
OK

538
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,000
Well...

539
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,600
This is perfect, right?

540
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
Ultra-man figurine collection

541
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,020
Let's do this

542
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,700
This is good

543
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,040
As long as he uses his preference to judge this

544
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,700
Look, he's not even hiding anymore

545
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,460
Please, take a good look

546
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Tell us whether you like this or not

547
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
We got the full set

548
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
I think...

549
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,300
I think we got him with these

550
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,080
Well...

551
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,660
I can see his elbows now

552
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm not a fan after this generation...

553
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,400
I understand but...

554
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,100
I'm only know the ones up to this point...

555
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,140
But here are Ace and Seven...

556
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,160
I didn't watch much of the Ace series...

557
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,520
I've got a good feeling...

558
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,720
He'll accept these!

559
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,580
What's up with him now?

560
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,060
OK, that's the breast stroke...

561
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,240
Maybe the Ultra-man Seven???

562
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,360
Well, he grabbed the Seven...

563
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,200
OK, got him, let's go home

564
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,080
He likes it then

565
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,960
We're done

566
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,180
Let's go home

567
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,140
He liked it

568
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,560
Wait a sec...

569
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,000
There's a little more left...

570
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,840
See you next week!!!!

571
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,550
What's he saying?

572
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,210
Same time, same place next week!!!!
