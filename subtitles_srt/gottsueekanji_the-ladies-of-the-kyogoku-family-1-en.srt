00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,620
Hey, Master Tokunin.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,220
Yes?

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,750
About how far is it
from here to Hakone?

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,350
Ah, it is about a mile that way.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,390
Ah, I see.

10
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,840
Hurry! Hurry!

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,550
Thank you!

13
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,440
Are you ok?

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,000
Thank you very much.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,540
Are you ok?

16
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,740
Are you hurt?

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,000
No.

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,300
Thank you so much.

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,200
Not at all.

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,800
What happened?

21
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,790
- Mother!
- It's Mother!

22
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,520
This nice samurai helped
me when I fell just now.

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,620
Oh, is that right?

24
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,220
Thank you so much!

25
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,050
Mother!

26
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,350
- Mother!
- Are you alright?

27
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,800
Look closely at the
face of that samurai!

28
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,240
You're Mitani Bokuzen, are you not?

29
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,300
Have we met before?

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
I am the wife of the now deceased
Kyogoku Muneharu!  Oshizu!

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,400
His daughter! Oichi!

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,690
His second daughter! Omatsu!

00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,690
The third daughter! Otaka!

34
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,520
My husband fell in
battle at Nippombashi...

35
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,450
...and you insulted his memory
two weeks on that TV show!

36
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,390
Have you truly forgotten?!

37
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,020
These things happen in life!

38
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,120
You!!!

39
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,250
How could you!!!

40
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,850
Are you a comedy troupe?

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,740
Avenge Father's death!

42
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,500
Give us...

43
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,500
...your life!!!

44
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,240
Fear not! I've cut your kimonos off,
but left your bodies unscratched!
