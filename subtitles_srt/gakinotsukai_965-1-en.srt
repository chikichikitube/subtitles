1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,560
Murakami Shoji's classroom series started without anyone wanting it

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,900
He comes in and does whatever he wants

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,000
And when the ratings are so low, it's too much to handle

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,800
What on Earth did he prepare now?

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:25,630
What was it?

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,570
That guy...

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,630
It's Matador Class

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,200
That's right... By Shoji

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,430
When the DX was over the other day

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,230
During a break he told me "Hama chan, I'm counting on you"

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,070
What the...?

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,890
I don't want to say this...

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,330
But I want to complain to Sanma san (famous comedian)

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,500
Via Suga san

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,430
What do you think?

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,200
But I think nobody can help us

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,830
Let's just quit, then?

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,600
What about raitings?

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,670
They are awful

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,360
We need Sanma san to watch edited versions of our previous classrooms

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,000
It's getting sunny, though

22
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,460
Something's written!

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,760
"Bullfighter class is here"

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,200
This cardboard is so wet

25
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,860
It must have been out here for some time

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,300
It's getting cold, too...

27
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,430
With the wind blowing...

28
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,700
No one expected it to be this cold...

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,300
First thing in the morning comes this guy, dressed up like for parade...

30
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,370
Wait do you hear him?

31
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,170
His voice is so loud!

32
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,840
That's so lame... Is that a kick scooter?

33
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,420
I'M SORRY!

34
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,620
They wouldn't let me on the motorway

35
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,530
I have no idea why they didn't let me drive there

36
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,730
Well that's unfortunate

37
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,970
I've made myself get here, that's why I'm a bit late

38
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,830
It's alright

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,140
The annoying man who came by kick scooter, was no other than Murakami Shoji

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,930
The weather's bad today, so it might be a bit of a bad day location-wise

41
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,060
What are talking about? today's weather is great

42
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,870
You sure?

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,930
I always pick days with the best weather

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,660
We're not so sure about this...

45
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,160
Today is the ninth installment in our series

46
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,300
The ninth one?

47
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,530
That's right. You haven't achieved anything, none of you

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS?

49
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,860
Is there anything funny, Matsumoto? I'm sorry

50
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,060
Your voice is especially strong today

51
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,500
I developed it

52
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,430
Is that so?

53
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,870
Listen up

54
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,630
This time call me Master

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,970
Master, okay

56
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,730
Hamada! Yes!

57
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,030
Are you trying to die?

58
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,430
Why's that?

59
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,470
THE HELL'S THAT RED THING?

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,790
Do you know that bull's most hated color is red?

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
The voice is so loud...

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Fine, I'll talk in a quite voice

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No, that's alright, please excuse us

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,260
You'll be the first one to be killed!

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,200
That's dangerous!

66
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,770
What were you thinking?

67
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,370
I'm sorry

68
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,730
Do you understand? You'll be dead in a bullfight

69
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,170
I'm sorry

70
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,760
Did you come empty-handed, 'cause you didn't know anything?

71
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,490
Go ahead and put in 2 or 3 extra pieces of intellect

72
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,990
Came here with nothing

73
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,890
"Thank you teacher! I became a great bullfighter!"

74
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,200
Why at least one of you can't get involved?

75
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,100
Get involved?

76
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,830
Listen, you

77
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,540
Do you guys only care about viewer raitings?

78
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,100
I see

79
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,770
Do you want to make me disappear with your "great power"?

80
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,470
What do you mean?

81
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you mean that I need to tell you about it?

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,020
We don't have much time, so remember

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
Stand in line right here

84
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,700
Here

85
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,700
Our first training is

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,660
When we think of bullfighting, we think about red things

87
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,470
I see

88
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,860
Besides...

89
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,730
the bullfighter...

90
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,030
that man...

91
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,270
he'll get excited

92
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:39,970
And bulls think

93
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,230
"Which one of us is going to stab you?"

94
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,180
So, that's what we're supposed to sense

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,990
Do you understand?

96
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,790
Do I really need

97
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,730
to explain you all the elementary basics?

98
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,900
Don't you get excited about the red stuff?

99
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,200
Check your qualities as a bullfighter first

100
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,130
You may be wondering why are we doing it

101
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,990
But that's to control bullfighter's excitement

102
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,930
Put your hands behind your back

103
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,260
And hold them behind your back

104
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,070
Firstly

105
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,990
Are you alright?

106
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,430
"Touch the crotch. Excitement inspection"

107
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,070
Are you all fine there?
"Touch the crotch. Excitement inspection"

108
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,660
"Touch the crotch. Excitement inspection"

109
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,670
What are you doing?

110
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:28,930
Ma-chan?

111
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,000
Is Tanaka alright?

112
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,330
Hey, you

113
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,990
That was your teacher's **** inspection

114
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,990
SO, DON'T QUESTION IT!!!

115
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,130
It's all under my control!

116
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,370
But how can we get excited from that?

117
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,830
Let's continue. It will get worse

118
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,700
Get worse?

119
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,560
I tried to use more suitable words

120
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,200
I want you to feel it

121
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,200
You really have hard time understanding the basics... I'm sorry...

122
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,100
STAY STILL!

123
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,000
I'LL BE BACK!

124
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,300
It's so difficult to understand what he wants...

125
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,770
Let's wait and see...

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,970
I still don't get it...

127
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Here!

128
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,470
Sports shorts

129
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,690
It's definitely different from the last one. These red shorts...

130
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,300
Alright, let's commence

131
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,170
Are you alright?

132
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,570
I'm counting on you! What is she doing!?

133
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,030
LOOK!!!

134
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,530
Look closely! I see no point in doing this...

135
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,230
I understand that they are red, but...

136
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,330
Are you all good?

137
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,130
You won't see this often on TV these days

138
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,060
Alright, that's enough, thank you

139
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,530
Are you alright?

140
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,100
She did her best

141
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,330
Are you okay?

142
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,870
What's that?

143
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,930
I feel a bit sticky...

144
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,130
Sticky? He means his hands

145
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,070
I mean sweat

146
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,990
Let's head for next training

147
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,990
We don't have much time

148
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,660
Time? I think you woory about it too much

149
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,600
Bullfighting unions are on strike now

150
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,430
Then, don't we have plenty of time?

151
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,890
As a bullfighter, you have to dodge the rampaging bulls

152
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,400
And fascinate the spectators

153
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,600
This is the bull

154
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,000
On average

155
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,960
It weights 560 kg

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,030
Endo, try it

157
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,270
Do your best

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,230
Listen

159
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,690
Use blanket for now

160
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,500
Alright?

161
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,060
It's still early to use the red one

162
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,970
Hold it like that

163
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,100
Go for it!

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,900
Do it splendidly

165
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,400
I'm ready

166
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,430
I see

167
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,570
Just like a bull

168
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
That's dangerous...

169
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,360
He really did it with all his might

170
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,830
These bullfighters are really desperate

171
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,700
That's right...

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,330
Matsumoto went next

173
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,500
Do it with more passion

174
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,900
I don't really understand what you mean...

175
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,130
Endo did really well

176
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,730
I think the bull might get exhausted...

177
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,700
Again with full force...

178
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,130
Here it comes!

179
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,100
That's hilarious

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,100
Is he done already?

181
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,870
Matsumoto...

182
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,500
Come here...

183
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,100
Look out, he's not finished yet

184
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,100
It's dangerous. He'll go out with full force, be careful!

185
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,430
'Cause he's a bull

186
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,500
Here it comes

187
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,500
He breathes so much...

188
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,270
He's definitely out of breath

189
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,500
Are you fine?

190
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,570
What?

191
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,530
Master?

192
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,700
Master?

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,500
I'll do it next. Please!

194
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,930
Do it with style!

195
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,860
I'll do it now. I'm ready. That's a bit scary...

196
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,900
Hamada, it's alright

197
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,130
You're fine

198
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,930
We thought that everyone will do it

199
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,990
We still didn't practice it

200
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,150
We've had enough

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,800
Are you sure?

202
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,680
We all want to go through full training

203
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,170
I'll show an example

204
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,930
Because it's dangerous, I don't want...

205
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,370
Your family to feel sad

206
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,000
Me...

207
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,600
Yamasaki

208
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,030
Do the bull

209
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,000
But I have no experience...

210
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,330
Do it

211
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,070
I actually want to see it

212
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,600
Yamasaki, do the bull

213
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,700
Grab it

214
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,100
Freeze and become a bull

215
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,860
Everyone, give me a hand

216
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,430
Here

217
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,900
What shall we do?

218
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,870
We're loading it?

219
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,170
Wait a moment!

220
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,230
Please, wait!

221
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,000
That's right, bull's actual weight is around 500 kg

222
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
We need to make it realistic

223
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,200
Please, wait!

224
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,790
Master, but you didn't have this weight

225
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,330
You didn't have this...

226
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,400
This weight

227
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,770
It's not a weight

228
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,330
It's called real bull

229
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,330
That face...

230
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,900
Do it

231
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,270
But... It's not a weight

232
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,000
CAN YOU EVEN DO ANYTHING?

233
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,330
For 9 episodes, can't you do at least something?

234
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,130
You only complain and ask to be forgiven

235
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,370
DO IT!

236
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,030
Here he comes!

237
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,230
Go for it!

238
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,370
What is he doing?

239
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,130
The hell's he doing?

240
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,830
What's that?

241
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,370
What on Earth?

242
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,970
What's that?

243
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,700
You can't do anything

244
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,130
Good grief...

245
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,230
For those who cannot become bullfighters

246
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,990
There will be a training for a different profession

247
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,170
That's no good

248
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,570
I'm disappointed

249
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,170
To climb that hill...

250
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,690
Was quite difficult

251
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,170
for a matador

252
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,860
If you can't do anything Matador-related, you're out from this

253
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,730
You

254
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,600
Come here

255
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,730
Let's go down the other way?

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,270
What do you mean?

257
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,430
You have only this way

258
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,330
What's that? Let's do Carmen

259
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,470
Take it

260
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,230
I'll do Matador. IMPOSSIBLE!

261
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,630
I SEE AND JUDGE. CAN I BE WRONG???

262
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,170
I've been doing it for 32 years, so I can tell when one is no good

263
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,230
Who do you think you are?

264
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,230
Big brother, sorry

265
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,370
He said nothing

266
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,170
Anyway, put this on

267
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,000
Put it on from below

268
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,000
For your hands

269
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,830
Does anyone know the proper way to hold these?

270
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,130
No idea

271
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,170
Really no clue

272
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,210
I wear a costume, please...

273
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,330
Fine, take these off

274
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:44,770
Do your best!

275
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,130
Music, start!

276
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,470
Do you know it?

277
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,270
No idea...

278
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,600
I am!

279
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,470
Ah, me!

280
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,460
(he just says "Spanish-sounding" words in Japanese)

281
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,270
Cafe!

282
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,930
Me!

283
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,530
SAY CAFE AND ME!

284
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,670
OVER HERE! ME!

285
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,400
Say "me over here"!

286
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,630
Say that

287
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,400
But, I couldn't think of it...

288
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:32,970
WELL THINK!

289
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,130
Think?

290
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,700
TURN YOUR BRAIN TO FULL SPEED AND SAY

291
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,860
Anyway, let's have a break

292
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,560
Let's have a break. Can I take this off, Master? Fine

293
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,670
That was fast...

294
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,800
Is that alright?

295
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,530
That was quite funny

296
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,660
Really? We never had a break on this level... Thank you very much!

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,870
Take a seat

298
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,930
Yes, we chose our seats

299
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,200
Today

300
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,670
We'll have a bull, that I've defeated earlier

301
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,300
Really?

302
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,400
It's very expensive

303
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:24,620
All the bulls that I defeat are prepared that way, so my friends can cut their slices and take them home

304
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,260
I never heard that

305
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,970
That's how it's done in Spain

306
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,660
We'll behave today, okay?

307
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,860
This is the one I got today

308
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,600
Really?

309
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,930
Thank you

310
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,330
Looks delicious

311
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,430
This is the really tasty stuff

312
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,900
Here

313
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,230
It's 100 grams

314
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,030
Yes..

315
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
From super...

316
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,900
Here

317
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,200
Thank you very much!

318
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,230
That's impressive

319
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,430
Thank you very much!

320
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,370
Master!

321
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,230
Master!

322
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,770
MASTER!!!

323
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,400
Thank you

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,800
That's enough...

325
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,830
Master?

326
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,600
Enjoy your meal

327
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,100
Eat well

328
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,370
Master!

329
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,170
Shut up

330
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,230
But I don't have anything...

331
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,300
Just as soon you gave me the plate...

332
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
You want some? Yes!

333
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,900
Is it tasty?

334
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,770
It is

335
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,430
It's very good

336
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,470
Master!

337
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,760
But that's pig feet...

338
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,370
You're 10 years too young to eat beef

339
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,170
Why?

340
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,530
Your "why" will be the end for you

341
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:05,120
"Announce - We're informing customers coming to the Seaside Park"

342
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,220
"The Seaside Park will soon be closed"

343
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,230
You heard that?

344
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,330
We'll be doing maneuvering section

345
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,900
Ma-chan

346
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,700
What?

347
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,730
I heard you had

348
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,070
a party the other night?

349
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,400
That's right

350
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,800
Only with my juniors

351
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,070
Ma-chan, you've gotten distant

352
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,930
I also wanted to congratulate you

353
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,300
Thank you very much, really

354
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,030
I wasn't able to give you anything

355
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,470
That's alright

356
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,100
Ma-chan. Yes?

357
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,800
He's calling you

358
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,190
I don't really need anything...

359
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,730
I'm totally fine

360
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,770
Actually... Yes?

361
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,100
I don't want Hama chan or Tanaka to know about this

362
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,270
Here, actually

363
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,640
These are by my wife's relatives, organically grown vegetables

364
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,280
Can you take it home for your wife?

365
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,100
Today? Yes

366
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,530
Thanks a lot

367
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,900
Actually

368
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
frankly speaking

369
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:08,970
today...

370
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,000
I prepared some fried rice

371
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,500
Eat it

372
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,530
with your wife

373
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,730
I will

374
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,600
He made some fried rice?

375
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,770
That's so dirty...

376
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,430
I have nothing else

377
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,300
So...

378
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,400
One moment

379
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,370
Actually, look

380
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,630
I'm releasing a DVD!!!

381
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,770
Is this for real?

382
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,590
Yes, my manager said that I have to wait a bit longer, but I'm just dying to get it out already

383
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,930
Well, didn't Hama chan release one?

384
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,160
Pretty much everyone released one

385
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,030
That's why

386
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,770
it's like a good opportunity to ride this wave

387
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,700
And one more

388
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,000
Here it is!

389
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,160
Gag bottles for soy sauce

390
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,730
80,000 yen per one with diamonds scattered on them

391
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,500
Is it true? Here

392
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,030
I've sold 4 already!

393
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,370
That's great!

394
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,900
The president of the company I know bought them all

395
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,500
Buy one

396
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,800
Buy one?

397
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,130
But he canceled one, so I've sold three for now

398
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,400
To tell the truth

399
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,970
Learn how to collect the flying bouquet

400
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,100
After a spectacular defeat of the bull

401
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,530
The bull's already fallen

402
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,070
Once he's down

403
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,670
Hundreds of thousands in the audience

404
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,700
Will shout "stunning!" And then...

405
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,350
Will throw donations down to matador

406
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,430
Offerings? Ah, yes

407
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,600
I have too many things on my mind, that's why I made a mistake

408
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,400
I'm sorry

409
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,830
I meant offerings

410
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,030
Let's go, have some practice

411
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,330
It's quite hold...

412
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,900
That's true

413
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,070
What a great weather!

414
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,370
That's so tasty!

415
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,730
Let's just eat it

416
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,700
It's grilled very well!

417
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,030
It's hot

418
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,770
Delicious...

419
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,330
HEY!?

420
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,800
They're all eating

421
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,530
And a sausage...

422
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,870
Tasty!

423
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,500
Hey!

424
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,990
I was the only one who went there

425
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,730
What are you doing?

426
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,200
Oh, thanks a lot!

427
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,500
HEY!!!

428
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,000
Look, Matsumoto

429
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,430
That's not a tray

430
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,800
I'm sorry

431
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,130
What shall we do?

432
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:07,970
What shall we do?

433
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,600
I knew it

434
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,400
It's only me who wants to do everything properly

435
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,210
With this, you'll get less than 0.1% of the viewership rating

436
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,560
I don't know if I can do it with you guys anymore...

437
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,430
I want to exceed 10% at least once!

438
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,130
That's still too low...

439
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,300
You're really are

440
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,460
Once you catch what's thrown at you, you'd want to take it back to your family

441
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,370
That's why it's the last training

442
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,400
Hamada, why don't you try?

443
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,900
What shall I do?

444
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,560
Catch what I'll be throwing at you

445
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,300
What is going to be thrown?

446
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,600
Let's have a look at it

447
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,830
Are you throwing these?

448
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:53,160
Yes. Because you're the most experienced here, wouldn't you show us how it's done?

449
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,990
I won't play along with that trick anymore

450
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,270
No, no, no

451
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,730
We can't even think of doing anything bad

452
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,860
No matter how many times you say it, Hamada, you'll do it

453
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,490
Because I'm in a bit of a dispute with Yoshimoto (agency)

454
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,290
Which concerns my goods

455
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,500
And the percentages that I've told seem to be different

456
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,030
I want you to tell me

457
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,400
You think if all of you will ask me, I'll change my mind?

458
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,700
Really, please, show us!

459
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,400
Fine, if you're sincere

460
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,700
This time

461
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,880
Throw it high from above

462
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,330
High, right?

463
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,200
Hamada, try it

464
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,270
From above?

465
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,500
Okay

466
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,230
Awesome!

467
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,270
That's great!

468
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,330
Great!

469
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,730
What are you doing?

470
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,270
Don't throw them all like that

471
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,370
That's money

472
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,530
That's money, hey!

473
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,370
Ouch!

474
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,900
That's impressive

475
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,570
It hurts!

476
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,270
So, great

477
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,570
Stop that! I see...

478
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,900
That's how it goes

479
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,170
Stop that

480
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,700
Don't ever come back!

481
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,000
That's a single man...

482
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,030
You've done him?

483
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,000
Absolutely

484
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,760
At time like this, a bull can only say

485
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,600
Mooo

486
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,700
That's enough!
