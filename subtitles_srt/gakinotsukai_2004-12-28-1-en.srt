00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
--Yes that's only normal

116
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,050

How are we supposed to know?

138
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,900
Didn't you learn that in NSC training school?

139
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,700
Will you stop laughing for no reason?

140

[This is some surprise.]

188
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
[This is incredible!]

189
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,410
[This is disturbing!
The entire town supported them.]

190
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,140
(Cheif Producer Suga Kenji) welcome to Yugawara signboard

191
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,430
What? What?  Was that counted as laughing?!

192
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,310
Yeah, you laughed.

193
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,890
-An S&M army punishes laughers by whipping their butt.-

194
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,130
That looked painful!

195
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,800
They couldn't have done this without the town's cooperation.

196
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,140
That's incredible!

197
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,180
What?  I'm at Yugawara station now.

198
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,620
The infamous pro wrestler
Dynamite Shikoku passing by (Endo)

199
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
What?

200
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,720
Shikoku!

201
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Yeah?

202
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
May I have your autograph?

Fans of Dynamite Shikoku wants
his autograph

204
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,280
[That was a laugh.]

205
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,440
Wait a moment

206
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,150
[Shikoku has always been Tanaka's weakness.]

207
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,900
[I fell for it everytime.]

208
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,980
Wow, this is so cool!

209
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,520
Skikoku! please perform your special move.

210
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,440
Please!  Do it!

211
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,600
OK, ready?

212
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,640
Shikoku! Shikoku!

213
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,930
Shikoku! Shikoku!

214
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,190
That's not fair!

215
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,960
So stupid.

216
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,800
[No one can survive this.]

217
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,410
What? Again?!

218
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,980
[That was really painful]

219
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,830
Why were you hit twice?

220
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,650
--I don't know!

221
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,750
At 3:00 p.m. today, a title match at the Yuguwara Gymnasium...

222
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,490
[Tanaka got hit 2 times]

Dynamite Shikoku
This will be an incredible match

226
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,010
Get away from my sight!

227
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,770
What are you waiting for?

228
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,410
[Seriously, what are you waiting for?]

229
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,420
Goodbye

230
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,110
--Good-bye and good luck.

231
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,990
[Well, that was kinda funny]

232
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,660
That guy's annoying

233
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,920
Damn right

234
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,800
Wow, the kids in Yugawara really take their studying seriously

235
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,770
Oh my god

236
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:06,750
Suga dressed as a student

237
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,710
[that was...]

238
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,410
[Suga-chan is everywhere]

239
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,780
My ass...my ass is on fire!

240
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,720
Suga's fake poster

241
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,750
Why the hell, it was only a half smile

242
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
[That was not good]

243
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,990
[Tanaka missed it here]

244
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,860
That was...incredible!

245
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,660
Yeah, Suga's amazing

246
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,790
This is bad, we shouldn't get suckered in so easily

247
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,900
--Damn right

248
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Yugawara's a famous spa resort

249

Yugawara's a famous spa resort
Sound Truck

250
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,680
It has many shops of long standing

251
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,600
Let's have some tea.

252
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,700
Yamasaki used his arm to cover his laughing face

253
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,740
[Cheater!]

254
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,590
Thank you very much

255
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,260
Thank you

256
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:57,310
Hi! Today, I'm at Yugawara, which is at its height of fall color

257
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,190
I can see clear blue sky in every direction

258
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,900
(Travel show reporter)

Kinomoto Ryo

259
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,140
Everybody knows Yugawara is a spa resort

260
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,590
But before I bathe, I'll show you some goodies

261
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:13,080
Hamada used his cup to cover his laughing face

262
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,180
This is really good

263
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,120
What do you recommend as a best buy?

264
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,450
This one sir, Amanogawa (Milky Way) manjuu

265
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,940
Amanogawa? What a beautiful name!

266
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,820
They don't care if we shoot at the same place?

267
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,100
He's speaking very loudly

268
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,480
We are definitely in their frame

269
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,600
WHY!?  Why is it called Amanogawa?!

270
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,220
Did you hear how much he stressed "why"?

271
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,570
Hamada & Yamasaki drink tea to cover their laugh

272
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,890
What the hell?!

273
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,400
That comment was totally unnecessary!

274
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,900
[You guys are too easy.]

275
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,340
Damn that's good

276
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,720
He whipped my balls

277
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,300
My balls...

278
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:23,740
There's much more to come, We'll be right back

279
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,260
(Director):
CUT!

280
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,980
OK!

281
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,020
[Isn't the director too old?]

282
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,140
Watch it! It's hot!

283
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,900
I just realized how old that director was.

284
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,900
-The director is in his 80s

285
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,480
I guess he's still nostalgic

286
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,700
Let's go, That way

287
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:01,750
There's a place I want you to see before we head for the inn

288
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,420
We'll go there first

289
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,010
Why can't we just go to the inn?

290
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,660
Hey!  Hey!

291
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,290
-Harley Davidson with a sidecar

292
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,960
A sidecar

293
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,760
Get in the car, I'll lead the way.

294
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,750
Are you going to ride in that?

295
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,740
I'll lead the way, Get in

296
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,020
-Fujiwara puts the 3 men in the taxicab

297
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,490
Thank you

298
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,330
It's much more intense than before

299
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
--Damn right

300
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,090
This is bad

301
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,030
Japanese-style
hairdo helmet

302
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,720
That Dynamite thing was close

303
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Yes it was

304
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:08,680
Dynamite Shikuko vs, The Escargot man

305
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,900
That Escargot Man

306
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,490
[This wasn't the only time you weren't punished.]

307
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,500
-Hamada's safe because the watcher missed it

308
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,790
They're leaving the Yugawara station.
Where is Fujiwara taking them?

309
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,710
What awaits them?

310
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,660
So much has happened in a short time

311
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,090
The town is against us

312
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,470
--That signboard was something!

313
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,780
Yes, it was

314
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,380
It was tough

315
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,590
Mind if I turn on the radio?

316
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,480
Radio? No, go ahead

317
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:53,730
Yoshida Terumi's (radio host)
"Yugawara, Oh My Mind!"

318
00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:02,900
Yoshida Terumi hosts on the radio

319
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,940
"As always, I'm your host, Yoshida Terumi."

320
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,880
"How are you doing? The same old, same old?"

321
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,050
"This year is almost over, time flies

322
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,180
--Time flies...

323
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:17,090
"At this rate, I'll be 90 by the end of next year."

324
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,480
The driver begins to laugh loudly

325
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,360
"Is this really the end of March, the weather is so warm"

326
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,130
"Give me more time!"

327
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,160
"And my name happens to be 'Tell me' (Terumi), too!"

328
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,190
Are they going to stop here?

329
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,170
They are being very thorough

330
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,160
No break for us

331
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,950
If anyone laughs, the car stops and he is punished outside.

332
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,850
You heard that?

333
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,800
I can hear that even with the window closed.

334
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,270
It's very loud

335
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,830
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?

336
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,320
[I don't believe Hamada didn't laugh]

337
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,210
"Yugawara, Oh My Mind"

338
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,940
I love this show

339
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:30,860
"What's up? Dynamite Shikoku has finally come to Yugawara."

340
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:36,260
"He's as rough as a whirling current in the Naruto Channel."

341
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,030
[Tanaka You suck.]

342
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,740
No, please don't "Dynamite" me anymore!

343
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,510
-Hamada takes advantage of the watcher's absence

344
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,380
He has zero tolerance toward the Dynamite sketches

345
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
Hang in there, Tanaka.

346
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,990
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?

347
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,420
Why do you need to ask everytime?

348
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,790
Why not just turn it on?

349
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,650
[It's annoying when you have no choice.]

350
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,590
[You get out of the car and get whipped...]

351
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,930
[That's horrible]
[--it looked painful!]

352
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,800
[This is hard.]

353
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
It hurts!

354
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,850
This is only the beginning for them

355
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,580
There are more traps to come

356
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:58,020
-Old lady hitchhiker
looking for a ride to L.A.

357
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,790
[She must be out of her mind!]

358
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,430
I suppressed my laughter!

359
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,860
Who'd give her a ride?!

360
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,180
[She's still holding up the sign.]

361
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,010
My balls!

362
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,550
My balls hurt!

363
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,360
Hey wait!

364
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,960
How the hell are we not supposed to laugh at this?!

365
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,820
we'll Laugh for sure!

366
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,940
Look at her face

367
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,310
My ass is throbbing

368
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,150
It will definitely be swollen

369
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,550
[You still didn't even reach the Inn]

370
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,020
Why is he checking on us

371
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,620
The punisher turns around

372
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Isn't that dirty?

373
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,230
It's dirty

374
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,230
It's dirty

375
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
You know, he's wearing glasses

376
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,840
[Of course we're going to laugh at that]

377
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,380
Why can't you just shut up!

378
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,250
Cut it out already!

379
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,380
What are you trying to do?

380
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,350
[The mask was off center]

381
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
He whipped my balls again!

382
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,520
At this rate, we will never reach the Inn!

383
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,760
[You knew that huh?]
[-Yeah]

384
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,330
I'm begging you

385
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,100
Really

386
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,910
They finally reach the next destination

387
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,900
But where have they arrived?

388
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,550
Please get out

389
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,690
Why don't we just go to the inn already!

390
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,800
There's something I want you to do here

391
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,010
This is a temple!

392
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,110
You have too many wordly desires
That's why you can't help but laugh.

393
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,590
You'll need some training, Follow me

394
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,400
A Temple...

395
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,270
They arrive at an old venerable temple

396
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,880
What training must they undertake?

397
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,750
We should cut out the unnessary comments

398
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
--I agree

399
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,300
Tanaka, raise your threshold.

400
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,070
What's that got to do with it?

401
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,650
Wait a minute...

402
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,300
It's got everything to do with it!

403
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,130
What's your beef?

404
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,920
Ungirls (Comedy Duo)
Yamane Yoshiaki & Tanaka Takushi

405
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,320
I don't like to ride behind you.

406
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,570
What's wrong?

407
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,650
Your steering sucks

408
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,090
I think I should steer

409
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,280
What? My steering was fine

410
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,270
--No it's not

411
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,580
What do you mean?

412
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,830
You get tired and...

413
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,900
Then why asking me to join in the first place?

414
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,610
Because I had no one else to ask

415
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,650
You wanna fight?

416
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,740
[They're getting better at this.]

417
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,660
To hell with this

418
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,920
Hey Wait!

419
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,050
Timeout

420
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,100
Don't count this laugh, OK?

421
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,980
He whipped my dick

422
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,930
This whip was for Tanaka, but the S&M guy missed and...

423
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,750
...hits Hamada's penis instead!!

424
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,190
[You should've moved]

425
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,810
My right ball hurts

426
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,260
He whipped my right ball

427
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,150
Isn't it supposed to be on the butt?

428
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,630
Ah...there he is...

429
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,260
--You're not listening...

430
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,820
This local priest will take care of you

431
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,480
Greet him

432
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,570
Hello there

433
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,740
--Oh yes?

434
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,310
-Eyes are painted on
the local priest's eyelids

435
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,400
Welcome all, my name is Tenkai, the local priest

436
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,890
Please come in

437
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,770
I'll show you inside

438
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,990
Please come inside

439
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,620
May we enter?

440
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,460
--Yes please do

441
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,630
This is the main hall

442
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,920
The pictures behind me are of previous priests

443
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:09,010
Our last resident priest was Priest Parakeet

444
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,660
he was one of the most revered priests around

445
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,660
[That was too much]

446
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,700
Today, we have a great priest visiting us from Kyoto

447
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,010
He wants to see you

448
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,470
Please pay your respects

449
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,350
Please come in

450
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,050
A black priest enters the room

451
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,460
ACHUkata desho (Atsukata desho) = It was hot, huh?

452
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,100
[Hou-san has zero respect!]

453
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,770
Excuse me

454
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,340
[It wasn't hot]
-[It was cold]

455
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,410
[He should be saying
that during summer]

456
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,390
This year is really

457
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,860
Hot huh?

458
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,730
It's really hot

459
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,840
Well?

460
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,080
It's hot right?

461
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,880
[So persistent huh?]
[--yeah]

462
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,430
Right?  It's hot, right?

463
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
I'm
- So suddenly

464
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,250
So

465
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,040
I'm

466
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,720
before you

467
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,020
Oshitoshimasu (Oitomashimasu) = leaving

468
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
[We couldn't hold it anymore]

469
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
aw..my balls!

470
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,710
Poor Tanaka got whipped 3 times in the balls

471
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,710
I want you to practice Zen setting meditation

472
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,730
Your eyes may stay open during the meditation

473
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,190
But you must never disrupt your equilibrium

474
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,900
You may begin

475
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,120
Meditation Time

476
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:38,330
Note: t.A.T.u is a famous Russian
pop duo (Lena Katina & Yulia Volkova)

477
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:38,360
2 Grannies Impersonating t.A.T.u.

478
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,650
I'm afraid I'm pregnant

479
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,680
Keep the baby

480
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,360
[They're always funny.]

481
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,960
You need to try harder

482
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:18,340
The priest punishes with the board-stick

483
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:30,480
Good afternoon Tokyo!

484
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,250

00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,480

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,490
Good afternoon Yugawara!

487
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,850
Good afternoon

488
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,320
Chief Producer
Suga Kenji

489
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,390
Good afternoon

490
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:46,290
Good afternoon Tokyo!

491
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,800
[He was so persistent.]

492
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,800
[He kept repeating it]

493
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,560
Good afternoon Yugawara!

494
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Good afternoon Tokyo!

495
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:04,910
Good afternoon Yugawara!

496
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,150
--You persistent bastard!

497
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,180
Good afternoon Tokyo!

498
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,060
You should try harder

499
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,600
What's wrong with That  jerk?!

500
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:30,940
A mysterious person appears from behind

501
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,500
This is disturbing

502
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,830
[Yeah, it's spooky.]

503
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,960
[Makes you nervous.]

504
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:56,830
It's me, Yinling of Joytoy

505
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,130
Note: Yinling is a famous swimsuit model

506
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,110
[That was a suprise.]

507
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,820
Try harder.

508
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,330
Yinling ... It's Yinling!

509
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,340
That's amazing

510
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
Dynamite Shikoku enters the Temple

511
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,570
Oh, Maito-san

512
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,740
It's not "Maito", I'm Dynamite Shikoku

513
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,810
Remember, I'm not "Maito"

514
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,140
Is it alright if I pay for a win?

515
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,540
Oh, great priests are here

516
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,520
Please let me beat

517
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,230
the world's best wrestler, Escargot man

518
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Cut it out already

519
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Here I go

520
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,680
Want me to do it?

521
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:23,960
Ready?

522
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
1

523
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,440
2

524
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,430
3

525
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,430
Shikuko, Shikuko!!

526
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,070
Cut that out, damn it

527
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,530
Try harder

528
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,860
Thank you very much

529
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,350
Training is over

530
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,740
Have you learned a thing or two?

531
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,350
It's just 3 hours in, and they're not at the Inn yet

532
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,970
But they look badly beaten

533
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:30,330
This is only the prologue to crueler and harsher chapters

534
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
We haven't even get to the Inn yet

535
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,390
Yeah it hasn't even started yet

536
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,800
It's like 2 leading characters haven't even met in a romance movie!

537
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,100
I think the person who got hit the most so far was Tanaka

538
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,230
--That's right

539
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,010
Weak!

540
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,040
I've told you about Yinling before, but it's the first time I've

541
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,640
Swimsuit model: Yinling

542
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,520
seen her in person

543
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,360
Oh, you've never seen her?

544
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,640
I never expected to see her like this!

545
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,050
But, Dynamite Shikoku is so funny

546
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,610
Actually it's been 7 years

547
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,530
Rght?

548
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,790
A long time ago during Shichi Henge, he appeared

549
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,450
During Endo's Shichi Henge?

550
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:20,130
9/1997 On Air

551
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:20,130
Endo's Shichi Henge

552
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,480
It's been about 6-7 years ago

553
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,600
Oh, yeah!

554
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,330
He just loved it

555
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,230
Yes, he was my favorite

556
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,800
You still like him even after 7 years

557
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,050
Feels like finally he appeared!

558
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,170
It's interesting to watch everyone's hot button

559
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,640
I couldn't stop laughing at the Parakeet bit

560
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:36,110
Priest Parakeet

561
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,350
Yeah it was amazing

562
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:37,790
The 2 Mrs. were awesome

563
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,060
I don't think you've seen the LA woman in person

564
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,100
Her face is literally a bigger than her body!

565
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:51,730
LA old lady

566
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,470
I think it's half the size of her body

567
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,110
I think it encompasses all of it

568
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,880
All? That's impossible

569
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,990
That'd make her a monster

570
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,580
Where's her body then?

571
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,970
-6:00 p.m.,
(4 hours past)-

572
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:06,680
The sun goes down, and the taxi finally takes them to the inn

573
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,120
This is the inn

574
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,220
They are staying at this inn

575
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,280
What awaits them?

576
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:25,710
A pair of slippers glued to the floor

577
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Come in

578
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,150
Good evening

579
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,110
Good evening

580
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,560
My ass is sore...

581
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,890
[You fell for an old trick.]

582
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,600
[What about LA!]

583
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:04,650
(The female hitchhiker is having trouble with the desk clerk.)

584
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,470
--You need a reservation

585
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,770
You can't stay here without having a reservation first

586
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,420
Give me a break

587
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,900
Let's go to your room

588
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,010
This is a nice inn.

589
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
--Yeah

590
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Can't wait, really

591
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,740
This is your room

592
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,160
Isn't it a nice room?

593
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,680
We aren't there yet

594
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,220
[He's just memorized the script.]

595
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,860
What a nice room

596
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,940
This really is a nice room

597
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,730
The scroll has a welcoming message

598
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:59,230
Feature ramen or animals for a high rating.
--Suga Kenji--

599
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:07,340
I'm leaving, the serving lady will take care of you

600
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,700
[So enlightening]

601
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,510
I want to take a piss

602
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Me too

603
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,580
Shall we go?

604
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,420
There must be a trick in here

605
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,860
Why?!

606
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,770
Hey!, this is wrong am Yamazaki, he said "Hamada Out"

607
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,510
Wait! wait!, this is wrong!

608
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,640
Yamazaki was punished instead of Hamada

609
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,710
Why?!

610
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,150
It was Hamada-san who laughed

611
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
What the hell?!

612
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,120
I didn't laugh at all

613
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,290
We were in the bathroom

614
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,630
--You laughed right?

615
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,930
Not really, I was only commenting on something, and they mistook it for a laugher

616
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,230
But I heard the Judge

617
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
He called you out...

618
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,650
It's true

619
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,180
Wait a minute...

620
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,590
What are you saying?

621
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,490
--After he called you out, the punisher came in here and hit me

622
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,530
Will you just cut it out

623
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,210
That was loud

624
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,520
It hurts really bad

625
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,490
It was really loud too

626
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,430
Yamazaki picks up the Hot springs pamphlet

627
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,530
There's something in the Hot spring pamphlet

628
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:18,040
inside there are introductions by famous people that stayed at the inn.  Included also is a part by chief producer Suga

629
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,410
-Producer Suga-
He is a genius producer who produced many hit programs.
He loves Yugawara very much which is
why he features Yugawara in many of his programs.
Since he was younger he always dreamed about the onsen baths.
His brain cells become so flexible because of the onsen steam.

630
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,150
[You had to read them in order]

631
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,690
Not so rough!

632
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,730
[When I see someone else getting hit
I think I shouldn't laugh]

633
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,610
Hamada-san, take a look at this

634
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:55,470
Yamazaki wants to trick Hamada by
showing him Suga's fake introduction

635
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:55,940
It's beautiful

636
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,340
--Yes it really is

637
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,610
They even have this shape

638
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,720
Even an out door bath

639
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,340
You bastard...

640
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,860
[Why do you look bland?!]

641
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,390
That was pretty surprising

642
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,190
Yes

643
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,260
--Yes it was

644
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,570
I think we have to be more careful

645
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,860
--Excuse me

646
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,230
Seemingly ordinary serving lady

647
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,570
We have some Japanese bathrobes for you to change into

648
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,050
We have 2 sizes, M and L.

649
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,430
Tanaka-san, which will it be?

650
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,020
Ah... an L, please.

651
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,670
Yes, sir.

652
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,270
Yamasaki-san?

653
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,450
I'll take an M

654
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,830
Lip Monster-san?

655
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,010
Which would you like, Lip Monster-san?

656
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,870
What, for real?!

657
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Oh I forgot, let me show you something...

658
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,780
we have an introductory video of our Inn, please watch it

659
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:54,090
Hot Spring Inn Guide

660
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,360
Please take your time and watch it

661
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,230
Now we will introduce this Hot spring inn

662
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:01,630
Host
Endo Shozo

663
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,170
Eh...everyone often

664
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,070
comes with their family and kids

665
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,180
[I'm seeing this for the first time]

666
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:15,210
and spend a lot on Sushi etc

667
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:22,620
I'm going to introduce, hey you!

668
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,990
[Endo went to Yugawara
alone just for this]

669
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,240
It stopped

670
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,850
Endo's Takeshi Kitano Onsen Guide starts again

671
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,460
5 Minutes later...

672
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,460
It was kinda long

673
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,560
Quite long

674
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,700
He filmed a long vtr

675
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,200
That's incredible!

676
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,940
This is the main hall, yea

677
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,350
[How cheap]

678
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,480
10 Minutes later...

679
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,350
Hey honey, where are you from?

680
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:38,900
Eh?

681
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,770
I made it through...

682
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,200
They actually made this video

683
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:55,780
Meanwhile, the mastermind of this batsu, Matsumoto arrives at the inn.

684
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,450
Good evening

685
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,490
This is amazing

686
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:07,390
Headquarters

687
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,500
Look at this place

688
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:08,300
You guys are really desperate to punish them.

689
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:16,420
-7:00 p.m.
(5 hours past)-

690
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:21,690
They've changed their clothes and are lounging peacefully

691
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,180
but It won't last long

692
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:43,150
C3PO
(Producer Nakamura)-

693
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:52,510
R2D2
(Director Ohnuma)-

694
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:52,630
C3PO
(Producer Nakamura)

695
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,720
[Why does R2D2 look so lousy?]

696
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,760
[They probably spent all the money on C3PO.]

697
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:28,710
Darth Vader
(Old lady 1)

698
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,420
[Hurts more in a robe?]
--[Yes.]

699
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,850
Hamada-san also laughed!

700
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,190
--No I didn't

701
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,900
That's a false accusation

702
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,870
Was it my imagination?

703
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:39,210
-8:00 p.m., (6 hours past)-

704
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,010
What time is it?

705
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:48,410
I think it's about ... 7:00

706
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,280
The room has no clock

707
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,010
Might be a little past?

708
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,410
I'm starving

709
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,910
I eat like a horse these days

710
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:01,530
--Really?

711
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,110
It's because I quit smoking

712
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,740
--Ah I see

713
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,710
What about you?

714
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
I did too

715
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,710
So I eat a lot

716
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,110
When did you quit smoking?

717
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,610
About 2 months ago

718
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,610
I really want to quit, too

719
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,910
I don't think you want to quit

720
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,920
That's true, but...

721
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,720
I need to switch to another brand
I'm smoking a stronger one now

722
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,620
What do you mean by "stronger"?

723
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,870
Magnitude

724
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,870
Magnitude?

725
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,220
What the hell is "magnitude"?

726
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,480
"Magnitude" was a bad move, Tanaka

727
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,030
You did it on purpose?

728
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,160
No

729
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,960
If you did, that was lame

730
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,110
[Hey.]

731
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:15,910
[The gorilla is acting strange.
It's definitely acting funny.]

732
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,210
[Look at its mouth.]

733
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,640
Magnitude

734
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:22,210
[He's about to laugh.]

735
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:24,110
It's been affecting me a lot

736
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,830
Cut it out!

737
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:35,280
Just shut up! Why do you have to talk?!

738
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:48,080
This is your fault, you kept talking

739
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:54,680
I didn't want him to think I did it on purpose

740
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,630
I just wanted to explain

741
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:02,130
It's not grammatically correct, idiot

742
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:08,370
Hamada-san, are you..

743
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,570
What is it?

744
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:17,880
[You should stop with the friendly fire.]

745
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,730
[It's too early to be on the disabled list.]

746
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,310
Why?!

747
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:30,560
You had it coming!

748
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,260
What's with the swing?

749
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,960
I was just worried about your ass

750
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,460
You replied in such a gentle voice!

751
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,630
What's up with that guy?

752
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,380
He whips very hard

753
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,830
He does it every time

754
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,530
Not again!

755
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,980
C3PO returns for a 2nd time

756
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,780
It's cold

757
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,210
He just left it open

758
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,310
That Bastard

759
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,090
They're doing it just to annoy us

760
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:18,560
C3PO returns for a 3rd time

761
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,280
I can't...

762
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,930
Please go easy on me

763
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:52,300
It's throbbing

764
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,850
And it's cold

765
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,580
I wish they'd stop

766
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,830
C3PO returns for a 4th time

767
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:24,080
Please, I'm begging you

768
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,430
The music is enough to crack me up

769
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,790
It's becoming a conditioned reflex

770
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,890
Hang on, Hamada-san.

771
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,560
9:00 pm
(7 hours past)

772
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:55,860
It's about time to bathe, you guys stink!

773
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:58,860
Why not bathe in the hot spring?

774
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,460
Do you want to take a bath?

775
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,510
--I do

776
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,660
Let's go then

777
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,560
OK.

778
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,390
Underground lies one of the finest hot springs

779
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,590
So enjoy

780
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:20,990
As they pass by, Matsumoto hides in the bathroom

781
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,010
What is he planning?

782
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:37,710
Nukumizu (actor)
happens to be in the changing room

783
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,040
[That can't be]

784
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,380
He whipped my balls

785
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,280
"Works instantly"

786
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:02,180
Nukumizu puts hair grower on his head

787
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,750
Hot!

788
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,230
Let me try this

789
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:17,700
Nukumizu tries a different brand

790
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,970
Nukumizu is having
difficulty tying his sash

791
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,900
Please stop it

792
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:49,070
Tanaka's laughing too

793
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,100
ehh, Wait...

794
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,680
It hurts!!

795
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,030
Hey! Hold up there!

796
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:11,380
What are you doing?  How many years
have you been in the TV business?

797
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,330
You can't be naked on "primetime" TV

798
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,080
I have some "primetime" swim shorts for you to wear

799
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,800
--If you say so...

800
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,580
Hey, Tanaka!

801
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,630
A middle-aged man is wearing
Tanaka's "primetime" swim shorts.

802
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,840
Are you for real?

803
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,550
Who the hell are you?!

804
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,250
Wait

805
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,190
Easy, please go easy on me

806
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,760
Please!

807
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:51,290
Tanaka

808
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,530
Put this on

809
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:58,270
Next, Yamazaki

810
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,400
Yamasaki, these are for you

811
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,700
Why must they wear them first?

812
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:16,590
Next, Hamada

813
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:22,450
(laughs)

814
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,850
what the hell, he's not wearing anything!

815
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,690
Why the hell is he naked?!

816
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,500
Why no underwear?

817
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:56,230
--yeah why?

818
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,600
This is just wrong!

819
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,680
cut it out! already!

820
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:22,290
[Why did you keep putting
your shorts back on?]

821
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:26,160
[Don't keep putting them on!
Just give them to me!]

822
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,270
This can't be happening

823
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:00,660
[That's digusting!]

824
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:06,930
[Bare ass.]

825
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:13,850
[You farted on us with your bare ass.]

826
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:23,190
He's insane!

827
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,530
[The ball came from nowhere.]

828
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:47,740
Pro Golfer Monkey (Old Lady. 1)

829
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,810
Note: Pro golfer Saru(Monkey) is a classic cartoon & video game character

830
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:55,150
[She must've plopped the ball into the bath.]

831
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:57,750
[How many strokes?]

832
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,650
[Why?]

833
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:15,170
[Why?!]

834
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,180
Why did she kiss him?

835
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,750
[You were laughing from the pain.]

836
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:43,030
They really put the camera at a bad place for Tanaka.

837
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,570
He can't even relax

838
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,370
He looks like a Gunji Hiyoronka (Military spokesman)

839
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,160
Hamada is instructed to put on an Afro wig

840
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:17,440
[That laugh should have counted!]

841
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:43,160
Inside of the basket, this wig didn't look so big

842
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,160
I knew it wouldn't be a regular afro

843
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,700
So that's an "Afro"

844
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,900
Isn't it hot?

845
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,800
Why is it hot in here?

846
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:57,270
I wonder why

847
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:04,010
I just washed my hair, this is bad

848
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,380
It's hot

849
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,940
[We acted alike.]

850
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:29,140
[We were desperately trying not to laugh.]

851
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,450
Please stop staring at me like that

852
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,720
--Huh?

853
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,640
[It accumulates, doesn't it?]

854
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,940
Weren't you staring at me for awhile?

855
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,450
Weren't you?

856
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:03,550
He was

857
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,500
He sure was

858
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,710
Hamada you suck!

859
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:15,010
Remove that wig now!

860
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,280
Die!

861
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,730
It messed up my hair

862
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,330
Die!

863
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:39,370
10:00 pm
(8 hours past)

864
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:44,510
A usual guest is coming to visit the 3 men in their room

865
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:50,410
Yes?

866
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:53,600
Good Evening

867
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:57,960
I went to a wedding nearby

868
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:02,940
So I decided to drop by to say hello

869
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:02,490
Fukawa Ryo
(Comedian)

870
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,880
And cheer you up

871
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,270
How are you holding up?

872
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:10,880
You look tired

873
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,800
Are you all right?

874
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,400
--Fukawa-kun

875
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,600
What?

876
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:26,850
Please let me hear that "old saying" again

877
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,150
That speech is only for that occasion

878
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,800
Please let me hear that speech again

879
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,560
It's only for...

880
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,730
--Just one time please

881
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:38,730
All right, promise me you'll leave right after

882
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:47,540
An old adage says there are 3 sacks
vital for a happy marriage

883
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,140
Firstly,

884
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,930
the sack of nuts

885
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,890
The sack of nuts!

886
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:57,690
And it's the very first one!

887
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,560
Once more, please

888
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,220
--no way

889
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,170
Sorry, everyone

890
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:13,670
Didn't you get what you wanted?

891
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:15,390
Hey

892
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:19,440
May I hear your "one phrase" joke?

893
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:25,860
Let me hear it once more, please

894
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,730
OK, only if you leave immediately after hearing it

895
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,680
Does it matter if the Chinese characters reads Hagiwara or Ogiwara?

896
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:38,130
Ogiwara or Hagiwara!

897
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:39,890
Are you satisfied now?

898
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:50,670
Ogiwara or Hagiwara!

899
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:50,170
--Let me hear that speech again

900
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:58,930
You guys are too persistent!

901
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:01,000
Take them out!

902
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:18,040
Matsumoto once again devices a plan to bring more misery upon them

903
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:24,810
You scared me

904
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:26,610
It's Matsumoto-Kyoto

905
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:31,060
How its going?

906
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,160
How's it going-rolling?

907
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:40,020
You're moving faster than we did on any batsu game we've done so far

908
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,120
You wanna drink water-later?

909
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,970
Matsumoto can't contain his laughter

910
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,420
What's that all about?

911
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:10,430
What are you doing?

912
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:16,620
I'm here to lift up your spirits

913
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:19,230
Why do you look annoyed?

914
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:22,330
Tell me why-shy-thy

915
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:26,960
I'm here to help you

916
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,110
Why can't you speak normally?

917
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,560
I am speaking normally-formally

918
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,230
You know, I've got something for you

919
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:50,730
I wanna know what you think of these

920
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,020
--What's in there?

921
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:55,780
Just take a look at these-cheese

922
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:03,670
Kuwano Nobuyoshi's (comedian)
Driver's License.

923
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:12,410
Note: A gold license is given out to people who don’t
have any points on their current driving license,
this is an achievement usually limited to “paper” drivers – those who have a license but never actually drive!

924
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:15,410
He's got a gold card!

925
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:24,820
I'm sorry

926
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:27,010
I just wanted you to see it

927
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:30,180
Maybe you'll find this funny

928
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:37,120
Banjo Eiji (TV Talent)

929
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,610
You think this ... No? OK

930
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,540
It's for you, Hamada

931
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,920
Charlie Hama (Comedian)

932
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:53,450
He looks so blank

933
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:56,960
[Why do they've all have gold cards.]

934
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:04,730
They hit the same spot over and over

935
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:09,880
I really wish I could make them stop

936
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:13,230
But it doesn't work that way-say-hey

937
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:15,310
Try hard OK?

938
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:18,310
You're not even half way yet

939
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,480
You guys are kind of disgusting

940
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,760
I just don't get it, what's so funny?
Why are you laughing?

941
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:37,460
Go easy on me please

942
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,270
See ya!

943
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:47,540
Good bye-eye

944
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,640
What?!

945
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:49,390
You rhymed

946
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,890
And Hamada laughed again

947
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:56,250
Cut it out!

948
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:03,810
I'll be leaving now

949
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,840
He ate us alive

950
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:47,530
Darth Vader
(Old lady.1)

951
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:49,400
Are you alright?

952
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:54,230
What's this?

953
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:57,570
Darth Vader dropped a piece of his equipment

954
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:05,310
We had enough

955
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:15,490
11:00 pm
(9 hours past)

956
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:18,880
They haven't eaten any food ever since they arrived at Yugawara

957
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:23,200
Maybe that's why they look so limp

958
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:31,920
It stinks!

959
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,940
You guys sure do stink!

960
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:39,340
Since you keep demanding food...

961
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:43,160
We'll get you some cho ... dinner

962
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,440
You want it?

963
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:46,950
--Yes of course

964
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,090
You're pathetic!

965
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:55,350
We'll have dinner and refresh ourselves

966
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:57,600
OK?
--OK.

967
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:08,040
Staying at the Inn
Ijiri Okada
(Comedian)

968
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:09,510
[This is weird.]

969
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:12,170
[I don't understand
why he's there.]

970
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:14,280
[Who called him?]

971
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:15,800
What?!

972
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:19,390
Hamada gets a child's plate

973
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,770
For God's sake, give me some decent food

974
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:46,490
What are you doing here, Ijiri?

975
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:49,540
I had a gig at a nearby bar, doing impersonation acts

976
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:02,450
Tanaka spills his dinner

977
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:08,430
[The lid wouldn't open.]

978
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,580
Pantyhose

979
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:21,960
[What did you think it was?!]

980
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,150
[What made you think it was food?]

981
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:31,070
[I thought it was dried bean curd.]

982
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:34,520
Yamasaki almost ate a pair of pantyhose

983
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,750
[This is more confusing than funny.]

984
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:47,270
[You thought that was food?]

985
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:56,180
What the hell is that?

986
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:59,430
It's a pair of pantyhose, I almost ate it

987
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:05,440
I feel sick!

988
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:08,330
It was in the egg hotchpotch

989
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,500
Excuse me

990
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:16,400
In fact, today in the next room

991
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,410
there is E.Yazawa's Japan tour group

992
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:24,740
so it may be a little noisy.  I'm sorry for the trouble

993
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,340
--Thank you

994
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,020
I'm sorry but

995
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,320
it looks like it's starting

996
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:02,580
Eichan's towel can be seen

997
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:51,560
Eichan along with back band

998
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,340
Thank you very much!

999
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,700
Please have a wonderful time!

1000
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:09,110
2 hours and half is tiring, huh

1001
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,800
They dropped the dishes

1002
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,060
Midnight
(10 hours past)

1003
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:55,080
With so many traps, one after the other, they are growing tired

1004
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:02,730
If you guys don't have anything to talk about, let's go with Mr. Marick

1005
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,600
What should we do with Mr. Marick?

1006
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,710
Talk about him

1007
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:42,210
Theme
Mr. Marick

1008
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,480
Doesn't  he have another name?

1009
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:17,780
What was it?

1010
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:18,960
Don't you know?

1011
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,440
Japanese name

1012
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,980
Is it Matsuo Shokyokusai?

1013
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:24,820
Matsuo..

1014
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,890
What kind of name is that?

1015
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:37,750
Where did that come from?

1016
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,280
Another name

1017
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:48,510
His Japanese name

1018
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,070
Mr. Marick

1019
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:52,750
What kind of name is Matsuo Shokyokusai?

1020
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:02,770
This is because you mentioned about Matsuo Shokyokusai

1021
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:10,060
Correct Information

1022
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:10,660
Matsuo Gentousai

1023
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:10,670
Mr. Marick's another name when he performs his magic show in Japanese costume

1024
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,760
He surely does

1025
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,250
I didn't know at all

1026
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:10,570
When he dresses up like an old man?

1027
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:12,520
Ah..I guess so

1028
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,070
With Un-nan

1029
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:17,580
Next theme is design perm

1030
01:18:18,610 --> 01:19:07,590
Theme
Design perm

1031
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,410
What is design perm like?

1032
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:23,950
Well it's like..

1033
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:26,650
What?

1034
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:30,720
I got a perm, only on the top

1035
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,710
Looks very natural

1036
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:51,280
I think design perm is only partial

1037
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:52,980
Is that so?

1038
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:56,980
I think so.. who else got design perm?

1039
01:18:58,050 --> 01:18:59,330
I wonder who

1040
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:00,950
Mostly

1041
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:02,490
Mostly?

1042
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:12,260
You are bad, Tanaka

1043
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,470
What are you doing Tanaka?  Really

1044
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:19,070
I dont know what you mean by "Mostly"

1045
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:40,540
Listen, today there's...

1046
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:44,540
...a Hollywood star secretly staying at the Inn.

1047
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,640
What?

1048
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:48,240
He kindly said he wanted to say hello to you bums

1049
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,960
You'll be stunned

1050
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:52,580
Please come in

1051
01:19:56,830 --> 01:20:01,530
The Hollywood star
Robert De Niro

1052
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,670
[He really looks like him.]

1053
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:07,170
[Especially when he
smiles and cries.]

1054
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,830
I've seen that face so many times

1055
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:31,230
Teru  (Comedian)

1056
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:32,560
Good Evening

1057
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:47,360
"De Niro humoring a baby."

1058
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:01,400
(Bump.)

1059
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,510
[The door hit him.]

1060
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,920
De Niro making...

1061
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,280
Come on!

1062
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:28,890
Give me a break!

1063
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:29,890
Please!

1064
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:34,180
No way that's in the script

1065
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:45,520
That's just an intro

1066
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:48,790
I swear I won't laugh again

1067
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:51,200
"De Niro performing a 'hammer throw'"

1068
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:17,490
Mr. De Niro is a busy man, He says he has to go

1069
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:19,790
Consider yourself lucky

1070
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:49,110
You know what, about the C3PO thing, give me a break

1071
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,620
Oh yeah

1072
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:54,590
When you hear the "ba ba ba ban" we had a different plan

1073
01:22:55,150 --> 01:23:05,030
Naka-C3PO
(producer Nakamura)

1074
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:58,460
When the door opened, Yinling was supposed to appear

1075
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:05,100
Swimsuit model Yinling

1076
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,460
But she had that thing on, so she couldn't open the door

1077
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,560
We wanted you to laugh when Yinling entered the door

1078
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,600
But you laughed just because of the door opening

1079
01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:09,900
Oh, really

1080
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:13,870
"ahh my stomach is sore, my ass is sore"

1081
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,180
and then, again gara gara (door opening sound)

1082
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:18,410
He closes it again!

1083
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,380
Again Nakamura appears!

1084
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,320
Yeah that's true

1085
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:27,790
"Ow, that hurt" Again he closes the door!

1086
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:29,020
What the hell?

1087
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:32,590
Get outta here!

1088
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:35,250
1:00 am
(11 hours past)

1089
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:40,720
All 3 are tired after hours of torture

1090
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,960
But that doesn't stop us from sending another assassin

1091
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:53,650
Itao Itsuji (Comedian)

1092
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:32,930
Itao takes out a rifle
from the fishing bag

1093
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:36,930
[He's so clumsy.]

1094
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:39,970
[He's supposed to be a professional.]

1095
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:43,270
[He kept trying again and again.]

1096
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:51,060
[He doesn't realize that details do matter.]

1097
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:05,890
Hello?

1098
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,390
Yeah

1099
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,840
A guy wearing black-rimmed glasses?

1100
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:20,540
Let's not talk about it now

1101
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:22,930
[What did they say?]

1102
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:27,680
Yes?

1103
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,730
Change of target?

1104
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:33,480
A guy with contact lenses?

1105
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:55,000
The sniper Itao, gets sniped

1106
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,420
[He went to the wrong side.]

1107
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:05,950
[That was definitely the wrong side.]

1108
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:14,780
Anyone would be stunned by that

1109
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,020
[Yeah, it's more startling than funny.]

1110
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:32,140
I've been to Paris, 3 times

1111
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:33,710
No way, really?

1112
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:35,110
That many times?

1113
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:42,810
Endo     Matsumoto

1114
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:55,030
Trying hard?

1115
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:56,730
How's it going?

1116
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,730
I'm trying my best but

1117
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:02,870
my ass hurts more than ever...

1118
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,470
Because you're laughing too much

1119
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:08,210
He really laughs a lot

1120
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:10,440
Really

1121
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:17,720
Let's change the atmosphere

1122
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:20,190
Let's play a game

1123
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:24,850
Impersonation Game

1124
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:29,720
Impersonate famous people while saying certain words

1125
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:29,720
Rule

1126
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:28,290
Ok let's start!

1127
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:39,870
This is the first one

1128
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:44,540
Kuwata Keisuke's impersonation of things katakana

1129
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,280
Endo you start

1130
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:53,550
Gadaru Kanaru Taka (person's name)

1131
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:56,220
Ok? Gadaru

1132
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:00,990
Hamada-san is smirking

1133
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:03,030
Ok Fujiwara you next

1134
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,700
Do Kuwata Kesukei impersonation

1135
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,270
Nai fu! (Knife)

1136
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,640
Why knife?

1137
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:20,580
What did you say?

1138
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:22,410
Knife

1139
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:26,550
I didn't laugh at that

1140
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:29,890
Watch this

1141
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,230
I was safe

1142
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
That's an Incredible whip!

1143
01:28:42,870 --> 01:28:44,870
Ok it's Tanaka's turn

1144
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:47,740
Go Hiromi impersonating something about the Kansai region

1145
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,110
Takoyaki

1146
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:54,350
What that?

1147
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:00,420
I can't do impersonations, it's hard

1148
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,320
Ok Yamazaki

1149
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,130
Okonomiyaki

1150
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:14,100
Hamada-san your turn

1151
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,700
No, Yamazaki again

1152
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:20,640
Okonomiyaki

1153
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:27,010
Yamazaki again

1154
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,680
--Okonomiyaki

1155
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,320
Why do you keep repeating the same phrase?

1156
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:45,200
Well maybe we shouldn't have come...

1157
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:47,930
No, it was fun

1158
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,300
If you wanted to say something, please say it now

1159
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:54,670
Take off the glasses and talk

1160
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,150
You're talking to me rudely, I'm getting disgusted

1161
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:04,950
Hamada-san, you know...

1162
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:13,990
if you have kids, you teach them to look at someone's eyes when you speak to them

1163
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:15,260
Hamada!

1164
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,210
Pass me

1165
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:28,970
What?

1166
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:30,840
Never mind.  Fujiwara...

1167
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,850
What are you talking about?

1168
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:35,780
Fujiwara get them out of here

1169
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,580
--Take who out?

1170
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:40,390
Who and who do you want out of here?

1171
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:42,560
Say it clearly

1172
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,760
Look at my face and tell me

1173
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:45,460
HAMADA!

1174
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:55,030
Give me a break already!

1175
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:01,910
Damn He hits hard

1176
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,880
Ok Fujiwara, should we go?

1177
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:10,710
2:00AM
(15 hours in the Batsu game)

1178
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:17,390
Madam Fujiwara invites them to the temple next door

1179
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:18,960
And then...

1180
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:23,500
Beware the Damned!

1181
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:25,260
Undead Warrior
Heipo (Director)

1182
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,500
Help me!

1183
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,470
That looked painful

1184
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,670
That was dangerous

1185
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:35,640
I'm scared!

1186
01:31:38,110 --> 01:31:39,980
[Tanaka you were really scared]

1187
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:51,490
So they enter the temple and the priest begins to show them scary pictures

1188
01:31:54,530 --> 01:31:58,730
Please take a look at this picture of some boys sitting down

1189
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:05,570
Out of the 5 boys, 2 are Kishibe Shiro

1190
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:11,510
This is a picture of a family playing

1191
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:14,750
Please look closely

1192
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:17,050
at the spots

1193
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:22,050
Most of the spots are Kishibe Shiro

1194
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:24,790
This is just a regular picture, but

1195
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:29,830
there's something in the tea container

1196
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:38,140
You can see clearly, it's Kishibe Shiro

1197
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:43,910
So from now on, please be aware of Kishibe Shiro

1198
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:33,620
Sniper Itao get shot in the back

1199
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:37,430
[You guys were the targets]

1200
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:05,650
3:00 am
(12 hours past)

1201
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:08,030
our 3 went to take a bath again

1202
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:12,000
But there are cleverly-devised traps even in the bathroom

1203
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:15,680
It's so cold

1204
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:19,740
A mysterious woman is having a bath

1205
01:34:46,410 --> 01:34:50,510
The woman farts in the bath

1206
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:16,680
[You guys looked stunned.]
--[Yes, we were.]

1207
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:28,070
Why did they call me out?

1208
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:30,280
The rules are awfully tough

1209
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:41,820
They don't care if we laugh or not anymore

1210
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:54,520
Tanaka is instructed to put on a spooky mask

1211
01:35:58,090 --> 01:35:59,840
I'm going to pee

1212
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:03,480
You did it just now

1213
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:11,150
Tanaka, we're leaving now

1214
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:19,570
Tanaka in a spooky mask

1215
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:28,770
[Scary isn't it?
--Yeah it is]

1216
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:33,370
[ohh a strong swing]

1217
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,930
Damn it, now my ass hurts a lot

1218
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:45,350
That mask must be hot

1219
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:47,420
It's very hot

1220
01:36:47,430 --> 01:36:49,280
Extremely hot

1221
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:53,580
Tanaka enjoys looking at his masked face in the mirror

1222
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:55,840
[You liked that mask, didn't you?]

1223
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,750
(Gurgle)

1224
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,100
Cut it out

1225
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,950
What?

1226
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:29,350
Try this on

1227
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:30,350
Yeah, do it

1228
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:33,500
Oh, this?

1229
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:37,240
This is huge

1230
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,080
[Come on.]

1231
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:58,960
Ouch, that must've hurt

1232
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:12,660
The Mad Brothers enter the room

1233
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:19,800
Mad Endo    Mad Matsumoto

1234
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:23,160
The inn has a specialty

1235
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:27,720
They have a kind of night show here

1236
01:38:27,730 --> 01:38:29,630
A sort of feast

1237
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:31,380
You wanna go?

1238
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:33,770
We can't have it here?

1239
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:35,450
Of course not

1240
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:38,430
it's a great show really

1241
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:39,640
Night show?

1242
01:38:40,690 --> 01:38:44,060
I really want you to enjoy it, Hamada-san

1243
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:46,060
You do?

1244
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:45,670
--Yes

1245
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:49,510
Lets go

1246
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:52,850
Now

1247
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:08,040
If we must, let's just go now

1248
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,510
That pose means, "let's go!"

1249
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:17,760
Sucks for you

1250
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:26,730
Why can't we just go!

1251
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:31,740
How long are you gonna keep doing that?

1252
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:34,450
Let's get going, now!

1253
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:36,660
We're gonna go soon

1254
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:40,510
That guy is so powerful

1255
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,580
Hey, enough already...

1256
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:56,840
Get the hell out! Now!

1257
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,890
I said we will soon, OK?

1258
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:05,210
Don't make those moves!

1259
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:11,610
Hamada-san, you should come over here quickly

1260
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:14,330
Maybe it's the angle

1261
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:21,630
[What the hell are you doing!]

1262
01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:29,640
No way!

1263
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,810
Haven't you had enough?

1264
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:34,720
How much more are we supposed to take it?

1265
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:40,190
OK, I got it we'll go right now

1266
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:53,680
Stop it! Goddamn it!

1267
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:55,740
Out! Now!

1268
01:40:57,130 --> 01:40:58,990
Please get out

1269
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,600
We can't take it anymore

1270
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:05,490
I promise I won't do it anymore

1271
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:18,440
All 5 attend the nightly dinner show

1272
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:22,430
They finally exit the room

1273
01:41:22,430 --> 01:41:26,280
They're on their way to see the night show.

1274
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:29,820
The batsu game gets tougher and crueler

1275
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:32,310
What awaits them?

1276
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:35,040
Mysterious MC

1277
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:39,900
Thank you for coming to the inn and this show

1278
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:46,450
Tonight, we proudly present
a wonderful dinner show

1279
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:51,130
First up is an '80s superstar
who's finally playing in Yugawara

1280
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:54,410
Please give him a warm applause!

1281
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:10,310
Yogiriyo Konya mo Arigato
Ishihara Yujiro (Late singer and actor)-
*The Japanese Sinatra.
(Yutarou)

1282
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:13,480
[What a sweet voice!]

1283
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:55,070
They've laughed, but please watch without interruption.

1284
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,240
Great!

1285
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:14,200
Yujiro!

1286
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,650
Awesome!

1287
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,470
Awesome!

1288
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:37,440
Add another blow

1289
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:37,030
--that must be tough

1290
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:40,680
Up next, from the famous
comedian agency, Yoshimoto...

1291
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:43,890
the comedian better known
as "The Comedy Commando."

1292
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:45,370
Please give him a good clap.

1293
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:50,960
Yamashita Shigenori (Comedian)

1294
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,350
[You guys didn't clap.]

1295
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:58,480
Yamashita splits!

1296
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,400
Squash!

1297
01:44:14,490 --> 01:44:17,960
-5 minutes later-

1298
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:21,570
[It must have felt like an eternity.]

1299
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,720
Let's just get to the next act

1300
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:39,190
Also from Yoshimoto is a rising star, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed

1301
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:40,350
Take it away!

1302
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:52,060
Please watch our impressions
and sound imitations

1303
01:44:48,570 --> 01:44:50,570
Jicho Kacho
(Comedy Duo)

1304
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:54,580
"An old time radio."

1305
01:44:54,930 --> 01:45:00,040
(Oldie)

1306
01:45:01,970 --> 01:45:07,510
In 1945, Japan surrended and signed the US-Japan peace Treaty

1307
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:13,750
Next is "an orangutan eating ants."

1308
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:37,220
Next, Katsura Kinshi Shishou

1309
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:43,360
Welcome, to the affairs of the state

1310
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:47,730
When people line up

1311
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:49,430
a long line

1312
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:52,570
it was for Katsura Kinshi

1313
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:15,150
That was a very good night show

1314
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:16,260
Yes it was

1315
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,560
You'll have a good memory

1316
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:27,300
Next a veteran singing duo, the brothers Pinkara Kyodai

1317
01:46:35,070 --> 01:46:39,080
Onna no Michi
Pinkara Kyodai
(Nobu & Fukki)

1318
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:36,440
[This guy also looks like the real person too]

1319
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:01,060
4:00 am
(14 hours past)

1320
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:08,040
After the night show, it's time to hit the long-awaited bed

1321
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,090
But...

1322
01:48:18,730 --> 01:48:24,130
Pro Golfer Monkey comes in

1323
01:48:19,010 --> 01:48:24,010
Pro Golfer Monkey
(Old lady.1)

1324
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:27,910
[I felt so sleepy.]

1325
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:30,630
[So did she, We had to drag her out of bed.]

1326
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:39,850
[You made her wear this thing again.]

1327
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:18,310
[What is she doing?]

1328
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:21,980
[We had no idea what she was going to do to us.]

1329
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:33,410
She tickled me

1330
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:40,010
[She's using the big guns.]

1331
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:45,930
A deep kiss for good-night

1332
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:51,640
[Rape.]

1333
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,110
Score one for her

1334
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:14,440
Disgusting!

1335
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:20,990
Hamada-san, this is unbearable

1336
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:23,240
Isn't it a bomb?

1337
01:50:22,670 --> 01:50:24,670
--it sure is

1338
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:29,540
You better go to the bathroom

1339
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:30,540
Excuse me

1340
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:33,610
I'm going to wash my mouth

1341
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:38,530
Yamasaki runs to the bathroom
to wash his mouth.

1342
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:46,910
It would be hilarious if she were to be at the doorway when he comes out

1343
01:50:48,410 --> 01:50:48,790
Is she ready?

1344
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:51,580
Tell her to go if she's ready

1345
01:51:14,630 --> 01:51:17,320
Hamada wraps himself in the futon

1346
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:18,870
Tanaka is just astonished

1347
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:28,270
[Why is he out?]

1348
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:33,740
Doomed!

1349
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:35,590
Doomed! Yama-chan is doomed!

1350
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:50,150
-30 minutes later-

1351
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:05,890
Tonight is Yamada(Crucial)

1352
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:08,270
Yamada Hussein

1353
01:52:05,890 --> 01:52:09,890
Note: It's supposed to mean, when properly pronounced,
"Tonight is a crucial night.

1354
01:52:27,660 --> 01:52:30,980
Give me a break!

1355
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:42,340
-Bed Time-

1356
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:44,340
They went to sleep shortly thereafter.

1357
01:52:44,490 --> 01:52:49,260
After a short sleeping period,
it's time to wake up

1358
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:55,060
Wake up guys!

1359
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:59,600
Wake up

1360
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:02,970
Come on, guys

1361
01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:05,700
The Batsu game isn't over yet

1362
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:11,260
[Huh?]

1363
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:14,200
Come on, Yamasaki.

1364
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:22,250
I completely forgot about the No-Laughing rule

1365
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:26,180
[Oh, come on!]

1366
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:29,060
[You thought you were in your house?]

1367
01:53:38,950 --> 01:53:42,340
All 3 are groggily having breakfast

1368
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:45,220
And there comes unexpected news.

1369
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:49,810
Hamada, this is the morning paper

1370
01:53:49,810 --> 01:53:52,120
You like the sports section, right?

1371
01:53:55,300 --> 01:54:00,270
Hamada is in no hurry to read the paper

1372
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:06,060
It's good.

1373
01:54:09,330 --> 01:54:16,460
Yugawara Post:
"Dynamite Shikoku Pulls a Muscle Again!!"

1374
01:54:16,910 --> 01:54:18,870
[He's too weak.]

1375
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:21,580
[This is funny.]

1376
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:25,100
[I like the word, "again."
He had done it before.]

1377
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:31,020
[Tanaka, you have no
tolerance to Shikoku.]

1378
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:41,760
[I read the paper carefully.
It's well-written.]

1379
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:47,460
[It's very detailed.]

1380
01:54:49,150 --> 01:54:51,660
This early in the morning, that sucks

1381
01:54:55,010 --> 01:54:56,010
Tanaka

1382
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:59,180
Read this Article about Escargot man

1383
01:55:01,180 --> 01:55:02,950
About Escargot man

1384
01:55:03,950 --> 01:55:04,650
Interview?

1385
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:10,060
This newspaper looks like a real sports page

1386
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:16,800
There's an article about Dynamite Shikoku getting injured and his surprising fight

1387
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:23,270
He tried he best to fight with the champion Escargot man

1388
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:27,570
but he lost the fight after 58 seconds into the 1st round

1389
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:30,810
He lasted only 58 seconds

1390
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:35,080
Just 58 seconds

1391
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:47,130
He lost in 58 seconds!

1392
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:05,920
Yamasaki suddenly decides
to do a De Niro impression

1393
01:56:14,450 --> 01:56:15,520
Shit!

1394
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:24,630
(Bump)

1395
01:56:27,830 --> 01:56:30,280
[That's been there all the while!]

1396
01:56:32,590 --> 01:56:35,850
[I can't blame you guys for laughing.]

1397
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:40,030
[No way wouldn't we laugh.]

1398
01:56:48,130 --> 01:56:50,790
You can't do that

1399
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:00,500
You work today?

1400
01:57:01,070 --> 01:57:02,070
Yes

1401
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:05,390
I wonder what time it is

1402
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:06,820
Me too

1403
01:57:08,430 --> 01:57:11,010
They never let us know what time it is

1404
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:18,930
Tonight is YAMADA(Crucial)

1405
01:57:22,060 --> 01:57:28,400
Tonight is YAMADA(Crucial)

1406
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:44,260
Tonight is YAMADA(Crucial)

1407
01:57:58,070 --> 01:58:00,340
So persistent

1408
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:06,820
If it keeps coming like that, we're done

1409
01:58:07,660 --> 01:58:08,780
(Bump)

1410
01:58:09,530 --> 01:58:10,280
(Bump)

1411
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:16,600
[Why!]

1412
01:58:19,690 --> 01:58:22,340
Come on, Yama-chan, enough is enough

1413
01:58:24,010 --> 01:58:28,640
We should stop attacking each other

1414
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:56,210
Yama-chan, knock it off

1415
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:00,840
You looked at me with that funny look of yours

1416
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:07,630
It's not like that was your first time walking there

1417
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:14,970
Fujiwara dressed as
Bruce Lee (Game of Death)

1418
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:19,470
It's almost time to check out

1419
01:59:19,470 --> 01:59:21,340
So let's go to the lobby

1420
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:26,980
Fujiwara Lee talks to Hamada with
his face almost touching Hamada's

1421
01:59:29,850 --> 01:59:31,150
Hamada

1422
01:59:33,530 --> 01:59:34,620
[Too close.]

1423
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:37,070
[Yeah, it's too close.]

1424
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:47,710
Asshole

1425
01:59:54,290 --> 01:59:57,900
That landed hard

1426
01:59:59,010 --> 02:00:01,960
Why aren't you in your landlady's outfit?

1427
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:06,380
Why Bruce Lee?

1428
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:12,590
All hotel employees are here

1429
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:14,940
Let's thank them

1430
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:16,820
Come here

1431
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:26,370
Thank you very much for staying at out inn

1432
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:29,100
Thank you, sirs

1433
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:35,610
As a sign of our gratitude, we have a present for you

1434
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:51,500
Dynamite Shikoku
pops out from the box

1435
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:55,890
Everyone

1436
02:00:56,860 --> 02:00:59,550
On the count of 3...

1437
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:11,400
Shikoku! Shikoku!

1438
02:01:20,630 --> 02:01:22,860
[Look at the cleaning lady.]

1439
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:36,460
That jackass, at the very end, too!

1440
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:41,260
A day from hell is now over

1441
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:41,710
Matsumoto Hitoshi

1442
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:44,180
[Don't use my song!]

1443
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:46,650
They can't think of anything...

1444
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:50,760
but their painful asses...

1445
02:01:48,190 --> 02:01:50,190
[Don't use my song!]

1446
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:55,850
Number of times participants were whipped:


No. 3     Tanaka Naoki      64 times

1447
02:01:56,150 --> 02:02:00,710
Number of times participants were whipped:


No. 2     Yamazaki Hosei     72 times

1448
02:02:02,590 --> 02:02:04,710
Number of times participants were whipped:


No. 1     Hamada Masatoshi

1449
02:02:04,710 --> 02:02:08,470
Number of times participants were whipped:


No. 1     Hamada Masatoshi      78 times

1450
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:11,740
That was pretty funny

1451
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:14,210
Tanaka you didn't get hit much

1452
02:02:14,210 --> 02:02:16,220
Hamada-san you were #1

1453
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:23,160
Last time I was #1, but it was 52 hits

1454
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:25,260
This was very different

1455
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:27,290
20 hits more than me

1456
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:30,960
Nakai's Shikoku Shikoku was great

1457
02:02:30,730 --> 02:02:32,400
Yes it was

1458
02:02:32,030 --> 02:02:34,030
--She was great

1459
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:36,200
She's great

1460
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:48,140
Watch the Serving lady!

1461
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:50,280
[She's amazing!]

1462
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:04,760
[She did it perfectly]

1463
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:10,470
Enough with this song!

1464
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:14,810
Stop using this song!

1465
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:19,110
Yeah, but it's you singing so we can

1466
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:21,010
Yes

1467
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:23,420
Well, no wonder it played twice

1468
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:32,260
Well shall we end here

1469
02:03:32,290 --> 02:03:33,830
Yes after the song finishes

1470
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:37,760
Thank you everyone
