Ryouko-san!

00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,840
Ah..Pochi...

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,730
Good evening

9
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,900
Long time no see...

10
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,610
Is your dad home?

11
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,460
da-

12
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,460
...your father, uh wait

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,730
hold o...

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,430
Yeah.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,660
Excuse me

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,960
It's a pleasure to meet you again

17
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,660
Who is this?

18
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,500
From your home in Osaka...

19
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,800
...taking care of me..

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,460
back then..

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,400
Ah~

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,200
yes yes

23
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,700
I'll tell him!

24
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,370
Good evening. It's a pleasure to meet you again

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,010
Uhm, excuse me

26
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,200
Outside, lets talk out here

27
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,200
Okay

28
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,710
You came from Osaka?

29
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,700
Yes

30
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,860
I'm surprised you found us

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,830
Yes, well, uhm

32
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,640
I heard..your family

33
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,430
had moved...but wasn't really notified

34
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,130
...kinda surprised me there

35
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,650
Oh, yeah?

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,660
Yes

37
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,930
So, what is it?

38
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,800
Well, nothing important but..

39
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,830
Uh...

40
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,930
I didn't know we moved so

41
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,300
I was trying to follow you

42
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
You know?

43
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,260
I was glad to find you all and..

44
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,900
So...

45
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,160
right now you're owning..

46
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,730
other dogs now or...?

47
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,960
no no no

48
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,860
Oh, really?

49
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Mhm

50
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,980
So then we can all go...

51
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,450
Well..

52
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,800
This area...isn't like the last place we were at, ya know?

53
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,150
Different from the apartments back there, right?

54
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,330
Around here..

55
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,100
They call it "High-Class residential"

56
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,430
Pretty expensive to live here...

57
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,430
Oh, yes... Without a doubt

58
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,050
Like, the neighbours...

59
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,630
Did you see their home?

60
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,420
Yes, I saw it

61
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,760
Pretty expensive too!

62
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,920
What kind of house is that?

63
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,820
Rin..Re..Revolver..or something like that I think

64
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,100
Just something really exquisite!

65
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,610
Really!

66
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,800
...and over there, Tanaka's got a Doleman

67
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,940
I'm familiar with that style!

68
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,940
Oh, I see

69
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,800
I guess, having high quality homes could also mean high quality dogs

70
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,030
Everyone's got pure breeds around here...

71
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,330
I'm sure

72
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,960
Wait..

73
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,810
I'm...

74
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,560
What?

75
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,030
Huh?

76
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,060
What?

77
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,760
I think I might be misunderstanding...

78
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,430
Did I do something...to upset you?

79
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,660
No no no, nothing like that

80
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,600
Well..

81
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,630
Before..

82
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,540
In Osaka when the manager visited the apartment..

83
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,830
And..

84
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,100
I accidentally ended up barking at him

85
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,260
Because I didn't know who he was back then and...

86
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,260
...maybe that was a wrong move by me..?

87
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,940
Well, that's kind of your job too, so...

88
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,630
I mean...

89
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,630
yes yes

90
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,650
He was a total stranger to me..

91
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,000
But there's still acceptable and unacceptable times to bark, ya know?

92
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,640
And even..

93
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,530
...if you bark ALL the time..

94
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,530
That's also a problem

95
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,830
You gotta know when to bark and when to not

96
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,260
Of course..

97
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,340
I guess making noises in general...

98
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,300
Like

99
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,460
I just get the feeling to need to bark. Right?

100
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,200
I guess, but I wouldn't really understand where you're coming from but...

101
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,510
since I'm not like you..it's something..

102
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,370
I understand

103
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,500
I wouldn't expect you to understand senirorities and all that...

104
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,360
In the workplace and..

105
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,580
You wouldn't really understand, would you?

106
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,600
No, I wouldn't

107
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:22,730
No

108
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:23,380
No

109
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,800
Well..

110
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,800
I don't wanna stop you from doing.. you and..

111
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,160
you probably knew what was going on right?

112
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,500
Yeah, a little bit...

113
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,430
but still..

114
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,030
maybe next time...

115
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,930
Perhaps...

116
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,830
I could..

117
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:42,840
no no no

118
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,660
Just...

119
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,230
(Context: Itao is offering him money)

120
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,620
Wait..

121
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,120
It's not like that!

122
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,890
I can't take this!

123
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,890
No

124
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,780
No, really...

125
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,370
Please

126
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,720
No please, It's alright

127
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,610
You have to...

128
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,660
I won't take this

129
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,080
I insist

130
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,520
Please

131
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,120
No!

132
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,700
I'm not here for that

133
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,030
Or anything like that...

134
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,900
I will make that clear...

135
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,900
Please, I don't really need it

136
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,660
You sure?

137
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,660
Yes

138
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,730
But maybe..perhaps..

139
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,230
I came all this way so..

140
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,930
You could take me, from now on

141
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,500
Well, good luck...

142
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,500
...with everything

143
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,170
I'm sure it won't really be easy for you but...

144
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:21,890
Uhm...

145
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,930
No...

146
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,700
I'd like to...

147
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,000
..Here..

148
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,060
..stay here..

149
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,700
If that's possible?

150
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,830
Well...

151
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,000
you know..

152
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
..A mutt..

153
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,200
...Mixed breed

154
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,230
Yes, I'm aware

155
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,230
Good

156
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,760
Alright

157
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,700
That's true, there's that factor too

158
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,470
Well, It's almost time Isn't it?

159
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,970
Yeah

160
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,980
Well, today's...

161
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,300
my day off so...

162
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,610
...go get some chinese or something

163
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,610
Really?

164
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,980
You're going out?

165
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,660
We should really go soon..

166
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,640
Yeah

167
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,220
Then I'll just stay at home

168
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,060
I don't really think we can have that

169
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,960
How about...Monday?

170
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,900
Have any plans then?

171
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,860
No, nothing for Monday

172
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,660
I'm free all day

173
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,620
All day?

174
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,630
Yes

175
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,560
Then let's talk again on Monday

176
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,460
If you are available yes, please

177
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,460
Yeah

178
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,800
So Monday, correct?

179
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,490
Will work for you?

180
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:12,930
Monday?

181
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,060
I mean, it doesn't have to be Monday

182
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,080
No, I am fine with Monday

183
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,330
Monday it is

184
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,330
Around what time should I come?

185
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,070
Afternoon.

186
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,060
Afternoon?

187
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,960
What time...

188
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,000
Well...probably around 4..5...o'clock

189
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So monday, at 4

190
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,740
Same place. I'll be looking forward to it.

191
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,170
Alright

192
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,810
I apologize for showing up like this

193
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,660
I'm truly sorry

194
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,410
See you on Monday!

195
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,930
To be continued...
