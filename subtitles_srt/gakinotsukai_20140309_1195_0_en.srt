00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,050
Fully Improvise Everything! Liar's Inn

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,890
I've heard the guy in the Funayssi costume is you

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,290
I was asked to do it for a while

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,160
An Impossible Project!

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,160
They gotta improvise based on a lie given to them

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,000
The Rule: Based on a card with a name and lie level

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,000
Either a massive, , plausible or small lie

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,840
The person on the card picks someone to continue a lie

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,370
Which line is it?

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,970
I'm not sure, I'm just sort of on the train

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,980
Tonight the exciting finale!

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,410
Endo Shozo

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,410
Hamada Masatoshi

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,410
Matsumoto Hitoshi

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,410
Tanaka Naoki

16
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,410
Tsukitei Hosei

17
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,410
Alright, I'll go

18
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,120
Let's see this card

19
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,790
Matsumoto nominates someone to tell a massive lie

20
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,120
This is something that really shocked me,

21
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,620
I wouldn't have asked this if it wasn't for this episode,

22
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:56,500
Say, Yamasaki ... have you been smacked by a gorilla before?

23
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,010
Oh, is it alright if I talk about this?

24
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,970
A gorilla?

25
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,750
But Gorillas are really strong

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,250
Surely you'd die if one smacked you

27
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,010
Yeah, I wanted to confirm this,

28
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,020
Was it on a shoot?

29
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,390
It wasn't during a shoot

30
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,020
Eh? In your private time?

31
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,670
Eh eh eh eh?

32
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,650
Cause I thought this happened on a shoot

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,870
Yeah

34
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,360
No, it's actually, I couldn't talk about it before,

35
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,640
How did this happen?

36
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,040
It was at Hanshin Park,

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,400
Oh yeah I remember that place

38
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,570
It's gone now but,

39
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,610
They had cages with a male and female gorilla,

40
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,980
And they kept them apart for the most part

41
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,940
And then,

42
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,590
And it was during middle school, I went to Hanshin Park by myself,

43
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,370
And I went over to the gorillas,

44
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,990
And it just happend to be their spawning season

45
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,060
Spawning season?
They don't lay eggs

46
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,500
Spawning season?

47
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,820
Cause Gorillas don't lay eggs, they don't have that...

48
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,700
I guess an analogy,

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,480
if they were fish I guess

50
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,160
Well yeah, to use a fish analogy,

51
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,450
Did the female gorilla look pregnant?

52
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,370
Her belly was massive

53
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,600
And I thought "Wow that's huge",

54
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,600
It was in the newspaper too

55
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,560
In the newspaper?...

56
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,340
But they kept the male and female seperate?

57
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,340
Yeah

58
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,740
That's why they separated them

59
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,790
Cause the male gorilla would freak out

60
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,710
Cause after all, once a gorilla sees a big belly,

61
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,930
It sets off their fighting instincts

62
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,960
So like, once the male gorilla saw that big belly of the female,

63
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,780
Cause he saw that belly

64
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,450
He ... started hitting

65
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,640
But they were seperated?

66
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,280
He's lost the plot

67
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,680
You said the female gorilla wasn't there

68
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,320
They seperated them

69
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,400
They did they did, but,

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,600
The other cage was just ahead, like this distance,

71
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,120
So the female gorilla started fighting-

72
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,980
Which one?

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,510
The m-m-male

74
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,740
The male?

75
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,950
The male

76
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,880
So the male saw the big belly of the female,

77
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,270
And it set off his fighting instincts

78
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,490
There's a lot of instincs here

79
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,560
But why?

80
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,020
So she has a baby bump?

81
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,350
You'd think a gorilla would understand that though

82
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,860
Well maybe it might be, the male gorilla,

83
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,780
He might feel like he has to protect the female gorilla

84
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,610
Ahh that makes sense

85
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,520
Maybe that's the main reason

86
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,560
I think that's the main reason

87
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,110
Ah, yeah maybe

88
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,360
You approached it?

89
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
I approached it

90
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,250
You went inside the cage?

91
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,260
I went inside the cage

92
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,870
Eh?

93
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,860
But you can't enter, surely?

94
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,040
That's not true right?

95
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,880
I-
The cage thing is a lie right?

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,820
I-

97
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,500
Even on a shoot

98
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,340
Yeah, that's not possible

99
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,720
Sorry, my memories of that are really hazy

100
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,070
This sounds like a lie!

101
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,860
This is gotta be a lie!

102
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,960
No no, it's not a lie

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,850
Why did you go inside?

104
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,630
Is it because he smacked you?

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,410
Yes

106
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,340
You saved him there

107
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,120
I got smacked, so I forgot everything

108
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,900
Well-Alright fine you went inside

109
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,900
Well-

110
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,290
You got smacked? How?

111
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,840
How did you get smacked?

112
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,440
Well that's, like I said,

113
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,020
Gorillas go like this when they're angry

114
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,170
Like bears?

115
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,500
Like bears!

116
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,620
Gorilla really do that?

117
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,710
And then

118
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,240
"You bastard!"

119
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,810
It was as if he said that

120
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,670
I still don't understand why he was angry

121
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,980
But alright it doesn't matter

122
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,610
And then like,

123
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,150
He grabbed me from here

124
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,160
Woah that's dangerous

125
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,700
And then, with all of his force he smacked me down like,

126
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,550
Was the floor concrete?

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,580
That's gotta hurt like hell!

128
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,570
It hurt like hell!

129
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,940
I said "I'm sorry!", but it didn't matter

130
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,100
Chono Masahiro

131
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,890
This is a memory about Chono-san

132
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,060
Is it really a gorilla?

133
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,140
It's not a story about Chono-san?

134
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,720
It wasn't Chono-san

135
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,420
It was a gorilla right?

136
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,340
"Im sorry!" - And then he hit me

137
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,850
And the gorilla, with both his hands,

138
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,040
Like that ?!
Yeah

139
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,680
He goes like this, then this?

140
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,860
That's not a gorilla!

141
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,260
I can't tell what the gorilla is doing at all!

142
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,780
Like this?!

143
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,690
He punched you in the neck?

144
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,900
Like I said,

145
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,900
I still don't know why he's in the cage though

146
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,680
Surely he would die

147
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,540
I entered the cage, and then he ran towards me

148
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,660
He ran?

149
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,540
He ran

150
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,720
Gorillas are huge right?

151
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,820
They are!

152
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,760
And then he grabbed me like this, and my neck went down like that

153
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,540
And then the gorilla crouched down and POW!

154
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,960
A gorilla doesn't do that

155
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,960
He crouched down?

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,160
With his fists out like this?

157
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,500
He crouched down and jumped?

158
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,920
That must've hurt!

159
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,880
That would kill you!

160
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,040
If a gorilla hits you like that

161
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,340
I don't remember anything after that

162
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,120
And this incident didn't show up in the newspaper?

163
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,680
It did not show up in the newspaper

164
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,920
You'd think they would put that in there

165
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,580
Surely that's more newsworthy

166
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,800
Why?

167
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,640
You're right

168
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,820
You were hospitalised?

169
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,270
I was hospitalised?

170
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,740
Oh you were?

171
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,540
I was

172
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,620
Were you alright?

173
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,200
I got 2 stitches

174
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,160
Just 2 stiches?

175
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,340
Just 2 stiches?

176
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,440
Where?

177
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,720
Right around ... this area

178
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
You have a would there?

179
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,020
Your neck was cut?

180
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,080
It got cut, with his nails

181
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,160
Your neck didn't break?

182
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,250
Lie TIME Over

183
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,260
Well I wanted to confirm

184
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,300
Yeah

185
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,930
Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

Here I go,

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,800
Oui!

190
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Oh!

191
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,870
Tanaka picks someone to tell a massive lie

192
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,980
This- Well segueing from this,

193
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,720
You guys might think "You gotta be lying!",

194
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,400
Hamada-san,

195
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,750
Is it true you were raised by gorillas?

196
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,960
Cause of the story we just heard,

197
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,360
I didn't mean to be, but I was reminded of that just now

198
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,580
That sounds true!

199
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,620
Yes of course,

200
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,520
It sounds like it's true

201
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,640
Until what age?

202
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,310
Umm, yeah you know,

203
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,480
It was before I came to Amagasaki

204
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,180
Sooo before I entered kindergarten

205
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,280
When I lived near Daikokucho (Osaka)

206
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,260
I didn't know that

207
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,380
Why?

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,040
I didn't know about Daikokucho

209
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,460
Oh really? Well yeah I came to Amagasaki before starting kindergarten,

210
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,300
And we got to know each other after I got to Amagasaki

211
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,620
Oh yeah, you wouldn't know then

212
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,620
Yes indeed

213
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,070
Surely you don't really remember?

214
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,900
Nah c'mon it was obvious! He was so massive and hairy after all

215
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,080
Obviously that wasn't my dad

216
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,600
Yeah you would remember that I guess

217
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,440
I guess it had a big impact on your memories

218
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,500
Do you have any memories of being taken somewhere?

219
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,260
Well yeah, I was taken to the zoo a lot

220
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,550
The zoo?

221
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,120
The zoo itself?

222
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,610
You went to the zoo?

223
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,900
Well cause I was raised there!

224
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,300
The gorilla took you to the zoo?!

225
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,700
He wanted to show it to me

226
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,840
He wanted to treat you like a human child

227
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,010
Yes, yes exactly

228
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,100
Ah, I can tell he was kind

229
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,940
Oh is that so?

230
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,400
And my dad was busy, and my mom had-

231
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,240
Who are you talking about?

232
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,320
Your real dad?

233
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,620
My real dad was really busy, right?

234
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,760
Eh~?

235
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,130
How busy could he be that he left you with a gorilla?

236
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,620
Oh is that what you meant?

237
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,700
I thought he was found by animals

238
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,080
No no I wasn't found!

239
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,760
I apologise

240
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,980
A gorilla won't take a child home

241
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,010
So like a domestic worker?

242
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,160
It was coincidental, we were looking for help around the house,

243
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,420
Is it a generational thing?

244
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,580
So you got a gorilla?!

245
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,060
I wanna know more!

246
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,640
A go-, A gorilla,

247
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,950
Maybe someone told them
"I know a gorilla that's good around humans"

248
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,460
They should be more careful than that!

249
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,060
What kind of fun did you get up to? With the gorilla?

250
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,880
Well, you know Matsumoto does joke about this, but for example,

251
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,460
Swinging in a tire,

252
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,820
Really?

253
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,440
Gorillas love doing that

254
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,200
Cause that's the gorilla's idea of fun

255
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,760
Yeah, yeah

256
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,280
So how did this end?

257
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,250
In the end,  he went back to Tennoji Zoo

258
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,820
A Gorilla!

259
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,060
That gorilla was from the zoo?

260
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,820
Cause he won't visit there-

261
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,640
Well I'm not sure about "Visit'

262
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,900
So that was when you were 3, 4 years old,

263
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,220
Did you visit him in Middle or Elementary School?

264
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,800
Ah, I see! Did you?

265
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,960
Cause he's at the zoo after all

266
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,940
It's sad, but I did visit him once,

267
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,160
I went to his cage, he totally ignored me

268
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,680
He was a gorilla after all

269
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,470
Lie TIME Over

270
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,820
That sucks

271
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,760
You would expect an emotional reunion

272
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,120
That pisses me off!

273
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,540
He should've remembered!

274
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,360
There was no emotional reunion

275
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,280
That sucks

276
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,460
Yeah

277
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,540
I guess animals are just like that

278
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,850
Yeah I guess
He forgot about me

279
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,960
Endo will pick someone to tell a plausible lie

280
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,940
Endo's plausible lie

281
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,600
Yes

282
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,580
Tanaka, I didn't know about this,

283
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,480
You know that  "Best Jeanist" show?

284
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:57,860
TN: "Best Jeanist" is an award Japanese jeans industry made up for celebs that look good in jeans

285
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,240
You decide that right?

286
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,680
Eh?!

287
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,360
You decides who wins right?

288
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,300
That's amazing isn't it?

289
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,200
Yeah I thought that too

290
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,860
In that case pick me!

291
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,040
And the "Best Father" award, and all those other ones?

292
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,640
He picks every "Best" winner

293
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,020
Eh~?!

294
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,540
Whaat? No way

295
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,760
First off- well that is true, but,

296
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,490
Who did you hear this from?

297
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,980
Who?...

298
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,220
Shit, now I'm really pissed off

299
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,620
I don't know who,

300
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,640
Who did you hear this from?

301
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,000
I saw something like that on the internet

302
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,700
Someone wrote that?

303
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,860
Yeah

304
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,920
I wanted that to remain a secret no matter what

305
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,780
Cause if people find out, it ruins it right?

306
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,410
Mmm, well,

307
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,540
Ruins it? Well,

308
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,100
If we know, we might ask to be picked

309
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,200
Yes yes exactly. It's, well it's not anyones fault, but,

310
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,660
I don't want to be asked things like that

311
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,000
It will become fixed

312
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,780
Exactly exactly

313
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,370
I pick people purely because they look good in jeans

314
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,900
When did this start?

315
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,420
Since the beginning

316
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,640
How many years?

317
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,940
When did it start?

318
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,720
The Jeanist show started probably ...

319
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,740
12 years? 13 years? I think

320
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,240
I think 13 years ago

321
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,140
So you've been deciding for the past 10 or so years?

322
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,440
Yes

323
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,580
Eh? Really!?

324
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,340
But why you?

325
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:10,180
Probably, cause, my family,

326
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,400
My family lineage I guess, is involved in jeans

327
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,140
Your lineage is jeans?

328
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,980
I know for a fact your family lineage is not jeans

329
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,980
Well I mean like,

330
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,860
Jeans have always been really important to us,

331
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,600
In Osaka, my family there,

332
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,860
My parents are in the Clothing Industry

333
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,920
They're not!

334
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,080
That's a lie isn't it?

335
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,920
No no-

336
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,320
The clothing industry?

337
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,200
Yes, my dad, both my parents actually. That's why they got married.

338
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,210
Really?

339
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,040
Could you elaborate?

340
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,260
Well, yeah, it's about Jeans

341
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,760
The people who brought jeans to Japan - My family brought jeans here

342
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,180
Wow

343
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah,

344
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,860
I didn't know that

345
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,500
The 4th or 5th generation of my family, brought jeans to Japan from America.

346
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,460
That's amazing

347
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,640
I didn't know that

348
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,660
So every year when I would joke "Why wasn't I picked"
You knew the whole time?

349
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,300
Yeah yeah, I thought "Hahaha he's said it!"

350
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,200
That's kind of rude

351
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,560
Why didn't you pick him?

352
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,920
Yeah? Why not me?

353
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,170
That's cause,

354
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,180
So you don't pick comedians? Is that it?

355
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,440
Yeah is that why? You can't pick comedians?

356
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,640
It's not that I can't do that,

357
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,540
If a comedian looks good in jeans  then it's alright

358
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,160
But he looks great in jeans!

359
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,640
Why is Hamada no good?

360
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,340
Hamada-san, well according to my sense doesn't look good in jeans at all

361
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,360
I didn't want to hear that

362
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,800
It's not Hamada-san's fault of course, it's just the jeans

363
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,380
It's not the just the jeans right? He decides winners of other things too?

364
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,260
Yeah, the "Best Father", "Best Glasses"

365
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,040
Theres the glasses too

366
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,960
What about that one?

367
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,920
How do you decide?

368
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,080
That one as well, of course,

369
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,980
If the glasses look good on them-

370
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,190
Sorry, excuse me, but sometimes the winner of the Best Glasses,

371
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,720
Is someone who you normally wouldn't associate with wearing glasses

372
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,040
Yeah exactly

373
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,350
Yeah

374
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,780
No no,

375
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,470
There are a lot of people who say that

376
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,560
"I don't normally wear glasses, but please pick me"

377
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,460
Like who?

378
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,780
Umm,

379
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,840
Like Takagi Miho-san

380
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:34,350
Takagi Miho

381
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,260
But she does wear glasses

382
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,320
Takagi Miho wears them!

383
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,120
She does!

384
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,340
But that's where it started,

385
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,310
When she's reacting to a VTR  she usually wears them

386
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,120
That's true

387
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,520
Then, my last question,

388
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,220
Who will win this year?

389
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,480
Oh yeah

390
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,900
For the glasses,

391
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,400
Tell just us

392
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,420
Yeah

393
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,500
Who do you think should win?

394
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,140
Yes yes yes yes

395
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,240
I was thinking Pierre Taki

396
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:56,470
Pierre Taki

397
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,100
You wouldn't think he wears glasses

398
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,440
Glasses?

399
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,780
He doesn't wear them right?

400
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,900
And what about the jeans?

401
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,900
That guy, umm,

402
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,600
Umm,

403
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,920
The former baseball guy, umm,

404
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,520
Kuriyama Hideki

405
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:12,520
Kuriyama Hideki

406
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,080
The director?

407
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,600
Yeah, he looks great in jeans

408
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,980
He never wears jeans!

409
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,770
His everyday attire is fantastic

410
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,840
Normally he never wears them

411
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,340
He looks great normally

412
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,240
Kuriyama Hideki?!

413
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,360
I have no idea how

414
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,960
There's no way it's Kuriyama Hideki

415
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,300
It is

416
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,840
It is him though

417
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,790
Could you tell us the "Best Father" please?

418
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,020
Oh yeah

419
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,050
Yeah who's winning this year?

420
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,100
The Best Father is...

421
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,160
Well I wanted to leave this as a surprise,

422
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,040
Really?

423
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,280
Oh, really?

424
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,820
What do you base it on?

425
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,860
Well after all, whenever he's on Gaki

426
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,200
All he talks about is his daughter

427
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,290
That's not true!

428
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,860
Then you're lying aren't you?!

429
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,370
That's a lie!

430
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,060
Lie TIME Over

431
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,800
That felt kind of rude just now

432
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,680
I got wrapped up in that!

433
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,800
After this,

434
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,800
Hosei consults the members for advice

435
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,110
Endo Shozo

436
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,110
Hamada Masatoshi

437
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,110
Matsumoto Hitoshi

438
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,110
Tanaka Naoki

439
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,110
Tsukitei Hosei

440
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,000
Can I ask something?

441
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,980
Yes?

442
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,460
I want some advice for this problem

443
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,220
What happened?

444
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
It's a real story,

445
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,230
It's your bald spot right?

446
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,100
That's it is it?

447
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,260
Cause this whole time,

448
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,880
The clown of your head- Sorry crown

449
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,480
Crown!

450
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,800
Crown-

451
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,160
I can see it's bad

452
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,240
They say your hair gets scruffier as you age

453
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,920
Yeah sure

454
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,920
Yeah

455
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,340
Yeah-

456
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,480
He's saying "Yeah sure"

457
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,040
I have no idea what to say when I'm being picked on for that

458
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,380
I pretend they're talking about someone else

459
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,520
C'mon no way!

460
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,960
Cause you can't say anything otherwise?

461
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,330
You don't really do that!

462
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,000
No no I do

463
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,140
So you can't really join the conversation?

464
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,460
Yeah exactly

465
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,440
Ah, well that's unfortunate

466
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,300
It puts me in a tough spot,

467
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,920
I understand, I apologise

468
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,760
My apologies

469
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,240
So don't ever bully me about that please

470
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,520
I apologise

471
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,320
He's so mad!

472
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,640
He's kind of ticked off

473
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,120
Yeah

474
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,030
So this problem I have,

475
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,760
Right

476
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,450
My son, he was born recently,

477
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:08,970
Hosei's eldest son, the 3rd child was born in September of 2012. He is 1 year and 6 months old

478
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,800
Your son was born yeah

479
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,710
Yeah, we have a new boy right?

480
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,560
His 3rd child is a son

481
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,710
So now he's 1.5 years old, and he's totally different from my daughters!

482
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,500
He's really agressive! He really is

483
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,560
So I was taking a nap,

484
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,510
And he goes "Papa papa!", he's aware of me

485
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,220
He said it to me when I came over too

486
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,530
He said it to the chawanmushi too

487
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,680
That's not true

488
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,640
He knows I'm his dad

489
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
So I was sleeping in the evening,

490
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,200
And he jumped on me,

491
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,800
And I was so shocked by that pain I almost fainted!

492
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,220
Seriously!

493
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,000
Well it would be surprising

494
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,540
Right

495
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,340
My daughters were never like that

496
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,400
But that's just common with boys

497
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,980
Oh is it?

498
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,600
It's not really that big a deal

499
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,320
I see

500
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,740
No no no no

501
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,770
Can you stop using that tone?

502
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,030
Everyone watching this is probably thinking the same

503
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,990
Well that might be,

504
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,060
But girls don't do that right?

505
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,200
They don't

506
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,620
Yeah they don't

507
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,560
Hmm, I don't know about that

508
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,340
When I'm sleeping,

509
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,920
He tries to wake up, he wants to play with me

510
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,130
I see

511
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,540
He pulls my hair really hard!

512
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,540
Ah that's why? (you're bald)

513
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,360
No no that's not why

514
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,350
Ah that's why he's balding

515
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,180
There's a connection there!

516
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,440
No there isn't!

517
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,940
Ah so this was your joke!

518
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,620
Yeah!

519
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,520
He did say it

520
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,480
No no no

521
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,240
You didn't want us to ruin your punchline

522
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,350
I sincerely apologise

523
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,350
Oh that's why?

524
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,410
No!

525
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,610
We couldn't have known that

526
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,640
We apologise

527
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,900
So we can make fun of you now right?

528
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,740
No, don't do that!

529
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,300
We can't? I don't get it

530
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,920
No!

531
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,680
I thought "His bald spot was the punchline!"

532
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,240
No, that's not it

533
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,720
Nope

534
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,900
Where does he grab? For real

535
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,340
Where does he grab?

536
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,320
Here, the top most part of my head

537
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,740
So Hosei-san, we can make fun of you?

538
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,240
Cause clearly you're trying to make that joke

539
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,560
I'm not

540
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,840
So there's not really a problem then

541
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,720
No there is,

542
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,320
There is, and well he is a child after all,

543
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,600
I want to know how to handle boys,

544
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,080
Cause if I get angry, my wife gets angry at me

545
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,480
She gets mad

546
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,560
Then that's gotta be because,

547
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,200
Generally, the mom just can't help but dote on the son right?

548
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,980
And for the dad it's the daughter

549
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,760
Yeah that might be why

550
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,180
That's gotta be why

551
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,840
Cause I've known your family for a while

552
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,940
And when you had just your 2 daughters before, you would dote on them more

553
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,260
I guess it's different that way

554
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,580
Ahh

555
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,040
Maybe cause he's like you, I don't know

556
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
It's different

557
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,880
Certainly, it is different

558
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,780
Yeah

559
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,500
So when he yanks my hair, my wife,

560
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,060
She laughs and goes "That's a funny reaction!"

561
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,800
What do you guys think?

562
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,580
What do we think?

563
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,820
Yeah

564
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,600
What do you say? "Stop that!" or something?

565
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,180
I go "Ow ow ow!"

566
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,060
And when she sees that,

567
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,040
She goes "That reaction is hilarious!"

568
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,090
My wife laughs - What do you guys make of this?

569
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,870
Who is this story about?

570
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,950
It's a little hard to follow

571
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,920
Who is the main character?

572
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,860
Who is the main?

573
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,740
That I don't understand

574
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,020
I also don't get that, sorry

575
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,080
Who are you complaining about here?

576
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,840
Is it your son? Your wife?

577
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,980
What is this?

578
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,700
My son

579
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,620
I also think my wife isn't reacting correctly

580
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,710
But what is your problem? You want to know what to do?

581
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,000
What is your problem?

582
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,700
Well since you two have raised sons,

583
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,980
How should I react to get him to stop doing that? Like jumping on my belly,

584
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,380
Or pulling my hair, how should I handle that?

585
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,120
Did your son jump on your belly?

586
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,740
Well that did happen often I guess,

587
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,820
From "Sesame Street",

588
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,900
Do you know "Cookie Monster? That blue character from Sesame Street

589
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:09,250
A character from Sesame Street that loves cookies

590
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:09,250
Cookie Monster

591
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,920
I think so

592
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,740
It's a character that loves eating cookies

593
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,240
I think it was when he was 3 or 4 years old

594
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,460
I imitated him eating a cookie, and he found it hilarious

595
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,460
And cause he wanted to see that, when I was sleeping,

596
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,940
He would force a cookie into my mouth

597
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,740
And you're alseep?

598
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,820
I'm asleep, and he's jamming the cookie

599
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,900
The cookie

600
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,120
And the first time,

601
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
The first time I,

602
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,860
I woke up and pretended to do it,

603
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,300
But after that every morning he would shove a cookie in my mouth,

604
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,220
He would shove it in?

605
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,820
Sounds exhausting

606
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,820
It was exhausting

607
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,100
So I wanted to put a stop to it,

608
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,390
I would not wake up when he put the cookie in

609
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,860
So since I stopped waking up, he stopped doing that

610
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,020
He wants to know whether or not he should get angry

611
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,880
How should he display he's mad

612
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,000
Ah, I didn't get angry

613
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,700
That behaviour sort of faded out

614
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,480
As he got older?

615
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,100
Now he's totally calmed down yeah

616
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,760
He's 5 years old after all

617
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,220
Maybe you should make him think dad is scary

618
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,540
I see

619
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,380
Make him think "I shouldn't get scolded by dad"

620
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,500
Maybe just make him think that

621
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,040
I see

622
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,360
Cause they get scolded by mom everyday, they get used to it

623
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,060
Yes

624
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,820
We went to dinner togther the other day,

625
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,740
Ah yes, with our families

626
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,180
With our families

627
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,020
He looks just like Yamasaki!

628
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,880
Oh?

629
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,600
I did hold him once,

630
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,340
They're just different from girls

631
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,020
They are

632
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,980
Oh really?

633
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,860
They kind of smell like old people

634
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,860
No no no

635
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,400
Like old people?

636
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,620
That's too soon!

637
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,120
They don't have that sweet smell that girls have

638
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,460
Too soon to smell old

639
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,980
Boys that is

640
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,840
They aren't as soft?

641
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,620
They aren't

642
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:58,130
You never know, maybe Hamada might have a new daughter some day

643
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,420
No way!

644
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,840
Of course not!

645
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,540
I'm 50!

646
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,770
After this

647
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,770
That person is now a grandfather?!

648
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,520
That would be a thing to see

649
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,960
Is it alright to mention this?

650
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:15,940
Kimura Yuichi

651
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,420
Kimu-chan is a grandfather now

652
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,240
Ah I heard that

653
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,940
His previous wife's son right?

654
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,480
Yeah, cause Kimu's been married right?

655
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,450
Um, his 6th ex-wife

656
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,540
Too many!

657
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,000
It was his 4th wife

658
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,040
His ex-wife's children,

659
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,280
He got grandchildren early

660
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,600
He's KimuPa now

661
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,320
KimuPa?

662
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,700
KimuPa?

663
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,700
KimuPa!?

664
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,310
He's gonna be pissed at him now. Right?

665
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,270
I did laugh at that but,

666
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,260
C'mon, you guys, you laughed

667
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,620
I don't know about that

668
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,380
You guys laughed really hard

669
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,340
All he ever talks about is his daughter

670
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,600
I don't!
