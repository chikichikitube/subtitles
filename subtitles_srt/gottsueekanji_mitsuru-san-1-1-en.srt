00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,770
Mitsuru-san

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,420
Translation: ZuRUi

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,470
It's no good

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,470
- Yea

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,470
We're messing up on the "shibakuzo" part

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,870
Let's try again

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,540
Tatsuya!

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,400
Practice with us!

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,440
Come on!

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,950
I don't want to learn that stupid dance

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,770
You dummy!
We're members of Hamigakitai right?

12
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,790
Just shut up!

13
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,790
I didn't want to join you guys from the beginning!

14
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,190
What are you saying?  Give me a break!

15
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,550
Yea, what are you saying?

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,550
What's with you?!
-What are you doing?

17
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,320
Stop!  Let's practice!

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,650
Shut up, idiot!

19
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,870
Not the face!

20
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,120
Stop it!
-Don't hit the face!

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,740
Stop it already!

22
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,840
Hey! Hey!

23
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,470
Mitsuru-san!

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,620
What are you guys doing?

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,020
Tatsuya doesn't want to practice

26
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,750
You need to take your practice seriously!

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,020
I don't want to do it!

28
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,270
You idiot!

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,170
You will be debuting next month...

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,140
You shouldn't be acting like this!

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,870
What are you talking about, idiot!

32
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,700
You need to practice seriously!

33
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,250
Idiot, I said I can do it!

34
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,350
I can't do it, I'm leaving

35
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,820
Hold it right there!

36
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,890
What do you want?

37
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,890
What are you doing?

38
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,450
Let's dance!

39
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,420
I'm leaving!

40
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,720
Tatsuya!
-Where are you going!
