9th Time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende
"Are their hearts connected?" No Smartphones Meet Up!

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,120
Excuse me. I think 4 of us will come to the same conclusion,

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,280
4? 4 you say?

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,920
There's just that 1 guy who won't

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,080
I see

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,800
Do you mean me by any chance?

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,840
Exactly

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
C'mon that's not true-

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,440
You went to a Yudetaro instead of Fuji Soba!

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,960
That was egregious

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,920
That is an incident!

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,280
It really is, he went to a Yudetaro after all

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,960
Which means if it was Yudetaro then he'd go to a Fuji Soba

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,440
A guy like that can't do this

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,600
I'll be fine, today I'll be fine

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,800
The 9th installment of a series testing the bonds between the 5

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,560
The rule; They head to a location based on the theme. If everyone ends up together the game is over.

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,880
Tanaka use the second idea that comes to mind. Your first idea always takes you far away

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,600
That's true

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,000
I see

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,880
You always end up heading towards Shinobazu Pond

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,040
He does, he does

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,120
What's with that?

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,990
Timed & Typeset by Kedomas
Translation by senor_wristband

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,000
What will the first theme be? No Smartphone Meetup!!

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,120
Let's get to it, time for the first theme

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,480
The first theme...is this!

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,640
"A car showroom"

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,280
"A car showroom"?

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,040
I got one already

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,360
There's 2 of them I think

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,880
This is a good question

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,640
So like always they've got taxis ready, let's go!

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,360
They depart from NTV at 2PM

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,840
I guess not that one

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,880
Wouldn't that one be goood?

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,360
Aoyama, was it in 1-choume?

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,000
That Honda dealership right?

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,360
They also have the Cornes there

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,560
That one...

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,680
Near Shiba Park?

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,560
Yes, yes. If this was about foreign cars it'd be that one

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,800
Will Matsumoto head towards Aoyama or Shiba Park?

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,960
In Aoyama-itchome, was it the Honda?

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,560
That one, I think is the best one

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,840
You want to head to Aoyama-Itchoume?

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,240
Let's head to Aoyama-Itchoume

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,710
We might end up fumbling this

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:46,320
We might have 5 people meeting right away for the first time. That's not good is it?

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,840
Will Matsumoto's prediction come true? Let's see where the others are going

51
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,600
Before in the opening when I opened the card,

52
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,440
2 of them came to mind

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,000
I'd want to head towards Honda's showroom. The one at the corner right?

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,400
That one, or in Roppongi, wasn't there like a Ferrari showroom?

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,680
Near Iikura

56
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,640
Yes yes yes, yes

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,480
Those 2 came to mind right away

58
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,560
Should I go with Honda? Or Ferrari?

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,920
As soon as I saw the theme 2 of them came to mind

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:38,400
Near the Iikura intersectionn, I'm certain there's a Ferrari, or some other showroom

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,800
At the Aoyama-itchome at the left of the intersection there's a huge place with a car parked. That's a showroom right?

62
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,680
Let's do this

63
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,280
Just like Hamada, Endo is choosing between Aoyama and Iikura

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,560
I want to consider what everyone else might think,

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,560
If I do that, let's go to [@!#!@#]

66
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,960
Just where is Endo going?

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,520
I thought of three, the first one, the showroom near Shinjuku West Gate

68
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,960
That building, also Aoyama, the showroom there

69
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,360
And Ginza

70
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,400
I think, and I did used to live near there,

71
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,000
Aoyama, probably

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,320
But I didn't live near Aoyama though, I was trying to look cool

73
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,160
And what about Tanaka, who sucks at this?

74
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,080
There's 1 I thought of, but it seems like a bad idea. It's a showroom you can see from the highway

75
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,720
The highway one is the one I thought of first

76
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,920
Well let's get going for now

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,920
What is this showroom Tanaka can see from the highway?

78
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,880
Getting on the highway leaving Shibuya,

79
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:10,420
Like heading towards Odaiba, around the right side of Shiba Park, there's a showroom you can see from the highway

80
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,760
Oh yeah, there is

81
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,400
That's the first one I thought of,

82
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:22,080
But in the opening Hamda-san told me "go to your second idea"

83
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,640
He did say that

84
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,880
Yes

85
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,440
Aoyama 246 Intersection, I just thought of one there

86
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,800
I see

87
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,520
Eh, what should I do?

88
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,920
We might have 5 people meeting right away for the first time. That's not good is it?

89
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,560
As Matsumoto said, it's possible everyone could meet up

90
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,480
Will a miraculous meet up with the first theme occur?

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,100
I feel like I won't be the only one there

92
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,920
Maybe Hamada...

93
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,960
I think he might not even pass by there

94
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,120
That guy never moved houses right?

95
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,880
He lives in Seijo (Setagaya)

96
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
Where in Seijo?

97
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,640
In Seijo?

98
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,120
Which district?

99
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,960
[!@#!@#]-district

100
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,800
What house number?

101
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,440
It's fine really, you can say it on TV it's alright

102
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,320
15 minutes since the start. He arrives at the Honda in Aoyama

103
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,320
Oh yes, there it is. This one.

104
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,080
They used to have a car out front

105
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,480
I guess not anymore

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,560
I bet 1 or 2 people will come for sure

107
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Believing everyone will meet from the first hint. He waits for the other 4.

108
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:13,080
Personally there's a lot of showrooms I see while driving

109
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,880
I think I see quite a few normally

110
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,200
We're almost there right?

111
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,160
He arrives at his showroom. Is he in Aoyama like Matsumoto, or in Iikura Katamachi

112
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,360
In Iikura Katamachi, a Ferrari dealership

113
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,280
What do you think? This is like THE Showroom

114
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,920
Endo chose the Rosso Scuderia in Iikura Katamachi

115
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,520
I am confident about this one,

116
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,480
They'll definitely be there

117
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,640
Let's go meet them

118
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,360
Between Aoyama, Iikura, and Ginzam where did Hosei end up?

119
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,080
Nissan

120
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,280
He chose Ginza's Nissan Crossing

121
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,920
In Ginza...

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,320
And then...

123
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,960
Hm?

124
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,800
Who's that?

125
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
Can we?

126
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,600
Let's head there

127
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,720
Hold on, look, you can see a camera...

128
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,200
There is a camera crew

129
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,240
There's a camera crew

130
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,720
But that's not Gaki's crew right?

131
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,200
It's a different production

132
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,800
Gaki no Tsukai doesn't have such smartly dressed camera man

133
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,560
And between Aoyama and Shiba Park, where did Tanaka end up?

134
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,200
I think it's in this area

135
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,600
It's that one right? Look! "Cornes"?

136
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Cornes

137
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,880
The main point is whether or not you can see it from the highway

138
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,480
Before going to the showroom, he confirms the highway is there

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,280
That there, you can see it from there right? Yeah look

140
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,360
There, there

141
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,640
And then confiriming the Cornes showroom is there

142
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,920
Yeah,

143
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,760
The location, it's that there

144
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,960
Right now it's under construction,

145
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,360
So this is what I always saw from the highway

146
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,960
Just as Tanaka remembered, there was a Cornes dealership, currently under construction

147
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,760
I wonder how many people know about this place from driving by

148
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,200
I messed up

149
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,320
And Hamada who also had to choose between Iikura and Aoyama is close to his destination

150
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,440
Hamada-san, last time you were all by yourself till the end

151
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,720
Yeah

152
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,000
I hope at least one person comes

153
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,800
Who do you hope comes?

154
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:19,400
Anyone, anyone really, well ...
... If Matsumoto-san comes all of a sudden, then...

155
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,360
Would you dislike that?

156
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,000
20 minutes since he left

157
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,960
Hamada arrives at his showroom

158
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,960
Will it be Aoyama where Matsumoto is? Or Iikura where Endo is?

159
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,160
The first hint "A car showroom" - Hamada had to choose between Aoyama or Iikura Katamachi

160
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,720
Will it be Aoyama where Matsumoto is? Or Iikura Katamachi where Endo is?

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,200
They're definitely here, they'll come here

162
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,040
Huh, they're not here!

163
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,680
Not one person!

164
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,360
But then

165
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,240
Nobody!

166
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,280
Oi!

167
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,600
This one right?

168
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,680
Of course, however,

169
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,080
Yes, of course, but, I know what you mean

170
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,920
This is kind of annoying

171
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,680
But it's this one!

172
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,320
But, still...

173
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,200
I don't like DownTown being together by themselves

174
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,840
And whenever we meet up, for some reason we always stand in our manzai position

175
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,920
It's never the other way around

176
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,080
Only 2 people met here, which means,

177
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,000
Time's up

178
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,440
For real?!

179
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
They really didn't come?

180
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,760
The 5 go on a group call to confirm their locations

181
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,960
Hello. Why aren't you here?

182
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,720
Matsumoto-san, where are you?

183
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,520
No no Yama-chan where are you?

184
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,280
I'm in Ginza's Nissan Showroom!

185
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,880
Ginza he says

186
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,400
Ginza's Nissan Showroom he said

187
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,800
Nobody would think of that

188
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,920
Eh? And Shozo?

189
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:29,200
Yes, I'm at the corner of Iikura Katamachi, in front of the Ferrari showroom

190
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,440
Oh yeah, yeah that one, yeah

191
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,400
Tanaka?

192
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,760
Yes, um, I'm at Shiba Park,

193
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,360
It's a showroom you can see from the highway

194
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,920
Oh that one, the Cornes

195
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,680
Yes! The Cornes

196
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,080
I get it, but how the hell were all 5 of us supposed to know that

197
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,540
I thought everyone ... I had a strong impression from the highway

198
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,400
No no no no, hold on

199
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,320
It's GOTTA be the Aoyama-itchoume Honda!

200
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,720
UWAAAHH THAT ONE!

201
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,000
That was my other choice!

202
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,140
Matsumoto-san that was my second choice

203
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,600
That's where you went huh Matsumoto-san

204
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,640
Listen to where Hamada is

205
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,400
Hamda-san, Hamada-san

206
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,120
I'm standing next to Matsutomo-san

207
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,240
DownTown met up!

208
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,160
It's a "A Legendary Day" isn't it!

209
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:26,840
TN: "A Legendary Day"  is referring to DownTown's recent Manzai performance, their first in 31 years

210
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,080
No this is annoying

211
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,840
In so many ways I want you to COME HERE

212
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,040
For real, next time, for sure

213
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,480
I wanna say, stop messing up on purpose because it's funny to leave DownTown by themselves

214
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,240
It's really obvious

215
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
It's obvious, I get it

216
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,080
Enough

217
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,160
Let's meet up

218
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,240
Let's do this

219
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,320
This is a big deal, DownTown-san have already met up

220
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,400
This really is "A Legendary Day"

221
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,960
Well, in the end, I did say between Aoyama and Ginza right?

222
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,600
Well...There's no helping it

223
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,000
I did think of it. I think I can do the next one

224
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,920
Today you wanna meet up

225
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,720
I do, I do

226
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,680
With the first theme, DownTown met up

227
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,560
They want to clear this faster than ever before - Time for the next hint

228
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,760
Damn, so hard!

229
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,920
"A Large Post Office"

230
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,920
We gotta a really tough one here

231
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,160
We just passed by it

232
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,720
That one right?

233
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,640
I don't know what it's called though

234
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,320
Akasaka Post Office?

235
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,200
Oh ok

236
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,040
It's really famous!

237
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,160
It is, and it's huge

238
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,800
Yeah!

239
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,920
It's gonna end now!

240
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,280
It depends on if they come or not!

241
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,120
We can walk there

242
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,800
Yeah let's walk there. Let's go

243
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,920
Oh yeah, let's walk there

244
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,440
Akasaka Post Office, so close by they walk there

245
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05,640
If they think about it, they'll go "Oh yeah, there's post office near where DownTown are"

246
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,560
They're not the type of guys to think like that

247
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,880
No way

248
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,120
For real

249
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,920
They gotta take that into consideration!

250
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,600
I'm telling you, their brains don't work that good

251
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,080
Where were the other guys?

252
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,160
Endo was nearby

253
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Endo's in Roppongi right?

254
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,880
Where was Yama-chan?

255
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,960
Ginza's Nissan

256
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,360
Oh yeah

257
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,600
Ginza's Nissan...Well it's not that far away

258
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,920
Walking with Hamada like this...

259
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,120
It feels like the very first episode of Gaki no Tsukai

260
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,640
In Shibuya?

261
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,880
I can't remember if it was Shibuya

262
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,880
You guys were climbing a slope

263
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,280
It was like that yeah

264
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,960
I remember climbing the slope, I can't remember if it was Shibuya

265
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,760
It was the hill near the bottom of Shibuya

266
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,160
Oh really?

267
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,000
Really?

268
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,400
1 minute since they started walking, they arrive at Akasaka Post Office

269
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,600
At least one person will come, 1 person for sure

270
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,480
Meanwhile, Hosei, Endo, & Tanaka were deciding their destinations

271
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,480
Can you think of one?

272
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,720
I can

273
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,440
The first one that came to mind is Meguro Post Office

274
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,200
On Meguro-Dori?

275
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,440
On Meguro-Dori

276
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,880
And the other one I thought of is Setagaya Post Office, with the neon

277
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,600
It has the neon sign, yes

278
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:30,880
I feel like there was also one near where DownTown are. I can't remember if that was a large one

279
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,160
There are plenty of locations, there's one in Akasaka too-

280
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,880
Nevermind that was a bank. That's a bank

281
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,280
Wait wait! Hold on! I'm counting on my memories right now,

282
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,240
In the past, in Tameike Sanno where Yoshimoto's Tokyo office was,

283
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,880
I think there was a post office behind there. And it was pretty huge.

284
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,160
But, that might be a bank

285
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:09,840
It might not be that large, if you compare to Shinjuku, Shibuya...
It's not that big

286
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,040
Was there a big one in Shibuya?

287
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,680
Nope, I can only think of [!@@#!#]

288
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,480
[@!!@$] Post Office

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,680
Will they meet up with DownTown?

290
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,400
20 minutes since they arrived at Akasaka Post Office

291
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,760
DownTown are pissed off that they still haven't met anybody

292
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,000
You know, it's messed up if Endo doesn't come here

293
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,080
Ah, considering the distance

294
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Considering the distance, the fact that he's not here only makes me worry

295
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,520
So DownTown are probably driving sitting with each other right now huh?

296
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,280
Mr. Driver, did you come up with any ideas for a large post office?

297
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,920
I thought Akasaka Post Office

298
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,600
Akasaka? There's one in Aoyama? - Wait, THERE IS!

299
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,600
It's right across the Aoyama-Itchoume intersection right? UWAH wait a second

300
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Endo forgot about Akasaka Post Office

301
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,960
So, then where is Nedo heading?

302
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,540
Where did Yamasaki go again?

303
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,980
Ginza

304
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,760
Ahh, he's far away

305
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,120
Is there a big one in Ginza? Oh right, Ginza Post Office

306
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,800
Ginza Post Office

307
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,520
It's big?

308
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,440
It is

309
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,200
Oh it's big?

310
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,960
Really?

311
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,680
Alright whatever, even if it is big, we were in Akasaka

312
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,840
We're the senpai...The 2 Big Bosses

313
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,640
The 2 Big Bosses are already in Aoyama-Itchoume!

314
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,440
"What are the 2 Big Bosses gonna do?" - That's how they should think

315
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,400
Of course right?

316
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,000
There's one behind where we passed by right?

317
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,800
They might have gone somewhere totally different

318
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,320
Yamasaki, that guy used to live in Meugro,

319
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,320
But Meguro Post Office is not an option

320
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,200
And that Hosei just arrived at his destination. Just where is he?

321
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,960
Oh! It's huge! That's a big one

322
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,000
Just as Matsumoto predicted, he went to Meguro Post Office

323
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,000
It's huge right?

324
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,400
Yeah, I've never actually been in there

325
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,320
But I have a strong memory of it being huge from all the times I walked past it. Everyone should think that too.

326
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,720
Where the hell did everyone go?

327
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,720
Meanwhile, it's been 50 minutes since DownTown arrived at Akasaka Post Office

328
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,360
This is a loss

329
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,000
The fact that we've waited this long

330
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,320
They need to take into consideration DownTown-san are in Aoyama-Itchoume

331
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,000
Exactly, exactly

332
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,360
Ahh enough

333
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,240
This is is impossible, impossible

334
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,200
TN: Not sure about this line

335
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,200
They're going to get a massive punishment for this

336
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,800
For real, they just didn't listen to us

337
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,600
They didn't listen to us, they don't listen to people

338
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,080
The only thing to do is rip off their ears

339
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,480
Meanwhile, that man appears in front of Hosei at Meguro Post Office

340
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,960
Of course! Hosei-san!

341
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,720
Hosei-san!

342
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,700
SEE! WE DID IT! Hell yeah!

343
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,080
Alright!

344
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,480
Congratulations!\n
Of course right?

345
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,480
Of course right?

346
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,680
For real, it's this one

347
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,080
Thank god!

348
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:52,600
Also Hosei-san used to live near here. I came here cause I was thinking of him

349
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,000
Thank you. I'm really happy!

350
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,000
Tanaka also arrives at his Post Office

351
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,720
Will he be able to meet anyone?

352
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,480
Nope!

353
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,960
Tanaka chose Setagaya Post Office

354
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,890
Nobody's here huh?

355
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,720
Eh? Isn't it this one?

356
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
And then...

357
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,480
Tanaka-san, time's up

358
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,120
Seriously...Not here?

359
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,680
The 5 confirm their locations

360
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,080
What are you doing?

361
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,800
Where did you guys go?

362
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,000
Hold on, we were just at Aoyama right?

363
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,360
So the closest one to us was Shozo. Where the hell are you?

364
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:51,160
Yes, umm, right now I'm at Meguro Post Office

365
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,240
There it is! Meguro Post Office!

366
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,400
Endo-san is at Meguro Post Office?

367
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,500
No no, GRRR, GRR, I'm pissed off

368
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,440
There it is

369
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,080
Oi! Rakugoka!

370
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,960
Where the hell are you?

371
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,520
I'm at Meguro Post Office!

372
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,320
Of course, Hosei-san went to Meguro, of course

373
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,640
And Tanaka?

374
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,480
Yes, I'm at Setagaya Post Office in Sancha

375
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,360
Goddamn. He went to Sancha

376
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,120
In the end Tanaka is by himself again

377
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,360
It'll be fine, of course I'll meet you guys with the next theme

378
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,880
Because of Tanaka we had to wait for an hour here

379
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,000
No listen, this might sound like an excuse,

380
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,280
In the opening, I partook in Hamada-san's advice to "Go to the second one you think of"

381
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,560
Yes yes, so the second one I partook in was Setagaya Post Office

382
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,160
What was your first one?

383
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,860
Meguro

384
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,440
Oi!

385
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,920
Just go with your first idea!

386
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,840
What the hell do you mean "The 2nd one I partook in"

387
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,920
That's the advice he gave me

388
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,440
What the hell is "The 2nd one I partook in"

389
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,740
Don't, don't make such dumb excuses

390
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,520
Listen. You lot.

391
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,080
If you think about where we started, we obviously walked to the post office

392
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,880
We walked to Akasaka Post Office on foot and have been waiting ever since!

393
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,240
WE'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG
AND WAITING TOGETHER!

394
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,000
WHAT GENERATION ARE YOU GUYS?!!

395
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,710
TN: Referring to NSC comedy school, DownTown are from the 1st genration

396
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,960
I'm scared, I'm so scared

397
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,000
This ferocious anger in front of Akasak Post Office!

398
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,760
Next Week!

399
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,680
No Smartphones Meetup Finale!

400
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,680
The Theme - "A long tunnel"

401
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,680
I really gotta meet up, that's for certain

402
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,120
Eh? I can't think anywhere right now

403
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,680
I think near [@!#!@]

404
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,360
Ahh, yeah

405
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,040
I think this is a lucky question

406
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,760
Will they be able to meet? Look forward to the answer!

407
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:13,160
