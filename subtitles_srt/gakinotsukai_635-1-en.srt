1
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,540
He's the first foreign
talent to do this.

2
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,020
It was quite a challenge for me.
- It must be.

3
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,620
He's very enthusiastic
about this.

4
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:56,820
I told him "Hamada's very tough so you can hustle him as much as you want".

5
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,580
Look, don't provoke him.
You saw us having a conversatoin with both smiling now, he's a good guy.

6
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,300
Normally, we'll bring
the performer here.

7
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,580
But this time just save it to the show
- Of course.

8
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:16,740
7 transformation Rules

9
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:16,740
The performer enters a meeting room.
One who laugh pays 1,000 yen fine.

10
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,180
I'm going to be in backstage directing him today.

11
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,300
Planning Meeting

12
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,340
So which one should we do?

13
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,740
Endo Shozo

14
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,740
Tanaka Naoki

15
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,740
Yamazaki Housei

16
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,620
We like to see Endo's "manic potato digging".

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,260
Suga Kenji (Producer)

18
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,740
How could I make a digging manic?

19
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,900
Well, you dig and dig
like maniac, I guess.

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,100
There got to be many ways to do that.

21
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,260
Shichi henge start!

22
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,900
Peanut

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,860
Hot rice cracker

24
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,180
Too hot!(in slangy Japanese)

25
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,020
Peanut

26
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,740
Delicious.

27
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,980
Hot Rice Cracker

28
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,180
Too hot!

29
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,940
babble

30
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
How could anyone not laugh?

31
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,020
He make me laugh by
just sitting here.

32
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,020
What a dominating
presence he have!

33
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,180
It's already funny the moment
he steped into this room.

34
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,060
It's about time we get some new blood in our show to replace you guys, don't you think so?

35
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,420
We are just about enough.
We don't need new blood. - Absolutely not.

36
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,220
But, there are so many
talented young comedians...

37
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,140
Morino Ishimatsu(a famous historical play)

38
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:00,860
We have 8 performances this year.

39
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:13,860
There are some ticket available (in bumbleheaded Japanese)

40
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,340
Ticket available.

41
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,340
There's no way I'll star in this play.

42
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,820
This thing is bs!

43
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,860
He's breaking up the setup.

44
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,220
Very funny.

45
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,980
So what's that all about?

46
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,980
I couldn't make out what he's saying at first.
- Me neither.

47
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,180
Do you want to do "face-off"?
- Fine with me.

48
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,940
Just a minute, please.

49
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,300
Hello?(in good pronunciation)

50
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,980
Hello?

51
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,020
The connection is bad.

52
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,180
The connection is bad.

53
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,020
He made all of us pay for every one so far.
- We shouldn't go so easy on him.

54
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,820
It's funnier in good pronunciation.
- Look at these bills!

55
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,180
It's only the 3rd act.

56
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,620
That was 6 years ago isn't it?
- Well, that was...yes, 6 years ago.

57
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,300
Good morning.

58
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,260
Well done!

59
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,340
Why? Don't scare me.

60
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,460
That was hard for you, Hamada.

61
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,260
(sad song)

62
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,260
Sada Masashi

63
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,260
Take a shelter from rain

64
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,540
Oh, this song moves me!

65
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,580
This song moves me!

66
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,260
I managed to hold that one.

67
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,820
Heipo(director)

68
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,220
You shouldn't laugh so hard, Heipo.
Your laughter triggers mine too.

69
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,420
Bob, are you ok?

70
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,980
You drunk too much.

71
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,780
Get a grip!

72
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,420
Here, take this seat.

73
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,980
I...drunk too much.

74
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,420
I drunk too much.

75
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,220
I...drunk too much...again.

76
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,860
I drunk too much.

77
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,780
He's doing good.

78
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,260
Can you stand up?

79
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,540
I...drunk too
much...again.(make a fluff)

80
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,820
He made a fluff.

81
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,100
I don't have much money left.

82
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:31,460
Bob and Matsumoto brushing up final act

83
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,100
You mean like your fans?
- No. My fan wouldn't be good.

84
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,980
Peach Boy(old story)

85
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,100
(sound effect of peach
flowing in the river)

86
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,660
Kiji(pheasant)

87
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,660
Are you going to carry on?

88
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,580
So why did you scattered
all the papers?

89
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,100
Sorry.

90
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,980
babble

91
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,500
He scared us.

92
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,260
Everyone, Bob Sapp.

93
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,340
Clear the way for him.

94
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,420
After he got wild he didn't
know what he's doing anymore.

95
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
53,000 yen.

96
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,460
Which makes him the
No.1 in the ranking.

97
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,500
He has almost unfair advantage.

98
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,500
All the money goes to a charity

99
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:47,140
Like when he has this face so close to mine.

100
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,900
Bob Sapp understand intention of this show and generously accepted our offer.

101
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,700
We should offer him a regular spot.

102
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,660
Come to Sanseido studio
next week ok?
