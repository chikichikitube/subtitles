00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,560
(Translator's note: "rangai"
is pronounced as,
"ran-jai", a mispronunciation
of the word "ranger" .
Enjoy!)

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,610
The Future Century
Squadron: The Five Rangai!

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,780
It's past 8:00 already!

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,660
"A" Kanji has started already.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,280
Ah good. It just started.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,260
Stop it!

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,300
Help!

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,840
My name is Skeleton Mask!

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,800
You are mine from today on.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,180
No!!

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,240
Somebody help me!

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,680
Touchy touchy!

13
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,120
Stop!

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,420
Red Rangai!

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,900
Yellow Rangai!

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,250
Red Rangai!

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,400
Red Rangai!

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,680
Yellow Rangai!

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,680
Our powers combined!

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,800
The Five Rangai!

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,420
Alright!

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,840
Go out from there!

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,360
Thank you!

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,940
Hurry up and run away!

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,300
No.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,520
Huh?

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,960
It's all wrong.

28
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,900
Who are you guys?

29
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,060
Your group name?

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
The Five Rangai.

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,120
You aren't five rangai.

32
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,800
What color are you?

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,880
Yellow Rangai!

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,860
Our powers combined!

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,920
The Five Rangai!

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,720
Hold on a second!

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,480
Hold on, hold on.

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,480
You. Who are you?

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,360
Yellow Rangai!

40
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,460
And you?

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,680
Yellow Rangai!

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,780
Ridiculous!

43
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,780
Why are there two yellow ones?

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,180
Red Rangai!

45
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,240
Yeah, yeah. You're red.

46
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,320
What about you?

47
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,540
Red Rangai!

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,820
And you?

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Red Rangai!

50
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,460
Our powers combined!

51
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,460
The Five Rangai.

52
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,420
Stop! Stop!

53
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,340
Nooooo!

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,720
Don't you see something wrong?!

55
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,640
Why are there 3 red ones
and 2 yellow ones?

56
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,900
Well, you see.

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,000
We're not all about colors
or anything like that.

58
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,280
But the colors...

59
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,880
You see we want people to focus
on our individual characters.

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,640
But, no one can tell that
kind of thing offhand.

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,940
Kids focus on how you look.

62
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,060
But I think that somehow
we can get by that...

63
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,200
Because...

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,940
Because if you look, it may
seem like the same red color...

65
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,920
...but he really, really has deep affection
for his mother. Things like that...

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,780
He has a really good story about her.

67
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,840
I don't need to hear it.

68
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,660
That stuff makes no difference.

69
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm talking about you guys look.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,680
Ridiculous.

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,500
Just look.

72
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,560
Don't you think it's strange? Why
are you red and they are red, too?

73
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,300
My dad said the same exact thing.

74
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,340
Well, your dad is right.

75
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,200
It just isn't right!

76
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,080
You can't form without consulting each other about your colors first.

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,000
But we're different on the inside.

78
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,220
I already told you no one
can tell that offhand!

79
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,000
Our powers combined!

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,820
The Five Rangai!

81
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,860
Stop, stop, stop.

82
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,860
Stop, stop. No, no, no.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,920
You're not there yet.

84
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,080
You're not formed yet.

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,960
I'm the arrogant one!

86
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,720
Fine, fine.

87
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,460
you...

88
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,560
You MAY be the arrogant one.

89
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,300
But no one can tell!

90
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,380
Fine then.

91
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,620
Huh?

92
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,880
I give up.

93
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,680
Give up? What are you talking about?

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,200
But, well.

95
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,080
I'm not saying you should give up.

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,820
If it's this important, I'll
switch to green so...

97
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,060
Really?

98
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,040
I'll switch to green, too.

99
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Why the hell?!

100
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,000
We attend the same high school.

101
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
It's gotta be different!

102
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,280
I mean 2 green ones-

103
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,900
Why are you taking off your clothes?!

104
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,300
If you become green
then you can stay yellow.

105
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,980
Why are you eating right now?

106
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,260
Just ridiculous.

107
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,580
No matter how you look at it it's all wrong.

108
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,440
So, what are you saying is... Umm...

109
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,660
So you... uh...

110
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,560
...um... won't battle us today?

111
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,560
Of course I'm not fighting you today.

112
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,840
It wouldn't feel right.

113
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,300
I'd feel strange attacking you.

114
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,220
You should have a discussion with
each other when you get back home.

115
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,740
You guys hang out all the time, right?

116
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,600
Actually...

117
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,920
...I have no idea who he is.

118
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,380
You guys aren't friends?

119
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,700
No, no, no.

120
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
We just met for the first time today.

121
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,360
We were introduced to each other...

122
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,220
Is that right?

123
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,640
Yes.

124
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,620
Through the personal ads or something?

125
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,160
Yes.

126
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,480
That's no good.

127
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,340
I mean...

128
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,160
... you have to practice a little
bit with each other first.

129
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,900
It's to soon. It's to soon.

130
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,000
You're to soon.

131
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,880
I'm in my 14th year now!

132
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,860
I'd destroy you in a minute!

133
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,160
Using this!

134
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,440
Ok?

135
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,020
We understand.

136
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,560
Ok?

137
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,920
So leave.

138
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,600
But I'll be back next week.

139
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,940
So you'll be back next week.

140
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,580
Yeah.

141
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,100
So try again next week.

142
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,660
Ok.

143
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,480
And show me what you learned from today.

144
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,520
Ok?

145
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,840
The Future Century Squadron: The Five Rangai!   To be con't.
