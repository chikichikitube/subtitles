They took off in a taxi to head for the place they'd thought of.

51
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,940
I came to Daikanyama.

52
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,940
The facade looks like a Japanese house.

53
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,510
That's gotta be small, right?

54
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,180
It's not small, it fits 44 cars!

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,680

68
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,340
Matsumoto and Hosei were able to join up!

69
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,340

makes you start hating the other members.

108
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,000
Well...

109
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,910
It makes you think that they're idiots.

It's a difficult one.

115
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:28,490
Theme 3

116
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,020
I have no idea about places where we record frequently.

117
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,490
Frequent Gaki recording location.

118
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,490
We always go all over the place.

119
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,330
This one's actually really hard.

Omotesando

121
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,570
Because there's actually a lot.

122
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,240
Since there's many, the impression it left them is key.

123
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,820
Indeed. So far, Gaki no Tsukai has been recorded in all kinds of places.

124
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,240
So naturally, there are many options to choose from.

127
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,680
Let's think about this one.

128
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,510
Because now we can both think about it.

A strategy meeting at MOS Burger

130
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,920

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,620
There's no bun but...

145
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,650
There's no bun?

146
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,090
No way.

147
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,960
Is this what the lady said? Something about only lettuce.

148
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,090
I mean...

149
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,760
I though it would still have the bun!

150
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,630
Eh?

151
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,930
Really?

152
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,760
Which one is it?

153
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,430
How stoic do they think I am?

154
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
I'm really hungry...

155
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,070
A stoic

156
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,070
meal

157
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,200
Stoic Matsumoto,

158
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,740
filled his belly with lettuce.

159
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,550
South Aoyama

160
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,550
I think we've been in that place more than once.

161
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,010
Playing badminton in that place, that's what comes to mind.

162
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,380
Playing badminton in that place, that's what comes to mind.

163
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,380
Alright, I'll go there.

164
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,560
What place did he decide to go to!?

165
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,560
What frequent location did Endo choose as his destination?

166
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,360
Omotesando

167
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,860
Wait a minute.

168
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,030
What should I do?

169
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,660
There's one place that comes to mind.

170
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,070
Incidentally, where would that be?

171
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,070
Staff

172
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,870
Can I say it?

173
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,070
The first place that I though of was

174
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,640
It's *Beep*.

175
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:26,140
For Downtown's opening segment before the talk,

176
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,140
I remember recording there quite often.

177
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,050
I want to see them there!

178
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,450
Believing his hunch, he heads to his destination!

179
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,450
Tanaka decides to trust his hunch and head to his destination!

180
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,960
After eating, they discuss their destination

181
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,960
With their bellies full, the pair discuss their destination.

182
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:45,360
"Itao is watching" was

183
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,360
on that field in front of Yoyogi Park.

184
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,270
Haru no Ogawa Community Park

185
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,270
Matsumoto is thinking about a park in Yoyogi.

186
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:58,310
The park where "Itao is watching" and other segments were born.

187
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,170
This is the park where "Itao is watching" and other famous segments were born.

188
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,610
They chose it as their destination.

189
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,610
Akasaka

190
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,610
At the same time, in Akasaka, Hamada looks like he's still wavering.

191
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,620
The park where Itao watched from his apartment, we went

192
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,760
The park where Itao watched from his apartment, we went

193
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,760
there at least once, right?

194
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,060
And other things.

195
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,830
But the closest place would be Shiba Park, right?

196
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,530
But the closest place would be Shiba Park, right?

197
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,230
Shiba Park

198
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,230
Hamada thought of Shiba Park.

199
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,400
"Heipo stops a giant boulder" and other memorable segments.

200
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,400
Many memorable segments were recorded there too.

201
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,010
I'll try going to Shiba Park!

202
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,720
There's even two of these ladies.

203
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,720
I thought this was the perfect place.

204
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,320
Rides a taxi to Shiba Park

205
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,320
Hamada has chosen his destination and gets on a taxi.

206
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,390
Matsumoto and Hosei head toward Yoyogi

207
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,420
Matsumoto and Hosei begin moving toward Yoyogi.

208
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,520
That was LOSS Burger.

209
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,660
LOSS Burger.

210
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,500
Rectangle

211
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,500
Test Rules

212
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,500
â˜› The traveling time limit is 30 minutes

213
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,240
Akasaka

214
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,240
Omotesando

215
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,240
Shiba Park

216
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,240
Shibuya

217
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,240
Shinjuku

218
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,240
South Aoyama

219
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,240
Tokyo

220
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,240
With their destination in mind, everyone begins moving.

221
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,240
Yotsuya

222
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,240
Yoyogi

223
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,240
With their destination in mind, everyone begins moving.

224
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,740
Okay, wait a minute.

225
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,080
I should think about this one.

226
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,110
There's one more place.

227
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,110
There is.

228
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,110
There is, but

229
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,650
In terms of distance, I wouldn't consider it.

230
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,650
Where?

231
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,220
Sagamiko Picnic Land.

232
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,990
But this

233
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,060
It's not an option, considering the distance.

234
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,320
I told you.

235
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,060
You told me.

236
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,430
Don't you think this is it?

237
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,430
From being separated,

238
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,130
Us five will get together and it'll feel good.

239
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,900
Us five will get together and it'll feel good.

240
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,330
I really hope they come.

241
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,240
Absolute

242
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,240
Confidence

243
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,240
Endo is very confident on the place he thought of.

244
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:41,250
Arrival at Shiba Park

245
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,110
Around the same time, Hamada arrived at Shiba Park.

246
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,250
Shiba Park

247
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,250
We came here a few times but

248
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,350
I want to know where the others

249
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,350
decided to go.

250
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,920
Hamada surprised me, he went to the place where you were.

251
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,620
Hamada surprised me, he went to the place where you were.

252
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,860
I said that I was in Akasaka,

253
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:02,000
Akasaka

254
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:02,000
Matsumoto

255
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:02,000
Theme 1

256
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,260
and then he goes to Akasaka.

257
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:02,000
Akasaka

258
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:02,000
Hamada

259
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:02,000
Theme 2

260
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,030
That's why

261
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,200
I think he's an idiot.

262
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,370
The zipper is completely broken...

263
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,680
It's like he thought

264
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,680
that I wouldn't move away from Akasaka.

265
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,510
There's no way that would happen.

266
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,680
Yeah.

267
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,510
No way.

268
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,090
That's why he needs to study more.

269
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,460
That's why he needs to study more.

270
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,970
Now it got stuck.

271
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,240
We used to take this road

272
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,740
all the time when we went to Sanseido.

273
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,540
There's also this park!

274
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,750
In an apartment here Itao would...

275
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,010
That apartment.

276
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,650
He would watch us from there.

277
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,120
I think we did it at least one time.

278
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,130
In the end, what's his destination!?

279
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,130
Where exactly is Tanaka heading?

280
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,430
(Tanaka's) parking lot for 44 cars really startled me.

281
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,100
Tanaka is starting to scare me.

282
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,270
Tanaka is starting to scare me.

283
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,270
He's scary.

284
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,600
There are times when you can't really understand him.

285
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,170
There are times when you can't really understand him.

286
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,740
There are.

287
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,850
I Think You Like This

288
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,280
Like with his sense of style.

289
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Right.

290
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,850
When that happens.

291
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,050
If he hadn't entered Yoshimoto, he might have not made it.

292
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,350
If he hadn't entered Yoshimoto, he might have not made it.

293
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,560
Yoyogi Park is getting closer!

294
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,560
The two get closer to their destination, Yoyogi Park.

295
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,630
What will happen...

296
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,020
What will happen?

297
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,710
Alright!

298
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,350
I did it!

299
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,350
Of course you did.

300
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,350
Yeah!!!

301
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,450
This was the only answer.

302
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,890
Endo has joined up!

303
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,420
This was it.

304
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,690
Yeah.

305
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,290
You're right.

306
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,990
I'm so glad.

307
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,730
They're still not here.

308
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,190
I'm the only one here.

309
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,700
It had to be this place.

310
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,430
Yeah, this place.

311
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,430
That's were Itao would...

312
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,000
That's right.

313
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Itao was watching.

314
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,800
There was also the Cream Stew episode and Tanaka fight.

315
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,270
We did those, it was here, right?

316
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,270
Right.

317
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,540
And Housei's "God of Laughing"

318
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,640
It was over there.

319
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,640
Yeah.

320
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,710
This is the only possible place!

321
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,710
This place for sure.

322
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,850
Their feelings prove useless, as their time is up.

323
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,350
Nobody came!

324
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,690
It's over!

325
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,690
Staff

326
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,690
No, it's not over yet.

327
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,120
No, it's not over yet.

328
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,890
It's still not over.

329
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,330
But seriously,

330
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,370
Tanaka has a problem.

331
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,370
Yeah, I think it's really showing now.

332
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,370
I wonder what's wrong.

333
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,070
Is he doing it on purpose?

334
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,070
It makes you think...

335
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,370
If he's really doing it on purpose, then it's getting old now!!

336
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,740
If he's really doing it on purpose, then it's getting old now!!

337
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,780
Is he doing it to get a reaction from us?

338
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,850
Yeah, it feels that way.

339
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,780
He's not that type of person though...

340
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,620
"No way!"

341
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,120
They confirm Hamada's location

342
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,120
First, they confirm Hamada's location.

343
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,660
Hello?

344
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:16,930
Shiba Park

345
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:16,930
Yoyogi

346
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,720
Where are you?

347
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,130
Me?

348
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,930
I'm at Shiba Park.

349
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,560
Shiba Park?

350
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,560
Shiba Park?

351
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,560
Shiba Park?

352
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,270
I knew it.

353
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,500
You went there!!

354
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,800
Over here, there's three of us now!

355
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,600
Another correct place.

356
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,570
Over here, there's three of us now!

357
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,670
One more person joined up?

358
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,770
Yamasaki and

359
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,840
Endo here.

360
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,540
This place was the correct answer!

361
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:40,890
Shiba Park

362
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:40,890
Yoyogi

363
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,810
The correct answer? Where are you?

364
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,890
Obviously, the park where Itao watched us.

365
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,890
That's right.

366
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,850
I thought of that place but

367
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,060
"Itao is watching" was only one time, wasn't it?

368
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,060
What else did we do there?

369
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:47,830
I mean,

370
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,490
You're by yourself, right?

371
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,330
Shiba Park

372
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,330
Yoyogi

373
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,800
What if I am?

374
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,370
This was the correct answer.

375
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,300
This was it.

376
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,770
Yeah.

377
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,330
No, no, no.

378
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,140
The real problem is Tanaka.

379
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,140
Please call that monster.

380
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,370
Staff

381
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,370
Time's up.

382
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,370
Speak with everyone.

383
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,880
You're kidding...

384
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,380
Shiba Park

385
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,380
Yoyogi

386
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,410
Where are you?

387
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,650
I'm near Sanseido,

388
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,380
Shinjuku Central Park

389
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,680
No.

390
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,150
That's where we caught bugs.

391
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,690
You thought about the time we were catching bugs, didn't you?

392
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:27,930
It's a park that we used plenty of times before.

393
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:27,930
Rectangle

394
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:27,930
Shinjuku Central Park.

395
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:27,930
Tanaka's own "Bug Hunt Segment" was recorded.

396
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,320
Shinkuku Central Park, where Tanaka is,

397
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,230
was where he produced the "Heatwave Bug Hunting" segment

398
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,930
and there's no mistake that it has been used before.

399
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,370
That's old, that's really old!

400
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,040
That's old, that's really old!

401
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,040
It really is.

402
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,400
Wait a minute,

403
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,010
Did I get it wrong?

404
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,240
Matsumoto, Yamasaki, Endo. Us three are together at the park where Itao watched us.

405
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,240
Shiba Park

406
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,240
Shinjuku

407
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,240
Yoyogi

408
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,250
"Itao is watching"?

409
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:49,190
Shiba Park

410
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:49,190
Shinjuku

411
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:49,190
Yoyogi

412
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,480
Hamada, where are you?

413
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,150
Shiba Park.

414
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,190
Shiba Park?

415
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,190
Who cares about Hamada.

416
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,460
There's no use talking.

417
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,460
This conversation is useless.

418
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,290
You both got it wrong, your conversation

419
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,290
won't do any good.

420
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,560
I'm at Shiba Park!!

421
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,260
At Shiba Park, have we even recorded there?

422
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,700
At Shiba Park, have we even recorded there?

423
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,730
Shiba Park...

424
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,200
Well then...

425
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,200
You're just loitering now.

426
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,170
We're still...

427
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,540
We're still continuing...

428
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,540
The number of times doesn't matter to them.

429
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,250
They're saying their choice was right,

430
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,250
because "Us three came here", thinking about "Itao is watching".

431
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,750
I thought about it too but I only remembered going there once.

432
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,220
I've really been trying to make the right choice...

433
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,090
Akasaka

434
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,090
Harajuku

435
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,090
Omotesando

436
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,090
Shiba Park

437
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,090
Shinbashi

438
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,090
Shinjuku

439
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,090
Shinjuku

440
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,090
Time since start: 2 hrs 34 min

441
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,090

442
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,090
Yotsuya

443
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,090
Yoyogi

444
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,360
It's been two and a half hours since the start.

445
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,090
Three people have come together. Only Hamada and Tanaka are left.

446
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,870
Theme 4   Announcement

447
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,870
Next, the fourth theme is announced.

448
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,970
Tsutaya

449
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:44,210
Theme 4

450
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:44,210
Speaking of Tsutaya?

451
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,210
I don't go to Tsutaya very often.

452
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:50,280
Possible Tsutaya locations: About 42 stores

453
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,850
Considering the time limit, they have

454
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,280
about 42 different stores to choose from.

455
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:58,220
Aired on 10/08/2014

456
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:58,220
Let's continue strolling until we meet Celebs ! in Daikanyama

457
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,920
In Gaki no Tsukai, they recorded the "Strolling to meet celebs" segment,

458
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,220
and they should remember their visit to the Tsutaya in Daikanyama.

459
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Shinjuku

460
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,290
I already have two in mind.

461
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,560
I have two.

462
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,530
The first one that came to mind was

463
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,230
The Tsutaya in Sancha.

464
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:13,200
Sangenjaya

465
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,530
The one in Carrot Tower.

466
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,470
And the other one was the Tsutaya in Daikanyama.

467
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,200
Daikanyama Tsutaya Bookstore

468
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,400
Is that one a Tsutaya?

469
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,540
Yes, it is.

470
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,810
I wish I could have seen it better, Daikanyama's Tsutaya.

471
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,940
I wish I could have seen it better, Daikanyama's Tsutaya.

472
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,650
I didn't really see it...

473
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,620
Yoyogi

474
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,610
Ah, Matsumoto, we got this.

475
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,620
We got this one.

476
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,390
There's a lot of them, but it's gotta be that one, right?

477
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,920
Let's say it all together.

478
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,120
1, 2...

479
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,120
1, 2...

480
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,120
1, 2...

481
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,130
Daikanyama!!

482
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,130
Daikanyama!!

483
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,130
TV Asahi!

484
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,390
The one in front of TV Asahi.

485
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,200
It's gotta be one in Daikanyama.

486
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,200
It's gotta be one in Daikanyama.

487
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,170
No, the one in the corner in front of TV Asahi.

488
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,070
I'm telling you it's the one in Daikanyama.

489
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,070
Daikanyama...

490
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,140
If you think about it, they're gonna go to Daikanyama.

491
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,370
If you think about it, they're gonna go to Daikanyama.

492
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,570
If they're thinking straight.

493
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,370
However,

494
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,110
there's also a Tsutaya near the yakiniku place

495
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,110
where Hamada sometimes goes to eat.

496
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,620
The one near the Equestrian Park.

497
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,080
Equestrian Park

498
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,580
Ah, that's...

499
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,480
But the one that comes to mind

500
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,920
has to be the one in Daikanyama

501
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,750
Right.

502
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,920
Let's go there.

503
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,920
They'll go there.

504
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,790
Right now, I'd go to the one in Roppongi.

505
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,790
Shiba Park

506
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,390
The one near TV Asahi...

507
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,560
The one near the intersection.

508
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,830
If I had to choose a Tsutaya...

509
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,270
Personally, I'd go to the one in front of the Equestrian park.

510
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:24,210
Equestrian Park

511
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,640
But I wouldn't go all the way over there.

512
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,210
It'll take more than 30 minutes.

513
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,410
There's also the one where we recorded recently,

514
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,080
whether we could meet celebrities, the Tsutaya in Daikanyama.

515
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:38,960
Daikanyama Tsutaya Bookstore

516
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,090
Which one is closer? From Yoyogi.

517
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,960
Which one is closer? From Yoyogi.

518
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,190
Daikanyama?

519
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,660
Daikanyama.

520
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,960
It's Daikanyama...

521
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,030
Let's go to *Beep*

522
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,800
Which Tsutaya did he choose!?

523
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,000
After pondering an answer,

524
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,800
which Tsutaya did Hamada choose as his destination?

525
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,010
What will Tanaka do?

526
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,680
Right now, we're in Shinjuku...

527
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,480
I think it has to be that place.

528
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
Akasaka

529
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
Harajuku

530
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
Omotesando

531
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
Shiba Park

532
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
Shibuya

533
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
Shinbashi

534
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
Shinjuku

535
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
Shinjuku

536
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
Tokyo

537
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
With their destination in mind, everyone begins moving.

538
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
Yotsuya

539
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
Yoyogi

540
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,050
Now that they've chosen their destination,

541
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,920
they begin moving.

542
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,260
A frequent recording location,

543
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,260
Staff

544
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,260
the one with the most (people) became the right answer.

545
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,260
The number of people.

546
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:14,930
Yeah.

547
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,790
That's the rule they made up.

548
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,560
It said "frequent" in the theme,

549
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,560
but they ignored that part.

550
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,400
They don't even bother reading the sentence.

551
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,240
They're all idiots!

552
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,910
On the road to Daikanyama

553
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,010
Those three are on the road,

554
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,850
heading towards the Tsutaya in Daikanyama.

555
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,080
Tanaka thinks very differently.

556
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,350
Tanaka thinks very differently.

557
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,850
What's going on with Tanaka, Endo?

558
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,850
He's always like that.

559
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,620
I wonder what's wrong.

560
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,250
He's starting to stop thinking like a Japanese person.

561
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,960
He's starting to stop thinking like a Japanese person.

562
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,390
Stop thinking like a Japanese person?

563
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:46,960
Tanaka is...

564
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,430
He's the type of person who destroys himself.

565
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,070
A self-destructive person!

566
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,120
Yeah, he's destroying this.

567
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,330
Samantha Thavasa, was it?

568
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,870
It was just a normal billboard.

569
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:05,180
Tanaka's  "Big Billboard"

570
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,000
What was he thinking?

571
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,000
It's not even big.

572
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,310
There's no way five old guys would get together at a Samantha Thavasa billboard!!

573
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,180
There's no way five old guys would get together at a Samantha Thavasa billboard!!

574
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,210
Were they complaining about you? On the phone?

575
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,780
Staff

576
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,780
Were they complaining about you? On the phone?

577
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:18,520
I don't know who said it but

578
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,520
when I said, "I'm at Shinjuku Central Park"

579
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,430
I heard a voice say, "That's old!"

580
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,400
It made me feel embarrassed, for a moment.

581
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,400
I don't know...

582
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,570
That's old, that's really old!

583
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,070
That's old, that's really old!

584
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,030
It really is.

585
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,610
Knowing who said it...

586
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,610
Staff

587
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,800
Yeah,

588
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I think it's gonna make me feel worse so...

589
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,480
I'm thinking of not watching this one when it airs.

590
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:46,480
Arrival at Daikanyama's Tsutaya Book Store

591
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,980
At around that time, Matsumoto, Hosei and Endo

592
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,480
arrived at the Tsutaya in Daikanyama.

593
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,420
No, there's no one here.

594
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
There is, over there.

595
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,290
No, there's no one.

596
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,030
You're kidding.

597
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,660
If they're still not here, then...

598
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,560
They'll never...

599
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,660
Not good news.

600
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,530
Isn't this too hard?

601
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,870
Isn't this too hard?

602
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,870
But,

603
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,600
there was a bit of traffic so...

604
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,940
Tanaka, please...

605
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,670
You can't stand up for Tanaka.

606
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,610
You can't stand up for Tanaka.

607
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,050
He's off somewhere else.

608
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,050
What happened, Tanaka?

609
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,380
If we're unlucky, he went to Sangenjaya.

610
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,150
It's this one, it's gotta be this Tsutaya.

611
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,620
But, yeah...

612
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,190
I want to meet them.

613
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,030
It would make me very happy, if I could meet them.

614
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,430
It would make me very happy, if I could meet them.

615
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,800
Where are they?

616
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Worst-case scenario, Tanaka went to Sancha and Hamada went to Roppongi.

617
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,440
Worst-case scenario, Tanaka went to Sancha and Hamada went to Roppongi.

618
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,440
And we're still separated.

619
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,440
Still separated.

620
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,400
And we do it one more time.

621
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,600
One more time.

622
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:48,680
There's two choices, but which one do I choose?

623
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,190
At Daikanyama,

624
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,190
will they

625
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,190
come together!?

626
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,190
Will the five be able to come together at Daikanyama's Tsutaya?

627
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,120
My stomach hurts.

628
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,220
Matsumoto.

629
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,830
There.

630
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,860
Dahama-senpai!!

631
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,600
Senpai!

632
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,800
Senpai!

633
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,070
Of course.

634
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,770
I'm so glad.

635
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,210
You're here.

636
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:15,840
Alright!

637
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:15,840
Alright!

638
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,810
Hamada is able to join up!!

639
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,180
This was it, wasn't it?

640
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,310
This was it.

641
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,410
Right?

642
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,450
Right?

643
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,610
We recorded here.

644
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,880
What about Tanaka?

645
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,880
He's still not here.

646
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,020
I don't know where Tanaka went but

647
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,090
There's no way it's anywhere but here.

648
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,090
It's really strange for him not to be here.

649
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,090
Yeah, considering the distance.

650
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,130
Tanaka was nowhere to be seen and time ran out.

651
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:45,000
Mulling over two choices, he went to Sangenjaya.

652
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,570
After mulling over his two choices,

653
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,000
he decided to go to Sangenjaya.

654
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,670
They're late...

655
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,780
Scolding him over the phone

656
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,780
They're going to scold Tanaka over the phone.

657
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,410
Staff

658
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,410
Time's up.

659
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,450
No way.

660
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,090
This is just ridiculous!!

661
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,090
Hello?

662
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,060
Daikanyama

663
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,060
Sangenjaya

664
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,690
Where are you?

665
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,060
I'm in Sancha.

666
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:11,260
T/N: 'Sancha' is how they shorten Sangenjaya.

667
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,760
Sancha?

668
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,860
He went to the Tsutaya in Sancha.

669
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,260
Why did you go to Sancha?

670
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,570
Daikanyama

671
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,570
Sangenjaya

672
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,900
There's four of us over here.

673
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,330
There it is.

674
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,570
You four are together.

675
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,270
We're in Daikanyama.

676
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,910
There it is! Daikanyama!!

677
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,480
If it's Tsutaya written in alphabet letters,

678
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,480
wouldn't it be the Tsutaya in Sangenjaya?

679
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,450
What are you talking about?

680
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,650
He's desperate.

681
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,880
He's really desperate.

682
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,550
This is his weird, serious attitude.

683
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,920
He's displaying it.

684
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,550
He's desperate, not good.

685
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:40,220
Daikanyama

686
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:40,220
Sangenjaya

687
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,190
But, in the strolling around the city segments...

688
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,490
The most recent one...

689
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,970
Right now, suddenly, *Beeeeeeeeeeeeeep* has shown up.

690
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,800
Encounter with a celebrity

691
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,000
What the hell...

692
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,800
It's the wrong
segment.

693
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,800
Wrong segment.

694
00:19:52,800 --> 00:20:00,510
Daikanyama

695
00:19:52,800 --> 00:20:00,510
Ebisu

696
00:19:52,800 --> 00:20:00,510
Nakameguro

697
00:19:52,800 --> 00:20:00,510
Sangenjaya

698
00:19:52,800 --> 00:20:00,510
Shibuya

699
00:19:52,800 --> 00:20:00,510
Tanaka went to Sangenjaya, and was unable to join the others.

700
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,480
For the fourth theme, Tsutaya, Tanaka headed to Sangenjaya

701
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,510
and was unable to join the others.

702
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,010
Right now, suddenly, Pierre Taki has shown up.

703
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,280
Right now, suddenly, Pierre Taki has shown up.

704
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,990
Right now, suddenly, Pierre Taki has shown up.

705
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,660
Right now?

706
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,590
What the hell...

707
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,590
It's the wrong segment!

708
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,760
Wrong segment.

709
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,590
This time we don't have to meet celebs.

710
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,330
What are you doing?

711
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:23,370
Happened to pass by

712
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:23,370
Pierre Taki

713
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,960
Recording for Gaki.

714
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,070
Taki is right in front of me.

715
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,200
I met a celebrity.

716
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,200
Then...

717
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:31,380
Daikanyama

718
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:31,380
Sangenjaya

719
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,770
Alright, last one.

720
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,010
Yes, last one.

721
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,010
Let's do this.

722
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,070
We have to get together with this one.

723
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,380
Of course, this is it.

724
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,380
Bring Pierre along too!

725
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,980
Ah, together with Taki!

726
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,520
Why?

727
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,620
I'm here with my kids, shopping.

728
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,590
Ah, of course.

729
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,690
Taki is shopping with his kids.

730
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,560
Daikanyama

731
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,560
Ebisu

732
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,560
Nakameguro

733
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,560
Sangenjaya

734
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,560
Shibuya

735
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:50,560
Time since start: 3 hr 24 min

736
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,260
It's been 3 hours and 20 minutes.

737
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,560
Four have come together, only Tanaka is left.

738
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,230
Theme 5   Announced

739
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,230
They want to end it with the next one, the fifth theme.

740
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,500
Next is...

741
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,940
It can only be that place.

742
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,070
If it's Donki, it has to be that one.

743
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,110
Theme 5

744
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,110
Speaking of Don Quijote?

745
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,810
Only that one.

746
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,810
That one.

747
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,670
Let's say it all at once.

748
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,380
Wait.

749
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,110
I'm ready.

750
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,580
1, 2...

751
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,580
1, 2...

752
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,580
1, 2...

753
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,580
1, 2...

754
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Nakameguro!

755
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Nakameguro!

756
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Nakameguro!

757
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Shibuya!

758
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,850
It's Shibuya, right?

759
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,920
We went Nakame, Nakame, Shibuya, Nakame.

760
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,420
(Nakameguro)'s closer, isn't it?

761
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,190
Yeah, it's close.

762
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,290
We could even walk there!

763
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,460
We can.

764
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,290
Are you walking there?

765
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,290
Staff

766
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,930
We're not walking there though.

767
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,300
Nakameguro is fine, yes?

768
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,300
Yeah, it's fine.

769
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,300
Yeah.

770
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,230
There's one in Roppongi, isn't there?

771
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,970
Uh... yeah, in Roppongi.

772
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,000
Yes, in Roppongi.

773
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,540
Taki, speaking of Donki?

774
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,840
Speaking of Donki... I guess...

775
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:48,850
Nakameguro

776
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,270
It'd be Nakame. First one is Nakame.

777
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,270
Nakame, right.

778
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:48,850
Kanpachi Setagaya

779
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,840
Also, Kanpachi,

780
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,510
the Honancho store,

781
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:48,850
Kannana Honancho

782
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,120
and there's also the new big one

783
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,850
Shinjuku East Exit

784
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
in Shinjuku's Kabukicho.

785
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,850
You know a lot about Donki!

786
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,850
Yeah.

787
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,790
Well, I just got a hint from Taki so...

788
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:52,760
all that's left

789
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,760
use it to make my own choice...

790
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,330
Yeah.

791
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:55,760
I'll be going now.

792
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,270
He parts ways with Pierre Taki...

793
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,430
After receiving help during his private time,

794
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,270
we part ways with Pierre Taki...

795
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,070
Having chosen a destination, Tanaka heads to Don Quijote!

796
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,070
After choosing his destination, Tanaka heads to Don Quijote!

797
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,810
How should I feel about this?

798
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,210
There are people waiting for me in that place...

799
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,150
I want to feel it,

800
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,150
what everyone else already felt.

801
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,820
Arrival at Nakameguro Main Store

802
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,020
At the same time, the other four

803
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,220
are already at Nakameguro's Don Quijote.

804
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,890
Why do we have to wait for Tanaka?

805
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,760
Why do we have to wait for Tanaka?

806
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,760
Sorry.

807
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,200
Only one wish

808
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,200
Tanaka only has one wish.

809
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,900
I wish I could meet them. I want to meet them!!

810
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,710
At last, will they be able to meet!?

811
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:42,710
At last, will Tanaka be able to meet with the others?

812
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,310
Stand-by at the Nakameguro Main Store

813
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,310
The four wait for Tanaka at the Don Quijote in Nakameguro.

814
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,380
Why do we have to wait for Tanaka?

815
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,820
Why do we have to wait for Tanaka?

816
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:56,390
Tanaka has arrived near a Don Quijote.

817
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:59,490
Arrival at his chosen Don Quijote

818
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,060
This is the only place I could think of.

819
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,060
And now...

820
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,700
I want to meet him, in the end, it'll feel nice.

821
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,700
I bet Tanaka wants to meet us too.

822
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,040
Oh?

823
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,470
There's a lot of people over there.

824
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,440
He's here!

825
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,820
It was this one.

826
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,910
Look, they're here!

827
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,950
Look, there!

828
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,250
Hey, this is...

829
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,290
There they are!

830
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,820
Yeah, we're here.

831
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,750
Here you are.

832
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,360
At last, the 5 come together!

833
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,360
Time since start: 3 hr 43 min

834
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,320
Don't be saying "look, look".

835
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,730
Don't say that. What the hell is up with you?

836
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,630
Why are you like that? You're not excited at all.

837
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,460
It's not like we're happy.

838
00:23:38,630 --> 00:24:09,730
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

839
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,400
This one was really a no-brainer.

840
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,540
You're the only one that thought differently.

841
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,370
Look who's talking! You just met them in the last one.

842
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,370
Seriously.

843
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,540
Isn't it true?

844
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,810
What's wrong, Tanaka?

845
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,140
Are you doing it on purpose?

846
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,280
He's doing it on purpose.

847
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,280
I would never...

848
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,280
It was...

849
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,280
On purpose.

850
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,710
If you were...

851
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,920
If you were actually doing it on purpose...

852
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,380
You would really be a despicable person.

853
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,550
You would really be a despicable person.

854
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,720
He called you that again.

855
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,250
Stop saying that.

856
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,660
Matsumoto, please stop calling me that.
