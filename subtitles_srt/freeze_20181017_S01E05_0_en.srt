00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,730
I'm sure this thing will escalate.

3
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,230
Are we gonna be alright?

4
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,540
What's really the point of staying still?

5
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,230
Tarantulas...

6
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,350
Those are a no-go for me.

7
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,160
Thinking about it, that was an
abuse of power by Hitoshi Matsumoto.

8
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,270
If I go to the finals...

9
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,300
I don't think it'll be
about winning or losing.

10
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,620
Rather, it's gonna be about
being as still as possible.

11
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
And I've evolved throughout
all the different battles.

12
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,090
I can feel Matsumoto's
philosophy in play here.

13
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,120
I'm using my five senses to
the fullest, but that's what's hard.

14
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,330
I have to use them to the fullest, but at
the same time I'm forced to shut them out.

15
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,840
I didn't realize how funny
"non-reactions" could be.

16
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,520
I was so happy when I
won the consolation match.

17
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,710
And I could be
representing the celebrities.

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,390
So I wanted to show them
how amazing we celebrities are.

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,990
I think I'm stronger when it
comes to pain endurance.

20
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,160
I'm here!

21
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,320
Who are you again?

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,740
I'm Kuro-chan!

23
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,570
You know me, don't you?

24
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,640
- Aren't you Bobby?
- I'm not Bobby!

25
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,570
I won the consolation match.

26
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,220
What did you guys do?

27
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,790
I won't tell you. That might
give you an advantage.

28
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,650
I'm gonna fight to the death.

29
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,570
- That scared me!
- Alright, everyone!

30
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,360
We're finally here.

31
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,270
Yes.

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,110
Everything will be decided here.

33
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,330
Who will win the 1 million yen?

34
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,360
- He looks so happy.
- For real.

35
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,390
Don't you hate him for that?

36
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,880
You're right, he's the ultimate sadist.

37
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,400
Kuro-chan climbed all the way back here.

38
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,390
And the other two are undeniably strong.

39
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,350
We're just freezing in place.

40
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,200
But you know, everyone
else failed at that.

41
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,470
That's right.

42
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,190
I can't even imagine how
this match will turn out.

43
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,840
But this is the final stage.

44
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,510
- Let's go!
- Yes! I'll do my best!

45
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,770
I won't lose!
I definitely won't lose.

46
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,170
- I mean, that's good and all...
- But you know...

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,570
We lived through the turbulent Showa era.

48
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,910
So we learned to bear it all.

49
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,160
It's a bit different from today.

50
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,600
I won't be fazed by anything either.

51
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,630
Anyways, this room is super small.

52
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,590
- You're right.
- It's so small.

53
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,620
Even so, you have to endure it.

54
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,010
Alright, it's about time to start.

55
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,880
Everyone looks really tough.

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,820
But, Kuro-chan is not as
weak as you might think.

57
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,940
He's pretty strong.

58
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,030
But will he overcome these two?

59
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,080
I'm kinda hoping Kuro-chan
ends up being a dark horse.

60
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,930
It all depends on how he does here.

61
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,040
Right, let's go.

62
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,530
The pressure is starting to rise.

63
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,620
And here it comes.

64
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,490
I would hate this.

65
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,290
I would really hate this.

66
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,060
I really loathe this.

67
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,760
With this challenge,
the faces and reactions

68
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,430
will be a bit hard to see.

69
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,550
Isn't this great?

70
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,260
Diamond Yukai isn't even
blinking despite the situation.

71
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,970
This thing will keep growing.

72
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,260
That's good, that's great.

73
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,630
Everyone, make sure to pay
attention. Don't miss the moment it pops.

74
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,690
There should be some sudden reactions.

75
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,870
Will they still be able to breathe?

76
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,530
Yukai still has some room left.

77
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,920
Kuro-chan must be suffering right now.

78
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,470
Hang on, Morohoshi might be in trouble.

79
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,060
He doesn't look ok anymore.

80
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,470
Morohoshi has lost all ability to move.

81
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,940
Morohoshi has...

82
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,070
Yukai didn't move at all!

83
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,500
Morohoshi has...

84
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,850
Yukai didn't move at all!

85
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,210
That hairstyle!

86
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,470
None of them laughed?!

87
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,000
They aren't even smiling.

88
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,200
- That was an amazing match.
- Hold on...

89
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,650
What was that?!

90
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,360
That was impressive.

91
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,340
Whoa! My eyes hurt.

92
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,120
His eyes hurt?

93
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,310
This...

94
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,440
Yukai...

95
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,590
I mean, there was no place to run!

96
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,540
- Hold on!
- That was so good!

97
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,360
That was good?

98
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,200
- What was good about it?
- It was an impressive match.

99
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,480
- That was good?
- Do you want to see the replay of this one?

100
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,300
- Yes, I wanna see.
- Let's look at the replay then.

101
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,230
Diamond Yukai wasn't
even closing his eyes.

102
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,140
Amazing.

103
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,950
- That was amazing.
- Really?

104
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,670
How were your eyes open that whole time?

105
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,570
Your face was all smushed.

106
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,140
Yet you kept your eyes open.

107
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,240
The battle of the open eyes! Amazing!

108
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,020
I thought I was gonna die.

109
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,930
It was suffocating.

110
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,360
That first one was really
something I didn't expect.

111
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,430
That was so scary.

112
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,410
I couldn't see anymore.

113
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,350
You know, I'm not that good at this.

114
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,570
I don't have any
experience with these things.

115
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,570
I mean, things exploding and all that.

116
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,180
It's never happened to me.

117
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,240
Let's go to the next one!

118
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,330
- Is there more?
- More?!

119
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,640
Hold on, that one was pretty intense.

120
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,540
Right?

121
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,390
It was scary too.

122
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,520
Yes, so why didn't you close your eyes?

123
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,640
I mean, we're supposed
to freeze. Like this.

124
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,270
Even there?

125
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,040
- Here we go!
- Hold on...

126
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,730
The mighty Diamond Yukai...

127
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,420
However, it may be that Yukai was
just well fit for the balloon challenge.

128
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,210
He might be weak in our next challenge.

129
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,680
How will they deal with this?

130
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,520
Alright.

131
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,780
Of course, they're
fighting with all they've got...

132
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,940
But they won't hurt the guys around them.

133
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,100
They won't point the bamboo
swords towards our guys.

134
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,360
However...

135
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,630
However...

136
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,000
Getting hit in these close
quarters is inevitable.

137
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,790
-- is inevitable.

138
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,360
Yukai is amazing. Look at him.

139
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,580
And Kuro-chan as well.

140
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,010
Morohoshi fell down.

141
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,850
Alright, this is awesome.

142
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,410
This is amazing!

143
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,460
Okay.

144
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,310
Let's get them back for now.

145
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,490
Let's get them back.

146
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,790
Bow.

147
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,870
What?!

148
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,350
That hurt!

149
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,680
- What the heck was that?!
- Did you fall?

150
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,380
They pushed and kicked me!

151
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,950
They were crashing into me too.

152
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,450
- That's so dangerous!
- It is.

153
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,840
- What was that?
- They bumped you, right?

154
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,890
- What the heck was that?
- What?

155
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:08,950
Wonderful!

156
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,780
- Wonderful?
- Yes, wonderful.

157
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,480
Why did you fall? I missed it.

158
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,940
One of the guys tripped on my foot.

159
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,320
Let's take a look at the replay.

160
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,500
He got caught! See?!

161
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,000
I wonder about that...

162
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,680
But the fact that you didn't move
afterwards is a plus in my eyes.

163
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,680
Thank you.

164
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,820
I didn't fall on my own.

165
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,140
The Kendo guy got stuck on my foot.

166
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,150
- Is that so?
- He got stuck and pulled on me, so I fell.

167
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,590
I didn't move.

168
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,370
That was pretty suspicious.

169
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,410
I didn't say anything at the time...

170
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,090
But really, I think he fell on his own.

171
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Right, let's continue.

172
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,020
Yukai has completely
gone into his own world.

173
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,950
"I'm going to another planet now."

174
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,600
Or something like that.

175
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,490
Something unexpected might happen here.

176
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,490
Yukai is amazing.

177
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,400
Kuro-chan is also great.

178
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,450
They're flying, they're flying.

179
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,050
Whoa, they're really flying.

180
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,090
They're going pretty high.

181
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,850
They must be hot.

182
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,700
They've gotta be really hot.

183
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,160
They must hate this.

184
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,470
Don't you think Kuro-chan's
expression has changed?

185
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,820
It seems like Kuro-chan doesn't like this.

186
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,190
Morohoshi just got hit in the leg.

187
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,680
He flinched a bit, right?

188
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,550
It must be hot.

189
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,480
That one hit him right
between the rips in his jeans.

190
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,650
I totally saw him moving his leg.

191
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,370
Oh, it hit his arm! It's hot!

192
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:02,990
Hot!

193
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,900
That must hurt!

194
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,430
I would totally hate this.

195
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:12,560
After all, popcorn only flies
when it's really hot, right?

196
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,440
We could also go right back
to kendo without releasing.

197
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,870
Should I do it? Okay.

198
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,500
Yukai is awesome.

199
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,400
Alright, what's gonna happen?

200
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,240
That hit him!

201
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,130
Okay, let's get them back.

202
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,940
Have them come back. Okay.

203
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,520
That hurt!

204
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,960
- It was so hot!
- What hit me?!

205
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,910
That was amazing! It was super hot!

206
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,130
Morohoshi just got hit in the leg.

207
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,610
He flinched a bit, right?

208
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,310
It's so hot and itchy.

209
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,270
Why are you clapping?

210
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,260
What are the claps for?

211
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,620
- It's over!
- What?! We're done?!

212
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,410
It's over!

213
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,570
- It's over!
- Good job, everyone!

214
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,670
Kuro-chan, did it hurt when
the popcorn landed on your arm?

215
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,440
It was super hot!

216
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,050
Alright, how is everyone
feeling about their odds?

217
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,990
I have no clue...

218
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:23,570
Well, I think I was able to
focus towards the later half.

219
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,410
Ah, I see.

220
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,520
That hit him!

221
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,910
What about you, Yukai?

222
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,860
I think I did my best.

223
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,370
Alright!

224
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,630
Now, let me announce the winner.

225
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,740
Please!

226
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,590
The winner is...

227
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,440
Diamond Yukai!

228
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,940
He's amazing.

229
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,350
Wonderful!

230
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,270
He's really good, it's so unfair!

231
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,740
He really was amazing.

232
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,960
I was worried I wouldn't
be able to pick a winner.

233
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,070
But there was a clear winner.

234
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,210
Is that so?

235
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,250
He didn't move an inch.

236
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,450
He didn't even move with the balloon.

237
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,330
Right, the balloon.

238
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,060
The whole time, I was
just trying not to think.

239
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,130
I'm glad I did my best.

240
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,470
Matsumoto, thank you.

241
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,030
We will give Yukai the 1
million yen! Congratulations!

242
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,370
Congratulations!

243
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,840
Yukai is amazing!

244
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,170
Thank you!

245
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,190
Would you compete again if
we ever did a second season?

246
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,160
I don't know about that...

247
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,110
This show...

248
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,550
It's pretty intense!

249
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,710
I mean, of course I'm happy.

250
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,540
But I had to walk through fire and flames.

251
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,300
I think my mind took a bigger hit.

252
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,300
I've never seen that
many snakes in one place.

253
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,060
It's so extreme.

254
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,230
I hope it was entertaining.

255
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,010
And I think it'll spread worldwide.

256
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,750
The prize is 1 million yen.

257
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,660
Alright!

258
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,860
Congratulations.

259
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,960
I'm a father of three...

260
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,590
So I was thinking of them the whole time.

261
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,750
I think that's what got
me over the finish line.

262
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,080
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thank you.

263
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,100
That was amazing.

264
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,510
Really amazing.

265
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,360
I mean, everyone has a weakness.

266
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,470
But in the end, with Morohoshi and Yukai

267
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,470
I honestly couldn't find theirs.

268
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,540
Yukai sure is a strange guy.

269
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,780
Diamond Yukai is hilarious.

270
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,040
He's that funny without moving.

271
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:40,240
And he probably thinks he's so boring.

272
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,370
But that's also part
of what makes it funny.

273
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,200
You know, the tarantula...

274
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,500
Kuro-chan didn't move at all.

275
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:53,280
That huge tarantula was crawling
around his ear and he didn't move at all.

276
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,080
I think that was quite amazing.

277
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,630
And even he couldn't win
against the mighty Diamond Yukai.

278
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,080
That's quite something.
That guy is quite something.

279
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,170
He seems like a good guy.

280
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,490
But...

281
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,770
I wonder if his personal life is okay.

282
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:43,750
