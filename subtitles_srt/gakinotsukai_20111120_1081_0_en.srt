00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,240
2nd Time on Gaki no Tsukai - Nostalgic Song Drive!!

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,040
This is the second time

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,280
It's the second time, and actually,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,640
The first time, there was a proper ending actually

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,620
There was one, but because of the weather it couldn't happen

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,200
It was raining like crazy

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,480
And there is one person here who absolutlely must do that punchline

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,020
That's why he was smirking all this time

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,120
If anything that was a build up for this

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,350
oh really?

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,500
So there's a brilliant ending waiting for us

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,600
Something innovative

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,200
NTV might even pay him a fee for this

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,360
We can just do this like always right

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,200
Of course, you have all brought your nostalgic songs

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,800
You gotta hype it up

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,080
Innovation, innovation

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,720
I understand, there will be a nice ending right?

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,810
If we can hype it up eno-
Enough please! Enough already

What is Yamasaki's innovative punchline?!
2nd Nostalgic Song Drive!

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,320
A blue sky, for real

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,720
Yes, no rain for sure

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,170
Yeah it's not gonna rain

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,200
Did everyone remeber to bring their songs?

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,560
The CDs

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,800
Of course
Of course, my nostalgic songs

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,520
Hmm, Yama-chan, that?

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,520
Hamada-san just laughed so hard!
Hard? I did not laugh hard

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,120
I just thought "Oh it's like that again"

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,520
You really are loved.

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,800
By the staff right? They only gave me this

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,040
Why do they do that? Do you tell them to?

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,080
I really don't tell them to,

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,600
Before starting today the staff called me over. In fact there were 5 other ones beside this one!

36
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,440
"Choose from these ones"?

37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,040
Yes they said "Please choose from these"

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,080
Wow

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,560
That's totally favoritism

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,040
Shall we decide who goes first

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,840
Alright, then Tanaka you go?

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,600
Really?

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,160
Yeah we can start with Tanaka

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,800
Shall I start?

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
Tanaka you've been nominated

46
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,160
The first song on here please

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,840
Tanaka's first song

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,440
Yes

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,840
What? What?

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,280
This is...

51
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,080
This is Murashita Kouzou-san's "First Love:

52
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:52,480
Murashita Kouzou - First Love

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,600
It's a bit unfortunate that this had to be the first one, as it's so special,

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,320
Yeah

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:57,000
Back in the 2nd year of middle school, I liked this girl from the class next door

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,680
And I liked her so much I had to do something,

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:08,240
I confessed to someone that I like them for the first time in 2nd year

58
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,260
And in the end she did reject me

59
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,540
How did she reply?

60
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,080
"Tanaka-kun the way you walk is gross!!" she said

61
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,560
This is uh,

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,720
I was shocked, by the reason too

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,580
I talked to her a bit too

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,280
Endo was in the class next door

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,680
She was in my class

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,360
So I talked to Endo about it, and he told me it doesn't seem like she likes anyone,

67
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,640
She doesn't have a boyfriend

68
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,490
Right, and then I confessed to her, and she used that reason to reject me

69
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,360
It was my first confession, and I bawled my eyes out

70
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,160
You cried?

71
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,880
I cried and cried and cried my heart out

72
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,000
It took me so many days to get over it

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,680
Damn, that's not cool

74
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,960
I was so shocked

75
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,680
And when I turned the radio on after that happened this song was playing

76
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,560
This song is "First Love"

77
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,840
Yes it was linked to my first love, my first confession

78
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,940
If someone tells you the way you walk is gross,
It's gotta pretty difficult to walk after that

79
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,960
Someone telling you you're walking is gross...

80
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,920
I couldn't walk

81
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,800
It's your natural gait after all ... It's an insult to your life!!

82
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,600
Exactly

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,760
So right after that, I think this follows that obe

84
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,600
This one, everyone knows it I'm sure

85
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:35,590
O-NyanKo Club - Don't Strip Me of My Sailor Suit

86
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
EVERYONE knows it

87
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
When you were in middle school?

88
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:37,640
This is from when we went from 1st to 2nd year of middle school,

89
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,480
During 1st year, Tanaka was actually shorter than us

90
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,880
In fact you could even say he was shorter than average

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,880
And then went Tanaka entered 2nd year, and he fell in love right?

92
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,520
After that,

93
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,960
Tanaka's height suddenly grew by 10-19cm

94
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,360
Oh yeah there were kids like that

95
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,080
And then, that girl that was his first love,

96
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:20,560
And what all the girls in my class were saying was
"Isn't Tanaka from next door getting bigger every day?"

97
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,160
They said something like, "Isn't it super creepy?"

98
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,600
That's just how suddenly he grew super tall

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
Oh wow

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,960
You grew a lot right?

101
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,440
Like "Isn't he even bigger today?"

102
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,120
Exactly, after his confession he still kept growing

103
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,440
Yeah

104
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,120
Did you ever ask her out again?

105
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,300
I didn't

106
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:53,560
After that- After that Endo started dating that girl that rejected me

107
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,160
Oi asshole!

108
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
You didn't mention it did you?!

109
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,080
Endo! You can't do that!

110
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,400
Yeah I know

111
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:09,600
After that, that girl confessed to me she likes me

112
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,960
When I asked her "What do you like about me?"
She replied "Endo, you're proper"

113
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,600
After that Tanaka bawled his eyes out again

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,000
All I do is cry

115
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,000
All you do is cry

116
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,840
getting taller and crying, getting treated like a monster

117
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,960
I feel bad for Tanaka

118
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,480
Alright let's go with Hamada-san

119
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,440
Oh me?

120
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,600
The first song on here please

121
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,680
The first song

122
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,200
What is this?

123
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,320
Ah! It's Candies

124
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,640
Yes yes

125
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,000
Candies!

126
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,000
This was a hit

127
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:57,430
Candies - Gentle Devil

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,960
It was

129
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,520
Gentle Devil

130
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
This is super famous
Oh yeah this

131
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,440
Up until this song, Candies dressed rather conservatively,

132
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,000
After this song, they wore black fishnet tights and amazing outfits like that

133
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,520
I remember very well

134
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,040
Like "God damn what is this"

135
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,120
It was so arousing!

136
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,560
Black fishnets

137
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,120
How old was DownTown back then?

138
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,440
Like 14

139
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,880
Oh the perfect age

140
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,320
They went ALL the way up

141
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,840
It was shocking at the time

142
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,960
It was impactful

143
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,200
I see it was something totally different

144
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:37,080
Pink Lady came after this y'know. Nobody else came out in outfits like this.

145
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,320
Yeah

146
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,400
If it wasn't for this Pink Lady might not have been a thing

147
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,480
Yeah perhaps

148
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,880
This certainly was super arousing

149
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,080
The song, but also the outfits

150
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,920
Wasn't there like frilly thing here too

151
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,880
There was, like paper lanterns

152
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,660
Like some lace thing

153
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,660
Yes yes yes

154
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,440
Paper lanterns?

155
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,360
It was like puffy up here

156
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,800
I remember that very well actually,
They would shake their hips when dancing

157
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
Yes yes

158
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,680
Can I continue on this?

159
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,960
Yes go ahead

160
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,400
This

161
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,100
It would've been better if we weren't in a tunnel. Bad timing.

162
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,280
You're right

163
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,880
So, Hamada was aroused by "Gentle Devil" just earlier right?

164
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,000
For me it was Iyo-chan's "TV no Kuni Kara Kira Kira"

165
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:46,000
Mastumoto Iyo - Sparkling in the Land of TV

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,640
I was in year 2 of middle school,

167
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,240
Was this that kind of song?

168
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,840
The start,

169
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,840
The "Ne~" part

170
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,520
TS: "Hey, Is it alright to feel this way?

171
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,520
That part right?
"Ne~ konna no kanji te ii no?"

172
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,120
"Konna no..." I forgot the lyrics though

173
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,640
What?! Enough

174
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,560
Why did you even bring it up then

175
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,840
Wasn't that the important part

176
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,200
I don't know anything after "Kanji te ii no"

177
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,280
But the bit that goes "Ne~ something something"

178
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:10,290
The "Ne~" part,
I repeated and listened to that so many times

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,400
Why the hell

180
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,760
Oh that part aroused you?
Yeah it aroused me

181
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,560
I recorded that part and listened to it so many times

182
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,040
"Ne~?"  "Ne~!"
"Ahn Ahn~?"  "Ahn Ahn~!"

183
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,120
It is a good song

184
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,240
What the hell man

185
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:33,600
This one, I think Hamada and Endo might relate to it

186
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,720
Some people might find it an odd choice for me

187
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,800
What is this?

188
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
Ahh, yes yes yes

189
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,800
No idea

190
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,280
Endo you don't know it?

191
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,160
Not yet

192
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,400
Eh? Endo can't tell huh

193
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,840
Oh I got it!

194
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,160
So nostalgic

195
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,200
It's the Chunichi Dragon's song

196
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,080
Yes, "Burn Dragons!"

197
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:15,960
Bandou Eiji - Burn Dragons!

198
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,360
This one,

199
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,560
Is this Bandou-san?

200
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,400
Yes it's Bandou-san

201
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,600
"Fight Dragons! Burn Dragons!"

202
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:30,080
People in Osaka from a young age, they wear either a Giant's cap, even in Osaka,

203
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,280
Or a Hanshin's cap

204
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,120
Nobody wears caps from any other team

205
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,240
This guy was the only person wearing a Chunichi hat

206
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,480
Why? Why?

207
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,560
Wow really?

208
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,960
Did you like Chunichi at the time?

209
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,440
No, I'm not really sure why,

210
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,120
The only time I went to a shopping street with my dad,

211
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,040
My dad for some reason bought it for me

212
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,920
There were 12 other hats,

213
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,320
And just going by the colours, I said "this one" and got him to buy me a Chunichi hat

214
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,760
I have no memories about Chunichi at all!!

215
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,480
Everyone supported Kyojin

216
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,640
Yeah at the time

217
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,900
And some Hankyu fans

218
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,920
And I wasn't interested in baseball in the first place

219
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,200
So I decided to become a Chunichi fan after that

220
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,240
And everyone else were fans of other teams, mostly Kyojin

221
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,000
So I forcefully became a fan

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,480
I was probably hoping that they might win someday

223
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,720
And after I forcefully became a fan they went and won

224
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,400
So there was nothing to hope for anymore...

225
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,540
And they're from Nagoya after all,

226
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,400
I still can't get excited about them

227
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,280
But now that I think about that was when I was most passionate about pro baseball

228
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,000
I knew all the players at the time

229
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,120
There was a time when they were popular

230
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,200
Tanaka?

231
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,240
Yesss

232
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,920
Since we're driving, I think this one might be perfect

233
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,000
Excuse me, the first song on here please

234
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,920
Yes, since we're driving, it's main theme of 007

235
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:33,030
007 Main Theme

236
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,960
This is, back in 5th year of elementary school,

237
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,470
I decided to go watch a movie by myself

238
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,640
Wow that's amazing

239
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,160
A 5th year going to the movies using his own money,

240
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,680
And my older cousin gave me some Levis,

241
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:56,320
500 series or something I'm not sure,
But I wore my Levis, and went to all the way to Umeda

242
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,360
And I was going to watch a 007 movie

243
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:09,440
I thought in 5th grade, wearing Levis and going to watch a 007 movie by myself was so mature

244
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,600
After the movie, on the way back, in Umeda I was mugged by some highschool students!

245
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,560
I was super scared!

246
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,200
Tanaka man... your stories are so depressing. Every time.

247
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,120
I ran all the way to the Takarazu line

248
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,880
And I bet the way you ran was gross too

249
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,320
I was thinking  "I'm such a grown up",

250
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah you completed the mission,

251
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,720
I completed the mission, but...

252
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,240
I got mugged a lot back then

253
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,600
Yeah

254
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,960
Yeah it happened so often

255
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,640
I was mugged a lot in Amagasaki

256
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,640
TN: Amagasaki is DownTown's home town

257
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,960
Once you cross that side, you enter Ama right?

258
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,760
As soon as I crossed over I was terrified

259
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,120
Ama was scary?

260
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,890
Yeah for real. You can only buy bad clothes in Amagasaki

261
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,400
That's not true

262
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,040
It's all in Ama?

263
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,240
There was a place called Akadama (clothes shop)

264
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,720
I also went to Akadama during high school

265
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,440
There were some weird unknown brands there

266
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,720
Yankees liked to gather there

267
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,760
Did you ever go to 100 Yen City?

268
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,000
100 Yen City too

269
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,400
Then I'll go too, this song is also from then. The first song please

270
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Let's go with the school theme

271
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,920
What's this?

272
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,400
Between Earth and Sky

273
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,840
I really like this song

274
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:08,790
Matsuyama Chiharu - Between Earth and Sky

275
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:04,760
In 3rd year of highschool I went to a boarding school,

276
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,160
It was a very strict school

277
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,100
Whenever ANYTHING happened they made us all sing this song

278
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,800
Is this really a song for group singing?

279
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,160
Exactly!

280
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,000
Eh what's wiuth that?

281
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,000
Whenever ANY incident happened they made us all sing this song

282
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,520
Isn't this supposed to be a moving song?

283
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,920
Yeah

284
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,920
If someone got in a fight or caused an incident

285
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,840
Or if they told us "You guys have bad attitudes"

286
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,600
Whenever ANYTHING happened in the end we all had to sing this song

287
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,640
It's not that kind of song!

288
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,720
Maybe to teach you something-

289
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,200
Like maybe to encourage you

290
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,560
Like "Do better!"

291
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,120
So basically just "Do better"

292
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,240
Yes yes yes

293
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,520
I really got into these lyrics

294
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,160
It was a super strict dorm right?

295
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,120
I don't think places like that can exist anymore

296
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:17,560
There was 1 day where you could go home but had to come back right away. And instead of doing that,

297
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,800
I called Matsumoto, I told him "bring some money"

298
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,200
He got money the moeny and met me at Tsuruhashi

299
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,480
And we ran away together, not going back to school

300
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,000
Matsumoto-san, you ran away too?

301
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,400
Matsumoto was the assistant

302
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,520
I got the money, and met him at the gate

303
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,340
I got him to buy me Udon

304
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,560
It was just us 2, slurping like madmen,

305
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,880
There was one guy just staring at us the entire time

306
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:58,160
"How hard can they slurp?!"
"Humans can slurp like this?!"

307
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,480
Eat until you drop

308
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,720
Yeah, when it's some food you like

309
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,000
That's an amazing memory

310
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,520
Amazing

311
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,640
Then I'll go with the second song here

312
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,120
What is this?

313
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,720
Oh right, this is Missing right?

314
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,360
Yes, as Hosei-san just said

315
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:28,390
Kubota Toshinobu - Missing

316
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:24,480
When we were kids, and we would go to karaoke after school

317
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,600
And we called over the girls we knew

318
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,000
This is my, "lulling a woman" song

319
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,200
Oh you'd sing this

320
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, to lull them?

321
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,840
You really are an idiot aren't you?

322
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,360
No no no
When my turn would come up,

323
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:50,400
It's not like this would be the first song, we would sing other stuff to get excited,

324
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,960
After they're warmed up

325
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,280
And after they're all warmed up,

326
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:03,520
And right before it was time to leave, I would put this song in,

327
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:10,120
I'd sing this song, and take them home...basically

328
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,940
This guy is an idiot!

329
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,680
An idiot!

330
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,860
I wonder what kind of girl you can bring home by singing this song

331
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,240
Wow

332
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,000
I listened to this song so much

333
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,060
I did. All the women just like swooned

334
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,160
Idiot

335
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,920
Nice and smooth

336
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:37,600
And even my seniors wouldn't mind, some of them liked this song and they would swoon too

337
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,960
Can you sing just the hook for us?

338
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,960
I LOVE YOU even if it's not possible

339
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,000
Even though you forgot about me

340
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,360
I'd sing this, and you guys are swooing right?

341
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,680
But, yeah - No I'm not swooning

342
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,520
Let's go with this!

343
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,840
Let's go with this!

344
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,600
Ahhh this is nostalgic

345
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,680
I think only Hamada will know this one

346
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,400
I don't know this

347
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,840
It was a huge hit in Kansai though

348
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,720
Ah! This is "Kawachi no Ossan no Uta"

349
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,480
I think I've heard this before

350
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,640
Who's singing this?

351
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,280
Miss Hanako

352
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:53,340
Miss Hanako - A Kawachi old man's song

353
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,880
Oh right

354
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,880
This,

355
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,720
This one

356
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,360
This was super hilarious, basically

357
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,120
Basically, like that story earlier,

358
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,640
I was dozing off, listening to the radio with headphones,

359
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,920
When this song came on for the first time,
It was so funny, I couldn't sleep!

360
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,200
"What the hell is a Kawachi old man's song?!"

361
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,640
I couldn't hold it in

362
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,880
It was just so funny,

363
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,120
And our house was super small too,

364
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,800
And my older brother and my dad were sleeping nearby,

365
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,200
I couldn't laugh, I was trying so hard to hold it in,

366
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,200
It was just too much! Like this "My wife, that bitch" bit

367
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,240
This part

368
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,660
TN: The singer is using "ware" which is a rude way of referring to someone. I think, please correct this translation in the comments if it is incorrect

369
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,660
His wife

370
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,880
"He said bitch?!"

371
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,720
He called his wife a bitch! Even though the song is nice

372
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,320
Trying to hold my laughter in...

373
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,280
It was super difficult

374
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,400
1 hour since the drive has started
Yamasaki finally makes his move!

375
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,160
Then can I go, excuse me. The build up took too long you guys

376
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,600
Oh it's finally time?

377
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,520
We took too long?

378
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,760
Too damn long

379
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,840
Let's stick this landing,

380
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,320
Right, you weren't able to do it last time right?

381
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,680
You wanted to do this last time right?

382
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,160
Yes yes indeed

383
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,040
Now is just right

384
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,960
Counting on you!

385
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,640
Here I go

386
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,360
After this, we finally see Yamasaki's killer ending!

387
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,720
It's been a while since Yamasaki-san got off,

388
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,360
Yes it has

389
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,760
According to Yamasaki-san,

390
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,320
"This is the actual nostalgic song I want to present"

391
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,920
He wants to present it in a different way

392
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,000
So it's not simply putting the song on?

393
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,000
A more grandiose presentation

394
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,760
That's what I've heard

395
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,680
Oh?

396
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:33,300
Ishi Akemi - Cha-Cha-Cha

397
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,290
BEEP

398
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,290
They're getting angry

399
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,680
Oh really?

400
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,080
They're angry

401
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,220
Man...

402
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,840
Even though he was smiling, he looked so somber at the end

403
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,440
I just couldn't laugh

404
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,080
When it gets that bad

405
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,320
I saw his panicked face. Absolutely hopeless.

406
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:42,960
