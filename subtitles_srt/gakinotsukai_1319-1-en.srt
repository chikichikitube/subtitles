00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,350
Usually when you talk about
scary stories in tv shows like this

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,610
Something weird has to happen     - Right

It's like a rule

13
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,750
But this time nothing will happen if we joke around

14
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,250
We won't joke around

15
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,920
We'll just listen to our guests

00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,620
That's it

17
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,660
That's right

18
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,290
It's not going to be a fun corner

00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:44,420

26
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,960
World Ghost Stories Summit 2016: curtain-raise

27
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,820
Tonight, the 2016 World Ghost Stories Summit will be held

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,020
I'd like to call here our first guest from Switzerland

29
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,750
Please!

30
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,800
Our representative from Switzerland is miss Christine Haruka

31
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,300
Haruka Christine

32
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,410
Switzerland                   representative

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,410
Haruka Christine

34
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,070
Please

35
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:22,290
Switzerland

36
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,810
Switzerland, the land of historical fine arts and Alps

37
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,040
How is the scary story from this country going be?

38
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,410
When you're ready, miss Haruka

39
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,450
What I'm about to tell you

40
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,090
Is a story about a church
on a certain Swiss town

41
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,630
There was a big, big
clock tower in this church

42
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,500
And beneath it

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,130
Lied the remains

44
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,100
Of the XIV century mayor of the town

45
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,470
Said to be killed by a deadly poison

46
00:01:51,050 --> 00:03:39,760
The mayor under the tower

47
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,960
Time passed, and in the XX century

48
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,410
A group of scientists

49
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,120
Unearthed the mayor's corpse

50
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,020
In order to perform an autopsy

51
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,560
The examination went on for roughly one week

52
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,190
But when they were about to bury his bones back

53
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,430
For some reason

54
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,630
The skull was nowhere to be found

55
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,700
In the end, they decided

56
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,680
To deposit the corpse as it was, without the skull

57
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,280
Then, few weeks later,

58
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,780
Near the clock tower

59
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,290
Two siblings were playing soccer together

60
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,790
At one point, the ball started rolling away

61
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,930
Until it reached a grassy spot

62
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,100
Right under the clock tower

63
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,170
And in that grassy spot...

64
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,870
There was a man on all fours

65
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,870
In desperate search for something

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,980
When the big brother hurried up to get the ball back

67
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,750
The figure of that man...

68
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,850
Already disappeared

69
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,720
The brother, who found it eerie,

70
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
Hurried up and picked the ball up

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,880
And quickly run back to his sister

72
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,860
But then, she noticed something

73
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,760
And shouted as if in pure agony:

74
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,440
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,770
The brother, surprised,

76
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,870
Looked down to the soccer ball he was holding

77
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,570
And then...

78
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,310
He realized...

79
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,080
The ball have turned...

80
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,850
...Into an old-looking skull

81
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,560
Is this... famous in Switzerland?

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,130
Yes, it's one of the most famous

83
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,630
To be honest, by the moment the soccer ball came in

84
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,730
I thought myself, "that must be the skull"

85
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,160
It kinda leaked out

86
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,850
I thought

87
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,200
It may change to a different path from there

88
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,300
Me too, I was like "it just can't be that!"

89
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,970
But it was      - Just as we pictured it

90
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,410
Yeah, just like that

Our next entry for the 2016 World Ghost Story Summit

104
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,960
Is a scary story from Congo

105
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,740
Our representative for the Democratic Republic of Congo is Mr. Muwete Muluaka

106
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,910
Muwete Muluaka

107
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,080
Democratic Republic of Congo representative

108
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,080
Muwete Muluaka

109
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,780
Congo, the heart of Africa's wonderful landscapes

110
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:47,730
Democratic Republic of Congo

111
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,220
What kind of scary stories are told in this country?

112
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,060
In a certain village in Congo

113
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,860
There was a young man called Pier Thunkai

114
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,500
note: I don't know its actual transcription. It's "pieerutuukai" in katakana.

115
00:04:59,670 --> 00:07:37,860
Pier Thunkai

116
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,670
One day, this young man

117
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,670
Wasn't home all day

118
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,510
And while he was away

119
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,910
All of his property were stolen

120
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,710
And so he started asking the villagers

121
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,030
"Who stole all the things I had?"

122
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,730
While going around from house to house

123
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,490
None of the villagers listened to him, though

124
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,130
But unluckily for him

125
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,930
At that moment, Pier Thunkai

126
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,850
Accidentally slipped

127
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,710
And fell down from a cliff

128
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,380
note: he mistakenly says "date" instead of "gake" (cliff)

129
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,810
And so, Pier Thunkai went missing

130
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,220
Later on, when it was night

131
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,750
A monster showed up in the village

132
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,590
That monster had a single eye,

133
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,440
A single leg,

134
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,830
And a single hand

135
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,530
Every single part of his body

136
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,870
Was only one of a pair

137
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,400
And so, that monster

138
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,010
Started asking the villagers

139
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,810
"Where are all the things I had?"

140
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,710
He started going from house to house

141
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,720
Killing every villager he met

142
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,120
The villagers shouted "please, don't kill anybody else!"

143
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:42,530
And they started to chant
a prayer to calm Pier Thunkai's anger

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,630
That song was like this:

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,940
And it repeats

146
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,860
But that song didn't reach him at all

147
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,300
Pier Thunkai just kept on killing each villager

148
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,440
Until there was none of them left

149
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,040
In Congo, to this day...

150
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,180
We say "if you steal, Pier Thunkai will come for you!"

151
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,680
And it came to be a common phrase

152
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,890
What kind of story is that?

153
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,790
It's Pier Thunkai's story

154
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,260
How are Pier Thunkai and the halved monster related?

155
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,070
It's the same

156
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,970
Pier Thunkai himself became the monster

157
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,270
He did?      - He transformed into the monster

158
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,270
It came out so suddenly

159
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,410
Yeah it was sudden

160
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,240
But almost everyone of us got that,
like Cocorico and Yamazaki-san

161
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,980
Yeah we did       - I got that

162
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,440
Me too halfway

163
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,320
I thought I'd better off stop following it

164
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,490
I mean, I can't even remember
the main character's name

165
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,210
Pier Thunkai, right?        - Yes

166
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,390
So, he fell down a cliff
- Yeah, he fell down

167
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,660
And revived as a monster

168
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,070
He didn't fell down a cliff (gake)      - Huh?!

169
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,900
He fell down a gliff (date)

170
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,600
Of course he meant "cliff"

171
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,730
Come on, get it

172
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,000
Next up is a scary story from Brazil

173
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,000
Marzia

174
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:40,180
Brazil representative

175
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,180
Marzia

176
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,480
So, our representative for Brazil is miss Marzia

177
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,850
Pleased to meet you       - Same here

178
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,120
It's a pleasure

179
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,120
Whenever you're ready

180
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,590
The story I'm about to tell you

181
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,230
Is about an experience I really had
in Brazil when I was 14 years old

182
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,000
I was still very young

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,870
And I was trying to call
for a ghost, just for fun

184
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,880
In short, I was doing something
like the japanese "kokkuri-san"

185
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,880
note: a divination game similar to the western ouija board

186
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,350
On the table, I've placed

187
00:09:13,080 --> 00:11:25,960
The summoned spirit

188
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,750
Two cards labeled with "no" and "yes"

189
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,490
Then I've light up two candles

190
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,330
And planned to ask the ghost some questions

191
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,090
So it would answer, that's it

192
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,530
And so, I started the ritual

193
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,830
But then suddenly

194
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,840
The wind started to blow

195
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,810
And when I opened my eyes

196
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,870
Before me

197
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,680
There was a blond kid

198
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,810
So I asked him

199
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,950
"Who are you?"

200
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,720
And he said

201
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,090
"I'm Paolo"

202
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,660
"I died in an accident"

203
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,060
"And I don't have any friends,
so why don't you play with me?"

204
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,600
That was the first time I saw
a real ghost right before me

205
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,040
So I got really scared

206
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,840
So I told Paolo

207
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,740
"You're not in this world anymore"

208
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,650
"You shouldn't be here" - I desperately told him

209
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,450
And so he

210
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,950
Quietly pointed his index towards the "no" card

211
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,830
I gradually became even more terrified

212
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,130
And, scared, I told him "go home"

213
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,130
"Please, just go back home!"

214
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,840
And yet

215
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,140
He just kept on pointing the "no" card

216
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,740
So i took the cards and the candles

217
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
On the table and took them away

218
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,580
And cleaned everything up

219
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,780
And while shutting both my eyes and ears

220
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,960
"Go away! Go Away! Vá embora! Vá embora!"

221
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,560
I just kept on shouting this

222
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,590
And after some time

223
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,000
He disappeared into thin air

224
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,100
But...

225
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,340
On the table, there was a single tarot card left

226
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,970
When I looked at that tarot card...

227
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,410
I realized its meaning...

228
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,150
...was "friendship"

229
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,020
Paolo...

230
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,760
So, you actually experienced this?

231
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,120
I was around 14 years old      - 14 years old...

232
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,840
I've always been kind of sensitive to ghost sighting

233
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,200
They're always sticking close to me

234
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,290
And always pop out, like, a lot of them

235
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,780
So there's a chance it could stick close to us?

236
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,540
It could happen, yes

237
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,410
Will it be Paolo?

238
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,040
If you call him, he may come but---

239
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,510
Even tigers could come

240
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,180
A tiger?

241
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,150
It actually happened I was once possessed by a tiger

242
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,450
It's not something to laugh about!

243
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,350
I'm not trying to sound funny

244
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,890
This too was from that time,
I was like 15 years old

245
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,060
And what happened?

246
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,630
A tiger

247
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,200
And what happened?

248
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,660
It bit me

249
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,500
It bit you?      - It did

250
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,330
It bit you?      - Yes, on the neck

251
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,070
It's scary, huhh

252
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,000
What is it?

253
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,920
But it would be scary even if it wasn't a ghost

254
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,800
No way!

255
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,750
I mean, even if a non-ghost tiger would bite you...

256
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,350
Next up for the World Scary Stories Summit

257
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,490
It's a story from our italian dandy

258
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,790
Girolamo Panzetta

259
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:53,680
Italy                   representative

260
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,260
So, our representative for Italy is mr. Girolamo Panzetta

261
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:53,680
Girolamo Panzetta

262
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,530
Please, take a seat

263
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,930
When you're ready, Girolamo

264
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,930
Please

265
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,380
My story is... of course, happened in Italy

266
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,220
It was... from when I was around 20 years old

267
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,490
I wanted to make a new product

268
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,820
A perfume

269
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,930
So, the city of perfumes is in France

270
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,690
On the southern side of it

271
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,760
In Provence

272
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,060
It's a place called Grasse

273
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,370
In that place there are a lot of small factories

274
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,970
And you can sort of create your own perfume there

275
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,910
But the town I was in was Naples

276
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,710
So I had to go from Naples to Genova

277
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,010
By train

278
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,810
And from Genova

279
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,850
I had to take a car and travel along the coast

280
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,850
And then I had to get inside a mountain road

281
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,190
Just when I entered this mountain road

282
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,790
There was a small station, and before it

283
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,290
There was a little girl

284
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,730
She was hitch-hiking, doing the autostop

285
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,270
She was wearing a white dress,
her shoes were white too

286
00:13:57,880 --> 00:15:28,930
The white girl

287
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,100
She had a big bag, like a Chanel bag

288
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,940
And her skin was pale white too

289
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,640
I asked her where she was headed to

290
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,750
And it was exactly the same
town I was headed to, Grasse

291
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,750
As soon as she got inside my car

292
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,620
I noticed that her smell was really similar

293
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,530
To the perfume I wanted to create myself

294
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,760
I thought "that must be fate"

295
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,760
So, we got in the car and
went running through the mountain road

296
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,900
But the girl kept on saying
"take it easy, go slower"

297
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,740
You know there are lots of cabins here

298
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,650
We were going straight
but then she was like

299
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,880
"Stop!"

300
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,680
So I stepped on the brake

301
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,180
I was surprised

302
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,410
When I turned towards her

303
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,620
She was gone

304
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,290
I was confused, but when I looked ahead

305
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,990
Right before the cabin I noticed there were the remains

306
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,790
Of an incident

307
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,530
There were victims

308
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,060
She told me to stop and so I did

309
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,230
I wasn't involved in that incident

310
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,690
So, I had goosebumps

311
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,690
And when I looked over

312
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,440
The place lit by the lights

313
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,940
Which was on the roadside

314
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,540
I noticed there were lots of flowers

315
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,250
And beside them

316
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,990
There were pictures of those
who died in such incident

317
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,820
And one of them

318
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,150
Was the girl who was with me

319
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,860
That was my story

320
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,830
There are similar japanese stories      - Yeah

321
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,120
It was kinda japanese-styled     - It was, yes

322
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,000
Its style was similar

323
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,000
Was this your experience?

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,970
It was      - A real experience? Woah...

325
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,500
The most amazing thing about this story

326
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Is the fact it involved the smell

327
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,380
It was stylish

328
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,640
I know, right?

329
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,080
It's kinda... italian

330
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,850
I mean, the whole episode

331
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,200
I mean, it was about a perfume

332
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,660
With that on mind, he may be lying, you know

333
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,450
It's not--- I mean, I always
get that when I tell this

334
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,590
Even his horror stories are fashionable

335
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,590
Yeah, sort of

336
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,990
You know, that girl had a name

337
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,000
Which was it?

338
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,550
It was Paolo

339
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,300
This was a lie, sorry

340
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,100
See?

341
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,470
He did it right in front of us

342
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,470
It was a joke, uh...

343
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,780
He really loves to say such hard-to-get jokes

344
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,780
"Hard to get"...

345
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,010
I don't know when he's joking!
- I got it thanks to Hamada

346
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,350
Coming next

347
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,380
A scary story from Nigeria, Africa

348
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,560
Our representative from Nigeria is mr Bobby Ologun

349
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,900
Bobby Ologun

350
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,940
Nigeria representative

351
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,940
Bobby Ologun

352
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,290
Please

353
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:46,410
Nigeria

354
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,900
What will be the scary story from Nigeria,

355
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,970
A place where believe
in black magic to this day?

356
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,870
This is...

357
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,210
A story I heard from my mama

358
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,710
It's a cursed tale

359
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,050
Of a village

360
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,950
Still existing to this day

361
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,120
In this village, from old times

362
00:17:04,560 --> 00:19:24,640
The cursed village

363
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
There was a food's name

364
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,760
You couldn't say out loud

365
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,160
Because by saying its name

366
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,460
They said

367
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,170
A 2-headed 6-legged huge monster

368
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,710
Called [some nigerian name]

369
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,710
Would surely shows itself

370
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,180
It's a gigantic boar

371
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,680
A boar?

372
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,910
The legend says

373
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,180
That if it shows up,
someone from the village

374
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,120
Will die from a mysterious
death within 7 days

375
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,460
The village still can't say

376
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,630
The name of this food to this day

377
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,130
But then, one day...

378
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,870
A certain group of magicians

379
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,600
Tried to solve this mystery

380
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,940
And so they came to the village

381
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,640
To put an end to the curse

382
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,450
In order to solve this mystery

383
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,130
They danced... exorcism dance
all over the village

384
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,500
They started to dance

385
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,930
Err...

386
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:12,650
This...

387
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,290
While saying that forbidden name

388
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,790
But each time they said it

389
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:24,800
The 2-headed, 6-legged
[monster name] appeared

390
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,770
Each time he shouted

391
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,370
A mysterious death will occur

392
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,720
One day passed

393
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,580
And then people died

394
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,580
After two days

395
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,450
Again, 10 other people died

396
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,690
When six days passed

397
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,320
The 200 magicians

398
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,690
Were reduced to 7

399
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,930
And so, the people from the village

400
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,180
Became frightened

401
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,100
And expelled the
remaining 7 magicians

402
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,670
From then on

403
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,030
If someone...

404
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,500
...Would end up
entering this village

405
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,210
They would surely be
caught by the villagers

406
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,380
And they would
beat them repeatedly

407
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,110
Before they would
say that food's name

408
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,180
The name of that food

409
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,520
...Was "inya"

410
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,180
note: "inya" is based off what I could hear. Not sure about its actual name.

411
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,260
[yoruba language]

412
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,640
The end

413
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,600
What the heck?

414
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Sorry but...

415
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,560
I'm not sure I got it

416
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,630
Its second half was horrible

417
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,470
I have no idea what it was about

418
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,000
I listened to it though

419
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,550
He sounded more like an old lady
from Okinawa on the second half

420
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,980
I didn't understand anything!

421
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,980
Why?

422
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,580
In this village

423
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,880
There's a food
name you can't say

424
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,480
Yeah, that part is clear

425
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,250
By the moment you say it

426
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,300
The [monster name] will
emerge from the ground!

427
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,770
That's the first time we heard "ground"!

428
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,000
But it's obvious!

429
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,000
It's not!!

430
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,000
It's not!!

431
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,570
It's how it goes for this story
- It wasn't obvious

432
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,030
Which food is it?

433
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,860
It's inya

434
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,430
What?

435
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,800
Inya

436
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,570
What is it?

437
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,630
Inya!

438
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,470
What's that?

439
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,240
Inya
- Inya?    - Inya..?

440
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,100
Inya

441
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,940
What is it?

442
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,650
It's inya!!

443
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,110
Yeah but what?
- We got that, what is it?

444
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,400
What is it like?   - What kind of food is it?

445
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,150
What kind of food is it?
- It's inya!!

446
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,450
But what is an "inya"?
- Explain us!

447
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,850
It's food
- Is it a fruit?

448
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,850
Is it a fruit?

449
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,090
Is it something like a potato?

450
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,530
It's like a mochi made from sweet potatoes

451
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,030
So you knew it!

452
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,030
So you knew it!

453
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,730
Just say it if you know it!

454
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,800
Just say that

455
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,030
Why didn't you say that?

456
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,390
Is it good?

457
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,070
Everyone in my country eats it

458
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,780
And how do you eat it?

459
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,780
With tomatoes

460
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,440
You stuff em all inside a roasted capybara

461
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,010
And then you gulp it down

462
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,460
That's an impressive food!

463
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,460
That's incredible!
- It is

464
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,820
Capybara!?

465
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,490
That's not normal at all!

466
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,890
That's not ok!

467
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,460
It's the worst!
- It's not!

468
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,370
Brazil

469
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,370

Italy

471
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,370
Nigeria

472
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,370
Pier Thunkai

473
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,370
Swiss

474
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,370
The Cursed Village

475
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,370
The Mayor Under the Tower

476
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,370

477
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,370

00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:09,260
With all the 5 of them, our scary stories meeting is over

479
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,130
So guys, with this we're done

481
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,170
What now?

482
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,000
Encore

483
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,000
Tell the same scary story in your native language

484
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,700
Are we having our usual encore in native language?

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,380
Ask Bobby?

491
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,610
Shall we ask him?

492
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,380
For real?

493
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,680
Yeah, for the time being

494
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,720
For the time being

495
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,560

The cursed village

505
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:58,310
note: I'm going to translate only the japanese bits of it

506
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,130
..."norowareta" (cursed)

507
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,250
Huh?

508
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,250
Huh?

509
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,650
Is it in japanese now?

510
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,630
He totally ignored us

511
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,390
...Tamashii (soul)

512
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,930
He said "tamashii"
- He clearly said it

Or make a donation on my ko-fi page: ko-fi.com/shionnotsukai

517
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,070
It felt so different to me

518
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
ko-fi.com/shionnotsukai

519
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,070
There were some japanese words in it

520
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
ko-fi.com/shionnotsukai

521
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,410
That's mainly because

522
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,340
I couldn't translate what I said in japanese in yoruba

523
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
ko-fi.com/shionnotsukai

524
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,670
But it's your native language!

525
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,950
I speak in yoruba just with my mom

526
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
ko-fi.com/shionnotsukai

527
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,980
Kids nowadays don't speak it at all

528
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
ko-fi.com/shionnotsukai

529
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,790
But...
- Has your mother ever been in Japan?

530
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,950
She's here now

531
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,390
So you're taking in yoruba now!

532
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,890
You are speaking it!
- How irritating!

533
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,600
His mom...

534
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,160
Never heard of such a well timed thing before

535
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,870
I mean, she's here now

536
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,760
What the heck!

537
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,170
Why is she here now?

538
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,040
She...

539
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,640
She came to see her nephews
