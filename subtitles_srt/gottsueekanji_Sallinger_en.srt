SALLINGER

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,920
Greetings, everyone

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,090
Hello

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,520
Well, my dream has finally come true with the Sallinger

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,020
And now you can enjoy it, too

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,720
I'm your instructor,

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,950
Harita

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,670
Pleased to meet you all

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,620
Are you an instructor?

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,570
Let me know if you're like,

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,740
"Hey, I've done this before!!"

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,670
Don't be shy and let me know right away

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,440
Anyone?

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,700
So, this is new for all of you

16
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,370
You're right

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,440
Since all of you are rookies at this,

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,390
I understand if you're completely lost

19
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,890
But let me first start by taking your lunch orders

20
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,590
Excuse us

21
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,550
What do you want?

22
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,490
How about some instructions?

23
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,270
Well, I need to take the orders first

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,570
OK, beef or chicken?

25
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,770
Do you want Beef or Chicken for lunch?!!

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll have chicken

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,700
I got it, chicken

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,700
Me too

29
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,940
I'll do beef then

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,040
Beef, got it

31
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,520
Coffee with that?

32
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,590
Do you want a coffee with your lunch?!

33
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,420
I'll have a coffee

34
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,220
I got it

35
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,750
Can I get an iced tea instead?

36
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,420
Let me see...

37
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,790
No, not today

38
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,520
I'll just have regular tea then

39
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,990
Maybe an iced coffee?

40
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,970
OK, that's enough

41
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,720
That's enough order-taking

42
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,390
No time for this nonsense

43
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,140
So here's the Auto Sallinger

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,070
And I'm sure you want to try it out

45
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,340
Tell yourself just how much you want

46
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,840
To ride the Sallinger, OK?

47
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,120
Of course, you'll see some fish around

48
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,740
Which one of you is like,

49
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,220
"Yeah, I already have a fish as my buddy!"

50
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,990
Anyone?

51
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,820
No, none of us

52
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,690
Then please tell me!

53
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,890
Tell me that none of your friends are fish!

54
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,240
I need to know!

55
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,070
I'm sure you have questions about this ride

56
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,000
I'd be glad to answer them right now

57
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,500
Any question

58
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,740
Anything to prevent you from danger

59
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,240
I have one

60
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,770
How long until we're good enough to ride this?

61
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,940
Well...

62
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,290
It all depends on how honest you are

63
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,750
As long as you're true to yourself,

64
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,720
You can ride this

65
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,650
Of course, the seaweed will be approaching you

66
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,190
Numerous times

67
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,790
Got that?

68
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,790
Of course, the seaweed will see you from afar!

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,900
What'd you want, moron?!

70
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,700
Please get that through your head!

71
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,000
What else?!

72
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,300
I got one

73
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,840
Seeing that everyone else is a guy,

74
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,720
I'm wondering if I can ride this

75
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,520
Listen,

76
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,140
Women riders...

77
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,020
There's been some woman riders in the past

78
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,190
And it's because of women riders,

79
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,750
that this Sallinger exists here today

80
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,890
Please remember that

81
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,990
Here's one more thing

82
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,690
Don't ever think

83
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,340
your parents will be in good health forever

84
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,170
I've heard that one before

85
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,700
It's only natural

86
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,540
that your mother and father will go before you!

87
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,620
And that is the truth!

88
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,720
Don't you ever forget that!!

89
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,820
What're you laughing at?

90
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,120
Will you cut that out, please?

91
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,750
That was uncalled for

92
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,250
Why did you get violent with her?

93
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,290
Don't laugh at it

94
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,220
Don't be laughing

95
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,790
You're laughing, too

96
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,350
The Instructor finds some things amusing, too!!

97
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,100
Just keep your hands to yourself

98
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,270
Are we good now?

99
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
Let's get to the real lesson

100
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,770
Can we start?

101
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,440
Before I begin

102
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,720
Remember to keep your cool, OK?

103
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,720
So here's the Auto Sallinger

104
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,820
Therer are many ways to ride this

105
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,520
For instance, for womens riders,

106
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,650
the Air Plasma needs to be in this particular position

107
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,690
See?

108
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,220
And for male riders,

109
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,770
Place one of the Air Plasmas like so

110
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,290
Please remember that rule, OK?

111
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,970
With that having been said...

112
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,890
I didn't realize it can live in such shallow water

113
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,390
What did you say, asshole?

114
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,220
What did you just say?

115
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,090
Well...

116
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,690
So they can live in shallow water?

117
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,290
What do you mean?

118
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,920
I mean the water only comes up to here

119
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,370
Go home, moron!

120
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,970
I'm sorry

121
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,370
But why me?

122
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,100
Let's move on

123
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,870
I'm just going to have you ride it

124
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,520
Please don't get hurt

125
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,690
I don't need to be in trouble

126
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,490
What?

127
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,350
Why're you so quiet all of a sudden?

128
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,920
Well, we're focused on the lesson

129
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,120
Please ask questions, OK?

130
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,800
Instructor,

131
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,700
this just broke off

132
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,440
That scared me

133
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,120
What the hell, you morons?!

134
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,950
We didn't do anything wrong

135
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,720
But you just made a complete ass out of yourself

136
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,470
And you were scared, too

137
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,720
Go home, moron

138
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,590
Go home!

139
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,570
You go home now!

140
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,040
Why am I going home?

141
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,140
I paid for this

142
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,400
Listen

143
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,970
Please watch yourself

144
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,540
He's taking it out on him

145
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,320
So...

146
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,450
Who's first?

147
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,650
Well, let's go over the features then

148
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,970
What do you want to know first?

149
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,190
What's the lever for?

150
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,440
This is the "EXMENT LEVER"

151
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,340
This side is for EXMENT

152
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,000
Here's NON-EXMENT

153
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,800
Remember that, please

154
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,100
OK, so what does that do?

155
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,400
What do you mean?

156
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,620
What do you control with that?

157
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,170
What're you talking about?

158
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,770
What happens when you turn that on?

159
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,220
Of course, it becomes EXMENT

160
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,750
As a novice rider...

161
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,450
Just know that it should always
be in the NON-EXMENT position

162
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,320
Anything else?

163
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,970
What's that ring at the end?

164
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,370
That's called the "PILER"

165
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,040
Please don't touch that

166
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,670
or you'll get electrocuted

167
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,570
Serious?

168
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,340
About 2,000,000 volts of current runs through there

169
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,140
It's near the water?

170
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,000
That's really dangerous

171
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,170
Big chance we'll get electrocuted

172
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,120
And here...

173
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,820
Here's the double-fin

174
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,420
And here...

175
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,150
We don't need this one right now!

176
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,140
Who the hell do you think you are

177
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,670
I told you to go home, asshole

178
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,400
What are you talking about?

179
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,340
I'm going then

180
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,370
You got all that?

181
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,970
Anything else?

182
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,070
Anyone?

183
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,300
No, I don't think so

184
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,120
Well then, shall we?

185
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Get down and dirty?!

186
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,020
Let's get going

187
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,120
C'mon, get on it!

188
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,150
You, go

189
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,420
I'm going first?

190
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,320
Hop on it

191
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Let's go

192
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,790
Get it right

193
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,340
Don't forget to say bye

194
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,400
You need to say a proper farewell

195
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,670
I'll catch you guys later

196
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,540
No, that's not it

197
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,040
Let's get down and dirty!?

198
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,470
Let's get down and dirty!?

199
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,720
Alright then

200
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,340
What's your name?

201
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,420
I'm Hamada

202
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,520
OK everyone,

203
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,950
watch as your friend demonstrates

204
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,590
Hop on it, Hamada-san

205
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,520
Like this?

206
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,150
Good luck

207
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,690
Now, give me your Fighting Pose

208
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,970
Fighting Pose?

209
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,920
Pighting Pose?

210
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,840
Go ahead and position these any way you like

211
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,170
That's your move, huh?

212
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,170
Is that good for you?

213
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,000
Then, here's my move

214
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,240
OK, then the loser goes first

215
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,440
Loser goes first

216
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,850
You ready?

217
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,720
Don't touch this until I'm done with it

218
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,320
20,000 volts runs through this ring

219
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,370
I thought it was 2,000,000 volts...

220
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,670
You ready?

221
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,770
You good?

222
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,670
Hang on tight, please

223
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,570
Are you ready?

224
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,140
Here you go

225
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,720
This wasn't your first time, was it?
