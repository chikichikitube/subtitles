00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,820

27
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,940

28
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,340
Don't call me Ma-kun!

29
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,780
What do you mean?

30
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,100
Is this your girlfriend?

31
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,740
It doesn't matter!

32
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,780
I didn't know, you should tell me these things

33
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,140
What? Why?

34
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,980
Nice to meet you

35
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,940

36
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,620

37
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,740
Go downstairs!

38
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,260
When your girlfriend is here you should fix your hair

39
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,180
STOP IT!

40
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,500
You look stupid..

41
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,740
Don't touch me!

42
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,340

43
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,380
Go downstairs!

44
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,780
What are you saying...

45
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,780
I'm not feeling well

46
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,460
Go downstairs and sleep!

47
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,100
I came home because I need to go to the Hospital

48
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,020
Go!

49
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,020
Why are you yelling at me!

50
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,300
Go downstairs!

51
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,660
She's laughing at you!

52
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,460
Right?

53
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,940
What are you doing??

54
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,740
I'M BRINGING IN THE LAUNDRY!!

55
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,940
You're irritating me!

56
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,020
Sorry I can't welcome you better, Nishihata-san

57
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,740
It's fine

58
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,900
I didn't do anything

59
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,860
What?

60
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,020
No.. it's fine

61
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,940
Nishihata-san do you have any siblings?

62
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,940
No, I'm an only child

63
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,020
Oh is that so?

64
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,460
Being an only child is lonely, right Ma-kun?

65
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,540
Having siblings would be nice

66
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,420
Right?

67
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,020
Ah, yes

68
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,780
Having trouble studying?

69
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,380
Um...uh.. not really

70
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,660
I'll sit here

71
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,140
What are you doing?

72
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,820
What?

73
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,220
Go downstairs!

74
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,140
I'm folding the clothes

75
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,180
Do it downstairs!

76
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,980
Doing it here is fine

77
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,660
I want to talk with young people

78
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,660
with young people

79
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,380
Ma-kun... do you remember, my lower back...

80
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,380
was bothering me?

81
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,020
Really?

82
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,980
I had a CT scan, you know

83
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,700
There's a lot of different CT scans

84
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,420
Scary, so scary, my heart was beating wildly!

85
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,940
It's Ma-kun's...

86
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,140
Ma-kun!

87
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,980
What?

88
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,300
Are you changing your underwear?

89
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Don't show it!

90
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,500
There's always poo stains...

91
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,100
Fold it nicely!

92
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,740
I'm gonna kill you!

93
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,220
There's always dried and hard poo in your
underwear, what are you doing??

94
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,460
It makes me feel bad!

95
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,620
I'm definitely gonna kill her!

96
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,620
Why are you going to kill me??

97
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,220
Definitely gonna kill her...

98
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,900
Hurry get downstairs!

99
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,900
I'm going downstairs..

100
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,700
always...really...

101
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,940
you young Yakuza!

102
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,180
You talk like a young Yakuza!

103
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,020
Always saying those things...

104
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,260
this kid always saying such things

105
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,500
Can you talk like that at school?

106
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,420
WHAT ARE YOU DOING??

107
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,420
Changing...

108
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,420
Why are you changing here? Idiot!

109
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,980
I want to change before I go to
the Hospital, it's embarrassing!

110
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,540
Do it downstairs!

111
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,140
What?

112
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,820
Do it downstairs, stop taking it off!

113
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,020
I know

114
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,020
You know, but you're still taking it off!

115
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,780
Here is fine, don't peek!

116
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,820
Nishihata-san, this looks like your size...

117
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,060
What are you doing? Stop it!
I'm really going to kill you!

118
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,460
What?

119
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,100
Understand?

120
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,700
What?

121
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,500
I'll kill you!

122
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,380
Even if you look at me with
those eyes, I'm not afraid

123
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,140
I'm not scared!

124
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,500
Want to fight?

125
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,900
Your mother won't lose!

126
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,300
Always complaining about the smallest things...

127
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,060
I'm going downstairs!

128
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,060
Hurry up and go!

129
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,060
What are you going to eat?

130
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,900
What?

131
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,420
Food

132
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
I don't know, it doesn't matter!

133
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,100
Shall I make curry?

134
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,100
What? You really like curry, huh?

135
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,180
Why is today something special?

136
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,860
Oh, I'll make something different today

137
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,820
It doesn't matter just go downstairs!

138
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,580
What?

139
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,260
What's with you?

140
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,460
Hurry go!

141
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,060
I'm sorry Nishihata-san

142
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,900
Never mind!

143
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,900
It was scary but...

144
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,740
Never mind!

145
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,140
Don't start to sitting down again!

146
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,900
Go already!

147
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,180
You're eating this junk again?

148
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,140
You won't be able to eat your dinner if you eat this

149
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,700
Right?

150
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,820
Never mind!

151
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
IT'S NOT NEVER MIND RIGHT?!

152
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,700
WHAT'S WITH YOU? ALWAYS COMPLAINING!

153
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,580
JUST TELL ME YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S NAME!!

154
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,380
COMPLAINING! COMPLAINING!

155
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,940
I'm going to tell your dad!

156
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,940
Mother, get out already...

157
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,540
Why are you always so messy??

158
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,940
Don't touch it!

159
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,940
So messy!

160
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,940
Don't touch it, really!

161
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,860
Ouch! Ouch!

162
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,620
Why are you so rough, you
know my bones are weak!

163
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,300
My arm will break!

164
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,020
Hurry.. hurry get downstairs...so irritating!

165
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,300
What do you mean irritating..

166
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,620
Hurry, go! Hurry!

167
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,340
What?

168
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:30,980
Hurry go!

169
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,500
Your underwear...

170
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,220
What about it?

171
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,500
You better change it!

172
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,500
Ok, idiot!

173
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,500
Understand?!

174
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,620
YEA! IDIOT!

175
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,860
I'm sorry Nishihata-san, please come again

176
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,660
Thank you very much

177
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,700
Don't be shy

178
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,700
Barley tea... do you want some tea?

179
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,700
We don't drink tea..

180
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,380
Oh ok

181
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,500
Ok, bye Nishihata-san

182
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,060
She so bothersome..
