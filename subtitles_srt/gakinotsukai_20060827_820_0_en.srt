00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,650
Before the filming for Gaki no Tsukai starts,

4
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,150
Downtown

5
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,150
Hamada Masatoshi

6
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,750
the cast is relaxing backstage

7
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,020
However, one man is nowhere to be seen

8
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,760
Cocorico

9
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,760
Endo Shozo

10
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,760
Tanaka Naoki

11
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,760
Yamasaki Hosei

12
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,160
Good Morning

13
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,500
Excuse me... From Matsumoto-san...

14
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,070
Downtown Manager

15
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,070
Orita Naoya

16
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,800
What could it be?

17
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,170
Excuse me

18
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,040
Why isn't Matsumoto coming here himself?

19
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,780
Well, I was called to do this...

20
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,320
Um, sorry but you voice is so small, I can't here you

21
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,390
After all these years, why are you still like that?

22
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,290
Well, I was called. Yes

23
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,020
What is this...

24
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,460
I don't understand

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,460
Pretty long, isn't it?

26
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,430
The hell is this?

27
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,430
"People like yourselves"

28
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,600
"beings of low sexual experience"

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,710
"Your experience with women"

30
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,710
"has been postponed since birth"

31
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,710
"Your lack of swag"

32
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,710
"..is ridiculous"

33
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,090
"Therefore, the new technician of the ways of the bed"

34
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,760
"is to teach you how to become skillful"

35
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,090
This seems fishy

36
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,990
"You are to arrive at the place appointed in this map"

37
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,370
The map ratio is 1:2500

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
This doesn't make any sense, look at this!

39
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,770
Chiba

40
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,770
Here

41
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,770
Tokyo

42
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,840
Here's Chiba, here's Tokyo, and then it says "HERE!!"

43
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,540
Wow...

44
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,410
Here, if you would please

45
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,810
You can read this map?

46
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,580
Yes, it's fine

47
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,580
Huh, incredible

48
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,850
That's really amazing

49
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,180
Orita doesn't seem very enthusiastic to be doing this

50
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,990
Right

51
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,760
Where is it?

52
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,590
We've come quite far already

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,730
Yeah

54
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,790
Could you really read that map?

55
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,430
Yeah, really, amazing

56
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,760
What's this here?

57
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:02,830
Who..?

58
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,870
Matsumoto-San?

59
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,780
Downtown

60
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,780
Matsumoto Hitoshi

61
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,510
Hello!

62
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,540
Good Day!

63
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,210
So you've come, CHERRY BOY!

64
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,650
C'mere

65
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,210
He got everyone to come here..

66
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,450
Everyone's married...

67
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,350
The adult cherry boys have arrived!

68
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,950
Why are you so mad?

69
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,590
How is it?

70
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,090
Yes?

71
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,760
You @$!& your wife?

72
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,930
Guys who @$!& their wives, raise your hands!

73
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,010
What is the reason for Matsumoto's fury!?

74
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,770
Anyway, your, um...

75
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,280
Till now, have you seen a woman's #%@!

76
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,880
Yes

77
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,850
With this attitude

78
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,850
I've been working on this since last month

79
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Eh, what so you mean by attitude?

80
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,450
Today, my technique is invincible

81
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,790
Today, my technique is invincible

82
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,890
And I'm going to show you

83
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:06,770
Matsumoto today will show off his technique

84
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,490
The kind of spice

85
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,030
Am I Michael Douglas?

86
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,530
The Japanese version would be Hitoshi Matsumoto

87
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,040
There's a prize for the winner, right?

88
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,670
What is this? Don't speak to me with disrespect

89
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,940
Have a look at this!

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,140
That's a lot of mannequins

91
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,980
There are 30 mannequins with bras, waiting for you

92
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,180
Yes, yes, yes

93
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,350
This is a bra unhooking contest

94
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,390
That's @!#$

95
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,390
I'm 100% unbeatable

96
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,090
No, but...

97
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,660
You can't win!

98
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,230
That is, well...

99
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,760
$#%! doesn't have anything to do with this

100
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,160
It doesn't

101
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,900
There's a severe punishment for the loser

102
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,300
This guy's an idiot

103
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,330
Eh?

104
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,370
It would really suck to get this punishment

105
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,370
I'd want to go home

106
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,340
I don't understand the point

107
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,640
What do you mean "you don't understand the point"

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,540
Stupid!

109
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,210
This is the longest running program after Shoten!

110
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,210
I know that...

111
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,550
When you think about it, bra unhooking is a good theme for a competition

112
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,590
But I don't get it

113
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,520
I'm so good you'd think I'd win even if I was sick

114
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,460
What's the point?

115
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,590
No one can beat me with these 30 here

116
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,730
You're really confident?

117
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,300
I have confidence!

118
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,230
I'm confident, but.. Anyway, I...

119
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,670
But, because of the punishment I really don't want to

120
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,300
It's like that for everyone!

121
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:37,960
Rules

122
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:37,960
The contestants will single handedly remove the 30 mannequin's bras over 50 meters.

For the slowest time a batsu game awaits!

123
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Well then, we'll start with Endo

124
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,530
No way!

125
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,030
It would definitely be you

126
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,660
Why Endo, of all people?

127
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,960
Being first is too much

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,270
You've been given this position

129
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,330
Are you any good at this?

130
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,040
Usually I... um...

131
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Did I just say "usually I..."

132
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,070
With Chiaki's bra

133
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,740
Please stop!

134
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,380
It's bad to say her name, stop it

135
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,540
Let's stop

136
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,580
But how many times have you taken off her bra?

137
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,810
This doesn't concern her but you're making her look bad

138
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,980
We need to keep up the image for the kids

139
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,790
What kind of woman does that make her...

140
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,990
You shouldn't mention it

141
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,990
That's no good

142
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,690
No, are you usually one to take them off fast?

143
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,130
Well, since I used to be quite a bachelor...

144
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
I'm more like... "Take them off" kind of type

145
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,400
Endo who makes women take off their own bras

146
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
What is his true skill level!?

147
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,410
And so, Endo!

148
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,310
Yeah!

149
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,010
Are you ready?

150
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,210
All OK!

151
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,210
Then, Endo get ready!

152
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,520
Set!

153
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,290
I'm king of nervous!

154
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,130
Ah, that's bad

155
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,060
It's bad!

156
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,990
Slow, slow!

157
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,000
He's stuck there

158
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,000
He's getting stuck there too

159
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,800
He's freezing

160
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,000
He froze there too

161
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,200
The staff did this before

162
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,270
Around 30 seconds seems like the best

163
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,040
Oh, is that so?

164
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,110
So 30 seconds is excellent

165
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,610
His left hand is going to sleep

166
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,520
Right. Bad, bad bad...

167
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,680
This is not good

168
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,890
That's because he's used to just telling them to do it.

169
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,190
Exactly

170
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,820
Ah, no good

171
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,060
Ah, no good

172
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,660
He doesn't take them off himself

173
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
He's loosening them with his fingers

174
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,630
He is

175
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,630
Ugh, he still hasn't done half, right?

176
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,700
He's getting a bit more use to it

177
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
Doing it one handed

178
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,840
Hm, but still...

179
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,880
I wonder why?

180
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,980
Oh, he messed up!

181
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,520
HE'S SLOW!

182
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,480
This is awful

183
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,250
It is, isn't it?

184
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,420
Isn't that kind of harsh?

185
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,720
I think this is pretty bad

186
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,220
Ugh, you're slow, slow!

187
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,900
And so the time is...

188
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,570
1 minute 17.69 seconds.

189
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:08,840
Endo

190
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,870
Isn't that too slow?

191
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,370
This is quite exhausting, isn't it?

192
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,710
This is quite exhausting, isn't it?

193
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,010
Is it hard?

194
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
It's very hard

195
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,940
I must say, this is quite bad

196
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,380
Really?

197
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,080
Yes

198
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
But isn't it like that?

199
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,450
Really

200
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,220
I could take panties off faster

201
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,580
Seriously?

202
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,020
I could take them off with my feet like this

203
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,990
That's a bit extreme

204
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,220
Amazing

205
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,060
It's quite extreme

206
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,290
What kind of $%#@ do you do?

207
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,860
Next up is HAMADA MASATOSHI!

208
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,700
Go ahead

209
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,030
Oh, Hamada-san?

210
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,270
I'm second?

211
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,170
Second it is

212
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,540
Yeah but, well, this is...

213
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,540
I just have a feeling I'll be slow

214
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,540
Right?

215
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,910
Hamada-san's style would be more like ripping them off

216
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,740
There should be no ripping

217
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,080
The bra-ripping super-sadist Hamada!

218
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,180
What is his exciting technique?

219
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,890
Hamada, are you ready?

220
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,750
Sure!

221
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,750
On your mark!

222
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,460
Set!

223
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:55,150
Endo

224
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,940
I don't know about this guy...

225
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,770
Oh! Fast!

226
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,970
That's fast!

227
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,540
Fast, as expected

228
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,180
Super fast!

229
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,140
As I thought

230
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,340
He's fast!

231
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,010
As I expected!

232
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,180
"As you expected"?

233
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,180
That's impressive!

234
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,650
He's really keeping his pace

235
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,820
Well, this is..

236
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,450
Eh, what does this mean?

237
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,390
Ah, but he's fast!

238
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,420
What's the meaning of this?

239
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,920
Well, because after all...

240
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,890
He's the best at kenken

241
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,460
*Kenken is a puzzle game

242
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,730
He's stripping them so recklessly

243
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,260
Amazing

244
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,370
Have a look at that face...

245
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,340
Such an obscene face he's making!

246
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,340
With a perverted face... fast...

247
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,370
So fast all the time

248
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,370
He has no inhibitions

249
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,110
As expected

250
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,410
He got confident

251
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,510
He's the worst!

252
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,180
So very fast!

253
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,410
Looks like a Hannya mask

254
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,410
He seems happy

255
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,720
Wow, amazing!

256
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
He's really done it!

257
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,890
Incredible!

258
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,290
This is tiring!

259
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,490
48.67 seconds!

260
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,190
Ah, thanks!

261
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,560
Hamada

262
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,630
Wow, awesome!

263
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,270
I thought Hamada would be the second fastest, after me

264
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,030
Why would you think that!?

265
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,070
Somehow

266
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,640
You didn't know the technique?

267
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,300
I did it twice

268
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,570
the unhooking

269
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,070
*Wacoal is a lingerie company

270
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,070
The old guy from Wacoal is confused.

271
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,240
He's confused?

272
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,050
Even the emotionless mannequins laughed

273
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,880
He was just that amazing

274
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,750
That would make anyone happy

275
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,990
So, up next shall be... YAMAZAKI!!

276
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,520
Now I'm feeling kind of nervous

277
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,190
Zaki-San!

278
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,590
I think he's going to do the worst

279
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:40,990
You think?

280
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,490
Well, I somehow have that feeling

281
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,490
I see

282
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,900
You're right, I'm not that used to taking them off either

283
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,200
Oh!

284
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,970
I'm the Endo type as well

285
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,700
What do you mean?

286
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:48,930
Right

287
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,770
"Take em off"

288
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Do you understand bras at all?

289
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,840
I'm fine with that

290
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:01,610
Yamazaki, who usually tells women to "take them off!" takes on the challenge

291
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,580
Ah, he's going barefoot?

292
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,990
He was wearing sandals...

293
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,490
He was

294
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,750
He took them off so it won't hurt

295
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,420
So, Yama-Chan, ready!

296
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,830
Set!

297
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:59,770
Endo

298
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:59,770
Hamada

299
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,760
Here he goes

300
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,800
Huh? Uh, he's slow

301
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,800
This is...

302
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,070
Slow!

303
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,510
Is this slow?

304
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,570
How is he doing?

305
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,640
Did he get the hang of it?

306
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,250
He's certainly slower than Hamada-san but what about me?

307
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,210
No, he's faster than Endo

308
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,850
No way! I must have been really slow...

309
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,950
Endo... That's right

310
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,190
Had he done one third...  ah, half of them already?

311
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,220
Half, maybe

312
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:45,990
Y'know...

313
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,200
So far he's been doing better than expected!

314
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,060
He might be faster than me even

315
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,960
It's true

316
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:53,930
See?

317
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,770
Huh?

318
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,240
He struggled a bit...

319
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,340
He is faster than me

320
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,210
He might be fast

321
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,640
Eh? Seriously?

322
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,040
Faster than me

323
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,180
Wait a minute!

324
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,380
Yama-chan, it's your time!

325
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,410
You did great!

326
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,250
Your time is...

327
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,920
48.10 seconds!

328
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,150
YES!

329
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,090
Yamazaki

330
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,520
Great!

331
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,250
Current leader!

332
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,320
Looking at this, it seems Endo is in trouble

333
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,860
This ain't good

334
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,100
Doesn't look good for you, Endo

335
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Still, Tanaka is probably going to be really bad

336
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,600
Is that so?

337
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,830
I think Tanaka will do the worst

338
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,830
Really?

339
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,200
I'm the type to take them off myself

340
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,500
Oh, you are?

341
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,700
Yes!

342
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,010
It's just that I...

343
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,010
I'm sure liking to do it is enough

344
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,180
Experience is the difference

345
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,840
Different experience

346
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,080
Ah, I see

347
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,550
If Downtown is "heavy-speed" ...

348
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,250
I would be "minimum speed"

349
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,060
Tanaka, who in his own experience, is "minimum-speed" with women

350
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,520
How is he going to do?

351
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,160
So Tanaka, are you ready?

352
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,330
I'm OK!

353
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,830
If he gets more than one minute he's out, right?

354
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,300
What's up with Cocorico?

355
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,430
No, there's no such thing!

356
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,270
So then Tanaka, get ready!

357
00:12:07,570 --> 00:13:15,840
Endo

358
00:12:07,570 --> 00:13:15,840
Hamada

359
00:12:07,570 --> 00:13:15,840
Yamazaki

360
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,570
Set!

361
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,040
Just now, Endo was...

362
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,640
Tanaka is...

363
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,050
Look!

364
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,050
But this...

365
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,220
There's no way he's going to get a good time

366
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,190
This is kind of good, its great! You're really skilled

367
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,230
This is, um...

368
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,070
Ah, he picked up the pace!

369
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,330
Yes, well... ah...

370
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,710
He's making up for a little

371
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,870
A little bit

372
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,910
With that start I wonder if it helps

373
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,740
But... but...

374
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,780
Finally he... hahaha!

375
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,910
But... Tanaka!

376
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,180
I won't be losing this!

377
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,590
Wait, what, how's this compared to me?

378
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,150
Looking bad for Tanaka, eh?

379
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,720
Tanaka is in trouble

380
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,460
Tanaka is heading towards danger

381
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,830
Tanaka is in trouble

382
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,300
Tanaka... it's not going too well

383
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,930
Tanaka is doing quite badly

384
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,970
Tanaka, bad...

385
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,440
It didn't come off!

386
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,140
No good!

387
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,770
It might be he's lacking in physical strength

388
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,440
He's taking long!

389
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,250
I wonder what his time will be?

390
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,620
1 minute, 18.48 seconds!

391
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:37,000
Endo

392
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:37,000
Tanaka

393
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,530
The worst among the the group!

394
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,900
You had a really tight match there, Cocorico

395
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,770
Yes, well, but his legs did the weirdest thing back there

396
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,080
I've never seen a man sprain his ankle while taking off bras before

397
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,350
Did I seriously take that long?

398
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,120
There's no benefit to going through this!

399
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,760
But stripping them is cool!

400
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,290
Well, it is pretty manly

401
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,160
Manly and cool!

402
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,230
The first one was awful though

403
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,200
Well, the first..

404
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,830
You did it like "katakatakatakata!"

405
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,270
I didn't know how to approach it

406
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,600
I was lost on which approach to go for

407
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,040
No, no...

408
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,970
I was thinking of the entry

409
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,440
I'm sorry...

410
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:27,050
Endo

411
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:27,050
Hamada

412
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:27,050
Results so far

413
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:27,050
Tanaka

414
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:27,050
Yamazaki

415
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:27,050
Currently Tanaka has the lowest ranking. After this the moody Matsumoto will challenge them all in the field of bra unhooking!

416
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,180
I don't truly understand what you're saying here

417
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,020
Yes

418
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,450
It seems like I'll just do this so you will look up too me

419
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,120
Seriously?

420
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,960
I think that's how it shall be

421
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,720
How many seconds would it take you?

422
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,160
I think 30 seconds would be where I draw the line

423
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,190
Under 30!?

424
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,990
EH!?

425
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,390
Sorry, but I'm the technician

426
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,630
No need to apologize, really...

427
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,160
We don't have your result yet

428
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,930
This is a technician?

429
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,770
What that supposed to mean?

430
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,870
This is kind of embarrassing for Cocorico

431
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,640
There's something going on here

432
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Did bra unhooking skills go down after our generation?

433
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,040
The hooks have moved to the front

434
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,040
We're the skillful generation

435
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,520
Let's move on

436
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,680
Is he really not kidding?

437
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,150
Matsumoto-san, get ready

438
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,990
Time to show us!

439
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,450
It is, right?

440
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,590
Alright, understood

441
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,230
Why this outfit, I don't understand...

442
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,590
I'll be going then

443
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,700
Good luck

444
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,400
Thank you

445
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,470
Ah, he just walked off casually

446
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:30,340
Matsumoto, with his 30 second limit, will now show his divine display of talent!

447
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,180
Alright, Matsumoto-san!

448
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,250
Yes!

449
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,680
What are you rolling your sleeves up for?

450
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,480
No-one's done it until now

451
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,490
Anyhow, I thought I'd show you my record

452
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,490
Ah, I see

453
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,690
Go ahead and show us then!

454
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,460
Yes please, go ahead

455
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,660
Matsumoto-san on your mark!

456
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,760
Get set!

457
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,500
His stance...

458
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:41,850
Endo

459
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:41,850
Hamada

460
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:41,850
Tanaka

461
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:41,850
Yamazaki

462
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,980
Isn't that just fantastic?

463
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,320
Indeed

464
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,550
Is he really that fast?

465
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,460
It's not that different from Yamazaki

466
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,290
It really is similar

467
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:18,690
What?

468
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,190
Oh, how embarrassing!

469
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,160
No, Ma-chan recovered

470
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,870
Well, yes

471
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,840
How can this be

472
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,480
Isn't this pure genius?

473
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
This is skill

474
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,550
He'll surely get first place like this

475
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,310
So it seems

476
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,120
Is he faster than Yama-chan?

477
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
NNNYEEEAAAH!

478
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,960
No, that is...

479
00:16:52,460 --> 00:17:03,500
Best time so far

480
00:16:52,460 --> 00:17:03,500
Yamazaki

481
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,090
Matsumoto-san's time is...

482
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,590
WOW!

483
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,100
47.02 seconds!

484
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Mastumoto

485
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,000
YE-

486
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,660
That's kind of half-assed

487
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,270
Really, you!

488
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,900
It's true you're number 1 among us, but...

489
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,340
But that one...

490
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,210
What?

491
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,340
"That one"?

492
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,140
Anyway, I hate it.

493
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,640
It's a mannequin!

494
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,350
WHAAAAT!?

495
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,920
I've never done something like this

496
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,280
Here it comes

497
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:17,820
Here it comes

498
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,890
There was only that one camera over there

499
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,260
Yes

500
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,020
There was

501
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,660
It's normal to get super nervous there...

502
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:27,930
He's an idiot

503
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,190
He's an idiot

504
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,730
Camera

505
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,110
I couldn't get it to work there

506
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,180
You couldn't

507
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,310
That was the worst among all 30 of them

508
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,850
True

509
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,050
We agreed to do out best

510
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,720
Aside from that one thing I'm number one, right?

511
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,060
No, but you did say you'd do it under 30 seconds

512
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,060
He did

513
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,060
So that would mean that Mastomoto-San...

514
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,890
Matsumoto-san should get the batsu game after all

515
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,760
What the hell?

516
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,800
Are you #@$!, you idiot!

517
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,030
No way in hell!

518
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,730
That's how it is

519
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,140
So this mean, with his pace, Tanaka!

520
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,570
Whaaat?

521
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,570
BATSU GAME!

522
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,440
No way, seriously? I don't want to do it

523
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,980
TANAKA BATSU GAME!!

524
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,540
Matsumoto-san, what is the punishment?

525
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,450
Well, the batsu game is, as the title suggests...

526
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,520
It's called: "aimsless journey by train"

527
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,850
"aimless train..."

528
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,590
The "burari" here means bra

529
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,450
It will have something to do with a bra

530
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,390
You will be boarding the Enoden train in the evening...

531
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:31,920
Enoden?

532
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,990
Yes, wearing a bra

533
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,990
And you'll wander around

534
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,400
*burabura = aimlessly
bura = bra

535
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,000
Are you serious?

536
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,630
It's a very crowded location

537
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,730
Exactly!

538
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,400
It is, yes

539
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,340
I really hate this!

540
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,840
It's crazy!

541
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,310
Why do I have to look like a total weirdo doing that?

542
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,640
Is this seriously for real?

543
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,850
When I think about it, I thought I did bad

544
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,120
I don't get the punishment but my time was still bad

545
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,720
They go together

546
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,620
That's right

547
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,960
On the other hand, Downtown is kinda giving off a pervy vibe

548
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,960
That is true

549
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,860
I've arrived in Kamakura

550
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,930
Incredible isn't it. There are lots of stores around here

551
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,570
I've arrived in Kamakura

552
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,410
Why do I have to do this batsu game?

553
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,410
I really do not understand

554
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,280
Since I was made to wear a bra...

555
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,950
I feel a  bit gross

556
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,320
But, a cuter bra would have been nicer

557
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,000
Batsu Game

558
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,000
Cocorico Tanaka

559
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,730
Well aside from this slight misfortune

560
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,730
I'm going to wander around

561
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,560
*He can't go on the train wearing just underwear

562
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,240
He's buying "pigeon shortbread" as a souvenir for 4 people

563
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,640
Excuse me, I'm looking for souvenirs for 10,000 yen

564
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,970
Hello!

565
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,010
This is a rickshaw, isn't it?

566
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,420
Feels great

567
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,020
What a wonderful feeling

568
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,590
Very nice

569
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,370
Here we have the famous bookstore

570
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,000
I think I want to wander further

571
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,370
Hello

572
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,270
Hello, good day...

573
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,470
Hello

574
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,240
Ah, thank you, thank you

575
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,410
Hello

576
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,610
As expected, it's the summer holiday

577
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,190
There are kids running around everywhere

578
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,920
This is a tasteful shop, don't you think?

579
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,190
How long has the place existed?

580
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,830
For three generations

581
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,300
Three generations?

582
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,100
What a splendid store

583
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:34,140
I'm feeling sort of nostalgic for the Japanese summer

584
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,190
How cute!

585
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,190
Cute, indeed

586
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,820
Hello there

587
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,590
Hello there

588
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,590
I always watch you on TV!

589
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,930
Oh, thank you!

590
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,200
Thank you very much!

591
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,460
Hello

592
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,970
I wouldn't have thought this would be so sweet

593
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,280
"Kamakura Surugaya-san"...

594
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,250
It's a Japanese confectionery

595
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,280
You're doing good there

596
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,580
Oh, really?

597
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,820
Yes, really

598
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,290
Is it your first time?

599
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,050
It's my first time

600
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,020
You're good!

601
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,790
Chef's work

602
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,790
Tanaka's work

603
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,900
It's delicious!

604
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,570
*He can't go on the train wearing just underwear

605
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,940
Ever since I was small I've felt

606
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,240
being close to a big ocean like this

607
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,880
really makes you feel quite insignificant

608
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,720
After all, this isn't something I can do

609
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,850
take a punishment like this

610
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,290
just because I am slow at unhooking bras

611
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,530
Since I don't strip them off myself

612
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,170
A guy who is slow at taking off bras is really uncool

613
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,170
Doing it is just...

614
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,340
Taking them off your wife by force just seems bad to me

615
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,510
I just don't seem to be able to do it
