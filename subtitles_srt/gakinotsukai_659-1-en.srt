The Battle

00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,880
The Full Version

7
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,600
So we were talking about doing this

8
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,200
We were talking about which side these three should be on

9
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,980
Yes we were

10
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,140
And with our mascot, Yamasaki-san...

11
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,140
Thank you very much

12
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:14,830
Good luck to you on that

13
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,320
Well I am the mascot

14
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,280
To be honest...

15
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,540
and an enemy?

16
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,080
Yes I am your enemy as well

17
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,020
When the hell did you become our mascot?

18
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,380
I personally

19
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,690
would like to join Matsumoto-san's side

20
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,630
Apparently, he wants to join my team this time

21
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,340
Oh really?

22
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,880
Do Cocorico want to as well?

23
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,760
We also want to join um... Matsumoto-san's team

24
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,510
You haven't got anything to say?

25
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,730
No, not at all

26
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,700
What is with his confidence?

27
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,970
I know, it's making me nervous

28
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,400
He is really confident

29
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,220
Okay then, we will join his side

30
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,270
By all means, go ahead

31
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,510
Okay let's go

32
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,800
And so

33
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,090
Yup

34
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,700
We were thinking of what we should do this time

35
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,230
I see

36
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,300
The suggestions so far were... what was it?

37
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:51,970
Bowling

38
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,370
Bowling

39
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,400
Yes, bowling

40
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,210
So we do bowling, and you just bowl normally but...

41
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:58,720
Okay

42
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,770
us fourwill throw four balls  at the same time

43
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,970
us four will throw four balls at the same time

44
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,710
us four will throw four balls at the same time

45
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,150
Yes

46
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,840
But the lane is like this thin, will you four be able to do that?

47
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,380
Well um...

48
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,450
Yeah I'm sure we can

49
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,440
Yeah we can

50
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,590
Like somehow...

51
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,320
It's perfect

52
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,270
Oh yeah, we can do it like this

53
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,010
No no, there isn't that much width!

54
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,370
This is about right

55
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,110
I'm sure we will fit

56
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,070
Is it about this wide?

57
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,670
It is

58
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,870
It is

59
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,770
No no no no...

60
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,650
You will be hanging off the sides, are you sure you're okay?

61
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,050
No no, so we will be like...

62
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,450
We will be fine

63
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:35,340
Confirmed!

64
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:35,340
Hamada vs Team Matsumoto

65
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:35,340
Special Bowling Battle

66
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,380
And hence, a 4 vs 1 special bowling match was decided

67
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,120
Who will win the battle to decide the Batsu game's participants?

68
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,650
The first annual Gaki no Tsukai chikki chikki

69
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,090
Hamada vs Matsumoto, Cocorico and other

70
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,410
Unprecedented 4 vs 1

71
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,300
special bowling battle!

72
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,060
For the first time in ages, I am not alone

73
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,800
Oh yeah, that's true

74
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,880
Well I guess there are times when it's better to be on your own

75
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,280
Is that so?

76
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,430
But today I will try my best with Cocorico and other.

77
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,500
We will try our best!

78
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,160
Let's win, guys

79
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,650
Let's seriously try our best

80
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,550
But however you look at these guys,

81
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,400
they're just pieces of crap

82
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,170
You're right

83
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,360
They're just a shadow of crap

84
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,820
A shadow comedian at best

85
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,800
Why?

86
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,870
Anyway, everyone

87
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,460
Take a look at this

88
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,620
This time as well

89
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,750
There are people holding up placards from the crowds

90
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,180
There are placards?

91
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,980
There are people holding up placards from the crowds

92
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,640
Aww, I'm very grateful for that

93
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,990
Prematurely balding turkey hunter

94
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,990
Tanaka Naoki

95
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,610
Tanaka...

96
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,470
Prematurely balding turkey hunter

97
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,370
They definitely have no intention of supporting me

98
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,570
No way.

99
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,880
And Endo is..?

100
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,190
Endo Shouzou

101
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,190
Let it out! Bonito thrower from Shikoku

102
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,880
Get rid of it

103
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,130
I would but I got nothing else in terms of support

104
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,940
And myself, what does it say?

105
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,440
The black magician by the lane

106
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,200
Matsumoto Hitoshi

107
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,200
The black magician by the lane

108
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,600
A magician

109
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,000
What the hell is that?

110
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,270
That's quite cool

111
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,330
That's annoying

112
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,890
And next...

113
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,070
Your one is the only nice one

114
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,960
What does Hamada's say?

115
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,240
GO! Pervert strike comedian

116
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,240
Hamada Masatoshi

117
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,110
Go

118
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,280
Go

119
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,080
Pervert strike comedian

120
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,270
Pervert strike comedian

121
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,250
Pervert strike comedian...

122
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,090
That's a bit of a shock

123
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,880
Yamasaki-san

124
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,300
Yes

125
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,490
The gutter comedian that Nishinomiya gave birth to

126
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,280
The gutter comedian that Nishinomiya gave birth to:

127
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,280
Yamasaki Hosei

128
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,690
Give me a break, man, seriously.

129
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,650
They're not supporting us at all

130
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,760
And the whole "Matsumoto, Cocorico and other" thing too...

131
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,660
First annual Gaki no tsukai arahende!!

132
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,660
Hamada vs Matsumoto  Cocorico and others

133
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,660
Unprecedented 4 vs 1 Special Bowling Battle!!

134
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,950
Yeah I can understand that

135
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,530
How long are they going to do that for as well?

136
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,900
I don't know...

137
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,320
But if you moan about that kind of thing too much

138
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,320
They might erase the "other" part completely...

139
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,670
1 game - Whoever has more pins wins

140
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,670
4 vs 1 special bowling battle

141
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,670
Loser(s) participates in the Batsu Game

142
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,670
Matsumoto's team must throw
all 4 balls at the same time

143
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,670
Rules are same as normal bowling

144
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,670
m 0 0 l 543 -1 l 543 357 l 0 357 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

145
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,800
Normal bowling rules. But Matsumoto's team must bowl all 4 balls

146
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,510
at the same time.

147
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,310
We will now start with the first throw ceremony

148
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,840
We will now start with the first throw ceremony

149
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,880
Suga Kenji: Producer

150
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,880
Tournament director

151
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,700
So please give a warm welcome to this person

152
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:20,780
Who?

153
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,030
Let's move over here

154
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,220
Heipo

155
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,650
Oh bloody hell

156
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,670
He's so small

157
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,360
What the hell is he doing here?

158
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,510
We don't care, man...

159
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,920
Go on then

160
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,580
You have to do it when Hamada-san is looking at you!

161
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,890
HEIPO DOKKIRI (trick)!

162
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,280
Man that was shit

163
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,400
Complete success!

164
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,410
It didn't succeed at all

165
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,570
It really didn't

166
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,080
Even if you thought you had to do it...

167
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,290
I wasn't even watching!

168
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,940
Hamada-san was facing the other way

169
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,240
He was looking this way

170
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,710
I guess you're the type of person who can only get shocked

171
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,170
So true

172
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,980
I guess you're the type of person who can only get shocked

173
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,090
Well anyway, it's a first throw ceremony

174
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,320
So please do it well!

175
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,000
We're counting on you!

176
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,340
You never know, Heipo might be good at bowling

177
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:00,900
That's true

178
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,300
Is this old guy for real?

179
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,530
Okay then, here I go.

180
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,230
Go for it

181
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,300
We're counting on you seriously.

182
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,590
And we're finished here...

183
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,520
Thank you very much

184
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,350
Thank you...

185
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,930
Try your best and good luck

186
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,950
Thank you

187
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,390
Next up

188
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,760
Just for this battle

189
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,210
They came all the way from America

190
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,100
North Carolina Phoenixes

191
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,650
The National Number 1 cheerleaders have come just for us

192
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,920
The National Number 1 cheerleaders have come just for us

193
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,890
The National Number 1 cheerleaders have come just for us

194
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,020
Seriously?

195
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:33,930
Here they are

196
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,150
Are they actually?

197
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,410
Obviously not

198
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,050
They're not, right?

199
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,900
They're obviously not number 1 in America

200
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,150
Okay we get it...

201
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,830
We totally understand...

202
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,400
Simply put, it's the girl with the glasses which I found hilarious

203
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,220
She's definitely not the type to be a cheerleader

204
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,210
Anyway, today

205
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,950
Yup!

206
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,660
Due to the disadvantage I have in numbers

207
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,540
Apparently there's a coach just for my team

208
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,540
Apparently there's a coach just for my team

209
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,860
Wait, what... What are we meant to do then?

210
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,510
No no, you just figure it out yourselves...

211
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,900
We don't get a coach?

212
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,830
We don't apparently

213
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,210
If you could just try and figure it out yourselves...

214
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,210
Something's wrong here...

215
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,150
It's the professional bowler Ooyama Yukari-san, welcome!

216
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,980
Wait, she is going to be your coach?

217
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,760
Yeah, it's her for real

218
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,630
Nice to meet you

219
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,120
I have seen her somewhere before

220
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,970
Hamada's coach is someone who has won a lot of tournaments

221
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:59,040
Nationally ranked 6th

222
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:59,040
Ooyama Yukari

223
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:59,040
m 0 0 l 275 -1 l 275 153 l 0 153 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

224
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,660
Her name is Ooyama Yukari

225
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,730
Let's check out how good she really is

226
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,360
We're going to get to witness her get a split

227
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,030
Can she do that?

228
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,120
Well of course

229
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,060
She's a professional, after all

230
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,440
Even if she gets a strike

231
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,280
Of course

232
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,960
She's a professional; she should be getting these

233
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,180
Oh wow

234
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,400
Oh hang on, this looks good, this looks good

235
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,390
She's got it

236
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,400
Don't get me wrong, it is amazing but...

237
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,430
as soon as she threw it, she was like "This looks good, this looks good"

238
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,400
Practice Time

239
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,530
From here on, they split up and practice for the match

240
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,920
Damn this one is heavy

241
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,800
Two days ago, I did this

242
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,510
Two days ago, I did this

243
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,440
Bowling?

244
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,660
You know, with everyone

245
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,040
My whole body hurts like hell

246
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,340
My whole body hurts like hell

247
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,910
Just to hold it

248
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,520
It feels so heavy

249
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,200
Are you going to be okay?

250
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,210
Yup, I'm going to win!

251
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,660
So from here...

252
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,400
like this

253
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,930
Yep

254
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,480
That's about right

255
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,090
This will be

256
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,760
This will be really tough

257
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,980
You're right

258
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,960
I see

259
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,850
See? Look.

260
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,730
That one

261
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,570
That's the one?

262
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,730
Let's go with that one

263
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
I've decided on that ball

264
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,330
Let's go with that one

265
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,810
From about here?

266
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,030
Can we like squeeze up a bit more?

267
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,550
Like this?

268
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,990
Ready, steady

269
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:20,720
This is impossible

270
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,120
This is impossible

271
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,720
Because I can't

272
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,890
even throw the ball, I doubt I will be able to...

273
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,550
I'm like this...

274
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,610
Yeah same here...

275
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,910
Yeah me too

276
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:29,910
I'm already in the gutter

277
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,430
I thought we were bowling normally so I swung the ball back

278
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,500
and the ball hit my knee hard

279
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,330
Really?

280
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,930
We can't swing the ball back at all

281
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,520
But seriously

282
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,430
We can't do this movement

283
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:38,940
It's just like this

284
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,180
It's impossible for sure

285
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,630
Maybe we should try once?

286
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,390
You guys ready?

287
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,890
He's already asking us

288
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,320
He's asking us

289
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,410
I've been waiting for ages

290
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,280
We're good to go

291
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,720
We're fine

292
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,380
Ready anytime...

293
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,060
You sure?

294
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,480
Yes

295
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,250
We're good to go

296
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,290
Okay then, let's do it

297
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,210
Yes

298
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,540
The battle finally starts

299
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,580
Who will win the special bowling battle?

300
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,060
First: Hamada

301
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,060
Second: Team Matsumoto

302
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,710
Hamada will bowl first; Team Matsumoto will bowl second

303
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,960
Hamada's first throw is a very important one.

304
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,400
1st Frame

305
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,400
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 28 l 0 28 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

306
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,150
Here we go then

307
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,770
Oh man, this is good

308
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,060
Two more

309
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,350
But still...

310
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,350
If he gets a spare here...

311
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,950
It woule be really bad for us

312
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,950
That would be bad...

313
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,960
It would be real bad if he got it

314
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,390
Yeah...

315
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,350
First frame
2nd throw

316
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,350
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

317
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,220
He got it

318
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,160
Shit

319
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,290
Shit, man!

320
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,090
This is bad, man!

321
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,250
For real?

322
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,900
This is our first ever throwing as a four

323
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,660
That's true

324
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,490
Just ready, steady, throw...

325
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,520
We haven't even been given time to practice

326
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,100
That's right

327
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,570
The four didn't practise at all during the practice session

328
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,490
How will their first throw go?

329
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,240
Endo

330
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,240
Matsumoto

331
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,240
Tanaka

332
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,240
Yamasaki

333
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,240
m 0 0 l 122 -1 l 124 138 l 0 138 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

334
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,120
Get closer

335
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,120
Go that way more

336
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,660
I can't

337
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,810
I'm already in the gutter

338
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,580
I'm already in the gutter

339
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,440
If we go straight

340
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,640
This is bad, man

341
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,630
Oh man, I'm worried now

342
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,200
Please go that way a bit more

343
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,760
Hurry the hell up already!

344
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,710
Please wait a minute

345
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,850
Think about this, if we lose

346
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,290
I know

347
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,050
He will really get us if we lose this

348
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,120
I'm begging you guys

349
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,210
That's what scares me

350
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,930
Come on

351
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,510
Seriously guys

352
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,820
If we muck around, we could get hurt

353
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,760
The bowling centre has allowed them to bowl like this; please do not try this at home

354
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,550
You're right

355
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,880
Let's do it properly

356
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,670
Here we go

357
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,860
Everyone make yourselves smaller

358
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,450
Smaller

359
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,940
Get smaller

360
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,190
Okay

361
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,980
Right, here we go

362
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,130
Ready, steady

363
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,950
Okay okay okay

364
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,630
Look, look, look

365
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,530
The green one...

366
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,540
Oh shit, this is a strike!

367
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,810
Get it!

368
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,370
YEEEAAAHHH!!!!

369
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,160
Come on!

370
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,300
Yes!!

371
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,540
We can win!

372
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,730
Amazing!

373
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,530
This is amazing!

374
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,950
Who threw the last ball?

375
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,620
The red one?

376
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,170
Amazing!

377
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,540
That was fantastic

378
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,540
I didn't think it would go there to be honest

379
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,490
He was aiming for the left hand side but it drifted to the right

380
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,380
It's amazing that it got the remaining one

381
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,280
Oh man, oh man, oh man...

382
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,770
That was amazing

383
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,190
There's one thing we can take from what just happened for sure...

384
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,250
We will NEVER be able to do that again!

385
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,990
You're right

386
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,120
Honestly, everything went perfectly there

387
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,970
Everything went perfectly there

388
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,720
Everything went perfectly

389
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,140
After Team Matsumoto's strike, Hamada throws his 2nd ball

390
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,750
2nd Frame

391
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,750
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 28 l 0 28 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

392
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,640
It's good, it's good

393
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,240
Oh no

394
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,260
2nd Frame
2nd ball

395
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,260
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

396
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,410
Oh no, it's no good.

397
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,370
Thank you so much, Hamada-san

398
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,050
Okay, great!

399
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,500
Well, well, well

400
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,840
We can do this, we can do this!

401
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,460
Okay here we go!

402
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,290
Right then!

403
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,230
Let's just do the exact same thing as before

404
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,850
Everything the same

405
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,820
Everything the same, the power and speed

406
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,570
Everything exactly the same

407
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,300
Exactly the same

408
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,300
I can get this small

409
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,690
Endo

410
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,690
Matsumoto

411
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,690
Tanaka

412
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,690
Yamasaki

413
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,690
m 0 0 l 122 -1 l 124 138 l 0 138 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

414
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,050
Here we go

415
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,320
W-w-w-wait

416
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,470
Tanaka, can you move a bit..?

417
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,670
I told you...

418
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,230
I'm in the gutter!!

419
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,340
I'm in the gutter if I move any more.

420
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,970
Come this way

421
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,000
I only have a tiny bit of space

422
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,560
I'm in the gutter too

423
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay here we go

424
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,490
Ready, steady

425
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,430
Look

426
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,130
Yellow's gone

427
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,150
Oh shit, red, oh shit!

428
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,420
There you go

429
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,260
I see, so that's what happens

430
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,150
Hamada

431
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,150
Team Matsumoto

432
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,300
Yup, that's what happens

433
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,020
I see

434
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,430
You're doing it at the same time so of course that will happen

435
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,050
So the first roll you did really was

436
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,020
a miracle

437
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,690
Pure luck!

438
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,290
Hey

439
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,290
Apparently it was just a fluke...

440
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,680
So what do we do in this situation?

441
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,370
Yeah, there's no point of the left hand side

442
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,590
So Yamasaki being there...

443
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,440
You should just not aim for anything

444
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,740
Just go straight

445
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,970
I should try and just not hit anything?

446
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,960
Yes

447
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,150
Just try and miss

448
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,940
And we will just bet on the other three to do the job

449
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
You were just trying to hit it

450
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,380
and you totally missed it, so who cares, just hurry the hell up!

451
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,010
What does he mean by that?

452
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,130
Don't fall for his tricks

453
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,420
It's just a trick of words

454
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,110
Please

455
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,690
He's just trying to lower our morale

456
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,510
Yes he is

457
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,920
Even if you take loads of time,

458
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,730
You're not going to get on-air time so just hurry the hell up already.

459
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,090
You're not going to get on-air time so just hurry the hell up already.

460
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,200
When he makes those kind of comments

461
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,160
It really hurts us here, right?

462
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:57,840
You're right

463
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,990
Don't fall for it

464
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,100
Other than Matsumoto, none of you are getting screen time

465
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Other than Matsumoto, none of you are getting screen time

466
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,690
Are you serious?

467
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,520
That's not true, we are all getting screen time, we all are.

468
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,170
You're not tricking us, are you, Matsumoto-san?

469
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,710
You're not tricking us, are you, Matsumoto-san?

470
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,650
No of course not.

471
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,730
No of course not, we are all getting plenty of screen time

472
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,290
Are you sure?

473
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,400
Of course.

474
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,110
Take a look, guys

475
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,780
We aren't getting any screen time!!

476
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,920
Hey hold on a minute!!

477
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,400
He's tricking us!

478
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,040
Leave it, leave it!

479
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,180
We aren't getting tricked!

480
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,270
What's going on?

481
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,450
Don't get drawn into it

482
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,100
I really put effort into how I look today...

483
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,690
Don't get tricked

484
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,470
You sure?

485
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,970
It'll be fine, you're getting plenty of screen time

486
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,780
Okay...

487
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,640
As if you're going to miss the pins, okay?

488
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,930
Your behinds might get some screen time...

489
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,780
Zaki-san, you're just going to miss the pins

490
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:32,300
2nd Frame
2nd Bowl

491
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:32,300
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

492
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,470
I'm just going to miss it then

493
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,120
We understand

494
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,390
Ready, steady...

495
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,690
This is good

496
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:36,980
This is good

497
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,460
Tanaka's ball, keep going

498
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,760
Keep going!

499
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,660
Ah that blue one

500
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,530
Go!

501
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,240
Go!

502
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,000
It will be fine

503
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,850
Here it goes

504
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:55,020
Hamada

505
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:55,020
Team Matsumoto

506
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,380
I see

507
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,410
What's happened now?

508
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,920
4-pin difference.

509
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,550
It's a good match though

510
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,320
It is

511
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,360
It really is

512
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,180
We're fine

513
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,610
That first try (in the 2nd frame) was shit...

514
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,040
We're going to be fine

515
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,300
It was annoying that he

516
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,090
got a spare there...

517
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,500
You know?

518
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,260
Will you guys just sit down?

519
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,570
What are you planning to do? Sit down already

520
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,640
It was a good he didn't get a spare before

521
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,120
Yeah yeah

522
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,390
Now sit down

523
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,530
Move

524
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,600
So the next one...

525
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,200
Well I guess there's only a 4-pin difference

526
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,600
Yeah exactly, we can't be getting nervous here already...

527
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,600
You're right

528
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,280
Yeah

529
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,610
We can't get nervous and let this affect us

530
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,150
We can't let this affect us

531
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,450
You're right

532
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,250
There will definitely come a time where he starts to crumble

533
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,380
Yes for sure

534
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,980
It will come

535
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,600
Can you stand back?

536
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,190
Just get off this part

537
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,930
No but...

538
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,190
Get off this part

539
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,750
He will definitely crumble at some point

540
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,020
Get off here

541
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,890
He will

542
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,880
None of you come back on here

543
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,230
There's only a 4-pin difference

544
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,050
In bowling, that's nothing

545
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,140
We're totally fine

546
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,090
3rd frame

547
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,090
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 28 l 0 28 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

548
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,310
Oh shit, it went to the side

549
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,800
We are totally fine!

550
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,510
You're fine

551
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,510
I am fine, aren't I?

552
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,660
He is a bit

553
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,290
He's a bit tense, isn't he?

554
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,260
He is tense

555
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,760
He is, right?

556
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,740
You can really tell he's not been properly educated

557
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,580
It really comes out here...

558
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,750
You can really tell here

559
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,760
I'm totally fine

560
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,390
He really is a retard...

561
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,260
You bet

562
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,250
3rd frame
2nd ball

563
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,250
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

564
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,990
You're not going to deny it?

565
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,360
Shit, oh shit!

566
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,650
Come on

567
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,490
Let's increase the speed a little bit more

568
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,490
I agree

569
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,180
We are throwing our balls a little bit too slowly

570
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,730
You're right

571
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,500
Because we got a strike on our very first bowl, we were under the assumption that was fine...

572
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,270
But in all honest other than when we got a strike

573
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,670
All my balls have ended up in the gutter...

574
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,780
All my balls have ended up in the gutter...

575
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,160
You're right, the yellow ball is always in the gutter

576
00:14:59,050 --> 00:14:59,610
Always

577
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,340
It's always the first in the gutter

578
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,810
Okay

579
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,660
Here we go

580
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,750
Endo

581
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,750

585
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,100
Ready, steady

586
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,090
Fast!

587
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,770
There we go

588
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,410
That's great!

589
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,480
That's great!

590
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,890
This is really good!

591
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,060
Come on!

592
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,850
Yes!

593
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,780
Yes yes yes!

594
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,750
This is it!

595
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,800
Great!

596
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,880
We have arrived

597
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,640
This is the way to go!

598
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
This is really great

599
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,440
We have arrived!

600
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,520

603
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,680
Hamada

604
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,680
Team Matsumoto

605
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,930
Thank you very much

606
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,510
I knew as soon as I let go of the ball

607
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,760
Thank you so much

608
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,870
Next up is Team Matsumoto, an important throw after getting a strike

609
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:44,160
4th frame
1st throw

610
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:44,160
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

611
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,820
Oh no, oh no...

612
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,390
Shit!

613
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,400
Oh man, what have we done?

614
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:02,140
Hamada

615
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:02,140
Team Matsumoto

616
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,270
Shit

617
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,430
What the hell is this?

618
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,620
This is just...

619
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,470
I have no idea what to do

620
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,040
I don't understand at all what we are doing right or wrong

621
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,410
I don't understand at all what we are doing right or wrong

622
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,480
We are doing the exact same thing each time

623
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,860
We really are

624
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,130
Literally the same

625
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,280
Come on, hurry up!

626
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,270
What should we do?

627
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,710
No seriously, we don't know what to do

628
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,980
I'm going on the side

629
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,050
Okay then I will too

630
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,440
You guys are in the way

631
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,310
Okay, let's try it like this then

632
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,700
Okay I will go in the middle too

633
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,720
Yeah do that

634
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,230
Oh shit, you guys are in the way

635
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,690
We are, right?

636
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,150
Yes

637
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,800
Here we go

638
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,770
Fill in
Fill in

639
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,770
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

640
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,770
The bowling center has allowed them to bowl like this. Please do not try this at home

641
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,980
Ready, steady...

642
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,740
Make sure it's a speed ball, okay?

643
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,270
Speed ball.

644
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,500
I'm in the gutter!

645
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,520
We should have gotten smaller!

646
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,870
See! Of course my ball went into the gutter

647
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,670
Hold on, that's good!

648
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,090
That one's good

649
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,620

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,620
Team Matsumoto

651
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,580
Wow, that was quite good

652
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,520
Only 2 pins' difference

653
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,580

656
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,830
Such a shame, it was a good throw as well...

657
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,640
This is huge

658
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,620

659
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,960

661
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,710
Okay, green ball!

662
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,210
That's good, it deflected off!

663
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:02,910
Thank you!

664
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,600
Go!

665
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,220
This is good, this is good!

666
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,390
Yellow is looking good!

667
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,660

668
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,980

670
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,960
Oh no

671
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,360
Ready, steady

672
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,790
Endo

673
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,790

676
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,790
m 0 0 l 122 -1 l 124 138 l 0 138 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

Team Matsumoto's 6th frame, 1st throw

680
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,400
Okay, there they go

681
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,420
The yellow ball...

682
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,950
Oh man, there are some pins in awkward positions...

683
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,930
Hold on...

684
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,340
Yes, that's great!

685
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:51,280
Hamada

686
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:51,280
Team Matsumoto

687
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,990
Oh man!

688
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,170
I don't understand what just happened

689
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,320
That fourth ball

690
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,150
What about it?

691
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,220
It was thanks to the fourth ball

692
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,100
It really was

693
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,740
That would never happen usually

694
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,570
It would never happen

695
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,100
Yeah, normally

696
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,180
Okay okay... Man I want to throw by myself

697
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,260
I know, right?

698
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,070
We can do this though, right guys?

699
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,460
6th frame
2nd throw

700
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,460

701
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,900
Yes, we definitely can

702
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,210
Ready, steady

703
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,070
Oh I think they've got it here

704
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,890
The yellow ball again...

705
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:12,700
Endo

706
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:12,700

Tanaka

708
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:12,700
Yamasaki

709
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:12,700
m 0 0 l 122 -1 l 124 138 l 0 138 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

710
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,270
The red ball

711
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,580
Uh oh, the yellow ball...

712
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,570
The yellow ball...

713
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,250
See... The yellow ball!

714
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,020
Oh it's going!

715
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:12,680
The yellow!

716
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,800
The yellow is going to get it!

717
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,210
That's amazing!

718
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,110
The yellow ball is amazing (Matsumoto's ball)

719
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,140
The yellow ball is amazing!

720
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,700
The yellow ball, Matsumoto-san!

721
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,010
Amazing!

722
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,630
It really is amazing!

723
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,310
This is getting really bad for me now, right?

724
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:31,360
Hamada

725
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:31,360
Matsumoto

726
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,080
Yeah, you need a strike and a spare soon...

727
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,140
You're right

728
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,940
Yeah, he really does

729
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,600
This is now seriously desperate times for me

730
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,540
The middle of the game

731
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,190
There's a big difference in the score and Hamada's expression is much more serious now

732
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,330
7th frame

733
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,330
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 28 l 0 28 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

734
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,600
Hold on, this is good

735
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,440
Yeey!

736
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,450
There it is!

737
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,730
He gets a strike here?!

738
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,660
Ready, steady

739
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,280
Oh shit

740
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:00,990
This is bad

741
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,560
Endo

742
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,560
Matsumoto

743
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,560
Tanaka

744
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,560
Yamasaki

745
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,560
m 0 0 l 122 -1 l 124 138 l 0 138 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

746
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,960
Yellow!

747
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,450
Yellow!

748
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,170
Oh my God!

749
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,500
That's great!

750
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,040
That was amazing

751
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,470
That was unbelievable just now!

752
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,070
The ball in the gutterwas totally helping the other ball

753
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,530
The ball in the gutter was totally  helping the other ball

754
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,530
The ball in the gutter was totally helping the other ball

755
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,750
It was pushing it away from the gutter

756
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,350
Like the whole time

757
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,550
That ball...

758
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,560
Yellow!

759
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,350
Oh my God!

760
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,230
Same as before, okay?

761
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,730
Okay

762
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,730
Ready, steady

763
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,290
Look

764
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,140
One's gone

765
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,800
Look at my ball, it's so good, isn't it?

766
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,430
Stay on!

767
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,630
Oh damn!

768
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,400
Yellow!

769
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,240
Curve!

770
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,910
Make a sharp turn!

771
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,390
Ah I see

772
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,080
So that's what happens...

773
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,520
What to do...

774
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,140
Hamada now needs to close the gap

775
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,140
8th frame
2nd throw

776
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,140
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

777
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,140
8th frame, 2nd throw

778
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,660
He got it

779
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,210
Nice shot

780
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:19,030
Hamada

781
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:19,030
Team Matsumoto

782
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,390
Oh yeah

783
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,070
4 pins' difference

784
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,700
This is...

785
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:06,850
We're in trouble

786
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,050
We are in trouble

787
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,040
What do we need to do?

788
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,170
We're in trouble, we're in trouble

789
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:09,990
Yeah you're right

790
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,600
You're fine

791
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,300
Hold on, it's not a 4-pin difference

792
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,180
Nope, we can't do it

793
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,950
Nope, we can't do it

794
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,800
No, you can't say that

795
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,830
It's not like you can't win from here

796
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,370
If we just stop here

797
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,370
It would still be deemed a draw

798
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,470
It would still be deemed a draw

799
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,640
Yes, it would be a draw

800
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,940
It would be indeed

801
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,080
So today would just be a draw

802
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,940
It would end as a draw

803
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,800
We'll leave it 'til next time

804
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,270
We'll leave it 'til next time

805
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,580
Another battle

806
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,010
We'll battle again next week

807
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,480
We'll battle again next week

808
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,810
Seriously, we are...

809
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:45,360
Hamada

810
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:45,360
Team Matsumoto

811
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,160
we are definitely losing right now

812
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,120
Yes, we are

813
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,320
We are losing

814
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,680
We are losing on morale as well

815
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,930
Because in the next frame, he will definitely get 5 pins at least

816
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,380
In the next frame, his total score will go above 100

817
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,070
It definitely will

818
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,540
Ready, steady

819
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,690
8th frame
1st throw

820
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,690
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0

821
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,270
Shit, hold on a second!

822
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,700
Oh shit, man!

823
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,910
I told you!

824
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,870
Endo

825
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,870
Matsumoto

826
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,870
Tanaka

827
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,870
Yamasaki

828
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,870
m 0 0 l 122 -1 l 124 138 l 0 138 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

829
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,340
It looks good

830
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,860
This is not bad

831
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,180
I think it's going to be good!

832
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,930
It's looking good!

833
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,550
Come on!!

834
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,450
YES!!!

835
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,910
Come on!

836
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,790
See, now it could swing either way

837
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,290
Hamada

838
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,290
Team Matsumoto

839
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,720
It was totally a missed throw

840
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,710
It was

841
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,020
This is literally comedian-power

842
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,330
It really is

843
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:23,860
As if we would agree to a rematch

844
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,130
As if we would agree to a rematch

845
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,360
Right?

846
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,020
We can do this

847
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,600
Thanks to the 9th frame, we now have no idea who will win this match

848
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,770
9th frame
2nd throw

849
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,770
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

850
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,740
Hamada

851
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,740
Team Matsumoto

852
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,160
Ready, steady

853
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,250
9th Frame
2nd throw

854
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,250
The bowling centre has allowed them to bowl like this. Please do not try this at home

855
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,250
m 0 0 l 140 -1 l 140 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

856
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,240
Oh shit

857
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,770
Again?

858
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,320
Go on, purple!!

859
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,170
Come on, purple!

860
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,210
Go on, purple!!

861
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,220
This is bad...

862
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,740
Go!

863
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,530
It should be okay

864
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,120
Oh man...

865
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:06,300
Hamada

866
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:06,300
Team Matsumoto

867
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,200
I have no idea who's going to win, there's only a 5-pin difference

868
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,530
I'm the one at a disadvantage here

869
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,550
A spare is crucial here for you, Hamada-san

870
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,750
You're right

871
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,700
A spare is a must here

872
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,080
Hamada looks nervous and goes into his last frame

873
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,980
Final frame

874
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,980
m 0 0 l 150 -1 l 150 28 l 0 28 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

875
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,310
This is good

876
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,230
That's amazing

877
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,630
Hamada

878
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,630
Team Matsumoto

879
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,200
THIS IS BAD!

880
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,550
This is really bad

881
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,550
He's amazing

882
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,370
But guys, you know...

883
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,670
When I go bowling with him,

884
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,360
at the end, he tends to get 3 strikes in a row

885
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,280
That's not good, if he does that, we are just...

886
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,030
We can't have that!

887
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,050
He didn't get a strike on his 2nd throw, but...

888
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,110
Final frame
3rd throw

889
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,110
m 0 0 l 150 -1 l 150 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

890
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,790
He got it

891
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,200
He got it

892
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,690
Oh for sure...

893
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,880
He got a spare and he finishes on a total of 133.

894
00:22:49,110 --> 00:23:01,930
Hamada

895
00:22:49,110 --> 00:23:01,930
Team Matsumoto

896
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,260
Even if we get a strike or a spare here,

897
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,190
we only get another shot, so we are finished.

898
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,240
It would be really tough

899
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,370
We have to get a strike or spare in the first two shots

900
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,110
Yeah, you're right

901
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,070
It's going to be impossible

902
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,450
We're counting on you...

903
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,590
Yeah, sorry but if you could...

904
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,130
It's virtually impossible so if you could...

905
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,470
It's virtually impossible so if you could...

906
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,710
Unfortunately, we are going to have to carry this on another time...

907
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,390
It's such a shame

908
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,100
What the hell, man?

909
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,770
Us four men thought about it and this was the result

910
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,790
Yes, indeed

911
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,300
So you know

912
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,240
Nothing and no one can change our mind

913
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,180
No no, the result isn't final so just go and do it

914
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,880
Whatever happens, they need a strike or a spare

915
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,210
Finally, the time to decide the winner

916
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,450
Here we go

917
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,830
Get small and tight

918
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,380
Ready, steady

919
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,540
Go

920
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,270
Purple

921
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,180
It's up to purple!

922
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,970
It's up to purple... uh oh!

923
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,510
The purple one...

924
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,010
Come on, purple!

925
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,990
Oh no, the purple ball!

926
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,690
Okay, come on, purple!

927
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,810
Come on, purple!

928
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,490
Go, purple!

929
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,730
Okay yellow, knock it over!

930
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,890
Yellow, get it!

931
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,410
We are in serious trouble now!

932
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:17,600
Hamada

933
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:17,600
Team Matsumoto

934
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,230
We need to get it

935
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,220
We just need to knock it down

936
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,220
So knock it down...

937
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,370
But that alone isn't enough

938
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,620
We need to knock it down and then get 5 in the final throw, oh shit that is tough!

939
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:24,110
Get a spare on the second throw

940
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:24,110
Then knock 6 pins over on the final throw

941
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:24,110
m 0 0 l 590 -1 l 590 120 l 0 120 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

942
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,670
So get this one and then knock over 6...

943
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,260
That's fine, right?

944
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,320
and then 6 more to win?

945
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,650
Can we get that one?

946
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,980
The pin right on the side...

947
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,780
That one is difficult to get

948
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,920
Okay then, we are going to...

949
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,780
get the professional to throw for us

950
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,330
Great idea!

951
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,160
I see!

952
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,300
Please, for us

953
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,350
We're counting on you

954
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,140
We're using our chance card

955
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,350
Please

956
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,000
We're counting on you

957
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,590
Let's use it

958
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,460
We were going to use you at the 6th frame

959
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,200
But we decided to use you here

960
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,310
You can't miss on purpose though!

961
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,170
That would be mean

962
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,920
It really would

963
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
You can't do that

964
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,250
Just shut the hell up and throw

965
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,250
No but seriously, should we all aim for that one pin?

966
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,510
What, all of us?

967
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,110
I think we should all just aim for it

968
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,470
If we all aim for it, I'm pretty sure the

969
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,250
result will be disastrous

970
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,140
No, but if you calculate the probabilities of hitting the pin,

971
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,460
we should all just aim for it

972
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,640
I think so

973
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,280
that's definitely the right way to go about this

974
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,290
I don't think we can have balls missing the

975
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,920
pin on purpose at this stage

976
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,640
I think we should work individually whilst as a team

977
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,760
Let's go with that

978
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,600
As long as one of our balls hit

979
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,670
We should go with probability here...

980
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,350
He really isn't feeling it, huh?

981
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,740
I'm sorry but I have to feel it

982
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,190
No I totally get it

983
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,920
If we don't get the result we want here

984
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,210
I will end up hating all of you

985
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,910
I will end up hating all of you

986
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,890
I'm sorry

987
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,990
Just out of curiosity, what is your plan?

988
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,560
What do you think?

989
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,210
What do you think?

990
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,030
I think we should do what we've been doing the whole time

991
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,680
I think we should do the same thing we've done since  the start

992
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,520
I think we should do the same thing we've done since the start

993
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,580
I think we should do the same thing we've done since the start

994
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,760
But if we do it that way and we fail

995
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,250
I would feel really responsible for our loss and I don't want that

996
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,500
So let's talk it through together

997
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,780
Wait, we did do that

998
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,250
We did talk through it

999
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,040
and it's 3 vs 1

1000
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,090
If we count up our votes...

1001
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,160
So just on this throw, we all aim for that pin?

1002
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,720
Just direct your feelings to that pin

1003
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,340
You're right

1004
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,750
Let's go for it

1005
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,930
Wait, isn't it a bit too far to the right?

1006
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,540
Was there ever a pin that close to the edge?

1007
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,610
Was there ever a pin that close to the edge?

1008
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,160
No seriously...

1009
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,370
It has changed positions a bit

1010
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,520
Let's check it, seriously

1011
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,380
Seriously, it's not in the correct position

1012
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,210
Wait, even if it is, it's because the pin from before nudged it a bit...

1013
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,600
I agree...

1014
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,750
I guess...

1015
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,460
It's not been out of position from the start...

1016
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,060
It really is as he says...

1017
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,950
Here we go

1018
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,940
Okay then ready st-...

1019
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,550
What the hell, man?

1020
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,030
Together

1021
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,110
Seriously, let's do this properly

1022
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,480
Yes, of course, of course!

1023
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,810
Of course

1024
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,720
Ready, steady

1025
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,710
Final frame
2nd throw

1026
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,710
m 0 0 l 150 -1 l 150 52 l 0 52 l 0 357 l 0 2 l 0 2

1027
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,480
Oh shit, mine's gone

1028
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,290
NO NO, OH SHIT!

1029
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,920
Yes, you won!

1030
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,820
Hamada

1031
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,820
Team Matsumoto

1032
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,740
Come on!

1033
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,720
Well that's that!!

1034
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,600
Team Matsumoto

1035
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,520
BATSU GAME!

1036
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,830
Team Matsumoto Batsu game!

1037
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,170
You know

1038
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,620
We were doing so well as a team

1039
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,990
Right at the end, we became individuals

1040
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,180
You're right

1041
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,400
That's so true

1042
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,740
That was what was wrong

1043
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,540
That was what was wrong

1044
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,370
It's no good to

1045
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,110
think of us even  as a family

1046
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,540
think of us even as a family

1047
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,160
Why..?

1048
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,720
They're really getting lectured

1049
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,150
So I'm going to slap you guys now

1050
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:17,680
So I'm going to slap you guys now

1051
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,650
So I'm going to slap you guys now

1052
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,460
It can't be helped; stand up

1053
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,690
Apparently he wants to see us getting slapped

1054
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,790
Apparently he wants to see us getting slapped

1055
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,350
All of us

1056
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,390
Shall I slap you guys? Matsumoto included

1057
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,620
No, we are quite okay

1058
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,790
Shall I slap you guys? Matsumoto included

1059
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,940
Wait, what? Why?

1060
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,700
He just wants to slap someone...

1061
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,530
He just wants to slap

1062
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,570
He just wants to slap

1063
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,950
Because you lost as well

1064
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,230
Yeah, come to think of it, you lost too, why the hell are you slapping them?

1065
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,750
Oh shit, he's coming over here

1066
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,170
You've lost as well

1067
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,350
Oh shit

1068
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,050
Line up!

1069
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,700
He's coming

1070
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,650
This is so wrong

1071
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,460
This wasn't in the agreement

1072
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,880
Line up, line up now

1073
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,490
This is just...

1074
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,180
This wasn't in the agreement...

1075
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,060
Don't complain

1076
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,680
Hold on a second

1077
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,360
So we got slapped and have to do a Batsu game?

1078
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,200
So we got slapped and have to do a Batsu game?
