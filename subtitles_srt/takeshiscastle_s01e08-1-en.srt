1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,170
THIS PROGRAM WAS PRODUCED
UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MEDICAL EXPERTS,

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,870
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HEALTH
AND SAFETY OF THE STAFF AND CONTESTANTS.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,900
Charge!

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,330
Takeshi's Castle has been revived
after 34 years.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,000
The exploits of the deadly attacking army
have been full of laughter

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,300
and tears,

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,100
as well as other strange emotions.

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,630
It's been a spectacle
of great proportions.

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,500
I made it!

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,700
I will destroy you!

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,170
Takeshi's army fought like demons
on the defense

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,600
and kicked the attacking army
to the ground.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,400
There you go!

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
THE COUNT
BEAT TAKESHI

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,630
And Takeshi, the count,
has reappeared after 34 years.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,200
What are you doing, stupid?

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,030
I'm not some singer with a flashy costume.

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,900
The attacking force is
plotting the fall of Takeshi's Castle.

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,570
The story is about to reach its climax.

20
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,430
ARMY VS TAKESHI

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,570
The final chapter of Takeshi's Castle
is about to begin!

22
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,000
TAKESHI'S CASTLE

23
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,770
TAKESHI'S CASTLE
THE COUNT'S TOWER

24
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,400
Count, we have the Devil's Domain next.

25
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,830
-It's so nostalgic.
-You remember it very well.

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,430
This game has been made
more difficult, too.

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,100
I'll show you how hard it's become.

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,530
Let's watch!

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,200
-There's the film director.
-The film director?

30
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,530
I need to say hello to him.

31
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,670
NAOMASA MUSAKA

32
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,070
Director, good morning.

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,800
Thank you for having me here today.

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,430
Good morning!

35
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,200
What is Mr. Musaka doing?

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,500
The attacking army has been advancing
in two separate directions.

37
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,430
There are 60 survivors.

38
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,530
Twenty-seven of them
will take on the Devil's Domain.

39
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,300
You have done well, my elites.

40
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,100
Now you will take on
the Super Devil's Domain.

41
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,630
-Wow. It's rotating.
-Yeah.

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,300
-What's that?
-Not many of us are left now.

43
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,200
You can do this. Good luck! All right?

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,770
Oh, no! Not good! This door won't open!

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,970
SUPER DEVIL'S DOMAIN
DIFFICULTY RATING: 126%

46
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,870
This is the Devil's Domain.

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,500
There are devils lurking inside.

48
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,870
-Also, look! It's become harder.
-What?

49
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,970
It's rotating!

50
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,000
It's rotating.
You'll never know which way to go.

51
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,730
-Let me tell you again.
-No need!

52
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,370
-We're gonna crush them, got it?
-Yes!

53
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,670
Hey, you! Don't let anyone through!

54
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,000
HIROOKI GOTO - JUSHIN LIGER
NATSUKO TOURA

55
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,830
I won't let you through.

56
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,500
Just see if you can get past.

57
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,900
-Right!
-Don't get smart with me!

58
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,100
The Devil's Domain, which caused a fury
at Ueda Castle,

59
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,400
has become much harder
with the addition of a rotating maze.

60
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,130
Once you get in there, you won't know
which is the way to the goal.

61
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,370
I'm YoYo and I'm hyper,
so I'll run straight through!

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,630
Charge!

63
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,870
They're standing on top.

64
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,270
No fair. They can see where you are
from there.

65
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,200
They'll find you.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,830
-You need to run fast.
-Yeah.

67
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,300
-She made herself fall. I see.
-That's how it works.

68
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,430
She dug herself into a hole.

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,030
He's laughing.

70
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,500
Looks like he's having fun.

71
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,730
Charge!

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,670
Good luck!

73
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,730
MASATO YOSHIHARA (28)

74
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,930
It's time to show you what we've got.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Yeah. Please show it to us.

76
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,800
START - GOAL

77
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,400
Get him!

78
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,630
THE FOURTH STRONGHOLD
SUPER DEVIL'S DOMAIN

79
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,500
NINJAS ON TOP ATTACK THROW WATER BALLOONS

80
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,970
-He escaped.
-He's fast.

81
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,170
-They've got him.
-Run! He couldn't.

82
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,870
On his good-looking face.

83
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,300
They're ganging up on him.

84
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,230
No need to throw him like that!

85
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,070
-It's so rough.
-But the way they throw him is funny.

86
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,270
It is.

87
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,970
HAVE YOU WATCHED TAKESHI'S CASTLE?

88
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,400
Yes, since I was a child.

89
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,330
I really enjoyed watching it
with my family.

90
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,770
Erica is from Spain and loves cosplay.

91
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,730
It says "Foreign Five," but it has become
"Foreign One" now.

92
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,800
Charge!

93
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,670
Good luck!

94
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,470
-I don't think anyone can make it.
-Right.

95
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,000
SUPPORT ENGINEER, SPAIN
ERICA MARTINEZ, 30

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,130
Get her!

97
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,600
Get her!

98
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,100
GOAL

99
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,900
-I fell!
-Oh, no!

100
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,930
So close.

101
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,400
Erica from Spain...

102
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,900
-She did well at avoiding them.
-Nearly there!

103
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,270
-If it had rotated a bit more...
-Exactly!

104
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,100
If she had opened the next door,
she'd have reached the goal.

105
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,570
Almost there!

106
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,200
If only you'd opened the door
a few seconds later.

107
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,630
-I chose the wrong door.
-What a shame.

108
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,000
In Super Devil's Domain,
apart from the rotating maze...

109
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,970
DEVIL #1, 2, 3, 4 - UNCLE MUSAKA
PARKOUR NINJA #1, 2

110
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,630
... there also are more devils
chasing the challengers.

111
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,770
WORLD RANKING BEACH TENNIS PLAYER
NAOAKI YAMAMOTO (32)

112
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,600
Many challengers are caught
right at the start.

113
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,570
So many of them!

114
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,570
Will anyone be able to reach the goal?

115
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,270
This is a very unreasonable game.

116
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,630
POLE CHAMPION
KEIKO TAKEMOTO

117
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,930
I feel like I've been
in a dream world all this time.

118
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,800
Maejima has loved Takeshi's Castle
for 18 years.

119
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,400
TAKESHI'S CASTLE
HISTORY MUSEUM

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,900
He runs a website with all kinds
of information on Takeshi's Castle.

121
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,070
There's lots of data
on the Devil's Domain.

122
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,930
He's well prepared.

123
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,700
I'll conquer the Devil's Domain...

124
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,800
It gets out of control.
I'll turn the sound on when I shoot it.

125
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,330
Sure.

126
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,130
-He's a rabid fan.
-Yeah.

127
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,870
He's a Takeshi's Castle fanatic.

128
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,900
It's not like that!

129
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,930
What is he doing?

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,130
SATOSHI MAEJIMA (35)

131
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,870
-That's Toka's gag.
-I see.

132
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,100
Toka's gag...

133
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,230
-He knows which way to go.
-He's prepared.

134
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,670
He runs through strategically.

135
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,930
-Look for him!
-Go, go!

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,030
GOAL

137
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,930
He did it!

138
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,970
What?

139
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,930
Fantastic!

140
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,070
DEVIL'S EYE VIEW

141
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,130
Look for him!

142
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,400
-Did he clear that?
-The devils were just behind him, though.

143
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,900
-Amazing!
-Did I clear it? Did I?

144
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,370
Maejima displayed surprising agility
and escaped from the devils.

145
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,300
You cleared it, no doubt!

146
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,630
-Great job!
-I did it!

147
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,970
He is a rabid fan.

148
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,100
I did it!

149
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,130
I'm such a big fan of Takeshi's Castle
and wanted to clear no matter what.

150
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,270
-I'm so glad I survived. I did it!
-Congrats!

151
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,370
If I clear this,
I'll get a free beef dinner.

152
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,770
-Who will buy it?
-I'll get Peking duck.

153
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,730
Barbecue for me.

154
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,500
We'll get the rest of them!

155
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,630
Charge!

156
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,770
Good luck!

157
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,000
Here I am in Takeshi's Castle!

158
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll do my best!

159
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,670
MIYUKO ISAKA (21)

160
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,570
I've got you! I'm the one who got you!

161
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,070
Already?

162
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,330
I got her!

163
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,400
No!

164
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,830
-Why is he there?
-Oh, no!

165
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,570
-All right. Here!
-That's too bad.

166
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,300
That's too bad.

167
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,600
The remaining members
of the Female College Student Team

168
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,000
were caught instantly.

169
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,370
They won't get a nice dinner, after all.

170
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,230
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM
EVE HANIUDA (22)

171
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,130
-I bumped into Mr. Musaka right away.
-Did he get you?

172
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,530
"I got her!"

173
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,730
So sweet.

174
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,600
Here he comes.

175
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,830
Kasuga, do you have any plans?

176
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,100
-Any plans?
-Yes.

177
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,500
I just need to get through.

178
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,870
I just need to go from here to there.

179
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,970
Toos!

180
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,170
Kasuga betrayed Takeshi's army
and joined the attacking army,

181
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,270
but failed to live up to expectations.

182
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,700
Will he be able
to perform better this time?

183
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,600
Good luck!

184
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,500
Looks great. It's a nice house.

185
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,600
Let's visit this house.

186
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,330
Super Devil's Domain.
Please let me in. Toos!

187
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
All right.

188
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,530
-What was that?
-I hope he clears at least one game.

189
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,200
It's like my own TV program
where I visit houses.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,570
COMIC, AUDREY
TOSHIAKI KASUGA (43)

191
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,400
-Hey...
-He closed the door. Run!

192
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,730
The devils are gathering.

193
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,630
Run away! Run!

194
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,970
What? Is he running away?

195
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,770
They've got him.

196
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,800
Get him!

197
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,130
Let me go!

198
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,170
Don't move!

199
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,800
They've got him.

200
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,570
This is Kasuga's
fourth consecutive failure.

201
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,530
Now he'll be kicked out of
Takeshi's Castle after being of no help.

202
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,170
Get out!

203
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,830
He was airborne.

204
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,800
This is what a traitor gets, stupid!

205
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,070
Kasuga! Just float there forever!

206
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,030
You were calm at first,
then you were running like this.

207
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,530
FAILED

208
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,070
Well...

209
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,730
I had no chance at all...

210
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,430
So far, the only survivor is Maejima,
a rabid Takeshi's Castle fan.

There you go!

225
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,900
The last challenger
from the attacking army is...

226
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,300
It's him.

227
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,970
Yamaguchi, a super high school student
who has cleared all the games so far.

228
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,770
He's a keen runner who became
the Nagano champion in the 100 meters

229
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,600
when he was in his third year
of junior high school.

230
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,700
-Are you enjoying Takeshi's Castle?
-Very much.

231
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,000
It's the most fun
I've ever had in my life.

232
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,470
Really?

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,030
Charge! I'm counting on you!

234
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,730

HARU'S FATHER
MINORU

238
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,200
GOAL

239
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,270
There!

240
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
-He's fast!
-This way!

241
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,770
Awesome!

242
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,230
Wow! He did it!

243
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,000
-Haru! Haru!
-There!

244
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,870
-There he is! This way!
-He's fast!

245
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,500
He's so young.

246
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,330
-What was that?
-Others would just fall once outside.

247
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,030
He's amazing!

248
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,300
What? Blow the whistle?

249
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,800
I did it!

250
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:41,300
This high school student got through
the maze in only eight seconds.

251
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,330
He has now cleared the sixth stronghold!

252
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,100
It seemed like you jumped at an angle.

253
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,900
I thought they would catch me
if I went back.

254
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,770
The devils were right behind me,
so I jumped.

255
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,930
-You cleared it beautifully! Congrats!
-Thank you!

256
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,800
I did it!

257
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,500
In Super Devil's Domain,
the attacking army did very well.

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,130
Two challengers survived.

259
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,900
TWO SURVIVORS

260
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,530
-Please let me play this character again.
-Sure.

261
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,730
-I'll reject other offers.
-Thank you.

262
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,000
Count, I'll be back.

263
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,870
Thank you for having me today.

264
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,500
The battle against Count Takeshi
is almost here.

265
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,570
Do your best to advance!

266
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,200
What was Mr. Musaka doing here?

267
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,330
Because I asked him
to come to Mt. Midoriyama,

268
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,500
maybe he thought this was a film shoot.

269
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,770
He thought this was an acting job?

270
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,970
Yeah. Isn't he having a big fight
with his agent right now?

271
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,900
Next, we have
The Bridge Over the Battlefield.

272
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,770
This one has become much harder, too.

273
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,070
Let's take a look!

274
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,400
SUPER BRIDGE OVER THE BATTLEFIELD
DIFFICULTY RATING: 142%

275
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,730
The bar is on a rampage in this game.

276
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,000
This time, this man is the one in charge.

277

COMIC
EIKO KANO

278
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,430
To say the least,
the whole reason I got into showbiz

279
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,400
was to use that bar.

280
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,700
It will be the culmination
of my entire 20-year career

281
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,830
to perform with that bar.

282
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,270
What does that bar mean to you, Eiko Kano?

283
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,670
It's my family.

284
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,670
So hot!

285
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,030
You surprised me!

286
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,070
-You got me!
-It's done.

287
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,170
My back feels so hot.

288
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,070
You have done well, my elites.

289
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,470
This is Super Bridge over the Battlefield.

290
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,700
-Isn't it really high?
-Yes, it is.

291
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,500
It's a tough one,
but I believe you can do it. Go for it.

292
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,700
Charge!

293
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,100
General Tani is so energetic. "Charge!"

294
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,300
This is Super Bridge Over the Battlefield.

295
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,700
It's nicely lit.

296
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,170
-We don't know how it got super hard.
-It's very high.

297
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,400
But we'll be super hyper, too!

298
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,100
-Thank you.
-You aren't very excited.

299
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,700
Charge!

300
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,330
-Let me try. Thank you!
-Good luck!

ATHLETE
YUME MOSES (34)

302
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,370
He's so fast.

303
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,330
He went down.

304
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,130
-It's quite high.
-It is.

305
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,600
Aren't you going too fast?

306
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,900
Didn't he go too fast?

307
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,800
In this game, you need to line up
the "Bingo" triangle with the surfboard.

308
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,330
Yume Moses went way past the finish line.

309
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,970
This team with an average age
of 50 have gone all out.

310

The Hibiya Club
takes on the challenge next.

311
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,300
Are you still up for it?

312
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,730
-We're tenacious.
-Yes, we are.

313
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,530
That's the only good thing about us.

314
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,630
We'll try our best!

315
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,230
Charge!

316
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,930

Too weak.

320
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,670
What?

321
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,900
You should've pulled back the bar, Kano!

322
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,600
This is so uncool.

323
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,100
You need to push yourself much harder!

324
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,600
Kano also knocks them down.

325
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,370
That was so uncool.

326
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,270
Are you really up for this?

327
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,100
Let him move farther down!

328
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,600
Charge!

329
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,930
I'll try my best!

330
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,900
It's a girl.
Maybe I'll let her go through.

We've got one million subscribers!

352
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,330
Charge!

353
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,530
MANARUTAI - TAKKA

354
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,230
What?

355
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,230
There? He pushes you over there?

356
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,700
It's Makabe.

357
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,170
There you go!

358
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,070
Both Dai and Keita failed miserably.

359
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,600
COMEDY VIDEO CREATOR
MANARUTAI - DAI

360
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,270
-Do you want me to push you back?
-Yes, please!

361
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,530
-Since you're so close...
-Sure. Please!

362
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
No way, stupid!

363
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,370
COMEDY VIDEO CREATOR
MANARUTAI - KEITA

364
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,130
No one in the attacking army has cleared.

365
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,070
How about a Sasuke finalist?

366
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,230
Charge!

367
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,900
I'll make a miracle happen!

368
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:29,930
SASUKE FINALIST
TOMOHIRO KAWAGUCHI (40)

369
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,030
Please don't... Yes, yes.

370
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,900
Please! Yes, right there!
You've crossed it!

371
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,500
-Did I cross it?
-Yes, yes. No, go forward!

372
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,970
-No! A little bit this way!
-What?

373
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,430
-What are you doing?
-What?

374
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,870
If you push too hard, you'll fall.

375
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,770
Charge!

376
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,900
I'll stop right there!

377
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,700
BUSINESS OWNER
TOMOYA NAKAMURA (45)

378
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,070
He went through.

379
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,830
-He can't make it.
-He's good!

380
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,430
-He will make it!
-Looks good!

381
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,570
Is that okay?

382
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:22,930
NAKAMURA'S SON
TOMOKI

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,870
He made it?

384
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,230
-So close!
-He did it?

385
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,130
What?

386
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,100
-Almost there.
-That should be okay.

387
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,370
Only this far away.

388
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,930
-What?
-What shall we do? Shall we push him back?

389
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,430
Push him back!

390
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,670
Shall I?

391
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,830
Okay! Okay!

392
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,830
Okay, fall now!

393
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,170
-What?
-No way!

394
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,030
That's too harsh!

395
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,030
-Too harsh!
-Why?

396
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,070
Just that by much? He failed?

397
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,870
Isn't that acceptable?

398
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,800
How hard does it have to be?

399
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,870
Since he touched the bar a little,

400
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,670
he had a very good speed.

401
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,570
-I see.
-That bar was actually good.

402
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,230
Isn't this acceptable?

403
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,900
This is all right.

404
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,030
It's not acceptable to have to be
lined up perfectly in this game!

405
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,670
That will never happen!

406
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,530
Is Takeshi's Castle that unreasonable?

407
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,000
-You shouldn't say that.
-But enjoy yourself.

408
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,800
Sure. I'm happy.

409
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,900
-Well done! Thank you!
-Thanks!

410
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,900
No one in the attacking army
has cleared so far.

411
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,530
Will there be anyone who can stop
at the perfect spot and clear the game?

Let's see a miracle.

428
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,170
The miracle is in my hands.

429
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,300
Good luck!

430
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:24,470
The last challenger is Mayaya, who's been
looking for love in Takeshi's Castle.

431
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,570
-She's been looking for a boyfriend.
-I see.

432
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:32,870
God of romance, bless me with love!

433
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Charge! Good luck!

434
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,430
I'm Mayaya! I'll get only "bingo"!

435

DANCE DUO
MAYAYA (35)

436
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,600
Mayaya. What's gonna happen?

437
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,630
-She slowed down a little.
-Yeah.

438
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,630
She can't make it.

439
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,970
Please! I'm sorry!

440
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,730
-You're quite far from the finish line.
-Wait! You're such a handsome guy.

441
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,630
-Me?
-Yes.

442
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,530
You think so?

443
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,200
-He has a mask.
-I like you a lot!

444
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,270
-Really?
-Sorry, no!

445
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,570
Please stop it. Please!

446
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,600
-I like you so much!
-Is he adjusting it?

447
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,470
No, mister!

448
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,330
Are you deeply in love with me?

449
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,330
I love you from the bottom of my heart!

450
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
She said she loves me!

451
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,730
It can't be true.
They just met a second ago.

452
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,300
Mister, please stop. Be nice to me.

453
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,470
Is it a "bingo"?

454
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,770
Let me see what a winner sees.

455
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,170
-Okay!
-Ready?

456
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,070
Bingo!

457
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,130
What? Really?

458
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,930
Did she clear it? She did it!

459
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,430
She cleared it?

460
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,970
Just like that?

461
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,930
Bingo!

462
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,530
If she cleared,
then so did that guy earlier.

463
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,370
Bingo!

464
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,030
Mayaya stopped farther
from the finish line.

465
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:03,700
Somehow she talked Liger into it
and she cleared the game!

466
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,530
What's going on?

467
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,700
I'd never said "I love you"
to anyone in my life.

468
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,530
It was your first time?

469
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,870
I said "I love you" for the first time.

470
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,900
You did?

471
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,300
You're saying he's the one for you, then?

472
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,670
Yes, he is. I'll marry him!

473
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,400
-Really? Congratulations!
-What is this?

474
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,730
Thank you!

475
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,870
What is going on?

476
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,400
ONE SURVIVOR

477
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,100
She's the only one who survived.

478
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,700
The challengers are being wiped out
one after another in these fierce battles.

479
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,270
Will anyone make it
to the battle against Count Takeshi?

480
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,630
-Count, how was it?
-What was that?

481
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,900
Why did she call him a handsome man?

482
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,830
She can't tell if he is.

483
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,730
He wears a mask. But it was a tough game.

484
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,930
-It has to be perfect.
-No chance.

485
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
-Shouldn't we have a bonus area?
-Yes.

486
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,600
We should've let the first guy
go through instead.

487
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,600
It was a tough game. But now we know
that kind of thing happens.

488
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,130
-I see.
-For your information.

489
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,670
-So if you beg for it, you might clear it.
-What kind of game is that?

490
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,500
The next game is also controversial.
Loser Resurrection.

491
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,400
-Let's have a look.
-Okay.

492
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,800
It's the final battle of Takeshi's Castle.
Only two strongholds remain.

493
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,930
To increase the forces to bring down
the main castle,

494
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,070
a Loser Resurrection took place.

495
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,230
I don't want Takeshi's Castle to end.

496
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,370
After being together for such a long time
every day,

497
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,030
I've grown very fond of you all
and I'm already sad to say goodbye.

498
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,530
We'll be shooting shortly.

499
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,630
God, I'm so nervous!

500
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,430
At this new stronghold, 50 people will try
to return to the front line.

501
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,200
MUDDY SPLASH

502
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,000
DAISUKE SHIBA

503
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,230
In this muddy pond,
there are these capsules.

504
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,300
If you open them,

505
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,500
-you'll find "Win."
-Or "Lose."

506
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,630
They are Mogrider.

507
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,900
-Who will win?
-Who will it be? Good luck!

508
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,300
-Muddy Splash.
-Start!

509
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,270
Go, go!

510
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,830
If you find a capsule with a "Win" note,
you'll return to the front line.

511
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:41,530
FIND A CAPSULE IN THE MUD
AND BRING IT TO MOGRIDER

512
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,130
He's fast.

513
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,600
-He's got it.
-The capsules are hard to find.

514
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,000
All right!

515
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,300
You need to bring it to him.

516
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,870
THE FIRST 30 PEOPLE TO FIND ONE
RETURN TO THE FRONT LINE

517
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,030
Only 30 people.

518
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,470
-I've got it. It says "Win"!
-Hurry!

519
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,730
It does?

520
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,730
Yes!

521
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,770
RETURN TO THE FRONT

522
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,870
Already?

523
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,470
It says "Lose"!

524
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,270
-"Lose."
-You can go back if you don't get a "Win."

525
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,370
-There must be a lot of capsules.
-It's great.

526
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,600
She did it!

527
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,530
You did it!

528
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,570
You need to get a note that says "Win"
from the muddy pond.

529
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,770
Only those lucky few can go back
to the front line.

530
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,430
That is this game, Muddy Splash!

531
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,330
-It says "Lose."
-Damn it!

532
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,730
It says "Lose."

533
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,370
Our staff just want them to get dirty.

534
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,430
-"Win"!
-Yeah!

535
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,430
He did it. There he goes.

536
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,000
He's a Sasuke member.

537
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,800
-Please!
-It's "Lose."

538
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,700
It's "Lose."

539
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,230
NURSE
EMIKO KANNO

540
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,130
BOYS AND MEN
YUKIHISA TAMURA (31)

541
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,170
Wow. We can't see his face.

542
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,400
I did it!

543
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,870
RETURN TO THE FRONT

544
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,830
Getting muddy is fantastic!

545
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,270
RETURN TO THE FRONT

546
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,700
-We all did it!
-We did it!

547
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,970
I did it!

548
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,530
RETURN TO THE FRONT

549
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,770
There is a long line
to wait for the judgment.

550
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,830
All you can do is hope
you get your turn before other winners.

551
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,270
Even waiting in line, you'll lose
if 30 people get through first.

552
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,530
-Hurry!
-Five more!

553
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,570
Hurry up!

554
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:19,000
Only a few more will get through
to the next stronghold.

555
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,700
FIVE MORE PEOPLE

556
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,370
I watched you on Sasuke
when I was in junior high school.

557
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,630
Sorry, Mr. Yamamoto. It's "Lose."

558
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,870
Hurry up!

559
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:32,130
-Hurry up! Come on!
-It's Cherry.

560
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,130
Cherry, shut up!

561
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,470
Not many left.

562
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,570
TWO MORE PEOPLE

563
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,800
-I don't want to lose.
-This one's a "Lose."

564
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,270
I know you don't wanna lose.

565
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,730
ONE MORE PERSON

566
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,800
-It's over!
-Is it?

567
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,170
They've counted 30 people.

568
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,830
I had this one, though...

569
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,830
FAILED

570
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,170
I wish he could've read it out quicker.

571
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,370
He was talking nonsense.

572
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,300
He's so right.

573
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,270
You were too slow.

574
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,830
Oh, dear... He's being attacked. Oh, no.

575
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,600
They took Shiba...

576
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,200
But I'm a successful comedian!

577
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,530
It doesn't matter, stupid!

578
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,670
Because you work too slow,
we couldn't get our turn.

579
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,830
You're talking nonsense!

580
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,000
It's "Lose."

581
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,970
MASATO YOSHIHARA (28)

582
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,870
I have no luck!

583
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,300
HIBIYA CLUB
YOSHIO YODA (60)

584
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,800
I didn't make it.

585
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,770
It's "Win!" Damn it!

586
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,100
SASUKE
TOMOHIRO KAWAGUCHI (40)

587
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,530
It was "Win!"

588
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,630
Mogrider was angrily retaliated against
by the eliminated members

589
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,370
and, along with a pin microphone,
were covered in mud.

590
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,900
Is the pin microphone okay?

591
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,500
-No. It's broken.
-I see.

592
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,670
It's bad, right? I'm not sure, though.

593
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,070
So, 30 people returned to the front line
from the mud.

594
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,300
The final battle is almost here.

595
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,570
30 people have returned.

596
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,470
The attacking army has succeeded
in bringing challengers back.

597
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:15,100
There're two more strongholds left.
Go for it, challengers!

598
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,630
Are there more challengers
who returned to the front line?

599
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,730
So many chances in Loser Resurrection.

600
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,630
Many losers are back, too.

601
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,000
-It's like... in Asakusa.
-Asakusa's...

602
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,970
There were more and more people
until it grew to over 20,000.

603
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,930
Like going back to wait in line?

604
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,430
Shiba from Mogrider
was pushed into the mud afterwards.

605
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,600
I think it broke a pin microphone
and he was told off.

606
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,600
That's different from the old comedians.

607
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:47,200
The old ones would say, "Stop it!"
while taking off their microphones.

608
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,630
-"Stop it, stop it!" and remove it.
-Right.

609
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,670
While shouting "Stop it,"
they wound it up and gave it to the staff.

610
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,700
They even wound it up?

611
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:02,030
The attacking army is just one battle away
from a showdown with Takeshi.

612
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,600
You have done well, my elites.

613
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:10,370
Look at the game behind you.
It's Super Strong Arms.

614
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,870
We also have From Right and Left.

615
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:18,870
I believe you can do it.
Good luck. All right?

616
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:33,170
SUPER STRONG ARMS AND FROM RIGHT AND LEFT
DIFFICULTY RATING: 120%

617
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,070
I won't let anyone through.

618
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,000
Remember that! I have three!

619
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,330
MOGRIDER
DAISUKE SHIBA AND TOMOSHIGE

620
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,470
-And four!
-I'm scared.

621
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,830
COMEDIAN
YOSHIAKI UMEGAKI

622
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,230
-Is that Umegaki?
-Yes.

623
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,130
MR. SHACHIHOKO

624
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,430
-She's a big name.
-All right!

625
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,700
-Is he Shachihoko?
-Leave it to Takeshi's Castle!

626
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,830
-Ms. Akko?
-Akiko Wada?

627
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,870
She's here, too?

628
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,770
COMEDIAN
KOUME DAYU

629
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,230
It's Koume!

630
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,170
-Damn it!
-It's Koume.

631
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,400
What's happening?

632
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,000
-Awesome!
-Look at them!

633
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,200
Three men dressed as women.

634
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:11,300
Two tough games have been combined.

635
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:15,600
Only one challenger has cleared
From Right and Left so far.

636
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,800
It's the toughest game yet.

637
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:23,030
The attacking army has reached the climax
of the battle against Takeshi's army.

638
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,070
Only challengers who clear this game
will go through to the finale battle.

639
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,500
How will the challengers do?

640
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,030
The first challenger is from
acrobatic video creator group AUN,

641
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,030
who have put on quite a show so far.

642
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,830
I will conquer this!

643
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
ACROBATIC VIDEO CREATORS
AUN

644
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,470
Kanta is the only one in the group
who has survived.

645
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,730
With the skills that got him
through Strong Arms so beautifully,

646
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,130
will he be the first one
to clear this game?

647
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,570
Charge! Good luck!

648
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,400
-Wait for me, Takeshi!
-Okay!

649
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,430
Kanta! Kanta!

650
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,970
THE SIXTH STRONGHOLD
SUPER STRONG ARM AND FROM RIGHT AND LEFT

651
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,900
CROSS THE WOBBLY BRIDGE
WHILE DODGING THE BARS

652
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:06,930
He made it through!

653
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:13,270
ACROBATIC VIDEO CREATOR
AUN - KANTA

654
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,370
Fantastic!

655
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,630
He did it!

656
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,570
Great! You did it!

657
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,670
Our first challenger
has cleared Strong Arms.

658
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:35,500
Next, he takes on From Right and Left,
which only one person has cleared.

659
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
SUPER STRONG ARM AND FROM RIGHT AND LEFT

660
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,930
MR. SHACHIHOKO SPRAYS THEM
WITH THE BUBBLE MACHINE

661
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:50,930
CROSS THE WOBBLY FABRIC BRIDGE
WHILE DODGING THE BARS

662
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,630
You can do it!

663
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:02,000
KOUME DAYU CONTROLS THE BARS

664
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:08,100
-He's gonna make it.
-Incredible! Almost there!

665
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,130
Keep going! Go!

666
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,800
-Fantastic!
-I did it!

667
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,370
Amazing!

668
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,370
Yeah.

669
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,630
He did it! Great!

670
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,970
What? He did it.

671
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,200
Oh, no! Damn it!

672
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:42,300
The first challenger, Kanta,
cleared this tough game beautifully.

673
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:47,630
He conquered the wobbly fabric bridge.

674
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,630
He dodged the last bar well.

675
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,200
He will go to the final battle.
A job well done!

676
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,400
You idiot! You let the first challenger
clear the game!

677
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,530
Make sure you don't
let anyone else through!

678
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,300
ADDITIONAL RULE

679
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:12,800
In anger, Takeshi's Castle has activated
an additional rule.

680
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,530
All right! I'll change
the direction of rotation.

681
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,930
CLOCKWISE
COUNTER-CLOCKWISE

682
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,870
There you go!

683
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:23,070
Umegaki has changed
the center bar's direction of rotation.

684
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,200
This increases
the rate of failure to 150%.

685
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,600
What will happen to the attacking army?

686
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,100
Wait! The direction has changed.

687
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,800
-What?
-That's not fair!

688
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,070
What is this?

689
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,630
-You're kidding!
-That's tough.

690
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,900
I wanted to learn from him,
but they've changed the direction.

691
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,600
Takeshi's Castle is scary.

692
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,070
Charge!

693
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,230
I believe in myself and try my best!

694
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,870
IDOL CAFE WAITRESS
YOYO

695
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,200
No! It's so scary!

696
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,730
No!

697
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,870
I want to clear this and
bring down Takeshi's Castle.

698
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:17,200
A super high school student,
Haru Yamaguchi,

699
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,570
has cleared all games so far.

700
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:26,530
Will he be able to clear this
and go through to Yabusame again?

701
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,070
I'll change the direction again!
See if you can make it.

702
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,130
Now all the bars are rotating clockwise.

703
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,300
It has reached maximum difficulty.

704
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,570
DIFFICULTY RATING: MAX 200%

705
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,830
Their rotation has been changed
to go that way.

706
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,830
HARU'S FATHER
MINORU

707
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,670
-It's true.
-Oh my gosh. The rotation!

708
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,970
No one noticed.

709
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,430
-It's the right level.
-Is it?

710
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,730
It's just right for Haru.

711
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,270
-What a dad.
-It's right for him.

712
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:55,800
Let's go!

713
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,870
Haru! Haru!

714
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:06,900
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT
HARU YAMAGUCHI (16)

715
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,700
-Oh, no.
-Seriously?

716
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,470
-Even Haru couldn't...
-He couldn't?

717
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,900
Even our super high school student
couldn't clear this unreasonable game.

718
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,070
Haru has been eliminated.

719
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,330
FAILED

720
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,530
What's your goal for Takeshi's Castle?

721
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,070
My goal is to bring down Takeshi's Castle
and break it down!

722
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,370
Crush it!

723
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,400
Charge!

724
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,300
I'm Mayaya!

725
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,330
Kiss, kiss, and cheese. I'll do my best!

726
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,870
Mayaya the goddess! Mayaya the goddess!

727
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:06,030
DANCE DUO
MAYAYA (35)

728
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,830
What?

729
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,100
-I thought...
-What was that?

730
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,970
FAILED

731
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,570
Come try the Takeshi's Castle dance!

732
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,930
Takeshi is up!

733
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,370
They're all in a trance.

734
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,330
Good luck!

735
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,670
-Looks fun.
-Go for it.

736
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,930
Marina Takewaki,
a home exercise video creator

737
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,970
with over three million subscribers,
takes on the challenge next.

738
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,400
-Over three million?
-That's amazing.

739
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,300
She looks hopeful.

740
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:44,570
I'll try my best!

741
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,370
-Go for it!
-She looks great!

742
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:52,700
Marina! Marina!

743
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,970
Takewaki, what will happen?

744
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:00,900
HOME EXERCISE VIDEO CREATOR
MARINA TAKEWAKI (33)

745
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,930
This set is huge!

746
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,600
She can go through there.

747
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,870
If you stop there, it pushes you.

748
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,230
See, she got pushed.

749
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,130
Watch out.

750
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,500
I'm scared!

751
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:19,870
What will she do now?

752
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,970
-Maybe climb over the top?
-Watch out!

753
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,630
-She almost fell.
-It's a miracle.

754
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,900
That was so close.

755
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,970
Okay!

756
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,400
She couldn't hold on.

757
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,500
-So close!
-It's tough.

758
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,930
The queen of home exercise,
Marina Takewaki, showed excellent balance.

759
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,670
She couldn't get over the third bar
and sadly failed.

760
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,330
-I'm gutted.
-I bet.

761
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,670
-I'll do more exercises.
-You will?

762
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,700
I need stronger legs
to be able to jump over the bar.

763
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:03,470
If you'd jumped bit more,
it would have been different.

764
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,300
Right. I need stronger legs.

765
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:09,630
Don't give up during this tough game.

766
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,330
Onwards!

767
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,870
Charge!

768
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,130
CHARGE!

769
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,030
IT COMPANY PRESIDENT
YASUYUKI HATTORI (46)

770
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,770
ENGLISH TEACHER, VENEZUELA

771
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,270
EX-JAPANESE NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM PLAYER
RAIMU SENGOKU (25)

772
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,500
Grandpa! Grandpa!

773
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:31,700
TAKESHI'S CASTLE MUSEUM DIRECTOR
SATOSHI MAEJIMA

774
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,030
Tell me how you got through it.

775
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,730
Let's go!

776
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,200
HIBIYA CLUB
IPPEI SUYAMA

777
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,100
SUPPORT ENGINEER
ERICA MARTINEZ (30)

778
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,000
MAYAYA - CHIITAN

779
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:51,500
Next, Team Sasuke, which has conquered
various strongholds so far,

780
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,330
will take up the challenge.

781
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,870
Well done! You don't have
to spread your legs so much.

782
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,270
Will one of them be
the second person to clear after Kanta?

783
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,500
I will clear this for sure!

784
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,970
DOMINATED SASUKE TWICE
YUJI URUSHIHARA (43)

785
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,930
This is dangerous!

786
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,470
Why?

787
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,870
Why?

788
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,700
-How did that happen?
-He couldn't see it.

789
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,300
-It's coming down from above.
-That's good.

790
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,330
-He did it.
-One more!

791
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,270
-He did it.
-He made it.

792
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,200
-Well done.
-He's good, as expected.

793
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,970
Keep going!

794
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,830
I'll take you down.

795
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,630
Hello!

796
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,030
Hello!

797
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,370
-This is hard.
-But it's fun.

798
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,470
It's that wobbly fabric bridge
you need to cross.

799
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,030
Look at those bubbles.

800
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,030
Go!

801
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,470
Wow! Great!

802
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,700
Waiting between the gaps
is a good strategy.

803
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,930
Watch out!

804
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,970
-Watch out!
-Oh, no!

805
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,600
I guess...

806
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,200
No mercy.
Bars hit your face from all sides.

807
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:28,900
As expected from a Sasuke team member,
even as he was pushed down, he persisted.

808
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,900
He reached the halfway point
of the very difficult From Right and Left.

809
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,030
Almost there.

810
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,730
He was good.

811
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:44,500
The most hopeful Sasuke member,
Morimoto, also known as Sasuke Jr.,

812
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,570
failed miserably.

813
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,370
SASUKE JR.
YUSUKE MORIMOTO

814
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,000
Even the finalist, Mr. Hioki
couldn't clear

815
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,130
this extremely difficult stronghold.

816
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,470
KITAGAWA ELECTRONICS, STORE MANAGER
MASASHI HIOKI (41)

817
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,270
Why did you fall?

818
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,900
Were you listening to it?

819
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:06,300
The nastiness of Takeshi's Castle
has gotten to me.

820
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,170
It was tough.

821
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,470
Next, parkour athlete Sato
will take on the challenge.

822
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,500
I'll be careful this time
since the final battle rests on this.

823
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,230
Show us how cool parkour athletes can be.

824
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,170
Indeed!

825
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,270
I'll make sure I get to the end.

826
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,600
CHAIRMAN OF PARKOUR ASSOCIATION
JUN SATO (30)

827
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,500
Good luck!

828
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,170
-Good!
-That's a good idea.

829
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,070
Watch out, it's coming!

830
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,200
Watch your head.

831
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,530
Come on!

832
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,400
All right! Let's go!

833
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,100
-Stay calm.
-I hope he wins this game.

834
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,330
Go for it!

835
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,570
Keep going!

836
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:10,900
There he goes.

837
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,670
You'll lose your balance!

838
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:19,300
What's he doing?
Oh, it's him shooting the bubbles.

839
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,630
Go!

840
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,570
Watch out! All right!

841
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,100
That's a narrow gap.

842
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,330
Oh, no!

843
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,900
-Keep going!
-You can do it!

844
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:43,400
Oh, no! Look!

845
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,730
He's using the gap.

846
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,530
The length of each gap is different.

847
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,270
It's a miracle.

848
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,500
He took it on his shoulder.

849
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,430
What will he do now?

850
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,530
He didn't make it.

851
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,900
No mercy. He's spraying water on him.

852
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,000
He must be gutted.

853
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:26,030
-On a wobbly soft fabric bridge...
-He couldn't make it.

854
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,470
Sato, a parkour athlete,
displayed excellent balance.

855
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,730
-It's amazing.
-Yes.

856
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:33,930
-But it got so wobbly afterwards.
-Yeah.

857
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:40,130
He was given the Fighting Spirit Award
for his effort getting close to the goal.

858
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,900
It's hard to be hit in the face.

859
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:44,930
The last challengers are
from the Female College Student Team.

860
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:51,230
They've fought in all the battles
but haven't cleared any games.

861
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,170
They've managed to survive,
earning them a Fighting Spirit Award.

862
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,900
CAN THEY MAKE IT TO YABUSAME
BY WINNING THEIR FIRST GAME?

863
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,270
I got her!

864
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:04,830
Since we've come all this way,
we need to go through to the final.

865
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,500
We'll do our best!

866
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,530
Good luck!

867
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,030
All right, they're cute.
I'll give them a special treat.

868
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,970
I'll let them rotate counterclockwise.

869
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:19,570
Now, the third bar
rotates counter-clockwise,

870
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:23,430
making the game easier, since the girls
don't need to jump over them.

871
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,270
How lucky for them.

872
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,930
I don't wanna make my teammates cry.

873
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,930
Katomiri! Katomiri!

874
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:42,470
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM
MIRI KATO (21)

875
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,470
-It's dangerous.
-It's dangerous.

876
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,670
-Everyone fails here.
-It's hard to see.

877
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,570
Yes. Then the bar pushes you.

878
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,600
It pushed her butt.

879
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:56,530
The bar pushed her butt.

880
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,230
FAILED

881
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,870
Isaka is the second challenger
from their team.

882
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,270
She made it to From Right and Left,
but she fell into the water right away.

883
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,070
The last challenger is Haniuda.

884
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,600
Good luck, Eve!

885
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,130
It's Eve.

886
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,530
EVE HANIUDA (22)

887
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,430
-That's good, she's following the bars.
-She'll be fine.

888
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,570
She can do it.

889
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,800
-It's a good idea to follow the bar.
-Yeah.

890
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,830
-Not good.
-She'd better wait a bit.

891
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:33,130
She's doing great.

892
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,370
Keep going. Well done.

893
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,830
Push the button. Go!

894
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,270
Go for it!

895
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:58,330
-It's Akko!
-"It's Akko," he says.

896
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,700
She stops in between them.

897
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,200
That gap is narrow.

898
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:08,070
Watch out.

899
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,030
She's doing well.

900
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,830
That's good.

901
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,000
-She's slim. She can get in there.
-Yeah.

902
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,670
-All right.
-Will she make it?

903
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,070
Watch out!

904
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,870
Will she make it? She will!

905
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:23,900
She will do it.

906
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,630
-There's a big bar, sometimes.
-Yeah.

907
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,070
-She did it!
-She made it.

908
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,900
Fantastic!

909
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,270
-Did she make it?
-Did she?

910
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:39,830
Did I do it?

911
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,170
Nice job!

912
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:47,500
Haniuda moved
without shaking the bridge at all.

913
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,330
She successfully completed
a super version of the game

914
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,700
that Team Sasuke's members could not!

915
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,070
Incredible! Even Team Sasuke
failed at this game.

916
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:02,600
-Great job!
-That was excellent.

917
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:06,330
-Thank you very much!
-We really wanted someone to clear it.

918
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,900
-I'm so happy!
-Thank you.

919
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,600
-Thanks for the energy.
-Sure.

920
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:12,230
-Do your best again! Good luck!
-Yes!

921
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,170
You did it!

922
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,800
Two challengers cleared the game.

923
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:28,100
Along with Sato,
the Fighting Spirit Award winner,

924
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:31,730
they will go to the final battle.

925
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,430
THREE SURVIVORS

926
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,200
Three of them went through.

927
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,500
-Three?
-Yes.

928
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,900
-People are still surviving?
-Yes.

929
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:46,100
-Because we made the game a bit easier.
-Yes.

930
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,030
-It was a tough game.
-Yeah.

931
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,870
Now, Count!

932
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:53,470
-It's time for the final battle, at last.
-All right!

933
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:57,570
We would like to ask you
to join the fight and take them out!

934
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,230
-How about that?
-What?

935
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,430
-Can't you?
-Don't be silly. I'm over 75 years old.

936
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,870
Aren't you gonna fight?

937
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,700
-We'd like you to join us.
-Yes.

938
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,730
For this occasion, I have...

939
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,100
That's what modern technology is for.

940
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:14,230
I've got someone else ready.

941
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,000
I wanted you to fight them yourself,
but I hear you have an amazing helper.

942
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,670
We'll go there, for now.

943
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:23,030
-Let's go.
-Who's the helper?

944
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:26,430
-We'll go, now.
-Let's go.

945
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,970
Let's bring them down.

946
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,230
-We've finally come here.
-At last!

947
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,230
We did it!

948
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,570
What'll I do?

949
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:39,530
It's different and I feel the tension
in the air. It's nice, though.

950
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:41,470
It feels like the final battle.

951
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,270
The parkour athletes
will get on a machine at the end.

952
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,700
Like "I'll be right back."

953
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,830
It's probably not the most suited to him.

954
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,230
Captain Kimura has joined the army, now.

955
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,370
The fighting spirit of the attacking army
is at its strongest.

956
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:57,900
You might have good luck, right?

957
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,600
I can't wait to see this.

958
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,470
At last, it's time
for the very final battle.

959
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,930
All right!

960
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,730
The attacking army?

961
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,700
Hayato Tani and Subaru Kimura!
We'll bring you down instead!

962
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:27,330
Come and get us!

963
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,900
-Wait and see!
-Yes!

964
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:35,370
For such an important stage of the battle,

965
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,900
did you think I hadn't prepared anything?

966
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:38,900
-What?
-What?

967
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,030
All right.

968
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,270
Now we'll find out
what Count Takeshi has prepared.

969
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,300
TENSHIN NASUKAWA

970
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,470
TENSHIN NASUKAWA

971
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,430
Fantastic!

972
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,100
How about that?
He's your opponent. Surprised?

973
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,670
It's Tenshin Nasukawa!

974
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,970
-Here he comes!
-What an amazing helper we have!

975
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,330
-We've got a real tough guy.
-I know!

976
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,900
-All right!
-Nice to meet you.

977
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,370
Right this way.

978
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:25,270
-Nice to meet you.
-Thank you.

979
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:29,170
-Welcome, Mr. Tenshin Nasukawa!
-Thank you!

980
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,870
We have an amazing guy!

981
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:33,570
What made you come here today?

982
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:36,600
Mr. Takeshi told me
it'll be the match of the century.

983
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:37,930
Did he say that?

984
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Yes. He asked me to win it.
That's why I came here.

985
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:44,130
-You're the man for a big fight.
-Sure.

986
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,170
-He's so reliable.
-Because he's the strongest man.

987
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,070
-Yes, he is.
-Sure.

988
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,430
-So great.
-Count!

989
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,270
-Were you surprised?
-There was more to it than that.

990
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,570
-He'll be a fierce attacker.
-Of course.

991
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,930
-Sure.
-Thank you.

992
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,430
-I'm counting on you, boy!
-Thank you!

993
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,230
-"Boy."
-Thanks. I'll do this for Mr. Takeshi.

994
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,400
-General Tani!
-Yes!

995
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:07,900
We have Tenshin Nasukawa with us!

996
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:11,330
-I'm so surprised by who you've got.
-Sure.

997
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,270
Our three survivors are quite tough, too.

998
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,230
I see.

999
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,430
-Three amazing challengers.
-Could you say a few words?

1000
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,500
Tell them.

1001
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:24,600
I don't know how strong
Mr. Tenshin Nasukawa is.

1002
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,330
But I'll be sure to bring him down!

1003
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,700
-He's up for it!
-He said he doesn't know who you are.

1004
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:31,000
He's pumped up!

1005
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,570
I also will bring
Mr. Tenshin Nasukawa down!

1006
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:38,600
This is great!

1007
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,070
-She's up for it, too.
-Yeah!

1008
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,130
What the hell!

1009
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,130
I can't beat him with my fist,

1010
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,630
but if we're shooting balls, I might win.

1011
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,200
I'll try my hardest to take him down!

1012
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,800
You've never been told that before, I bet.

1013
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:55,100
-Isn't it annoying you?
-Yeah.

1014
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,530
I'll make sure I bring you all down.
Get ready.

1015
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,870
-All right!
-Let's go!

1016
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,600
For the final battle of Takeshi's Castle,

1017
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:08,900
the game is Super Yabusame.

1018
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:14,000
The attacking army has tried Yabusame
three times so far.

1019
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,200
TAKESHI'S ARMY WINS

1020
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,200
TAKESHI'S ARMY WINS

1021
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,270
Each time, they failed
to hit their target with the ball.

1022
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:30,500
Thank you!

1023
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:35,300
In this final battle,
Yabusame has evolved.

1024
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,170
What a surprise!

1025
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:42,370
Takeshi's army's machine will now move
at the same time as the attacking army's.

1026
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:46,070
They can't miss a moment
as they pass each other.

1027
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:50,570
For both of them,
it will be more difficult to aim.

1028
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:57,430
The attacking army will win
if they get a ball into the red target.

1029
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,030
Takeshi's army will win
if they hit the challenger's target.

1030
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,370
But if both teams either succeed or fail,
it will result in a draw.

1031
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:14,070
The attacking force has to aim
at the small moving hole in the machine.

1032
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:19,700
They saved the toughest game yet
for this very last battle.

1033
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,670
As if in anticipation of
the battle's intensity, it began to rain.

1034
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:39,570
A little higher.

1035
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:48,300
Last time, Ryu went
during the first round.

1036
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,370
This time, it's Kanta.

1037
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,870
-The color of your shirt is so different.
-Right.

1038
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:57,530
But it represents his effort.

1039
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,400
It's the symbol of challenges he faced.

1040
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:02,130
-It used to be white, though.
-It can't be helped.

1041
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:07,000
Kanta has given a stunning performance
and had a great deal of success.

1042
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:12,870
Can he defeat
the formidable Tenshin Nasukawa?

1043
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:19,000
-I'll do my best.
-Good luck!

1044
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,870
-We're counting on you!
-All right!

1045
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,930
You can do it!

1046
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,970
-Those three are quite tough, too.
-Yes.

1047
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,530
I'll try my hardest.

1048
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,900
I'll take him out so that
the other two don't get a turn.

1049
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,170
-Do your best!
-Thank you, I will!

1050
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,470
Super Yabusame, round one.

1051
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,770
SUPER YABUSAME
DIFFICULTY RATING: 200%

1052
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:50,770
Here we go!

1053
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:54,000
Let's begin the first round of Yabusame,
the final version!

1054
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:56,930
Three, two...

1055
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,270
Go for it!

1056
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:59,630
...one.

1057
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,930
Go for it!

1058
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,530
Go for it!

1059
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,670
All right!

1060
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,570
THE ATTACKING ARMY FAILED

1061
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:44,630
He didn't make it.

1062
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,900
TAKESHI'S ARMY WINS

1063
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,500
All right! Fantastic!

1064
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,070
In the first round of Super Yabusame,

1065
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:54,700
the extreme difficulty of aiming
at the small, fast-moving target

1066
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:59,430
required split-second timing
and even Kanta couldn't do it.

1067
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:05,500
Unfortunately, he couldn't even hit
the flame around the target.

1068
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:13,770
On the other hand, Tenshin hit the target
on the moving machine,

1069
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:17,300
as expected of a fighter's eye.

1070
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:21,870
-Well, Mr. Tenshin. Fantastic!
-What an amazing guy.

1071
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,400
-Thank you. I did it.
-You did it.

1072
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:27,400
-I think your first ball hit the target.
-Probably.

1073
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,830
-Great work.
-Just as planned.

1074
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,900
-As planned?
-You won so easily.

1075
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,230
-Be sure to bring down the other two.
-Sure.

1076
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,600
-So reliable.
-Fantastic.

1077
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,930
Super Yabusame, round two.

1078
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,730
Takeshi's army came from there.

1079
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,200
I've got a microphone for the first time.

1080
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,230
I'm so happy.

1081
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:53,500
Their target is so big,
but mine is so small.

1082
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,000
I think it's all up to chance.

1083
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:58,430
I'll make a miracle happen.

1084
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:02,600
As the general,
I'll be sure to defend Takeshi's Castle.

1085
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,470
-Keep up the good work.
-Let's go.

1086
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:09,500
You must be aiming at the hearts
of cute male college students, too, right?

1087
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,900
I shouldn't have said that, right?
I know...

1088
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:19,670
Can Haniuda make a miracle happen
by bringing down Tenshin?

1089
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,500
-Are you gonna win?
-I will get the ball in.

1090
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,070
-Let's win!
-Yes. Thank you!

1091
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,870
Let's begin.

1092
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:33,570
The second round of Super Yabusame.

1093
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:34,970
Three...

1094
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:38,300
...two...

1095
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,930
...one.

1096
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,730
-She didn't get one in.
-It didn't hit her.

1097
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,870
Did you see it?

1098
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,770
Surprisingly, the attacking army's target
is intact.

1099
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:27,700
If Haniuda got the ball
into the opponent's target, she wins.

1100
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:39,070
Unfortunately, she made
some great shots, but missed the target.

1101
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:46,130
Haniuda was so close
to bringing down Tenshin.

1102
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,800
In the second round of Super Yabusame,
both sides missed the target.

1103
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:53,130
It's a draw.

1104
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:00,330
Super Yabusame, round three.

1105
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:05,100
At last, we've reached
the very last battle of Takeshi's Castle.

1106
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,400
The attacking army
of around 400 challengers

1107
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:13,600
tackled a total of 28 strongholds.

1108
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,970
With the help of their fellow members,
they've reached the final battle.

1109
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:31,370
Only this Yabusame remains in the fight
against the hated Takeshi's army.

1110
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:35,330
The last challenger is Sato,
a parkour athlete.

1111
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,270
Will he achieve their long-held goal
by winning this duel?

1112
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:42,530
See for yourself. Watch closely.

1113
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:45,700
-I've come this far, so I have to do it.
-Wonderful.

1114
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,270
-Okay.
-Great!

1115
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:50,870
-Good luck!
-I can do it!

1116
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,430
Charge!

1117
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,670
All right!

1118
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,300
This is the very last round.

1119
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:12,370
I'll make sure I shoot him down.

1120
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:17,600
This is the third round of Super Yabusame.

1121
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,030
Let's begin!

1122
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,030
-Three...
-Go for it!

1123
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:24,130
...two...

1124
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,370
Let's go!

1125
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:27,170
...one.

1126
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,830
The final battle of Takeshi's Castle.

1127
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:09,970
It looked like Tenshin hit the target,

1128
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:15,930
but because a bouncing ball hit it
from behind, it's invalid.

1129
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:22,430
So, if Sato got the ball
into Tenshin's target,

1130
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,000
it'll be a dramatic victory.

1131
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,970
Well, he hit a ball directly at the flame.

1132
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:42,870
But he couldn't get it into the target,
so he failed.

1133
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:52,630
The attacking army fought well,
but, sadly, they've been defeated.

1134
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,430
The winner is Takeshi's army.

1135
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,800
-Our count!
-Count!

1136
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,730
Oh, my. Well done.

1137
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,870
Thank you.

1138
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,630
-I protected the castle well.
-Yes.

1139
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,670
We should do this every week.

1140
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:11,330
-Every week?
-If we do, our staff will drop.

1141
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,370
All right. Shall we shout it now?

1142
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:19,070
The winner is Takeshi's army!

1143
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,370
We did it!

1144
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:32,830
It's sad that we lost,
but thank you so much for your great work!

1145
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,970
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1146
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:38,400
How was it?

1147
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:42,430
I could see the target,
but it was hard to aim at. It was tough.

1148
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,970
Sometimes it's up to luck
on Takeshi's Castle.

1149
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:48,670
I hope you guys will try again.

1150
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:52,170
Let's one day bring down
the impregnable Takeshi's Castle!

1151
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:53,230
All right!

1152
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,970
Good. Charge!

1153
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:05,230
This is how Takeshi's army
drove out the attacking army.

1154
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:10,030
-Well, well...
-How was it?

1155
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:13,030
-He was good, right?
-We had an amazing helper.

1156
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:16,130
-He was fantastic!
-We won easily. Thank you.

1157
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,330
-They were no match for him, were they?
-No.

1158
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,700
You know what? I can honestly say

1159
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:26,470
that I'd bet no one
can clear Super Yabusame.

1160
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,630
The last one was the toughest yet.

1161
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:33,430
So, this season, no one could conquer us.

1162
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,270
What shall we do next? Another season?

1163
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:37,930
Another season?

1164
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,970
-We'll do it.
-Yes!

1165
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,530
In another 34 years' time.

1166
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,430
That would be nice, too. But...

1167
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,200
Will the wait
for next season be that long?

1168
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:48,700
It's up to the viewers.

1169
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:50,500
Yes. We hope they all enjoy it.

1170
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:53,100
See you next time.

1171
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,930
-Hopefully in season two.
-Thank you so much!

1172
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,100
See you!

1173
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:01,400
-Thank you, Count!
-Thank you!

1174
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:02,870
Thank you for your great work.

1175
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:08,770
Around 400-odd people attempted
to overthrow Takeshi's Castle,

1176
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:11,530
but they were unable to do so
and were wiped out.

1177
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:23,500
For this era of the revived
Takeshi's Castle, the story is over.

1178
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,100
Until we meet again, goodbye!

1179
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:33,030
It's all over. Thank you so much!

1180
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,430
It was so much fun.

1181
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:39,300
You did so well.

1182
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,970
-I'll make a Yabusame machine.
-No way.

1183
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:47,130
-Takeshi's Castle was fantastic, right?
-Yeah.

1184
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,100
Takeshi's Castle is the best!

1185
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:55,030
I really wanted to win,
but everyone worked very hard.

1186
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:57,170
So, this is all okay.

1187
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:02,070
On this show, you can have
a wonderful experience.

1188
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,570
Cherry. Good!

1189
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,400
I've made lots of friends.
Even with the person with a painted nose.

1190
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:13,170
Japanese people are so kind.
Thank you very much.

1191
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:16,000
Did you get it?

1192
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:19,530
Could you please let me stay? Please!

1193
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:21,770
We came all the way from Nagoya.

1194
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:24,530
-I didn't know we'd work so well together.
-Seriously.

1195
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,300
-I feel like crying.
-Honestly.

1196
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:30,600
So cute!

1197
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:35,900
It's fun, because it's not scripted
and everyone's completely serious.

1198
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:40,300
It's up to us if they clear
or fail the game.

1199
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,400
I will get through hard times

1200
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:45,930
since they're nothing
compared to Takeshi's Castle.

1201
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,230
I enjoyed Slip-and-Slide Quiz so much.

1202
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:54,470
I've had a lot of fun in this experience
that might be once-in-a-lifetime.

1203
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,630
The most fun I've had in my life.

1204
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:57,830
Goodbye!

1205
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,030
-Don't fall in love with me!
-Fall in love with me!

1206
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,000
We had so much fun!

1207
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:06,500
Thank you so much!

1208
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,630
See you, Chiitan!

1209
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,270
Just seeing the gate of Takeshi's Castle
makes us extremely excited.

01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:19,230
This is fantastic!

1211
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,570
I want to make a program called
Osamu's Castle like this one.

1212
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:25,330
You've said that you wanted
to do it in the future.

1213
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,900
This is the new Takeshi's Castle.

1214
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:32,270
I'm from the old Takeshi's Castle,
but it feels the same.

1215
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:35,030
Okay?
