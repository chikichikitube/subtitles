00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,890
The First Annual Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende, Chiki Chiki

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,890
So loud...

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,530
Let's Shoot a Music Video with a Drone!!

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,200
So about today-

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,670
Today's Plan

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,670
Use a drone to shoot a music video in a single take

7
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,670
m 87 915 l 1836 915 1836 1024.5 87 1024.5

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,670
So apparently, we're going to use a drone and shoot a music video in one take

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,670
That's correct

10
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,540
Inamoto
Takafumi

11
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,540
Endo
Shozo

12
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,540
Fujiwara
Kazuhiro

13
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,540
Hamada
Masatoshi

14
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,540
Matsumoto
Hitoshi

15
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,540
So, License's Fujiwara has...

16
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,540
Tanaka
Naoki

17
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,540
Tsukitei
Hosei

18
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,540
m 1 833 l 1917 833 1917 1053 1 1053

19
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,080
awakened as a drone

20
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,510
He awakened?

21
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,540
I guess, yes, I have

22
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,950
Fujiwara is going to operate the drone to shoot the video in

23
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,820
one take

24
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,820
one take

25
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,820
Just one take?

26
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,820
Yes

27
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,890
2 weeks before the shoot

28
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,120
Damn, that's small!

29
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,590
This?

30
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,590
That's right

31
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,660
Narrator:

32
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,660
Yamada Shinichi

33
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,660
Micro-Drone

34
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:44,660
Fujiwara will use one of the smallest drones around: a micro-drone

35
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:54,270
Micro-Drone

36
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:54,270
-

37
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:54,270
-

38
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:54,270
A small camera inside

39
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:54,270
WEIGHT - 70 Grams

40
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:54,270
m 78 873 l 1201.5 873 1201.5 1030.5 78 1030.5

41
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,170
Weighing only 70 grams, it has a small embedded camera

42
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,270
Fujiwara will be able to see what the drone is seeing via a headset

43
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:01,550
Control without the use of the headset

44
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,310
First, he will practice without the use of a headset

45
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,750
I barely moved my finger at all just now

46
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:12,390
Drone Racer

47
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:12,390
Erinnu

48
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,420
It's a really sensitive machine

49
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,420
that will respond to the slightest push

50
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,390
So I have to get used to

51
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,390
how sensitive the controls are

52
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,100
It really just hit me that I'm going to have practice a lot

53
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,600
To control the Drone for the shoot, his training begins!

54
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,600
To control the Drone for the shoot, his training begins!

55
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,920
From this day, in order to control the drone, he began training

56
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,840
Third day of training

57
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,840
Yoshimoto HQ

58
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,840
To practice, he used locations with plenty of open space, like Yoshimoto's HQ...

59
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:36,480
Fifth day of training

60
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:36,480
Takatsu Dojo

61
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,850
and even a karate dojo where Fujiwara trains in his free time

62
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,510
He committed to his training

63
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:43,560
7th day of training

64
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,250
From the seventh day, when he got the hang of operating the drone,

65
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,360
he started training with the headset on

66
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,840
Are you getting the hang of it?

67
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,840

I think I've mastered the basics

70
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:06,680
10th day of training

71
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,210
When he wasn't working, he spent all his time training

72
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,210
His control of the drone improved

73
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,020
Yep, nice!

74
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,060
Fujiwara's first time using a drone

75
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,060
Fujiwara's first time using a drone

76
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,060
Will he succeed in shooting a one-take music video?

77
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,060
Will he succeed in shooting a one-take music video?

80
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,010
So, what song are we using?

81
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,010
Yes, about that...

82
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,340
'Okuru Kotoba'

83
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,340
Kaitentai's

84
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,340
And since the song is actually quite long,

85
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,580
if it were just you guys, we'd be lacking in numbers...

86
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,220
so we've invited some special guests today

87
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,220
Big time guests?

88
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,620
Of course they are, so if the big-time guests would like to come out now, please!

110
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,930
I thought he was going to joke like: "They're not big!" but then he shouted:

111
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,030
"They aren't shit!"

112
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,470

So you're teaching the students about what that character means

167

And please look directly at the drone whilst you sing

168
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,810
It's okay to look directly at the drone?

169

Yes, that's fine

170
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,510

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,250
the drone will move again

173
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,250
I see, so that will just go off on it's own

174
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,700
This door here will be closed

175
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,920
The drone will pass through here

176
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
Don't try that!

177
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,650
Isn't this a really tight space?

178
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,560
There's no lesson where the door is open

179
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,490
If you're going to say that,

180
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,490
there's no lesson where drones are flying through the classroom!!

181
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,800
Shoji

182
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,800
Telling off student in corridor

183
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,800
Next the drone passes Shoji, who is telling off a student in the corridor

184
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,940
Haranishi

185
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,940
Sticking a piece of paper on his back

186
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,970
Then it films a scene where Haranishi is getting pranked by another student

187
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,150
"Gorilla"

188
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,170

406
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,490
The drone goes to the first floor, where Matsumoto is

407
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,780
Then the drone leaves the staff room

408
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,490
and goes to the first floor, where Matsumoto awaits

409
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,260
So here it comes, it's coming down...

410
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,890
Yes, it will come right down here

411
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,160
And it will come here in front of you

412
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,160
I see

413
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,430
It will go around you,

414
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:41,670
Matsumoto

415
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:41,670
sings by the shoe lockers

416
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,360
so if you could turn with the drone

417
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,670
"Owari madde kiitte~"

418
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,500
As he sings, right?

419
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,670
And keep singing whilst you turn

420
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,070
"Okuru Kotoba~"

421
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,070
"Okuru Kotoba~"

422
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,370
Just like that

423
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,370
About one full turn

424
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,040
Yep, around one turn

425
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,080
So wait, what am I meant to be doing here?

426
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,230
Everyone so far has been doing something

427
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,050
What on earth am I doing here?

428
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,020
You're just overseeing things

429
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,450
Like the shoe lockers...

430
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,990
Just overseeing everything-

431
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,090
Isn't there a better role for me?

432
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
I'm just standing here, overseeing things?

433
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,030
But this is where things get really exciting

434
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,570
But this is where things get really exciting

435
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,900
It's a great role, right?

436
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,200
It's coming from above and all

437
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,410
Endo

438
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,410
Finds a love letter in his shoe locker

439
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,410
The drone then films Endo discovering a love letter in his shoe locker,

440
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,810
Dancing on the stairs

441
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,810
Tanaka

442
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,810
and goes past Tanaka dancing on the stairs to the second floor

443
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,780
Bobby

444
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,780
Bobby getting kancho'd

445
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,550
It films Bobby getting kancho'd by a student,

446
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,780
then back to the first floor

447
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,790
And in the interlude...

448
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,250
It's now coming back down again

449
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,940
and right here, using this line here:

450
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,330
Matsumoto-san, Hamada-san,

451
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,700
Shoji-san, Haranishi-san

452
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,600
you will be jumping rope here

453
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:50,470
Interlude

454
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:50,470
Matsumoto, Hamada, Haranishi, and Shoji skipping

455
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,920
Downtown will be in between here and you will both be jumping

456
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,470
You're just jumping rope

457
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,640
So when the drone comes, we are just jumping rope here?

458
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,180
That's correct, this is the interlude

459
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,350
If the rope catches my leg,

460
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,350
that's not going to affect anything, right?

461
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,120
No, then we re-do the whole thing...

462
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,420
Come on, let's not do that

463
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,420
This is serious, suddenly

464
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,420
Do we really need to do this?

465
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,660
Before, I was just overseeing things here

466
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,360
Now I'm here jumping rope?

467
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,960
What kind of person am I?

468
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,960
I don't get my character!

469
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,300
Coming out of the toilet

470
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,300
Hosei

471
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,300
The drone passes Hosei coming out of the toilet

472
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,670
Inomoto

473
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,670
Kicks the soccer ball

474
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,670
and films Inomoto kicking the soccer ball away

475
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,870
And then the music video is done

476
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,010
Right then, let's do it!!

477
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,680
Right then, let's do it!!

478
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,230
Good luck all!

479
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,580
Right then everyone, I'm going to start now

480
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,250
so please be ready

481
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,250
Right, got you!

482
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,090
Yup!

483
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,620
Good luck guys!

484
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:40,850
Shut up!

485
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:40,890
Shut up!

486
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:40,920
Shut up!

487
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:40,950
Shut up!

488
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,990
Shut up!

489
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,020
Shut up!

490
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,050
Shut up!

491
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,090
Shut up!

492
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,120
Shut up!

493
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,150
Shut up!

494
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,190
Shut up!

495
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,220
Shut up!

496
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,960
Shut up!

497
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,960
Of course you'd react like that

498
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,030
I'm starting up the drone now

499
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,730
Fail, and they must restart. The one shot music video

500
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,730
Fail, and they must restart. The one shot music video

501
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,970
Will they succeed?!

502
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,970
Will they succeed?!

503
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,970
I'm starting up the drone now

504
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,080
Fail, and they must restart. The one shot music video

505
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,080
Fail, and they must restart. The one shot music video

506
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,750
Finally, the shoot begins!

507
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,750
Finally, the shoot begins!

508
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,990
Here we go then, counting down from five:

509
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,190
four,

510
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,120
three,

511
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,220
two...

512
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:24,330
Okuru Kotoba

513
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:44,080
In the light and shadows of the town at sunset

514
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:54,630
I give you these words as you go away

515
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,130
Instead of hiding your sadness and faking a smile

516
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,800
It’s better to cry until your tears dry up

517
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,980
The more sadness a person experiences

518
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:16,250
The more they're able to be kind to others

519
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:26,530
It’s too sad to just say goodbye

520
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:37,170
So I give these words to you, my love

521
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:50,880
They’re interrupted by the twilight breeze

522
00:08:51,020 --> 00:09:01,360
But please listen to the end, these words I give to you

523
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,950
Instead of being upset that you can’t trust anyone

524
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,640
It’s better to take a chance and get hurt

525
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,380
Don’t ask for kindness

526
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:23,380
That’s a cowards excuse

527
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:33,330
For you, my first love

528
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:44,040
I give you these unembellished words

529
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,570
The rope, the rope, the rope!

530
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,390
Shit, it's coming, it's already here, we're way too late!

531
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,640
We're way too late, shit!

532
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,460
We were way too late!

533
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:01,250
In this new life you are about to begin

534
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,090
Someone will probably love you

535
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,030
But there is no one who will

536
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:17,670
Love you as deeply as I do

537
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:27,680
Your receding shadow disappears into the crowd

538
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:38,630
No longer do they reach you, my words to you

539
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:52,010
No longer do they reach you, my words to you

540
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,050
Success on the first attempt!

541
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,560
Success on the first attempt!

542
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,560
Success on the first attempt!

543
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,090
Amazingly, he manages to complete it on his first go

544
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,090
Hello, sir!

545
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,730
Kinpachi-sensei, hello sir

546
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,600
He was dressed as the janitor

547
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,600
Takeda Tetsuya

548
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,600
And as a surprise guest: Takeda Tetsuya himself!

549
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,850
Man, you get really nervous doing this, eh?

550
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,240
I wish you would have gone a bit higher at the end, though!

551
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
It ran out of battery, right?

552
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,980
Right? It fell at the end

553
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,510
Yes, there was no more battery left

554
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,710
Oh I see

555
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,010
How was it?

556
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,420
I was watching until just before

557
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,420
the skipping and it was pretty good

558
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,250
The skipping part was a bit...

559
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,960
Didn't you go past Shoji-san a bit too quick?

560
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,160
You literally got no screen time at all there

561
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,160
Seriously?!

562
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,330
I tried to look into the camera and sing but it just

563
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,330
flew off!

564
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,630
Can we watch this now?

565
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,630
Shall we have a look?

566
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,970
I think Takeda-san should also come and have a look

567
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,610
They watch the recorded footage from the drone

568
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,780
That's nice

569
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,550
That's nice

570
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,550
I like the angle

571
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,350
That's good

572
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
It's really good

573
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,030
He's made Hamada
look really good

574
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,030
Right?
He looks good

575
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,030
Yeah he doesn't
look bad, eh?

576
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,770
This is
Shoji-san's part

577
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,770
He hasn't started
singing yet...

578
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,500
It's way too fast!

579
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,040
It flew past so quick!!

580
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,410
It flew past way too quick!

581
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,410
You've screwed up a little here...

582
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,020
I still don't get
what I'm doing

583
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,020
What the hell
am I doing?

584
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,940
Why are you
standing there?

585
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,290
I mean...

586
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,830
You know...

587
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,160
Not bad

588
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,900
Here, right?

589
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,900
See, the rope
isn't there

590
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,030
The jump rope!

591
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,040
It's still not there!

592
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,770
Oh damn, so close!

593
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,770
We finally start here

594
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,780
You didn't jump
over it at all!

595
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,710
You haven't
managed that at all

596
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,320
Hamada-san didn't even try to jump

597
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,190
I think we should all
be here with him

598
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,530
Look at us walking
out slowly

599
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,530
Right?

600
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,130
We're just coming out, relaxed

601
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,600
We should run to where he is

602
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,350
Damn, I wish the
camera stayed
for a bit longer there

603
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,410
Come on
you can do it!

604
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,410
Come on, a bit more!

605
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,850
It's too low,
it's way too low

606
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,590
We need to start skipping quicker

607
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:57,320
Rather than worry about getting the rope out quickly

608
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,320
You should focus on learning how to jump rope

609
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,030
Who cares about that part!

610
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,060
What should we do about Kimura-sensei's part?

611
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,900
Shall we run to get there quicker?

612
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,830
I think you should run, and then we can sing it together

613
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,970
I think you should run, and then we can sing it together

614
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,370
If you have any other comments, say them now

615
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,840
To Fujiwara...

616
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,550
Could you make sure the drone

617
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,550
focuses on me for a bit longer?

618
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,020
I'm sorry, I was panicking a little bit

619
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,850
I was just thinking about Haranishi-san after that

620
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,660
And what was going on with Hosei's part?

621
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,660
The fact he came out a bit late pissed me off

622
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,130
The fact he came out a bit late pissed me off

623
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,630
Like a "master performer"

624
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,230
Don't build it up

625
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,230
Don't build it up

626
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,230
What you mean by that?

627
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,230
I was just doing it when the staff told me to

628
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,070
Right then, shall we

629
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,070
do it again?

630
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,580
I think we can do this

631
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,580
Amazing

632
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,410
You can get this good just practicing for 2 weeks, huh?

633
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,510
You know

634
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,520
If he properly masters this

635
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,790
we're going to be doing a B'z song next

636
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,120
"Ultra Soul" for sure

637
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,630
Sorry, everybody

638
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,630
I will correct

639
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:07,830
the mish-

640
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,630
the mistakes I made

641
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,630
No way...

642
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,400
I wonder if he'll be okay,

643
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,400
this is going to start eating him up

644
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,040
He needs to get it right here

645
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,210
2nd Challenge

646
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,210
2nd Challenge

647
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,110
To try and get a perfect take, this is the second challenge, but...

648
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,600
FAILURE

649
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,870
Hey man...

650
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,400
I'm sorry

651
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,140
When it entered the classroom, it banged as well

652
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,240
When it entered the classroom, it banged as well

653
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,610
It's no good if it hits something like that though, right?

654
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,810
No

655
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,610
No, it's no good

656
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,040
It properly crashed before

657
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,480
How is it going?

658
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,480
How are you feeling about this?

659
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,580
Just as I calculated

660
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,250
That's no good

661
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,350
What kind of calculations were you making?

662
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,350
Don't use those calculations

663
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,190
3rd Challenge

664
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,190

They try a third time

666
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,230
FAILURE

667
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,850
We are stopping there!

668
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,770
Is the window open?

669
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,770
STAFF

670
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,770
Was the wind strong?

671
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,770
m 82.5 688.5 l 295.5 688.5 295.5 741 82.5 741

672
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,010
Apparently, there's a window open on the second floor

673
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:31,880
STAFF

675
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,880
Could you please close it?

676
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,880
Oh I see, the wind?

677
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,980
Here come Fujiwara's excuses

678
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,570
Right? He wasn't saying that earlier...

679
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,020
All of a sudden, he's starting to moan

680
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,690
4th Challenge

681
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,690
4th Challenge

682
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,990
And then, the fourth challenge

683
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,880
We're getting it all-

684
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,880
Okay, that was good!

685
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,590
However, even though they made it to the staff room,

686
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:20,130
The drone didn't hover in front of Iwao

687
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,060
Sorry, but we're stopping here

688
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,300
With that, 3 failures in a row!

689
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,300
Now, he has failed three times in a row

690
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,770
So, was that first take

691
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,770
just a miracle?

692
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,300
Maybe we're not going to be able to do this again

693
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,540
During the rehearsal, he didn't make

694
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,540
Staff

695
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,540

696
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,540
this many mistakes

697
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,540
Oh really?!

698
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,540
He sucks under pressure

699
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,140
I know

700
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,480
What's he doing?

701
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,750
He sucked in the M1 final too

702
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,210
He's so up and down

703
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,920
5th Challenge up next! Will he succeed?!

704
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,920
He really is

705
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,920
All over the place, right?

706
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,890

5th Challenge

711
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,190
Good!

712
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,190
He got through

713
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,190
Good

714
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,960
He's good

715
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,460
The drone goes to the staff room, where things went wrong before...

716
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,210
...then it gets to the part which Fujiwara says is the most important:

717
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,210
Matsumoto's part

718
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:06,730
The Drone gets to the last part

719
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,100
With no major mistakes, the drone gets to the last part

720
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:34,260
As he completes the course, Fujiwara smiles!

721
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:34,260
As he completes the course, Fujiwara smiles!

722
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,760
Finally completing the course, Fujiwara smiles

723
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,700
I'm okay with it if you are!

724
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,870
Okuru Kotoba - One take music video - SUCCESS!!

Everyone watches the footage they just shot

730
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,310
I think this is the one?

731
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,080
From what I watched, there were no screw-ups

732
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,950
From what I watched, there were no screw-ups

733

736

I give you these words as you go away

737
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,230
Instead of hiding your sadness and faking a smile

738
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:53,110
It’s better to cry until your tears dry up

739
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:58,040
The more sadness a person experiences

740
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,880
The more they're able to be kind to others

741
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:14,890
It’s too sad to just say goodbye

742
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:25,340
So I give these words to you, my love

743
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:39,180
They’re interrupted by the twilight breeze

744
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:49,360
But please listen to the end, these words I give to you

745
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,870
Instead of being upset that you can’t trust anyone

746
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,870
It’s better to take a chance and get hurt

747
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:04,740
Don’t ask for kindness

748
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:11,420
That’s a cowards excuse

749
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:21,630
For you, my first love

750
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:32,370
I give you these unembellished words

751
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,390
In this new life you are about to begin

752
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:54,290
Someone will probably love you

753
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,100
But there is no one who will

754
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:05,600
Love you as deeply as I do

755
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:16,080
Your receding shadow disappears into the crowd

756
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:26,790
No longer do they reach you, my words to you

757
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:40,110
No longer do they reach you, my words to you

758
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,550
I think it's great!

759
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,120
It was definitely the best out of all of them!

760
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,320
Fujiwara, what do you think?

761
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,760
I'm happy with it, if you are

762
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,760
You're good, right?

763
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,490
We all agree then

764
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,490
Thank you all so much

765
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,490
Great work everyone!

766
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Thank you!
