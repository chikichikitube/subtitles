00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,990
Mitsuru-san

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,290
Translation: Zurui

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,720
"Please stir it just a little longer"

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,320
It's not working, my body feels heavy

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,550
I can't even move!

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,020
Didn't you gain weight?

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,790
What?

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,790
We're idols, so we should diet

9
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,790
Sorry about that

10
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:19,720
Yes

11
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:21,700
Try it again

12
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,700
Hey, Tatsuya!

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,370
Why don't you have some fun dancing with us?

14
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:27,900
Hey

15
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,640
Leavi him alone
-Why?

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,570
He failed the audition but didn't tell his production company

17
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,440
He failed miserably

18
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,000
The judge told him he has zero talent

19
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,450
"Zero talent" that's pretty bad

20
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,720
So he's depressed huh

21
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,520
Tatsuya

22
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,450
Cheer up, we're on your side

23
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,720
We are... 1, 2, 3, 4

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,520
"Hamigakitai"

25
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,750
Shut up!

26
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,500
What are you doing Tatsuya?!

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,300
How the hell would you guys know how I'm feeling?!

28
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,500
What are you doing?

29
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,900
Yes, that hurt
You didn't need to hit him

30
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,900
They said that was my last change... do you understand?!

31
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,470
Yes but...

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,650
I'm sorry, I was hard on you guys ultil now

33
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,620
Why are you saying that?

34
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,890
I'm sure the 2 of you will hit it big

35
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,320
Bye

36
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,620
Stop Tatsuya!
Wait, what are you doing?!

37
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,190
What??

38
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,820
If you jump from here, you'll die!

39
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,390
That's fine with me

40
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,550
Can't someone help?

41
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,350
Don't do it!

42
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,820
Isn't anyone here?

43
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,820
Oh! Mitsuru-san

44
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,300
Please stop Tatsuya!

45
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,270
What are you guys doing?

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,300
Tatsuya gonna jump!

47
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,100
Hey you!

48
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,250
Not me

49
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,270
Not him, he's there

50
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,220
Not me! Tatsuya's going to jump and die

51
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,020
Stop thinking like that!

52
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,850
Come here!

53
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,250
See ya!

54
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,250
Tatsuya!!

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,740
No way!

56
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,820
Tatsuya!

57
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,450
Knock it off!

58
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,050
Wait just a minute!
