Gaki no Tsukai presents the 3rd

00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,160
Never Been There Before, Let's Ask Their Best 3!!

10
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,120
Matsumoto Hitoshi    Hamada Masatoshi

11
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,120
Tsukitei Hosei        Endo Shozo        Tanaka Naoki

12
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,980
We used to do Best 5, but

13
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:22,300
The 5 guys go to a town they've never been to

14
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:22,300
Today's Plan

15
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:22,300
and they will ask the locals for info to determine that town's Best 3

16
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,330
Yes, that's right

17
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,990
It reduced by 2

18
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,680
Yes, they reduced it by 2 because Hamada made some complaints

19
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,970
Like, "There's too many" or "Let us go home already"

20
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,540
Really?

21
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,770
You made complaints?

22
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,020
I didn't say a damn thing

23
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,810
1 metropolitan area, 6 prefectures, all train stations

24
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,920
1 metropolitan area, 6 prefectures

25
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,670
All of their train stations are in here

26
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,960
Right

27
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,320
Before, we got Chiba and Chiba

28
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,180
T/N: Chiba is a prefecture in Japan just to the east of Tokyo. It's also where Narita Airport is located.
Kanto is the eastern region of Japan that includes Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, and other prefectures.

29
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:33,180
Rules

30
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,180
They will pick a lottery with all train stations in Kanto written on them.

31
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,180
m 0 383 l 800 384 l 800 585 l -835 584 l -835 383

32
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,180
If even 1 of them have visited that place before, it is disqualified.

33
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,370
Yes, we did have Chiba and Chiba

34
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,160
Matsumoto, you pick this time

35
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,240
Oh right, Chiba and Chiba

36
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,280
That's right, we've already had Chiba and Chiba

37
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,900
Yep, so far it's been Chiba only

38
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,010
What was picked last time?

39
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,420
Shinanomachi

40
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,000
T/N: Shinanomachi is a station within Shinjuku, Tokyo.

41
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,000
Shinanomachi

42
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,260
I have a feeling that the pick before that was very different...

43
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,560
Yokohama!

44
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,700
And the town is...!

45
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,690
This is pretty good

46
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,190
Iwahara...

47
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,780
T/N: Iwahara is a station in the Kanagawa prefecture.

48
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,760
Iwahara

49
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,980
I don't think I've heard of it

50
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,780
Iwahara?

51
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,440
I've never heard of it

52
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,060
I've never heard of this either!

53
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,820
Find it, Hosei

54
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,090
I have to find it on here?!

55
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,170
Iwahara!

56
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,320
Finding it on here would be amazing

57
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,810
Iwahara?

58
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,370
T/N: The Izuhakone Railway is a private company that serves in the Kanagawa and Shizuoka prefectures.

59
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,370
[Staff] It's on the Izuhakone Railway Line

60
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,890
Izuhakone Railway Line??

61
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,700
What... No way

62
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,130
It's over here

63
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,140
Found it!

64
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,690
Iwahara... Uwahhh...

65
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,090
This is...

66
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,280
Iwahara

67
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,020
Where is this?

68
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,340
There it is!

69
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,760
That is one hell of a pick

70
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,690
Yes, it is

71
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,210
Huh? What?

72
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,220
T/N: Unmanned train stations are stations without any railway staff to ensure payment, safety, etc. Only really small towns would have an unmanned station.

73
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,220
[Staff] It's an unmanned station

74
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,460
What?! Unmanned station?!

75
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,190
An unmanned station...

76
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,590
We don't know if there will be anything at all

77
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,100
2 weeks later

78
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,290
Alright everyone

79
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,780
We are in Kanagawa prefecture, in Minamiashigara City

80
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:38,110
Fukuoka

81
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:38,110
Iwahara

82
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:38,110
Izuhakone Railway Line

83
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:38,110
Kanagawa

84
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:38,110
Minamiashigahara

85
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:38,110
Tokyo

86
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:38,110
Yamanashi

87
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,600
And we've made it to Iwahara Station

88
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,470
Wow... Iwahara is very nice

89
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,770
There ain't nothing nice about it

90
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,930
"There ain't nothing nice about it"?!

91
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,820
Well, no...

92
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,940
There's no way there's "nothing nice about it"

93
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,700
Yes, I agree

94
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,650
We're only starting

95
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:40,940
Yes

96
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,640
It's so far

97
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,690
Starting from rank #3, they start asking for info

98
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,030
Without delay, they start from #3 on the rankings by asking for information

99
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,170
Look, there's a student

100
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,520
Oh hello

101
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,810
Hello!

102
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,690
That one...

103
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,360
Let's start with the one with the forehead

104
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,000
Excuse me!

105
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,040
Hello!

106
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,030
May we ask you something?

107
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,460
Yes?

108
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,750
Oh my! Very proper

109
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,780
His forehead

110
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,420
Are you okay?

111
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,160
Hi

112
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,550
Did you get hurt in a competition?

113
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,100
Looks like you were hit with a chisel or something

114
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,280
Oh

115
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,270
I practice judo

116
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,620
Oh, judo

117
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,250
Resident for 18 years: Kimura

118
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,250
Third Place Recommendation is...?

119
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,380
Born and raised in Iwahara, Kimura's recommendation

120
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,830
Rank #3 is...?

121
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,570
And now, your recommendation

122
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,400
What would you...

123
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,350
Kimura-kun, what makes you think, "It's gotta be this!"?

124
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,120
When you think of Iwahara...

125
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,780
There's nothing...

126
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,120
No, there's no way

127
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:19,930
No, there has to be something

128
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,900
He's hurt

129
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,740
There's blood...

130
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,250
He's hurt

131
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,520
He's hurt...

132
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,510
There HAS to be something...

133
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,260
There's gotta be something

134
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,930
You definitely can't say that to people

135
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,990
You can't

136
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,730
There's people who will hit you for it

137
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,270
In your opinion, #3

138
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,100
Ignore #1 and #2 for now

139
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,800
There really isn't anything...

140
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,190
No, you can't say that

141
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,710
If you say that, people are going to...

142
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,830
There's gotta be something!

143
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,860
This is your hometown

144
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
C'mon, there's something

145
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,230
Is that what you...

146
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,710
Is it because #1 and #2

147
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,710
can't be mentioned at all so you can't say...

148
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,000
Or is there really nothing at all?

149
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,050
There's really nothing

150
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Is there really nothing?

151
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,110
There's really nothing at all?

152
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,590
There's nothing?!

153
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,020
Then I don't want to do this!

154
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,410
I don't want to do this anymore!

155
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,620
Continuing on, the next person they ask is...

156
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,980
Continuing on, the next person they ask is...

157
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,960
Ogura Family

158
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,980
This family that lives in the neighborhood

159
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,070
Alright alright

160
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,040
We're going around, asking for the Best 3

161
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,360
And we're looking for #3

162
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,700
They all went out of business

163
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,970
Oh really

164
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,760
Unfortunately

165
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,960
Oh no, they went out of business...

166
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,300
It's very unfortunate

167
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,480
They ALL went out of business?

168
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,260
Yes, all of them

169
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,170
All of them going out of business is impressive in its own way

170
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,850
"Grill Toshio"

171
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,280
This is different

172
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,310
She says, "Grill Toshio"

173
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,270
"Grill Toshio"?

174
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,770
"Grill Toshio"?

175
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,970
That sounds nice

176
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,080
Sounds delicious

177
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,340
What the hell is "Grill Toshio"?

178
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,210
"Grill Toshio"?

179
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,720
It's next to where Family Mart used to be

180
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,720
T/N: Family Mart is a Japanese convenience store chain.

181
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,080
Is what she says

182
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,920
Wait, next to Family Mart...

183
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,640
That's...

184
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,150
Family Mart?

185
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,810
But it actually exists, right?

186
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,830
Does it still exist?

187
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,210
It's there, right?

188
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,680
Uh huh, it's there

189
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,170
Grill... Toshio

190
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,920
Toshio

191
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,840
Grill Toshio, got it

192
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,960
Grill Toshio

193
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,080
Grill Toshio

194
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,170
Hm, what's good there?

195
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,870
Are you okay?

196
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,520
What should we eat there?

197
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,640
You're just clenching your teeth

198
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,400
This entire time, he's just been messing with the back of your head

199
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,020
You've been clenching your teeth, but are you okay?

200
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,710
And also...

201
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,710
There's an old man in the small window up there

202
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,240
Hello

203
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,860
He likes it

204
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,120
He must really like that

205
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,390
Hello mister

206
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,930
You like hiding over there

207
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,120
We're looking for the Best 3 in this town...

208
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,920
Does anything come to mind for you?

209
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,070
He sure likes it

210
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,360
I just moved here so I don't really know

211
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,570
What?

212
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,080
You just moved?

213
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,990
They said "Grill Toshio"

214
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,070
They said it's good

215
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,230
But...

216
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,230
Just stop talking to the old man upstairs

217
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,270
Mister, if you could come down here...

218
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,270
Enough of that!

219
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,140
Enough of that

220
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,740
There's a place with good barbecued meat!

221
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,800
Oh, there it is!!

222
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,340
Oh there

223
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,090
See, now he's saying something

224
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,010
He's jamming his face through the railings!

225
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,930
Are you okay?!

226
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,580
If he were a lion, that could've been bad

227
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,980
They part ways with the old man in the window

228
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,990
They head towards rank #3, Grill Toshio

229
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,150
Have you guys been to a place called Grill Toshio?

230
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,530
Yes, I have

231
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,470
Is it good?

232
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,920
Yes!

233
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,670
What's good there?

234
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,290
What's good there...

235
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,810
Your recommendation

236
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,670
Pork cutlet!

237
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,850
Soba

238
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,870
But you guys definitely went for soba, didn't you?

239
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,870
T/N: Soba is Japanese buckwheat noodles.

240
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,350
Well, just for today

241
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,780
Today is soba

242
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,490
Oh it's here

243
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,790
It's suddenly there

244
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,760
Is this the place?

245
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,020
It was this close by

246
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,120
It's kind of got a marine aesthetic

247
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,170
It's a western style restaurant

248
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,170
T/N: They mean "western" in the sense of it having influence from western countries.

249
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,400
"Grill Toshio"

250
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,190
Go ask them if it's okay to film

251
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,190
Yeah, that's right

252
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,350
Okay, I'll go ask

253
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,100
Think it's okay?

254
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,990
Lunch bento?

255
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,790
Oh, lunch

256
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:16,260
Filming Negotiations

257
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,740
That's until 2pm, and then...

258
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,260
Immediately, Endo goes in for the filming negotiation

259
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,050
We're part of a TV program and we'd like to film...

260
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,880
He has such a sense of duty

261
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,990
Pardon me

262
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,800
We're good

263
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,140
Oh, it's okay?

264
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,980
Great!

265
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,640
Go ahead

266
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,930
So... This is #3, right?

267
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,870
There's other customers here too, so...

268
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,600
#3!

269
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,530
#3?

270
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,490
There's other customers in here too, just to let you know

271
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,790
#3

272
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,710
Grill Toshio

273
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,510
#3

274
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,500
I wonder what Toshio is like

275
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,880
Pardon us

276
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,410
The owner Toshio, yeah

277
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,700
Everyone scoot to the back

278
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,250
Please excuse us

279
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,050
Toshio-san?

280
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,560
Yes?

281
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,950
Oh, you are Toshio-san!

282
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,180
Are you Toshio-san?

283
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,790
Yes, I am Toshio

284
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,150
Thank you very much

285
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,890
Thank you, Toshio-san

286
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,050
Oh, this looks good

287
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,780
Cheese Hamburg Steak Pilaf

288
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,780
Katsu Pilaf

289
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,780
Tonkatsu Hamburg
Steak Set

290
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,700
T/N: Katsu is fried pork cutlet. It's a sort of Japanese comfort food.

291
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
This is what you came up with, right, Toshio-san?

292
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,910
Yes, that's right

293
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,630
It came from a staff meal

294
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,630
T/N: Staff meal as in the food that all the restaurant employees would eat before or after their shift.

295
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,380
Oh, from a staff meal!

296
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,850
So that's why you have dishes like katsu

297
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,270
It was really good, so we thought about putting it on the menu

298
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,970
How long have you been doing this?

299
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,280
This restaurant, about 46 or 47 years

300
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:14,490
Established for 47 years, a western restaurant loved by the locals

301
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:14,490
Grill Toshio

302
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,350
A comforting western restaurant, continued to be loved by the locals

303
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,710
Grill Toshio

304
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,520
Choosing a dish

305
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,930
First, they choose a dish they want to order

306
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,030
But Hosei...

307
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,410
But then, Hosei...

308
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,260
How about the lunch set?

309
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,520
Their lunch hours are over

310
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,520
It's only until 2

311
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,100
Oh, it's okay

312
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,200
Toshio-san

313
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,260
Toshio-san is so kind

314
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,310
You must be pretty hungry

315
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,580
Amazing

316
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,250
From that way you're ordering

317
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,080
Can you eat a full meal alone?

318
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,080
Sure I can

319
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,850
The portions seem pretty big

320
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,790
That's right

321
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,280
Yes, the portions are big

322
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,550
Then we'll get one lunch set

323
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,210
One lunch set

324
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,040
And uh...

325
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,520
Katsu Pilaf and the Katsu Curry

326
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,950
And Katsu Curry, got it, thank you

327
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,660
Thank you

328
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,020
That lady is his daughter, right?

329
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,340
Is it?

330
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,150
It definitely has to

331
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,770
Looks like it

332
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,530
Are you Toshio-san's daughter?

333
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,530
Yes I am

334
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,060
See?

335
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,770
Is your name Toshiko?

336
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,770
T/N: Many girl's names end with -ko, which means child. Such as Sachiko, Tomoko, Chieko, etc.

337
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,030
Haha, no it is not

338
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,640
It is not

339
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,820
Oh, it's not

340
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,440
Further more

341
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,940
Further more, behind them is...

342
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,260
Here?

343
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,920
This is his son

344
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,900
Wait, of here?

345
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,930
Yes

346
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,010
Toshio-san's son

347
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,900
Oh, is that right

348
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,390
Really?

349
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:20,490
T/N: Toshiya is a fairly common boy's name.

350
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:20,490
Toshiya-san?

351
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,350
Why do you keep starting everyone's name with "Toshi"?

352
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,420
Don't just assume everyone's some variation of "Toshi"

353
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,420
Toshiya-san, what do you do for a living?

354
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,860
You're not Toshiya, right?

355
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,420
I'm Hiroshi

356
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,460
Hiroshi

357
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,470
Hiroshi-san

358
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,260
Waited for 10min

359
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,670
Waited for 10 minutes

360
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,660
Even though the lunch hours are over

361
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,370
We asked them to make one, so it might take a long time

362
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,290
Oh I see

363
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,920
Because lunch is already over

364
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,440
You should just eat some of the bento in the green room, what the hell is wrong with you?

365
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,010
I did

366
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,750
Even though I already ate a bento, I'm still hungry

367
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,780
We haven't even done anything

368
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,090
And just then

369
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,900
And just then

370
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,480
Thank you for waiting, here's the lunch bento

371
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,600
Yes, please put it in the middle

372
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,910
Wow

373
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,790
This is for you, Hosei, we have our own dishes coming

374
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,810
We have our own coming

375
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,760
But really, look at this...

376
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,640
T/N: Roughly around $6.75 USD.

377
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,640
This is only 750yen!

378
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:12,640
Lunch Bento 750yen

379
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,130
Are you serious?

380
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,800
So cheap!

381
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,790
So cheap!

382
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,030
It even comes with miso soup!

383
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,100
This is so cheap!

384
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,420
This is very cheap

385
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,410
This is very nice

386
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,740
And then

387
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,510
And then

388
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,090
This is the Katsu Pilaf

389
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,790
If you could just place it here

390
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,560
Wow, this looks good too

391
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,640
Oh this is very nice!

392
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,700
Wow

393
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,290
They all come with miso soup

394
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,600
And now the Katsu Curry

395
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,100
This looks so good!

396
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,890
I'll put it right here

397
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,870
This is the Katsu Curry?

398
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,820
This is the normal portion?

399
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,980
Yes, this is the regular size

400
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,970
Katsu Pilaf

401
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,690
The recommended Katsu Pilaf and Katsu Curry

402
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,720
are large servings filled with Toshio's love

403
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,440
Katsu Curry

404
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:53,930
Is it good?

405
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,850
The katsu is so good

406
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,030
You can't go wrong with curry

407
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,740
You're right

408
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,150
Very delicious

409
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,420
Ding

410
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,590
What? She's right there!

411
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,830
The katsu is very delicious

412
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,380
Is it delicious?

413
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,090
Thank you very much, I'm very glad you like it

414
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,570
Thank you

415
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,370
Stuffing their faces with exquisite katsu

416
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,130
The four chow down on the exquisite katsu

417
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,580
Waiting for Hosei

418
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,350
Within no time, it's finished and now they wait for Hosei

419
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,000
We're just waiting for Hosei now

420
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,770
I'm actually good now

421
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,100
I'm done

422
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm good

423
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,790
Since the old days, he mashes up his food with his chopsticks

424
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,260
He does have this habit

425
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,000
All the time, when he does this

426
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,040
I can't even go, "Then I'll eat it for you"

427
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
Huh? Really?

428
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,090
No way! I can't eat it if you squish it disgustingly

429
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,190
Yes, that's a bit much

430
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,400
We even said, "You gonna eat all that?" and he doesn't

431
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,240
He's like a dog that digs a hole to store his bones

432
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,100
Who are you doing this for?

433
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:06,220
Go over to the park and find a place that can act as a doggy bag

434
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,190
How embarrassing

435
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,250
If you want to take home leftovers, we have takeout containers for you for free.
Please ask an employee.

436
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:12,070
T/N: Taking leftovers home in a to-go container is not a common practice in Japan. Many restaurants do not carry any takeout containers.

437
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,070
Hosei ended up not finishing his meal so he takes his leftovers to-go

438
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:15,730
To-go

439
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,470
They packed it up for me

440
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,750
Thank you for the meal

441
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:29,140
#3 Western cuisine restaurant "Grill Toshio"

442
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,600
And with that, #3 in Iwahara is

443
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,390
a humble western cuisine restaurant run by Toshio, who will be 70 years old this year, and his daughter

444
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:29,140
Confirmed

445
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,980
"Grill Toshio" has been confirmed

446
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:34,980
To the station again

447
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,530
To get information about #2, the five go back to the train station

448
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,080
They're curious about the old man, however...

449
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,690
It's closed

450
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,130
It's okay, he'll definitely come out

451
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,140
Could you hold my jacket?

452
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,570
But the old man only just moved here

453
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,520
Will he come out?

454
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,180
Will he come out?

455
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,930
He won't know, he only just moved here

456
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,590
T/N: The clapping that Matsumoto is doing is part of the ritual for when you pray at a Shinto shrine. The clapping shows respect for being able to meet with the Gods/spirits.

457
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,590
There he goes again...

458
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,870
He won't come out, right? If he did, that'd be amazing

459
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,320
No no no, it won't work...

460
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,430
He came out before

461
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,620
Before, yes

462
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,750
He's praying, like he's asking for good fortune

463
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,810
If he comes out from this, then this was pre-planned

464
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,930
He's sleeping

465
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,540
Yeah, this isn't...

466
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,660
Ahh, looks like he's not going to reveal himself

467
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,890
Oh my

468
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,910
Oh look! Matsumoto-san!

469
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,550
Look, there's some movement

470
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,130
Oh!

471
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,250
Hello, mister!

472
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,760
Thank you

473
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,260
Are you kidding me?

474
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,540
Really??

475
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,110
No way!

476
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,710
Hello, good day!

477
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,730
Seriously?

478
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,120
We got some food!

479
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,160
Oh really?

480
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,900
It was delicious!

481
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,130
Come have a drink

482
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,900
Wait, is it okay for us to come into your home?!

483
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,730
He says it's okay

484
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,840
What rank is this!

485
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,670
This is a special thing, not a ranking

486
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,070
What??

487
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,840
For Iwahara

488
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,260
This will become second in Iwahara's best

489
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,580
Can all of us come up?

490
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,380
Come on in!

491
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,060
Shall we go?

492
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,270
Let's go up there

493
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,300
Let's go

494
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,820
Recommendation Extra!

495
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,820
To Mr. Nagatsuka's Home!!

496
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,260
And so, we will take a visit to Mr. Nagatsuka's home

497
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,650
Hello

498
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,830
Excuse us

499
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,340
Come in

500
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,200
Oh yes, thank you

501
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,170
Matsumoto-san and him, just the two of them

502
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,170
Come on, let's go then

503
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,440
Pardon us

504
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,350
Sorry there's not much space

505
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,060
Not at all, you just moved in recently, right?

506
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,810
T/N: Shochu is a Japanese liquor which is usually made from either barley, sweet potato, or rice. Very similar to Korean soju.

507
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,810
Wanna drink shochu?

508
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,820
Well, we're currently filming on-site...

509
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,510
One glass won't hurt, right?

510
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,010
Oh uh... Sure...

511
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,410
Then maybe...

512
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,160
Hello

513
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,720
What are we having?

514
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,310
Shochu okay?

515
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,630
We're going with shochu...

516
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,310
Oh then I'll just have 1 drink. Might as well

517
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,530
What the hell are you doing?

518
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,080
The nice man is offering to make me a cocktail

519
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,670
A cocktail?

520
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,030
Huh?!

521
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,440
We have to go find first and second place

522
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,070
Couldn't this place be  first place in a sense?

523
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:49,450
Black Tea

524
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:49,450
Dairy Product

525
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:49,450
Shochu

526
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:49,450
Special Cocktail

527
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,710
Taking his kind offer, Matsumoto will drink Mr. Nagatsuka's special cocktail

528
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,380
Is it strong?

529
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,810
Maybe I should've added water

530
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,060
It's actually not that good

531
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,670
It's not good?

532
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,140
Wait, it doesn't taste good?

533
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,520
But it's drinkable

534
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,860
The cocktail that he made you?

535
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,770
So far

536
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,670
Is that even a cocktail?

537
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:13,240
Iwahara

538
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,240
At the train station,

539
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,240
Interviewing for

540
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,240
Second Place

541
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,670
For Iwahara's Best 3 recommendations,

542
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,250
the members go to the train station to ask around about second place

543
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,900
We're looking around Iwahara for...

544
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,560
5 months old

545
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,410
5 months old?!

546
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,480
Iwahara Residential Moms Group

547
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,480
Second Place recommendation is?

548
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,230
They speak to a group of moms who seek to raise their children in Iwahara

549
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,780
Third place is "Grill Toshio"

550
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,140
We've found third place

551
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,070
We'd like to know what would be second and first

552
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:29,880
Second place

553
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,430
Second place is that bar over there

554
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,460
No, that was...

555
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,400
That's not even a bar

556
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,270
That's not really a bar

557
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,280
A bar? Was it?

558
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,280
Anything is fine

559
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,330
T/N: "Yuuhi no Taki" is the name of the waterfall that translates to "Waterfall of the Sunset".

560
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,330
Yuuhi no Taki

561
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,810
Oh no way

562
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,700
That sounds good

563
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,310
Yuuhi no Taki?

564
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,390
There is a waterfall

565
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,630
A waterfall?

566
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,030
So you hike up there?

567
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,310
Do you climb up a mountain path?

568
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,170
Yes, that's right

569
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,410
Then this should be... Endo's responsibility

570
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,200
No no no, the last time--

Outskirts of Iwai Station Recommended Best 5

573
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,920
We'll all go there out of obligation

574
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,950
And then once you get ahead, you can walk the rest alone

575
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,370
We won't go to the end

576
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,120
Why aren't we deciding with Rock Paper Scissors?

577
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,590
It's decided that it's me?

578
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,680
I mean, for now...

579
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,450
Even if you say that, in Rock Paper Scissors...

580
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,720
I didn't even lose and I had to endure that [cocktail]

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,930
Transport to Yuuhi no Taki commence!

586
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,350
And now, they head to Yuuhi no Taki that is on Mount Kintoki by car

587
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,350
T/N: Mount Kintoki is also known as Mount Ashigara.

588
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,920
Oh wow, there's cherry blossoms

589
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,630
Very nice

590
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Very nice

591
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,460
It's full bloom in Tokyo, right?

592
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,020
Yes, I think so

593
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,910
Yes, full bloom

594
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,550
Finding first place will be hard

595
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,280
God told me of a barbecue place, you know

596
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,320
Did you guys get barbecue yet?

597
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,890
Oh not yet, but we'll go, what's it called?

598
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,020
Yanagi

599
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,110
Yanagi?

600
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,010
There's Yanagi

601
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,530
Is it-is it close?

602
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,010
It's really famous, so...

603
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,950
So he's God, that man?

604
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,560
What is he the god of?

605
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,560
He's uh... Kind of a...

606
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,840
The source of all happiness, it seems

607
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,230
The source of all happiness??

608
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,140
You know, he had those two dogs, right? They did something bad

609
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,380
They used to be human, but they were transformed into dogs

610
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,020
It's so beautiful, see the cherry blossoms?

611
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,660
Cherry blossoms, yes

612
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,660
I don't really find cherry blossoms to be that pretty

613
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,950
Huh? Why?

614
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,700
Are they pretty?

615
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,800
Yes, cherry blossoms are beautiful

616
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,080
In regards to cherry blossoms everyone is always saying...

617
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,310
"Cherry blossom this, cherry blossom that" too much, I think

618
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,210
So you're saying the focus on cherry blossoms is too much?

619
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,000
Yes, that's right

620
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,520
But that's normal for cherry blossoms, isn't it?

621
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,840
But this is probably

622
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,470
related to the climate too, right?

623
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,410
The feeling that it's getting warmer

624
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,980
Feels like the start

625
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,610
If you say it just about the flower...

626
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,570
That's right, Endo gets it

627
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,520
Right?

628
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,420
"Where do you want to go for an international trip?"

629
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,190
Everyone always says "Hawaii"

630
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,390
Yeah, that's probably number 1

631
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,140
People always take distance...

632
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,710
And money into consideration

633
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,260
If everything was free, then

634
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,100
the answer would definitely NOT be Hawaii!

635
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,200
That always pisses me off

636
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,900
"Which..."

637
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,300
"Which city would you like to live in?"

638
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,070
You gotta think about the rent!!

639
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:08,250
If all the rent were the same, then the answer would absolutely be the Tokyo metropolitan area!

640
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,120
Those kinds of surveys are such shit!!

641
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,100
Was he always like this?

642
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,450
Which side are you annoyed with?

643
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,800
Come on, what is happening?

644
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,890
Has he always been like this?

645
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,960
How did you come to feel this way?

646
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,690
You guys know more than anyone else

647
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,250
I haven't known him nearly as long as you have, Hamada-san

648
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,360
Well, I've always thought that he has this side to him, but...

649
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,630
Was he like this since elementary school?

650
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,250
What happened all of a sudden?

651
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,900
You're in rage

652
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,070
I finally see the sign

653
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,650
But

654
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,460
Oh you're right

655
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,140
There it is, Yuuhi no Taki

656
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,930
Yuuhi no Taki...

657
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,950
These cherry blossoms are pretty, huh?

658
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,350
He said the cherry blossoms are pretty

659
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,300
Cherry blossoms...

660
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,260
The cherry blossoms...

661
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,950
You didn't listen to a damn thing I said

662
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,590
Didn't listen to your senpai's once in a lifetime boke!

663
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,590
T/N: In case you're not a weeb, "senpai" means upperclassman or senior. Basically, someone you respect due to age, rank, etc. "Boke" is a part of Japanese comedy, based on making airheaded jokes.

664
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,230
You've got to be kidding me

665
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,600
Didn't even get that riled up about it

666
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,870
Ashigara Pass

667
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,870
Daiyuuzan

668
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,870
Iwahara

669
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,870
Yuuhi no Taki

670
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,000
Arrival at nearby parking lot

671
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:06,870
Arrival at nearby parking lot

672
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,560
After a 20 minute drive,

673
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,860
they arrive at a nearby parking lot

674
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,330
But even here, you can hear the sound of water pretty well

675
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,090
They head towards Yuuhi no Taki by foot

676
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,650
Head towards "Yuuhi no Taki" by foot

677
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,200
What kind of games do you play with your kids?

678
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,100
Look, we can see where our current location is

679
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,630
Oh okay. That's big

680
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,790
So... The waterfall is...

681
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,460
Our current location and "Yuuhi no Taki"...

682
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,520
Is this it?

683
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,790
Just as I thought

684
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,760
Waterfall, waterfall, waterfall... Waterfall of the Sunset~

685
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,790
Well I mean, this is kinda nice

686
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,690
Yes, the atmosphere

687
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,510
Very nice!

688
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,680
There's something over there

689
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,940
So I guess you go up there

690
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,810
Ah, yes, most likely

691
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,070
Should be nearby

692
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,090
This is really nice

693
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,110
It's so beautiful

694
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,110
What exactly have you been calling beautiful?

695
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,510
Like the water

696
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,460
The water?

697
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,380
If you're talking about water, then tap water is beautiful too!

698
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,500
You got told

699
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,150
Why do I have to get yelled at?

700
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,660
Advancing into the forest

701
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,600
When they advance further into the forest...

702
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,630
I'm sure it'll be fine

703
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,700
There it is!

704
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,680
Oh, you're right, look

705
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,100
You're right!

706
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,790
Should we go?

707
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,880
It's so close!

708
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,830
So nice!

709
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,430
So close

710
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,400
That was very nearby

711
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,360
We will arrive at Yuuhi no Taki shortly

712
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,450
Yes, Yuuhi no Taki

713
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,040
Yes it is

714
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,140
Yuuhi no Taki

715
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,680
Yay!

716
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,290
He's so far ahead of us

717
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,540
He's so excited

718
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,470
Ahead of us

719
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,350
Did he always love waterfalls?

720
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,060
Why did he suddenly get so excited?

721
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,750
Matsumoto-san...

722
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,980
Amazing!

723
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,340
This is very amazing

724
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,650
Ain't it amazing?

725
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,560
Wow, this is impressive!

726
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,060
Amazing

727
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,240
This is nice

728
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,300
Wow, this is so nice

729
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,930
Very nice

730
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,400
Impressive, impressive

731
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,620
This is nice

732
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,170
Yes, very nice

733
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,210
Was it okay with all of us?

734
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,120
T/N: Matsumoto is doing the ritual for praying to God, which is the same thing he did when he was summoning the old man at the window.

735
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,120
He's not going to come out

736
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,860
Yeah, but...

737
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,490
If he came out from there that'd be terrifying!

738
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:23,240
Yuuhi no Taki

739
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:16,600
T/N: For those who use freedom units, 23 meters is roughly 75.5 feet.

740
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:16,600
The fall distance of the waterfall is 23 meters, just upstream from Sakawa River, Yuuhi no Taki is...

741
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,230
Approx. 23 meters

742
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,230
Fall Distance

743
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:16,770
The Legend of Kintaro

744
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,000
T/N: The Legend of Kintaro is a famous Japanese folktale about a boy with super strength who grew up in the mountains. Some say that he is based on a real man, a samurai by the name of Sakata Kintoki. Kintaro is referenced in many different media like anime, kabuki, art, etc.

745
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,960
Where that legendary Kintaro had his first bath as a baby. It is an extraordinary power spot.

746
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,540
The Legend of Kintaro

747
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,240
Extraordinary

748
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,240
Power Spot

749
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,240
T/N:  Power spots are places with great spiritual energy. Many Japanese people visit these places of spiritual significance to rejuvenate themselves in hopes of gaining greater powers. They usually are places that are important to Shinto/Buddhist religions or are historical spots.

750
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,040
This is it right? The water has negative ions

751
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,010
T/N: Negative ions appear naturally in many places, including where water collides. Although there isn't scientific proof of the effects of negative ions, it seems to have some perceived positive effects like reducing stress or preventing the growth of harmful bacteria. Take this with a grain of salt.

752
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,060
Oh, I see

753
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,970
This is

754
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,010
The splashing of the water causes negative ions

755
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,240
Amazing

756
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,250
Indeed, this is amazing

757
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,450
The water is really rushing

758
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,010
There's no pollen here, right?

759
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,940
Ah right, there wouldn't be any here

760
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,440
What the hell is he doing?

761
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,770
He's hogging it all to himself

762
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,830
I wonder why

763
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,970
I want to be struck by the water

764
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,970
T/N: You've probably seen in other Japanese shows or movies, but standing under a waterfall is a training from Buddhist and Shinto origins to focus and test yourself.

765
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,020
About how many meters is this?

766
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,130
Struck??

767
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,380
Well, you could...

768
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,140
Wanna go get struck?

769
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,040
It's just a thought

770
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,170
I WANT to be struck

771
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,840
It starts and ends with just a desire

772
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,180
No really, I'm serious

773
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,160
No one's stopping you

774
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,810
No, I'm really saying this for real

775
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,220
Although we don't know if it's okay to get in or not

776
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,260
Ah yes, that's true

777
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,220
That's a good point

778
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,190
I see

779
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,220
We got the okay to film it, but...

780
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,750
Whether it's okay to get in or not is...

781
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,320
Whether it's okay to get in or not is...

782
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,700
Getting in the water and being filmed

783
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,890
could cause a lot of problems, so...

784
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,890
That might be asking for too much

785
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,120
Are you okay?

786
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,500
Let's go

787
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,160
You're trying to rush us to leave

788
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,360
It took us so long to get here and we're leaving already?

789
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,000
Let's stay here a little longer, since we came all this way

790
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,670
A little more...

791
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,280
If we stay here any longer

792
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,250
they're going to get permission and force him in

793
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,920
They're going to ask for permission?

794
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,350
So before we get permission...

795
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:41,050
Asking for permission from the Board of Tourism

796
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,540
Given this situation, they ask for permission from the Board of Tourism

797
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,390
It's okay, you don't need to make a call

798
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,380
There's no rush in calling them

799
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,170
Are you an idiot?!

800
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,470
Wait wait wait, wait a minute

801
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,310
Are you serious?

802
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,720
Well, it came from your mouth, Hosei-san...

803
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,420
No, I just wanted to express my desire

804
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,190
I didn't say anything about actually doing it...

805
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,780
Are we not allowed to say, "I want to"?

806
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,280
Am I not allowed to unless I carry out my words?

807
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,010
And then...

808
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,180
They don't endorse it, but

809
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,590
"You will bear full responsibilities" is what they said...

810
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,550
So... We can?

811
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,700
No, we can't, right?

812
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,080
He said we can

813
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,790
If you can take responsibility...

814
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,690
Let's do it

815
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,690
In any case, the result is we got the okay

816
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,100
Result is, we got the okay

817
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,210
Yes, we can

818
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,160
You're kidding me?!

819
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,970
Can this really happen!?

820
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,200
I ONLY SAID, "I WANT TO..."

821
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,410
I DIDN'T SAY "I WILL..."

822
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,270
I DIDN'T SAY THAT

823
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,170
And so

824
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:45,780
Off to Yuuhi no Taki!!

825
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,030
Will my body be okay?

826
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,020
Off to Yuuhi no Taki!

827
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,660
It's March...

828
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,410
Yes it is

829
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,450
I'm going in

830
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:53,090
Yuuhi no Taki

831
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,060
Everyone come over here

832
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:53,090
Air Temperature 15° Celsius

833
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:53,090
T/N: For those who use freedom units, 15° Celsius is 59° Fahrenheit.

834
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,380
Ahh, this is cold!

835
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,040
Hosei, go to the right, the right!

836
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,820
Watch out!

837
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,700
Go down there through the right side!

838
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,230
Take your time, it's freezing!

839
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:07,850
COLD!

840
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,810
This!

841
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,110
This is so cold!

842
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,550
Ease into it

843
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,360
Oh well, there he goes

844
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,840
SO COLD, SO COLD!!

845
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,150
You'll get used to it!

846
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,030
COLD!

847
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,900
WAIT A MINUTE

848
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,170
COLD!

849
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,950
COLD!!

850
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,840
That will definitely be freezing cold

851
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,690
I said it's cold

852
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,960
Oh my, it's so cold

853
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,150
Oh wow, it's right in front of him!

854
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:41,560
Note: We obtained special permission to film.
If you choose to get into a waterfall,
it is your own responsibility.

855
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,710
Right there

856
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,880
Second place

857
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,890
Yuuhi no Taki

858
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,630
Yuuhi no Taki

859
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,170
This is going to bring you good luck

860
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,890
Wow, this is really...

861
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,790
You're doing good, just a little more

862
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,800
Slowly, don't rush it

863
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,060
Go slowly, slowly

864
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,700
Slowly!

865
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,040
AHHHHHHHHHHH!!

866
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,040
T/N: It might sound like he's saying something, but it's unintelligible chanting/yelling.

867
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:56,850
THAT WAS TOO FAST!

868
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,220
TOO FAST!

869
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,290
TOO FAST!

870
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,100
A little more, a little more

871
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,620
*More unintelligible yelling*

872
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,980
Too fast!

873
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,080
Hosei-san, just a little more!

874
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,210
10 seconds!

875
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,680
Get right in the middle of it!

876
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,730
We didn't get the shot!

877
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,130
You can totally see his bald spot

878
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,300
So cold...

879
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,580
Cold...

880
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,070
We know it was cold, but...

881
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,640
Did it hurt?

882
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,720
What is the #1 best thing in Iwahara?

883
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,360
It hurts

884
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,550
Did it?

885
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,180
It... It's freezing

886
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,370
Freezing...

887
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,260
Next week, nearby Iwahara Station Recommended Best 3 Part 2

888
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,380
Next week, nearby Iwahara Station Recommended Best 3, Part 2!

889
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,490
I offer you my love~

890
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,540
♫

891
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,620
Their goal is a row of cherry blossom trees

892
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,930
Hey, what the hell is this?

893
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,410
However!

894
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,570
We've been tricked

895
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,460
We were completely duped

896
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,500
What will happen next?

897
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:09,240
*More unintelligible chanting*

898
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,300
Too fast!
