1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,480
Sho-ta!

2
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,150
Do you wanna play?

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,110
No.

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,180
Let's play.

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,210
What? - Let's play.

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,980
No.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,350
No.

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,250
Let's see how much we keep it in the air by hitting

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,810
Not now.

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,910
Why?

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:50,310
1! - 2, 3, 4, 5!! - Hey!

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,080
And this is over!

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,610
You, maniac!

14
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,250
So indiscreet.

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,180
This is a farewell ceremony!

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,950
How could you be so indiscreet?
- I... thought he might enjoy this.

17
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,350
But obviously I shouldn't. No more playing.

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,610
I'm sorry. Please go on.

19
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,810
No good.

20
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,680
Be serious!

21
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,150
(Give me a break!)

22
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,680
What? - I was scolded for what you did.

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,450
I want to play.

24
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,350
I already told you I can't.

25
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,750
Let's play with this.

26
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,480
Take this! Die!

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,380
You damn priest!

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Watch how I finish him!

29
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,350
Ouch.

30
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,450
Make a count!

31
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,950
Do you wanna join me?!

32
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,650
Hey! - What the hell do you think...

33
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,280
Hey! - You are the one who started this!

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,880
What is the problem with this guy?!

35
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,080
Hey! - Back off.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,910
I'm very sorry.
- What is this lunatic doing here?!

37
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,380
Be serious, OK? - I will. Sorry.

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,310
We came here yo say farewell. - Right.

39
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,510
Fooled you! Tour stomach is wide open!
- Fooled you! Tour stomach is wide open!

40
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,280
Hey!

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,680
You are totally open to attack!

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,650
I can't believe this! - I apologize.

43
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,380
Whyis he here?

44
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,350
Pick it up!

45
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,750
You shouldn't be here! - I'm sorry.

46
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,450
This is a farewell service for God's sake!
- I'm sorry, I will behave. - Please go on.

47
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,450
I'm sorry to have lost my temper.
- It's very understandable.

48
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,150
You do it one more time, I'm out!
- OK, I'm sorry.

49
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,710
You completely messed it up! - So what?
- You got me in a big trouble.

50
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,380
It's so boring. - Just hold your horses.

51
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,480
It's so hot in here. - I understand that, but...

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,310
I'm gonna catch fire soon. - Just sit tight.

53
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,350
Let's play. Please. - No way.

54
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,750
No. No.

55
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,150
I can't help loving you!

56
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,080
You freak!

57
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,210
I'm a gay!

58
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,150
Please, priest! Please get back!

59
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,210
You can never get away from me,
you understand?
