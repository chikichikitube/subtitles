Last episode’s broadcast:
Become an Anime Character Bus Tour!!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Cosplaying an anime character for the bus tour as Arare-chan from Dr. Slump* is Yamazaki Housei.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
*Dr. Slump is a manga by Akira Toriyama from the 80’s.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Once the game begins, the results are pitiful.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,510
He’s sent off to Ueno while he’s still in costume, where all eyes are on him.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,180
On top of that, he must go buy spaghetti as part of his punishment.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,720
Chosen one is Yamazaki!!

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,520
HOWEVER

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,480
I haven’t gotten the spaghetti yet.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,690
Yamazaki, embarrassed, escapes the area and together with Miyasako, went elsewhere to buy the spaghetti.

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,730
AND FROM THERE, AN ANGERED MATSUMOTO…

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,160
That’s no good. Get over to Italy!!

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,760
Get over to ITALY!!

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,550
ITALY?!

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,300
Over in that heel area of Italy. You know how it looks like a boot, go to the heel.

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Like when I went to Evian.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,490
HOLD ON, WAIT PLEASE, WAIT!!

18
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,380
The scale of this batsu game area has become humongous!!

19
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,480
And so with that, Yamazaki must go to Italy. This week we present to you his travels with blood, sweat, and tears.

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,480
And so, Yamazaki must make a journey to Italy…

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,890

“Hamada's Ear Hair, You Know~”

24
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,460
Don't fall

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,560
Don't fall

26
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,760
Don't fall in love with ME~

27
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,360
Hamada's

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,420
Hamada's

29
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,220
Hamada’s Ear Hair, you KNOW~

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
Flutters in the WIND~

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,950
Downtown

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,950
Hamada Masatoshi

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,950
Matsumoto Hitoshi

34
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,140
Well uhhh… everyone, you may be here, looking forward to tonight...

35
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,160
What do you mean, what is there to look forward to?

36
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,140
Eh…

37
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,110
This isn’t free talk.

38
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,410
In fact, uhh... this is going to be terrible…

39
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:52,100
You’ll just have to see. You know, it’ll even be a really long time since it’s been seen on here, but this one’s a very lame video.

40
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,990
It was pretty bad…

41
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,410
Nothing we can do about it...

42
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,090
Well well, without further ado...

43
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,090
The video is…

44
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,340
Ah yes, that’s right.

45
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,340
Let’s bring in the man himself.

46
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,860
Alright, come on in.

47
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,490
Yamazaki Hosei

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,740
Ncha!*

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,800
*Ncha is a phrase that Arare­chan says in Dr. Slump

50
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,830
Ncha!

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,110
Uhhh... I’m just gonna let you know, the loud cheering was for Cocorico.

52
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,260
NO WAY!

53
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,270
NO IT’S NOT!

54
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,200
Cocorico

55
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,200
Tanaka Naoki

56
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,400
That cheering was totally for me!

57
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,470
See, what’s all this clapping for?

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,490
Yamazaki, you went out looking like this, right?

59
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,240
Yes, this is how I looked.

60
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,640
Wow.

61
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,240
Amazing.

62
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,650
This was incredibly difficult.

63
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,570
You say that, but I bet you went out and did some sightseeing.

64
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,750
No, not at all. I didn't do anything like that. Really, I stayed for 0 nights.

65
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,250
0 nights and 3 days.

66
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,670
Just for one-way? How long did it take?

67
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,670
Let's see...

68
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,960
14 hours.

69
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,910
Wait, why are you answering?

70
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,940
That surprised me.

71
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,410
Hey!!

72
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Don't answer my questions for me!

73
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,350
You forgot the answer!

74
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,700
Wow, it takes 14 hours.

75
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,920
So we got to Italy, right? And then you said to go to the heel, right?

76
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,590
Oh yeah, right. The heel area of Italy.

77
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,530
Getting to that heel area took another plane flight and then a car ride.

78
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,870
So that means... In total, that was twenty... Uhhh...

79
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,320
24 hours.

80
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,970
four hours?

81
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,240
24 hours.

82
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,350
Yes.

83
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,350
24 hours.

84
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,470
So that heel area... Where is that?

85
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,090
Nietzsche.

86
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,360
Nietzsche.

87
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,860
Nietzsche.

88
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Lecce.

89
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Lecce!!

90
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,950
What the hell are you doing?

91
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,950
Saying Nietzsche...

92
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,470
Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

93
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,110
Translation: OolongCha
Timing: DuckToaster

94
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,610
September 26th
6:30am
Nihon TV Parking Lot

95
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,020
At the crack of dawn, we find this man in the Nihon TV parking lot.

96
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,100
It's early.

97
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,970
Your change of clothes.

98
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,020
Change of clothes?

99
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,020
Your change of clothes.

100
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,580
And now, Yamazaki transforms to Arare-chan.

101
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,860
Ncha!!

102
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,500
What low spirits...

103
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:49,460
Uhhh, well, I still haven't really accepted the situation, but right now...

104
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,310
I am going to Italy to go buy spaghetti.

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,630
Since this is so sudden, I don't have much time.

106
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,390
0 nights, 3 days is how long I have to obtain the spaghetti.

107
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,840
I don't want this.

108
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,500
I will also be taking Kewpie-chan* with me.

109
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:18,750
*Kewpie is a popular brand of dolls whose name is based off the word, "cupid." This doll's base is Kewpie with a Gacchan design.

110
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,970
Gacchan.

111
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,970
Gacchan.

112
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,450
Kewpie...

113
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,240
I will also be taking Gacchan* with me.

114
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:24,460
*Gacchan is another character in Dr. Slump

115
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,260
Here I go.

116
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,450
Yamazaki Arare-chan on his way to Narita Airport by car.

117
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,260
The punishments are only this severe when it comes to me.

118
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,490
To be honest.

119
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,960
Even though my pays sucks.

120
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,450
Making me take this useless thing.

121
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,420
Why this song?

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:06,470
Last episode, Yamazaki fails the task of getting spaghetti on his own.

123
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,640
He ends up getting it with Miyasako.

124
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:21,310
For this reason, he's sent off to Italy to get spaghetti.

125
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,750
Lucky... He's gone twice now.

126
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,550
11:10am

127
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,550
Departing Narita Airport

128
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,450
He even gets this
occasion filmed for him.

129
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,330
Yamazaki Hosei 0 nights and 3 days:
Going to Italy to Buy Spaghetti!

130
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,770
Yamazaki leaves for Japan, for the sake of finding spaghetti, and heads towards Rome, Italy.

131
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:46,270
Length of Flight: 14 hours

132
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
The length of the flight is 14 hours.

133
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,940
Not only that, this entire roundtrip is in economy class, so this long trip will be particularly exhausting.

134
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,210
I'll now present today's menu.

135
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,850
The meal looks like this.

136
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,910
This guy is drinking beer.

137
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,250
What?! He can't have beer!

138
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,720
Why not?!
It's a 14 hour flight!

139
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,020
This guy is such a pain.

140
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,260
Endo or Hoto-chan or the others don't have to do this?

141
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,260
They don't have to go anywhere?

142
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,100
Um, yeah, I guess not.

143
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,730
Aren't I the only one who gets the hard tasks?

144
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,440
Like Cocorico is...

145
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,440
Is treated like the favorites.

146
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Only I get this harsh treatment, right?

147
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,650
Well, it's not really a matter of harsh treatment.

148
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,850
Cocorico's schedule is completely booked.

149
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,890
I'm busy, too!

150
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,420
If you think my schedule is open, you're wrong.

151
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,060
After a while, the effects of the alcohol starts kicking in and Yamazaki, not realizing the camera is still rolling,

152
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,900
Yamazaki, thinking the camera is off, expresses what's on his mind.

153
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,270
starts talking about Downtown and other topics.

154
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,740
Amazing. Just amazing.

155
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,480
Those 2 (Downtown) are really amazing, I think.

156
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,510
In what way?

157
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,710
You know, when I first saw their manzai, I thought,

158
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,280
"Wow, these dudes are gonna be the kings."

159
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,460
Yeah, when I first saw them, I didn't know them at all, when I first saw Downtown, I thought...

160
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,500
"These dudes are gonna be the kings" and now look, they're at the top!

161
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,630
I have a sixth sense for these kinds of things.

162
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,630
Oh, I see.

163
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,670
Recently, you know, Hamada-san...

164
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,040
Didn't he dye his hair?

165
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,470
What do you think about it?

166
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,740
What do I think, well, I was surprised!

167
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,980
Because... "If you dye your hair, you're garbage!" is what he's been saying for a long time.

168
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,020
So now, he's become garbage.

169
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,550
That is just garbage.

170
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:55,900
And now, after enduring the long 14 hour flight, the plane has landed in Rome. Yama-chan is still in his Arare-chan outfit and his number 1 priority is to seek out spaghetti!

171
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:03,870
Leonardo da Vinci Airport

172
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,100
We made it. Italy.

173
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,870
Looks like we finally made it.

174
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,940
That was crazy, too intense. Seriously.

175
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,310
I didn't even get to sleep at all.

176
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,910
Pizza, let's go get that pizza.

177
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,050
Pizza?

178
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,610
Yeah, pizza. Oh wait, not pizza, spaghetti.

179
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,590
We made it, we're here in Italy.

180
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,460
Here.

181
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,190
Is this the city of Rome?

182
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,980
This is Rome.

183
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,000
So he said the heel, right?

184
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,400
No way, we shouldn't have to bother with that.

185
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,440
We made it all the way here. Let's just buy it in Italy and go home.

186
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,840
But Macchan said the heel, so we need to go all the way over there.

187
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,880
Are you serious?

188
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,950
We'll need to board another plane.

189
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,980
For reals?

190
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Yes... For reals.

191
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,250
Whaaaat... No way...

192
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:01,490
From the airport in Rome, Yamazaki takes a domestic flight, yet again in economy class, to the city that faces the Adriatic Sea, Bari.

193
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,030
Non-stop traveling since the morning has caused

194
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,600
Yamazaki sleeping like a corpse

195
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,030
Yamazaki unable to hide his exhaustion

196
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,300
and is now sleeping soundly.

197
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,070
We're here,

198
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,070
we're here.

199
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,070
We've made it.

200
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Wow, it's all dark now.

201
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,880
Time in Italy: 10 PM

202
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,170
It's so dark.

203
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,440
Okay so... So now...

204
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,580
Um... the heel.

205
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,880
Um... What was it again?

206
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,780
Let's just buy spaghetti and go home.

207
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Can't do that!

208
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,450
Why can't I just do that?

209
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,750
This place is called Bari.

210
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Huh?

211
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,090
Bari.

212
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,650
The heel of the boot, right?

213
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,220
We're still only at the achilles heel!

214
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,030
Archilles heel?

215
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,100
We have to ride in a car again?

216
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,670
We'll be traveling by car now~

217
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,630
For about how long?

218
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,560
Uhh, for about 2 hours. I hear.

219
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,560
2 hours?!

220
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,100
By car.

221
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,710
So damn far!!

222
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,280
Because I mean... We've been going...

223
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,050
For 20 hours. We've been traveling.

224
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,050
Let's see...

225
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,750
6am.

226
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,140
In Japan.

227
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,620
In Japan?

228
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,290
Yes.

229
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,690
We had you come in to Nihon TV at around 6:30am so...

230
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,690
It's been right about 24 hours.

231
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,830
After arriving in Bari, Yamazaki immediately resumes travel by car.  He heads towards his destination, the city at the "heel," Lecce.

232
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,340
From Bari to Lecce, the distance is about 200km.

233
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,740
Traveling the distance of 200km by car.

234
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,170
His journey still continues to attain spaghetti in Italy.

235
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,010
Yamazaki, sound asleep, again.

236
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,220
Around this time, Yamazaki,

237
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,750
with so much international traveling, is dead asleep.

238
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,420
The city he seeks is Lecce.

239
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,710
A city that gleams in bronze light and one of the most beautiful and aesthetic cities in Southern Italy.

240
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,500
It's been 24 hours since starting the journey from Japan.

241
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:46,060
The car takes them to the heart of Lecce city.

242
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,200
Yamazaki, though falling apart from fatigue, finally sets foot in the final destination.

243
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,210
We've arrived in Lecce!!

244
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,670
We've made it.

245
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,810
We've finally made it.

246
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,120
Yamazaki is only allowed 4 hours in Lecce.

247
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:12,290
4 hours is all he's allowed in Lecce.

248
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,490
Within this time, he must attain the spaghetti.

249
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,090
Yamazaki hurries in search of a restaurant.

250
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,760
Isn't this one?

251
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,760
This?

252
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Is this a restaurant? This?

253
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
No, not this one.

254
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,570
Spotted a restaurant!!

255
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,900
Immediately, they spot a restaurant-looking establishment!!

256
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,910
In order for Yamazaki to make the purchase, they give him a note of Italian translations on it.

257
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,910
Yamazaki is handed an Italian language cheatsheet.

258
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:41,110
Bringing meat to Japan from a foreign country is incredibly complicated, so he must order a spaghetti with no meat.

259
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,950
And his task is to order a spaghetti with no meat in it.

260
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,950
Can Yamazaki procure this spaghetti without a problem?

261
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,290
Good evening.

262
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,260
Good evening.

263
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,690
Good evening.

264
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,360
I come from Japan.

265
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,000
There's something I'd like to order.

266
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,040
Okay?

267
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:10,910
I'd like to order a plate of spaghetti.

268
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,650
We're already closed.

269
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,850
I'll pay for it.

270
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,780
Huh?

271
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,750
I'll pay for it.

272
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,990
The kitchen is all closed.

273
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,260
Please make it a spaghetti with no meat.

274
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,460
We're completely closed.

275
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,600
We're not open.

276
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,630
They said they're closed.

277
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,100
Huh?

278
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
They said they're closed.

279
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,170
Closed? Why?

280
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,670
We're closed.

281
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,870
No No No No No

282
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,670
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

283
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,640
"Si" is Italian for "yes."

284
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,610
We don't have any food right now.

285
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,510
Why?

286
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,150
Why why?

287
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,780
Are you serious?

288
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,020
They said they're done.

289
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,520
Let's go already.

290
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,950
Thank you.

291
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,420
Good bye.

292
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
Good bye.

293
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Why are they closed?!

294
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,660
Let's go search for another one.

295
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,440
Why are they closed...

296
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,800
Because it's already past midnight!

297
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,870
That can't be the reason.

298
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,510
The cuckoos are chirping and they're just doing nothing!

299
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,460
Yamazaki, thinking he could quickly order and go home,

300
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:28,520
They drive around by car in search for the next restaurant.

301
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,280
was refused and is searching for the next restaurant.

302
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,120
But because it's so late at night, they aren't able to find another one so easily.

303
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,390
Finally, they find the next restaurant.

304
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,030
Ordering from the second restaurant.

305
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,190
Yamazaki approaches, in hopes of ordering.

306
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,330
Nchao!*

307
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,600
*Translator's note: He's trying to be clever by mixing Arare-chan's "Ncha" with "Ciao."

308
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,330
We're in the process of closing shop.

309
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,940
We're closed.

310
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,840
Closed?*

311
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,240
*Translator's note: He pronounces the word phoenetically in English. "Close-ed"

312
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,200
Closed Closed Closed Closed

313
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,710
No No No No No

314
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,870
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

315
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,280
Don't take it personally.

316
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
Thank you.

317
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,050
Good night.

318
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Thank you.

319
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,430
It's not good!

320
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,830
They're not open!

321
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,330
Because it's late.

322
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,270
It's late but...

323
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,270
But we left at 6:30 in Japan!

324
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,040
We're just barely late.

325
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,440
Huh?

326
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,940
The restaurant is still open, but they're not serving spaghetti anymore.

327
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,880
What do you mean they're not serving spaghetti, that's not right.

328
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,280
You have a point.

329
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:37,550
After that, Yamazaki walks around Lecce in the middle of the night, looking for information on a restaurant that's still open.

330
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:37,950
After that, Yamazaki wanders around the town of Lecce by foot for about an hour.

331
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,660
But unable to get any promising answers.

332
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,020
Come on...

333
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,830
We don't have much time left until we have to go back home, right?

334
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,330
We have only about 3 hours.

335
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,330
Whaaaaat?!

336
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,470
Geez, this pisses me off!

337
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,770
Oh, this place is a restaurant!

338
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,080
Spotted another restaurant!

339
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,810
Somehow, Yamazaki spots the third restaurant!

340
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,620
However, will Yamazaki be able to order spaghetti?!

341
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,120
Good evening.

342
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,320
Good evening.

343
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,560
I'd like to order a plate of spaghetti.

344
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,900
No.

345
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,870
No?! Why why?!

346
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,340
Please make it a spaghetti with no meat.

347
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,240
You're still ordering?
You just keep going, huh.

348
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,950
Please, I beg of you.

349
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,620
Beg of me?

350
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,620
What is that? Is that Bingo Bongo?*

351
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:56,190
*Translator's Note: Apparently, Bingo Bongo is a movie that is the comedic Italian equivalent of Tarzan.

352
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,320
Bingo Bongo!

353
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,660
Bingo Bongo!

354
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,660
For some reason, the restaurant staff are amused by Gacchan and ask the chef to make an order of spaghetti.

355
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,460
Thank you! Thank you!

356
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,100
Pippo, make an order of spaghetti for Japan, will you?

357
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,110
Good evening.

358
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,240
I'd like to order a plate of spaghetti.

359
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,850
We've already done the cleaning, we're closed.

360
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:17,980
What?

361
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,580
We're closed.

362
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,490
Please, I beg of you.

363
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,990
We don't have anymore spaghetti.

364
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,660
Really?

365
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,190
What?

366
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,190
Will Yamazaki ever be able to get his hands on some spaghetti?!

367
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,170
There, an older gentleman who looks to be the owner, reaches out to Yamazaki.

368
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
He says to make do with this.

369
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,400
Make do with this? No no no.

370
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,410
I'd like a plate of spaghetti with no meat, please.

371
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,110
A plate of spaghetti with no meat, please?

372
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Come back tomorrow?

373
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,450
You don't have any?

374
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,720
We don't have time to come back tomorrow. We're on a time limit.

375
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,950
No time limit.

376
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,950
(I have unlimited time.)

377
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,360
Suddenly, the old gentleman...

378
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,290
What's this? Boil it! This is no good, boil it for me!

379
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,730
They bring him a package of dried pasta.

380
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,370
1 piece of spaghetti for 1,000,000 lira*

381
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,500
Translator's notes: Lira was the form of currency before Italy changed to Euros. 1,000,000 lira = 60,000 yen = roughly USD $600

382
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,170
No! Expensive, too expensive!

383
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,770
*Translator's notes: 120,000 yen = roughly USD $1,200

384
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,770
2 pieces of spaghetti for 2,000,000 lira*

385
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,940
*Translator's notes: 180,000 yen = roughly USD $1,800

386
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,940
3 pieces of spaghetti for 3,000,000 lira*

387
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,310
Do you want 1 piece of spaghetti for 1,000,000 lira?

388
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,480
That's so expensive!

389
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,320
The prices for spaghetti are incredibly inflated,
what will Yamazaki do?!

390
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,320
The price for spaghetti has been incredibly increased! This Italian man is be feared! Is what we thought, however...

391
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,650
Well, let's make it for them!

392
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,860
Let's treat Japan to a plate of spaghetti.

393
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,860
Thank you!

394
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,760
He says he'll treat us.

395
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,170
Treat us? You will treat us? Oh, thank you!

396
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,270
Let's give this spaghetti to this child (Gacchan).

397
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,270
Let's give a friendly applause for Japan.

398
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,550
Yamazaki has no idea what's going on with the strange turn of events.

399
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,650
At the words of a lively saint, Yamazaki is finally able to get spaghetti.

400
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:08,290
In the midst of cooking spaghetti.

401
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:13,330
At this time, they're cooking a Lecce style spaghetti with parmesan cheese and basil in a tomato-based sauce, no meat.

402
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,250
In the midst of cooking spaghetti.

403
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,830
They make spaghetti for Yamazaki as representatives of Southern Italian cuisine.

404
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,870
They're making a lot.

405
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,010
Oh, thank you!! Thank you, thank you!

406
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,740
Yamazaki acquires spaghetti!

407
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,610
It's done!! It's here, the spaghetti is finally made!

408
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:39,880
Due to this kind saint, Yamazaki is miraculously able to acquire the spaghetti he needed.

409
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:45,260
As Yamazaki departs, the restaurant bids us a warm Italian farewell.

410
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,830
I've acquired the spaghetti!

411
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,760
Thank you!

412
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,760
Thank you!

413
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,430
Yeah! We got the spaghetti!

414
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,300
This spaghetti looks so delicious. I'm so touched. This here...

415
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,610
I'll bring this back to Japan and let's all eat this with everyone!

416
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,550
After acquiring this earnest plate of spaghetti, Yamazaki travels another 24 hours just like before.

417
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,190
And makes his way straight back to Japan!

418
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:32,740
Yamazaki's spaghetti that
he bought home from Lecce

419
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,140
This is really

420
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,810
authentically Italian.

421
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,340
It was kept frozen

422
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,110
and naturally thawed.

423
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,620
That's no good, it's like a sherbet then!

424
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,080
Then by microwave...

425
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,420
Eh? You put it in the microwave?

426
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
Yes, please heat it up in the microwave.

427
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,420
Ughhh, I don't want it anymore...

428
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,550
No way, you can't do that!

429
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,620
This is that spaghetti, right?

430
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,860
Yes, this is the spaghetti.

431
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,630
Is this it?

432
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,230
Yes, this is really it! That's the real thing! So I told them not make a replacement.

433
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:07,970
That is absolutely unforgivable, I told them I will definitely bring you guys the exact dish that was given.

434
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,240
I don't understand what the hell you're saying.

435
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,110
How did you freeze it then?

436
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,340
I froze it over there.

437
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,380
What do you mean, "over there?!"

438
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,380
What do you mean, "over there?!"

439
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,080
Where is that?

440
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,210
What the hell do you mean?

441
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,620
In Italy.

442
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,220
That made no sense at all.

443
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,890
Okay, it's ready now!

444
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,190
It's done now!

445
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,060
See, now it's warm!

446
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,730
Well... I'm not so sure about the inside though.

447
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,730
Yeah, we don't know about that.

448
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,930
Regardless, Hamada is going to inhale all of this in one go.

449
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,800
Really? Do your best!

450
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,140
What the hell are you saying? Come on everyone, eat!

451
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,110
It's all stuck together.

452
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,880
This is no good. I don't want to eat this thing.

453
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,210
Come on, eat!

454
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,780
I guess we should have a little. Hurry up and eat it already!

455
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,010
Eat it!

456
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
I'll help myself then.

457
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,290
This has no flavor at all.

458
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,290
This is gross.

459
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,160
Gross.

460
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
Eat all of it please, eat up.

461
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,660
No, you.

462
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
No, you're the one who should eat all of it.

463
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,630
Yeah, you.

464
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,430
What the hell?

465
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Why is that?

466
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,070
Why did you change from casual to polite?

467
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,340
You eat it. Seriously.

468
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,970
Ow!

469
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,810
See, you're so harsh with me!

470
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,580
Isn't it odd that it's only me!?

471
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,620
I'm the only one who gets hit like this! Ow ow ow ow ow

472
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,020
Why are you pinching me?

473
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,890
That hurts, geez... Why are you doing this?

474
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
This is just weird.

475
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
You're not even scooping anything.

476
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,090
It's all dry and crumbly.

477
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,060
What the hell are you doing?

478
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,420
Why only that much?

479
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
This isn't even funny, so take this off.

480
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,370
It tastes bad, right?

481
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
Right?

482
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
Right?

483
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,470
What the hell is this?

484
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,870
Matsumoto, give him this.

485
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,070
Oh, we have some condiments.

486
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,510
For the occasion, you know.

487
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,810
Condiments.

488
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,880
It'll improve the taste.

489
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,680
Let's add some flavor.

490
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,310
There's no way I can eat this.

491
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,720
Tabasco.

492
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,820
I will add dashes of this... To the back of your head.

493
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,730
Please, no, please!!

494
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,560
It's okay, the flavor will be improved.

495
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,730
Your way of thinking will be improved.

496
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,870
That's right.

497
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,870
That's right.

498
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,200
Is this going to be okay?

499
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,470
Isn't it written on the label?

500
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,470
It's okay, it's okay.

501
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,070
Why would that be written on the label? To not pour this on one's head?

502
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,850
It says "Only for use on the back of the head."

503
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,750
Those are the instructions.

504
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,220
Wait wait, it actually says, "For use on the back of the head."

505
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,220
That's the same thing!

506
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,990
It's one of the many purposes.

507
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,520
It's definitely okay to pour.

508
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,690
Hold on a minute.

509
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,810
It's okay.

510
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,830
Massage that area for him.

511
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,560
What the hell.

512
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,530
Am I going to be okay?

513
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
What kind of situation has this developed into?

514
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,770
I'm going to soak his scalp.

515
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Oh that seems pretty good.

516
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,370
It's applied very nicely.

517
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,240
Eat it, eat it now!

518
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
Hurry, hurry!

519
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,980
Do your best! Do your best!
