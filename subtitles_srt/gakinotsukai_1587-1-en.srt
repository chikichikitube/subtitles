The highly-rated Gaki Jiji-Nuki!

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,660
The cards being used will have various different original subjects on them

8
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,660
Like the game Old Maid, match the cards to deplete your hand

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,640
Whoever is left with the one unmatchable card must follow its orders

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,440
I'M NOT GETTING PUNISHED EVEN ONCE TODAY OKAY?

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,740
Alright, let's do it

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,950

A famous song title is written on each card

19
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,450
Enthusiastically perform a famous song a cappella

20
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,450
The last person remaining must sing that song

21
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:49,530
First Round: All-Out A Capella

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,530
Here are the cards this round. Try to guess the "Old Man!"

23
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,600
Hosei draws from the player to the right and turns go clockwise

24
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,600
"Old Man" starts

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:45,480
Joker

26
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,740

B.B. Queen's "Odoru Ponpokorin"

28
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,910
"Odoru Ponpokorin" by B.B. Queens

29
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,910
Pair

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,910
B.B. Queens, huh?

31
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,080
Matsumoto-san takes a card, correct?

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,080
Yes, that's right, in this...

33
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,520
order...

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,090
I don't think that's right...

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,090
Staff

36
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,760
Eh!?

37
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,990
Endo-san takes a card right?

38
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,990
Staff

39
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,890
Just now Hosei-san took a card right?

40
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,070
Next

41
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,070
Endo takes

42
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,070
a card from Hosei...

43
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,070
Right, you messed up the turn direction

44
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,070
That happens

45
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,600
It's Tanaka's fault! If it's anybody's

46
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,310
This was all on Tanaka!

47
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,310
I even asked earlier whether this was okay

48
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,480
My position changed so

49
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,480
now I have no idea what's going on

50
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,480
Your position changed...

51
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,480
So Endo draws from my hand, correct?

52
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,610
Yes, that's correct, the game goes clockwise

53
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,120
Okay

54
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,860
Why does it look like you have an advantage

55
00:01:51,120 --> 00:02:33,400
Joker

56
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,130
Yes, it's like that

57
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,860
Because he's the dealer?

58
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,860
Correct

59
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,100
You didn't match right? So now I draw

60
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,570
Gimme!

61
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,070

That one's an enthusiastic song

71
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,250
That one really uses your voice

72
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,890

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,580
Saburou Kitashima's card circulates endlessly

81
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,680
He came back

82
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,920
Yes yes yes

83
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,920

The cards all have a yellow background don't they

85
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,770

You really wanna match soon right

88
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,170
Why are you holding the cards so strongly?

89
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,380
Ah, I've seen this one before

90
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,780
Alright, going with this one

91
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,150

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:34,320
Linda Yamamoto takes Saburou Kitashima's place in the infinite loop

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,260

Yama-chan you've won too

110
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,190
It's up to whether your card matches one of mine right?

111
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,630

00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,630

Cards Remaining

116
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
It's been a while since it felt like this

117
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,870
All-out a cappella performance...

118
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,420
GIMME!

119
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,380

I draw right?

130
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,490
If it matches Hamada's card...

131
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,760
It all depends on this draw

132
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:44,460
If Hamada pairs Endo loses

133
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,560

There ain't no TVs! Ain't no radios!

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,120
The cars ain't even goin' that fast!

160
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,880
No pianos! No bars!

161
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,710
The cops come round 'n round everyday

162
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,590
Wake up in the morn', take the cows out

163
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,490
For a lil' two hour walk

164
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,460
There ain't no phones! Ain't no gas

165
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,020
Bus only comes here once a day

166
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,800
I've had enough of this village

167
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,430
I've had enough of this village

168
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,400
So I'm goooooooooin' down to Tokyo

169
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,690
And when I get down to Tokyo

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,640

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,840

NYAAAH~!

173
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,450
It's gotta be Shozo doing this kind of thing

174
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,090
It was good that Endo-san sang it

175
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,020
I could never do this

176
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,690
HUWAAAAH!

177
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,960
That HUWAAAAAAH at the end

178
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,200
This round's theme is

179
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,280
*TN: famous sports commentator

180
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,280
In the style of Ichirou Furutachi*,

181
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:33,910
Improvised Commentary

182
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,340
improvised live commentary of an ordinary object

183
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,200
What the hell?

184
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:40,350
An everyday object is written on each card

185
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:45,420
Perform a live commentary on a commonplace object

186
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,350
There's no way I can do that

187
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,210
The item will appear in front of the loser,

188
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,420
who must do a live commentary about that object

189
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,490
Even Furutachi-san wouldn't do that

190
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:59,930
Improvised Commentary

191
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,340
One of these cards will have live commentary!

192
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,930
Guess which one will be the "Old Maid."

193
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,930
I wanna avoid this one

194
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,570
Dealer Endo begins the game by drawing

195
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,200
"Old Man" starts

196
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,040
Endo-san

197
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,040
please draw a card from me

198
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,220
I see...

199
00:07:13,040 --> 00:08:12,140
Joker

200
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,580
No matches right? Right?

201
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,390
Hold up...

202
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,890
Staff

203
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,890
You're going the wrong way

204
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,890
Eh...

205
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,890
no way!?

206
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,590
Eh?

207
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,590
Who?

208
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,830
Who? What happened? Who?

209
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,730
Dude it's your fault

210
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,570
Endo-san draws from Hosei-san

211
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,570
Staff

212
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,640
Earlier Tanaka clearly said

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,640
draw from me

214
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,710
Actually,

215
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,710
you shoulda drawn from Hosei right

216
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,980
Who?

217
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:44,980
Who?

218
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:44,980
Who?

219
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,980
Who?

220
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,410
Hold up

221
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,540
Hold up

222
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,610
Endo

223
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,610
Wait, hold up a sec

224
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,720
WTF are you saying?

225
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,190
This was a bad mistake huh?

226
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,960
What do you mean?

227
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,960
He shouldn't have drawn from you

228
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,230
How about you sing "Yosaku"...

229
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,500
Wait please, wha-, really,

230
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,800
did I really f*ck up that hard?

231
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,930
Well of course, and it's the second time today

232
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,140
Excuse me, I apologize

233
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:47,240
"Yosaku" by Kitashima Saburou

234
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:47,240
All-Out A Cappella

235
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,080
Yosaku cuts the tree~

236
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,340
So quiet

237
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,820
Hey hey ho, hey hey ho~

238
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,000
And it echoes back~

239
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,180
Hey hey ho, hey hey ho~

240
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,200
His wife...

241
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,240
Forget it

242
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,040
Gotta be all-out

243
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,510
It was all the same

244
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,380
I feel sick now

245
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,420
"Old Man" starts

246
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,420
Endo's card is returned, and the game restarts

247
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:28,110
Joker

248
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,840
I got a pair!

249
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,840
Really?

250
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Isn't that too fast

251
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,720
Pair

252
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,720
Spatula

253
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,630
Now I shall draw a card

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,670
Your pupils are wide open

255
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,170
Is, is this right?

256
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,170
So scary

257
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,670
It should be right...

258
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,010
Drawing from the right, here I go

259
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,280
Got a match

260
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,110
Compass

261
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,110
Pair

262
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,380
Please take it

263
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:46,000
Joker

264
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,380
After that, the game goes smoothly

265
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,920
I got one

266
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,850
Pair

267
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,850
Roller skates

268
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,930
Yes, here's folding fan.

269
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,790
Folding Fan

270
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,790
Pair

271
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,530
The number of cards quickly decreases

272
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,000
Daruma

273
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,000
Pair

274
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,000
That one ticks me off

275
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:57,110
Joker

276
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,340
The next time you laugh

277
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,340
it's punishment time

278
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,110
Please stop holding them so tightly

279
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,100
Or else I'll get punished

280
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:20,370
Joker

281
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,880
Du-duuuuuun

282
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,780
So simple minded

283
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,420
You laughed amirite?

284
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,420
No I didn't

285
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,320
Hosei you're laughing

286
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,710
You are tho

287
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,320
I didn't laugh

288
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,020
I'm normally like this

289
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,710
He told me not to hold them so strongly, so I didn't,

290
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,090
but he laughed anyway

291
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,760
No way you were holding them so tightly

292
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,370
He makes this face

293
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,570
Cards Remaining

294
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,570
Endo to draw

295
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,570
Endo, with one card, draws for the win

296
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,170
I wonder if the match is in there

297
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:37,420
Joker

298
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,630
I'll take this one

299
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,610
No way

300
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,610

301
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,280

00:10:37,680 --> 00:11:19,690
Joker

308
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,250
The game suddenly quickly advances

309
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,690
Ooh, here's one!

310
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,990

311
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,990
Pair

312
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,990
Cactus

313
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,490
He got the right card...

314
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,340

315
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,870

321
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,340

Hosei-san has won

323
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,780
If Tanaka matches...

324
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,880
If I... yes...

325
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,880
Yeah, he'll win

326
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
It'll be a battle between Downtown.

327
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,020
Damn, no pair

328
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,290
It's all from here

329
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,990
Tanaka please c'mon

330
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,690
Wouldn't it be nice to be a spectator

331
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,190

332
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:29,570
Joker

333
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,190

Teapot

337
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,000
Teapot, huh...

338
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,500
Tanaka draws to win

339
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,310
Joker

340
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,380
No good?

341
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:34,980
Yessss

342
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,310
Yes, another chance for me

343
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,330
This is a big chance

344
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,410
Hamada draws to win

345
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,380

346
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,770
I'm counting on you!

347
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,580

348
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:48,920
Joker

349
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,020

356
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,420
He won

357
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,840
Wait, if this is a match...

358
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,190
If this matches yours...

359
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,120
Matsumoto draws to win

360
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,120
I don't have a choice of card

361
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,630
Matsumoto draws to win

362
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,630
If Hamada's leftovercard matches one of Matsumoto's, Tanaka loses!

363
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:07,340
Who will perform the live commentary?

364
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:07,340
Will it be Matsumoto or Tanaka?

365
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,110
Wait, wait, I'm gonna cover the card up

366
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:50,720
Joker

367
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,380
It's gotta match for sure now

368
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,980
Like this, like this

369
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,620
Stop, stop, stop...

370
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,210
*dead frog noises*

371
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,460
That's good, isn't that good?

372
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,460
ISN'T THAT GOOD?

373
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,490
STOP! PLEASE STOP!

374
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,930

375
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,500

376
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,500

377
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,500
Stopwatch

378
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,670

379
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,670
has won!

380
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,100
Which means...

381
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,140
The question is what the object is

382
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,970
This card is...

383
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,350
Pair

384
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,350
Sunglasses

385
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,350
I matched sunglasses, so

386
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,350
Here you go, it's this

387
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,720
The punishment theme is "purse"

388
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,720
Purse

389
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,590
Ichirou Furutachi-style live commentary!!

390
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,590
Purse

391
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:59,590
Loser Tanaka gets the punishment!

392
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,660
3... 2... 1...

393
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:39,300
Purse

394
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,980
Please begin

395
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,980
Oooh, what's this in front of me?

396
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,940
What, what, what is this?

397
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,400
Appeared in front of me, it has indeed

398
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,260
This has appeared

399
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,720
This is, oh, the feel in the hand is

400
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,080
brown feeling of something

401
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,380
Here it opens wide, spread wide open, what is this

402
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,370
In-, inside there's also an open,

403
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,960
Inside there's also an open, it's got two levels

404
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,140
This is so-called, yes,

405
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,600
so-called, is this really what they call a PURSE!?

406
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,820
It's wide open, spread wide open, wide wide open

407
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,590
What the hell?!

408
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,140
This is, what color is this?

409
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,080
Oh my, it's a gold colored case

410
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,930
Eh, large bills can fit in here

411
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,930
*TN: b. 1948, Muranishi Tōru is an adult video (AV) director,

412
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,930
It's Director Muranishi

413
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,930
aka "Emperor of Porn"

414
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,300
*TN: 2019 Muranishi comedy-drama series

415
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,300
It's "The Naked Director*!"

416
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,700
Always saying it's wide open, spread wide open...

417
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,240
Somehow it became perverted too

418
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,240
Spread wide open huh

419
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,200
Someone quiet in the background, Hamada maybe?

420
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,970
You get super flustered from this

421
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,880
It's karma because you messed up earlier

422
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,640
"Oooh! What is this?"

423
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,150
"It's open wide,

424
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,150
spread wide open"

425
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,920
"Inside there's an open"

426
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,920
EMBARASSING!!

427
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,820
You get flustered and panicked doing this

428
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,820
I'm so glad I didn't do this

429
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,190
In the end you got two punishments

430
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,790
Tanaka you're all over the place today

431
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,200
No kidding

432
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,730
I'm really sorry

433
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,730
What's the last one?

434
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,330
I'll spin the roulette

435
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:19,600
Deciding the dealer by roulette

436
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
It's gotta be Endo

437
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,370
I do it a lot huh

438
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,370
Is it Endo?

439
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,510
Similar to last time,

440
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,350
it's a punishment, but

441
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,650
also like last time,

442
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,690
it will be an "air" punishment.

443
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:40,190
Acting out the punishment through charades

444
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,190
Hosei-san you did this ridiculous batsu right

445
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:48,770
Last time's batsu, powerful electric shock machine

446
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:48,770
Hosei had the batsu last time

447
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Right now it's level 2

448
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,770
Oh sh*t here it comes

449
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,680
Okay level 3

450
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,780
What the f*ck is this!?

451
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,250
Going from 3 to 5

452
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,250
3 to 5!

453
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,420
Don't increase it so quickly!

454
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,790
I wonder why it's like that

455
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,490
The hellish "Air Batsu Game!"

456
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,490
Who will get it this time?

457
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,130
That's gotta be tough

458
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,660
It's really bad

459
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,370
This time is also the air punishment game

460
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,500
The punishment card has already been drawn

461
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,470
Aren't I supposed to deal the cards?

462
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,810
Hmm?

463
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,810
Ooooooooooh!

464
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,810
This is crazy

465
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,650
Please nooooooo

466
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,080
Endo you're the dealer right?

467
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,080
I'm sorry nooooooo

468
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,320
Wanna wear that thing again?

469
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,480
No more nooooooo

470
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,750
How about the teapot?

471
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,750
Let's do the teapot

472
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,350
Teapot!?

473
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:53,400
Teapot

474
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:53,400
Ichirou Furutachi-style live commentary!!

475
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,060
Tanaka messes up the order,

476
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:53,400
and receives the punishment!

477
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,740
3... 2... 1... Go!

478
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:08,410
Teapot

479
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,280
Oooh, what, what is this

480
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,000
What has appeared in front of me

481
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,940
Is this what they call a teapot

482
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,870
What a mysterious object

483
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,210
There's the handle part,

484
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,860
and this part which opens wide

485
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,410
Don't say that, "opens wide!"

486
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,650
"Is this what they call a teapot?"

487
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,250
No sh*t!

488
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,690
Final Round

489
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,690
The final round with the "air" batsu at stake!

490
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,930
These air batsu, aren't you good at them

491
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:58,160
Joker

492
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,330
No way

493
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,770
I never act my punishments

494
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,970

503
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,180
There are lots of bad ones

504
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,550
Woah, this one's terrible

505
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,150
Alright, so dealer Endo...

Tell him what he's gotta do

509
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,860
Ooooh?

510
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,130

Already only two cards?

514
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,800
Yama-chan, only one card left...

515
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:44,410
Joker

516
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,010

"150 kph Spiked Chestnut Shot"

523
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,950
If you don't do the batsu

524
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,950
there's no way you can get a good reaction

525
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,790
Two of you only have one card?

526
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,550
Well, but yeah

There's no actual punishment so

537
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,640
they're really writing whatever the f*ck they want

538
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,410
These ideas are interesting though

539
00:17:44,680 --> 00:18:01,190

It's Tanaka Day today

556
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:16,740
No no no, no way, the viewers won't want it either

557
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,180

566
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,960
It was Tanaka's mistake

568
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,960

He just said it so clearly now

570
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,360
What the f*ck man

571
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,800
No no , please, really

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,100
I'll quit being moderator

573
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,630

We'll be in trouble if you do though

575
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,700
Please, one more chance

576
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,910
I've got this drilled in my head now

577
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,640
There's no next time alright

578
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,180
But wait

579
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,680
I didn't notice my mistake so

580
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,950
this might repeat many times over

581
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,880
It's scary

582
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,880
That's true

583
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,850
If I can get a hang of it,

584
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,260
I can repent my mistakes

585
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,260
If you can get a hang of it

586
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,260
True

587
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,890

589
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,330
Tanaka gimme GIMME

590
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,730
Damn, first time seeing this

591
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:30,980
Joker

592
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,730
I think it's fine if Tanaka gets it

593
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,400
No not happening, someone else

594
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,140

Turtle shell bondage...

600
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,980
The bondage part has nothing to do with it

601
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,980
Can't act that part out

602
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,940
Alright, I'm gonna finish this

603
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,490

So?

613
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,870
No no, ask Tanaka what to do next

614
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,460
What should he do?

615
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,730
If he doesn't get this...

616
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,470
The cards are always

617
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,470
drawn from the person to the right

618
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,470
Right, right

619
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,040
The cards are alw-

620
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,010
So tell him what's he supposed to do

621
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:09,590
Matsumoto-san just...

622
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:09,590
matched the cards titled

623
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,590
"Wasabi Soy Sauce Eyedrops"

624
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,090
Don't just regurgitate facts

625
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,060
Yeah, tell us what to do next

626
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,060
Everyone knows what you just said

627
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:21,400
Matsumoto just got a pair, so...

628
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,400
now...

629
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,500
Yama-chan draws right?

630
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,500
Yes, ri-, yes

631
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,910
I draw from Matsumoto-san,

632
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,910
Matsumoto-san wins

633
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,640
Matsumoto

634
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,640
has won!

635
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,580
Yama-chan if this matches...

636
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,210
Yeah, then I win

637
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,850

Cards Remaining

639
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,320
It's all down to this

640
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
It was so fast

641
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,610
It's been narrowed down to us

642
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,990
Narrowed down to the last three!

643
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,330
Who will get the air batsu?

644
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,100
It's gotta be this one

648
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,410

Tickle Hell

652
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,010
I also hate this one

653
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,380
It was suck to do a charade of this

654
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,250
Damn, down to this one card?

655
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,620
Hamada draws to win

656
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,350

657
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,620
No wait, I have two cards

658
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,980

Joker

660
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,180

00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,420
What was that now

662
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,420
Ooooh?

663
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,420
Did you see that now

664
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,430
Away from the camera

665
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,430
he kicked my left foot

666
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,430

00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,870
Just one card

668
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,860
It's down to this

669
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,280

Hosei draws to win

676
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,060
Hamada-san you won right

677
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,050
So if this card matches one of Hosei-san's,

678
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,320
If this matches with mine

679
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,320
then you win too

680
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,190
Who will get the air batsu!? Hosei, or Tanaka!?

Joker

682
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,100
It's worth seeing either of them do the batsu

683
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,100
No no no please no I'm good

684
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,400

689
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,640

690
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,510

691
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,750
*TN: variety comedy show

692
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,750

693
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,750

has won!

698
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,090
It's gotta be that way

699
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,090
It was decided for him

700
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,490
Tanaka today is just like that

701
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,690
I don't want this really

702
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,890
So what is it Tanaka-san?

703
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,760
"Giant Metal Tub Drop"

704
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,900
"Giant Metal Tub Drop" it is

705
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:44,010
Air Batsu "Giant Metal Tub Drop"

706
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:44,010
Loser Tanaka gets the air punishment game!

707
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,980
This is really scary Tanaka

708
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,750
It seems to be huge

709
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,950
It's huge?

710
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,950
Gigantic

711
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,420
Alright are we ready?

712
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,420
Have you never seen one this big?

713
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,790
It's about the same size as the studio

714
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,890
No I can't do this

715
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,480
Alright, Tanaka-san

716
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,420

717
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,800
please proceed!

718
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,180
This looks so painful

719
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,380
It's what he does all the time

720
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,380
The usual

721
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,590
The usual faking

722
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,490
And it's so long

723
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,230
And he's trying really hard to improve his act

724
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,430
We're always seeing this

725
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,200
Sure enough we got it on film

726
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,070
Thank you very much
