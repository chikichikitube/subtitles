00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,900
The Future Century
Squadron: The Five Rangai!

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:12,740
The manager, He said he'll divorce
his wife and marry me.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,840
Realy? He can?

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,620
I didn't much love him at first,
but what he said moved me.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,800
You really need to think this
thing through.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,920
Yes?

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,860
Ryoko-chan! Why didn't you come
to the Tokyo Dome?

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,940
I was waiting for you all day.
- I did, but when I see you outfit...

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,500
Oh, what's wrong with this?
- You guys had a date?

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,240
I paid much money for the tickets.
- Hey, this is my apartment!

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,300
Shut up!

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,620
How about movies then?
- Yes.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,320
If you don't wear this outfit...
- Oh, let's do it now!

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,800
Ouch. What?
- He's calling for you.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,280
Please stop!

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,180
I said he's calling for you!

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,400
Ok, maybe next week.

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,980
No! Heeelp!

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Stop!

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,580

Yellow Rangai!

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,440
Green Rangai!

25
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,700
Our powers combined!

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,980
The Five Rangai!

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,340
Ladies got out of here, now!
- Thank you.

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,960
Stay right there!

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,340
On our spot!

30
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,360
You creeps me out!

31
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,340
You are gruesome!

32
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:11,680
Ok. Red, Pink, Yellow, Green and Blue.

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,480
The colors are good.

34
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,180
No problem with the color this time.
- Thank you very much

35
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,740
You guys are beginning to get it
aren't you?

36
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,100
We're sure you'll be satisfied today.

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,980
Well... let's check out you guys
one by one.

38
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,860
You're... able to fight?

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,540
Yes.
- You have a hell of a body!

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,340
A hell of a body... but, still not right.
You need sleeves.

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,440
Oh, do I need those? This isn't right?
- No.

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,040
I wonder my being gay got
something to do with this.

43
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,400
Pink, you aren't bad. But  your knickers.
- This is mobile.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,780
But that's not for a hero.

45
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,400
I can climb high.
- I know that.

46
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,060
Hey! Dame.
- What is it?

47
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,040
Can you go around like that ?
How do you fight?

48
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:28,700
I'm a lady, so if there's a bad guy
I'll pay someone to take  necessary...

49
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,940
Cut the crap.

50
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,100
You are the one who have to fight.
- I'm very sorry.

51
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,560
You! You got  too much attached.

52
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,820
Which are your real name?
What's are you doing with these?

53
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,820
You can't even punch me with this.
- No.

54
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,920
You don't need these.

55
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,100
You know, when I was doing this move
I felt ridiculous myself.

56
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,100
And what's this?
Why suckers?

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,320
This is a... Taizo made this... ad lib.

58
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,280
So Taizo make your costumes.

59
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,240
I can't even come up with the words...

60
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,180
You have no intention to fight.
- I was on track team in high school.

61
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,260
I run very fast.
- So?

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,620
I thought may be this will make
me run even faster.

63
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,600
Please fight with us.

64
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,340
No I can't.
- Let's fight.

65
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,560
Stop! You idiot!

66
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,220
Wait! Just wait a minute.
Is he capable of fighting?

67
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,980
How about him?

68
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,400
I admit this costume isn't
cut out  for fighting.

69
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,800
My costume lift up my spirit.
- Me too.

70
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,400
Why you are on all fours?

71
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,240
At least I won' get caught up if I run.

72
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,380
You're not making any sense.

73
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,540
That's means no fighting?
- No. You've only got the colors right.

74
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,400
I see you understand about
the colors finally.

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,840
You are suppose to be a heroes!

76
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,580
But you were stealing glance at me
for quite a while, Dokuro-san.

77
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,540
That mean I'm OK, right?
I can attract viewers too, right?

78
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,380
I was looking because
your nuts are sticking out!

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,100
I can't help it!

80
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,600
It bothers me.

81
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,700
Keep it inside!

82
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:58,160
No, this is... a kind of
smoke signal... for me.

83
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,460
I think he also have a problem
with his lower body.

84
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,720
I don't see anything wrong with me.

85
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,140
Doesn't the fact you're talking to
me in that posture makes you realize?

86
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,680
If you want to ride me just say it.

87
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,620
You just have too much attached.

88
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,100
But, I mean we are...
- Why are you giving me this?

89
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,840
You don't need that much!

90
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,460
What? You've got something?

91
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,460
No use provoking me.
I'm not gonna fight.

92
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,000
Pink is the closest,
- Really?

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,080
You only need to change the knickers
and throw away the lunch box.

94
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,200
So pink is the closest, right?
- Yes, I can tell you that!

95
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,660
You got it?
- Yes.

96
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,220
Thank you very much.

97
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,420
You! You better think really hard
about what a hero is this time.

98
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,500
You are standing now!

99
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,980
I'll excuse myself.

100
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,700
Don't forget what I said.
- I won't. Goodbye.

101
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,040
Thanks. Don't forget it, ok?
- I won't.

102
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,940
Does this still continue?

103
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,100
The Future Century Squadron: The Five Rangai!   To be con't.
