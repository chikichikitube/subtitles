1
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,980
Surprisingly enough, people other than the Owarai talents speak of Documental

2
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,990
Saying that it's hilarious, which really surprises me

3
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,430
To be honest, this is definitely not something classy

4
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,140
What surprised me was that Rola said she wants to join

5
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,110
What on earth are you thinking?

6
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,610
And she says "I can handle it"

7
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:17,790
We've been constantly adding some minor changes to each season

8
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,750
Point System

9
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:20,460
Zombie System

10
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,460
and that variation seems to be working well

11
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,630
So this time, we will add another new rule too

12
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,370
A new experiment

13
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,940
You can ask someone for help

14
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,940
so an outsider will blend into the group

15
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:39,410
Helper System

16
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,410
Well, it could be a stray dog, if you like

17
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,150
Did you tell them about the new rule?

18
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,580
Yes I told them

19
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,750
But maybe all of them would ask for help,
and maybe some would say it's not necessary

20
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:56,060
So the number of helpers will be kept as a secret

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,730
The desired "ending"

22
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,800
I'm looking forward to see an instant defeat

23
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,770
Instant may sound too fast

24
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,750
But having the contest to end in a couple of hours
never happened before right?

25
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,580
It's the same as boxing,
first round knockout is much to be desired

26
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,720
Arising in the pandemonium,

27
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,500
is the improvisation of group owarai

28
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,800
While these 10 contestants are enemies to each other,

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,400
but it's actually a team play as well,

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,340
you can't just be disturbing others,

31
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:49,310
so this really makes me think that,
Owarai is gathered with a group of gentlemen

32
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,320
Well, gentlemen are showing their dicks

33
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,890
but still, showed in a gentle way

34
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:03,830
as a gentleman, as a nobleman

35
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,070
Towards the 5th contest

36
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,700
It's just interesting

37
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,640
I'm doing a TV show about Oogiri

38
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,210
as well as shows like Suberanai Hanashi

39
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,580
I'm also the judge for Konto

40
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,250
and I can totally see that people have different strengths

41
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:29,050
and the players that suits Documental is gradually taking shape

42
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:42,840
I hope to see a champion contest soon

43
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,410
Yesterday, I've been watering the plants in my garden

44
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,580
and I got panicked when it iced up this morning

45
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,350
But I was told that they will be fine.

46
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,990
This taught me a lesson about the toughness of plants

47
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,160
That being said, I would like to offer you an invitation

48
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,570
Could you prepare one million yen

49
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,670
and gather at a designated location?

50
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,940
I shall reinitiate Documental

51
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,380
I have prepared a reward of 10 million yen for the winner

52
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,520
Of course, participation is voluntary

53
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,420
For those of you who wish to participate

54
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,960
I shall inform you of the time and location

55
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,630
Awaiting your reply

56
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,560
I hope the steps of Spring will bring luck to you

57
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,240
Sincerely, Matsumoto Hitoshi

58
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,510
THE PARTICIPATING COMEDIANS ENTER

59
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,420
That's a big bag

60
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,760
I'm the first one?

61
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,230
Am I the first one?

62
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,270
Akiyama is like a regular member now

63
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,040
Nothing has changed in this room

64
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,610
Well, only this room

65
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,210
I'm Akiyama Ryuji from the group Robert

66
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,850
It's time to win the prize

67
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,220
Excuse me

68
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,720
What's happening?

69
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,990
I remember this envelope

70
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,190
Will you accept it for the 3rd time?

71
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,860
This is exactly the same envelope right?

72
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,060
So as the way you come in and hand me the letter

73
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,130
Akiyama is really an all-round player

74
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,770
And he suits Documental perfectly

75
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,970
It should be no surprise if he wins this time

76
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:15,580
I personally find his scene
with Kendo Kobayashi very impressive

77
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,820
It was hilarious

78
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,760
That was not planned at all

79
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,730
I was just acting as the massage girl that I know

80
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:35,070
I seriously didn't expect
my private activities to help out

81
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,240
The chubby imitation creator

82
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,740
But that's still not enough

83
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,010
So I'll take it to the next level this time

84
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:58,120
Instead of just sticking to the
usual patterns in previous seasons

85
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,360
or just following others blindly

86
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,030
I want to fight with originality

87
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,430
I have that same feeling again

88
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:15,870
I hope this will be interesting,
even to the comedians that are not participating

89
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,980
Everything is exactly the same,
including the interior

90
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,990
Here he comes

91
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,600
It's his first time to join

92
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,530
Really?

93
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,630
-Akiyama
-For real?

94
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,410
I'm Takahashi from Savanna

95
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,710
I brought in one million yen

96
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,640
and I wanna take home ten million

97
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,720
-Hello     -Hi

98
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,150
Me?

99
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:04,620
Why would Matsumoto choose to invite me?

100
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,030
Takahashi is more of an intellectual type

101
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,960
Instead of using his body,

102
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,070
He may possibly play the game
with a little bit of cunning

103
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,040
and choose to keep a distance instead

104
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,110
The Super Flatterer talent

105
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,080
People always say that
there's a constant smirk on my face

106
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,550
When I was a student,

107
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,480
some gangsters asked me "what are you laughing at?"

108
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,290
and I got into trouble for 3 times

109
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,520
"What are you laughing at"

110
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,560
Does this count as laughing?

111
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,260
Yes

112
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,360
It does?

113
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,730
Absolutely

114
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,160
What about this?

115
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,770
That's out

116
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,500
Out?

117
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,340
I have to judge this fairly

118
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,270
or else that's another Fujimon incident

119
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,640
they say "Matsumoto is being too nice to Fujimon"

120
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,680
No way!

121
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,620
Wow, Takahashi-san

122
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,880
So that's how it goes

123
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,090
Normally, you should be able to
imagine the victory for a competition

124
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,490
Not at all for this

125
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,170
So to be honest,
I don't think I'm gonna get the 10 million

126
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,600
This is blowing my mind

127
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,640
I can't imagine how Takahashi-san
will be like in this contest at all

128
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,620
Good morning

129
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,660
-Gosh, this is amazing
-Didn't expect this coming

130
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,400
Each of the three is different from the other two

131
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,330
Hello, I'm Kano Eikoh from Maseki Geinosha

132
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,200
Wait a second, is this...

133
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,770
This is awesome

134
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,010
I do think he is interesting

135
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,710
Well, he himself probably won't admit that

136
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,580
He's funny for being absent-minded

137
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,850
What does Documental means to you?

138
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,490
*Dohyō is the ring in which sumo wrestling bouts are held

139
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,490
It's a Dohyō

140
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,320
It's a clash between comedians

141
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,630
It's a clash between weapons

142
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,200
Wait, Sumo don't use weapons...

143
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,870
It's actually a battlefield, please let me change it

144
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,710
The narcissist prank victim

145
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,040
But surprisingly, Eikoh may possibly
be the aggressive player in these times

146
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,480
Although it won't be interesting at all

147
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,920
But those dull moment may instead become his weapon

148
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,550
Although I've joined many talk shows

149
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,960
but most of the time I was tongue-tied or making mistakes,

150
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,930
which ends up with some unexpected laughter

151
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,000
Those laughter were never meant to be there

152
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:08,110
So this time, I want to make
other comedians laugh with my own gags

153
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,740
I won none of the awards all this time

154
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,180
This is true for the R-1 contest too

155
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,650
Wait a second...
I actually won once in Tsuruko-san's radio show

156
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,390
Yeah I did...
but there's only 3 contestants

157
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,690
*Eikoh has been in a scandal for cheating with 6 girls

158
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,690
We haven't met since you've returned right?

159
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,860
Let me think...
Yeah, we didnt

160
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,670
Aren't those lines on your cheek becoming deeper?

161
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,270
Yeah...
My face is getting hollow

162
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,440
Well, that scandal must be stressing him out

163
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,890
Really?

164
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,860
Really?

165
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,630
Well yeah, this guest must be surprising

166
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,700
I'm Jinnai Tomonori

167
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,600
I really want to go home, even now.

168
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,170
-Hello     -Hi

169
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,440
Ahh...so here it comes

170
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,180
-Will you accept it?     -Of course

171
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,980
You'll need to prepare one million yen

172
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,080
It's not about the one million

173
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,990
I don't want to join even if you pay me one million

174
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,290
This is gonna be interesting

175
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:40,570
He's good at making fun of others

176
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,600
So I think he will be doing a good job

177
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,010
Mister One-man

178
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,510
One thing that I worry about Jinnai is that

179
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,280
he's not interesting at all when it comes to Oogiri

180
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:03,220
I don't have my own gags,
and I can't make people laugh all of a sudden

181
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm not the striker who scores goals

182
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,530
and here comes the police car again

183
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,240
When we had dinner together at the end of last year

184
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,270
We talked about whether to join Documental,
if it ever invites us right?

185
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,910
Yeah, we did we did

186
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,340
-I said I'll definitely deny it
-Yeah you did

187
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,250
Basically, I'm here without any weapons

188
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,690
So I'm aiming for a counter attack instead

189
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,220
Who else is coming?

190
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,120
There's 6 more people

191
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,930
This is amazing

192
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,900
No one is really out of space this time right?

193
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,540
What a long stick

194
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,780
-This is the best stage man     -I know

195
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,580
-Really?     -Wow, amazing members

196
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,250
He's terrified

197
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,690
This shows someone's personality

198
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,060
Well, I see

199
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,830
You do feel anxious though

200
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,360
-Good morning     -Good morning

201
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,060
Here comes the champion of King of Konto

202
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,840
I'm Yamauchi Kenji from Kamaitachi

203
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:31,710
I'm the champion of King of Konto in 2017, which is said to be the best contest ever

204
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,320
-Here it comes!     -Here it comes

205
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,520
I will accept it

206
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,120
I could see this coming,
as I've been working so hard

207
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,290
If I'm the contestant,
I won't want Yamauchi to be here

208
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,630
This guy doesn't really laughs at all,
and he turns on you with a poker face

209
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,600
His face itself is unfair

210
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,670
An unfair face

211
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,440
The ever-victorious Konto man

212
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,980
He's one of the potential winners

213
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,150
-What do you think?     -Just go

214
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,880
Would you pay me half of it?

215
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,820
Then repay me 5 million if you win

216
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,450
Well, I'll pay for it, no problem

217
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,830
-It's just a verbal promise anyway

218
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,830
-Why did you add that man

219
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,430
This year is really important to us

220
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,600
So I'm seriously aiming to win

221
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,300
-Is this your first time     -Yes it is

222
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,200
But I've been watching this

223
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,810
-You've been watching this show?     -Yes

224
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,450
I'm very greedy

225
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:48,020
I want to make people laugh to tears,
get them to think that I'm amazing

226
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,490
and win the 10 million all at a time

227
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,690
Is the one million in that bag?

228
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,600
Yeah it's in here

229
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,070
It has been really difficult for me to fund this

230
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,370
But you've got the prize from King of Konto isn't it?

231
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,400
-There was no more left
-You used them all?

232
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,470
I gave it to my parents and repaid my debts

233
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,810
So not much was left

234
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,150
I tried to borrow it from Yoshimoto finance,
but they refused me

235
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,310
-They didn't lend you any?     -Yes

236
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,890
It sounds like a giant is coming

237
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,800
-For real?     -Really?

238
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,360
-Jinnai is here too

239
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,360
-We just hung out recently right

240
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,870
-What are those words? (on his chest)
-Is the red panda still standing up?

241
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,500
Is this for real?

242
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,470
Hello, I'm the fantasista of owarai, Tamura Kenji.

243
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,910
Ciao

244
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,920
Please have a look

245
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,420
Here it comes

246
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,950
I actually think this suits Tamura very well

247
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,190
I've always suggested to invite him

248
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,160
He's the one that can deal with
dullness the most within today's members

249
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,600
He is really strong in this sense

250
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,140
-Kansai's side business king

251
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,610
-Try to ask him about virtual currency

252
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,040
Well, the Industrial Revolution in human history

253
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,110
this changed the use of horses to cars

254
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,020
and this boosted our productivity

255
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,590
which is one giant leap for mankind

256
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:33,420
The same thing is happening in the world of virtual money.
This is a revolution.

257
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,990
He's basically a slave to money

258
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,470
I bet he wants the 10 million more than anyone else

259
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:51,410
People seem to only recognize me
as the owner of a BBQ restaurant, or as an entrepreneur

260
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,880
and I want to make them think
"No, no, no, Tamura Kenji is a comedian"

261
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,820
When I was young,
I used to ignore all of the audiences

262
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,430
And only focused on making other comedians laugh

263
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,290
If I could take back those feelings

264
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,030
Maybe I would be able to win the contest

265
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,730
This is your first show after the scandal too right

266
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,940
What scandal?

267
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,300
-Both of you have been in a scandal

268
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,300
-Eh, you too?

269
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,740
No, I have never been in a scandal

270
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,140
-What are you talking about?
-So that's not a scandal?

271
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,480
No it's not a scandal

272
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,380
I just had food poisoning

273
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,120
The restaurant is in a scandal though

274
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
-Really?     -This scares me!

275
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,410
Wow, Tamura is here!

276
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,480
You've been on this show right

277
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,540
Jinnai, you cut you hair?

278
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,410
Well, I do cut my hair

279
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,750
-This is amazing!     -Give me a break!

280
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,480
Hello, I'm Kendo Kobayashi

281
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:12,060
People call me Kobaken

282
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,570
Excuse me? What are you doing here?

283
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,200
I'm looking for some interesting happenings
on the love hotel street

284
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,280
Jinnai, Kenkoba and Tamuken
were actually in the same comedy class

285
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:40,280
It's exciting to see these three comedians
gathering in the same space

286
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,860
But Kenkoba has been on Documental for a several times

287
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:52,030
So he might think that "this is my place" against the other two

288
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,800
The man of tenor eros

289
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:05,180
I realized that it's impossible to win with the tactics last time

290
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,610
there is still something left there for me to do

291
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:16,990
I really regret for not being able to ejaculate last time

292
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,160
I really regret about it

293
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,400
Last time, I was actually trying
to be interesting instead of winning

294
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,370
But this time,
instead of being interesting, I prefer winning

295
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,240
And instead of winning, I prefer ejaculating

296
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,650
If Jinnai starts doing some kinky things like we did before,

297
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,250
I'll literally cry if this happens

298
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,580
Laugh dude, just laugh

299
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:52,220
Because he came this far without doing all those shits

300
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,230
So it must be hilarious if Jinnai happens to do it

301
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,310
Those glasses are not fair

302
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,040
Ok ok, don't be scared man

303
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,150
This is becoming a classmates gathering

304
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,380
Almost everyone from our class is here

305
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,460
There's 3 of them here

306
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,160
Hello, I'm Hollywood Zakoshisyoh

307
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,830
-Hello     -Yes?

308
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,170
Invitation from Documental?

309
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,070
Oh, so it's finally here

310
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,510
Well, I probably won't be able to hold back my laughter

311
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,580
He has a unique conception of world

312
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,480
So maybe he's the one to win the contest

313
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,920
But it's gonna be horrible
if he's my daughter's boyfriend

314
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,220
A man with 2 trillion imitations

315
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,190
The king of sloppiness

316
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,570
Wow it's Eikoh-chan!

317
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,970
Your voice is so loud

318
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,570
Of course I am

319
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,340
The 4 people from NSC11th class

320
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,340
-You are happy right?     -Yes I am

321
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,070
There's no broadcasting code right?

322
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,040
Then I am the man!

323
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,250
Some contestants are aggressive
and some are not right?

324
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,120
Some of them do nothing
and simply hold back their laughters

325
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,120
I feel like "what are you doing here?"

326
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,660
Let me show you guys what to do on Documental

327
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,030
I am the true Documental!

328
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,060
I'll show you the max Zakoshisyoh

329
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,630
It's not even 10% when I'm on TV shows

330
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,800
This is what you call "crazy"

331
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,910
This is who you call a "lunatic"

332
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,040
I feel like winning as you're here

333
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,680
Why man! I'm definitely not going to laugh

334
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:01,390
I think everyone will be surprised to see this guest

335
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,720
He came with nothing, nothing!

336
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,030
This can't be true!

337
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,670
Is this a classmates gathering

338
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,840
Yeah, I know

339
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,210
Why would you accept it?

340
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,510
Hi, I'm Chihara Jr.

341
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,880
So I'm finally invited to the show

342
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,090
-Hello, excuse me     -Yes?

343
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:39,520
The contestants will all be people I know right

344
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,390
Well, what would be happenning

345
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,360
I have no idea what Junior should be doing too

346
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,070
To be honest,
I thought I'm irrelevant with this kind of shows

347
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,970
The logical minded veteran

348
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,710
-Give me a break, I can't do this man

349
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,480
Some people are actually introverts when they are off the stage

350
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,780
That being said, I wonder how Junior will be doing

351
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:13,690
I'm personally interested to see a different Junior,
even if he loses the contest

352
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,260
I came here without bringing anything

353
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,360
I try to keep my mind blank

354
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,670
There's nothing I can do about it anyway

355
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,470
I don't have any interesting gags

356
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:31,680
and I really dislike parties with a lot of people

357
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,310
My social life is extremely shorter than others

358
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,080
I'm primary school level when it comes to socializing

359
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,390
So I'm curious to see how far I'll go too

360
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,900
Kanoh-chan

361
00:25:52,900 --> 00:26:00,870
As the last person comes in,
the atmosphere is probably gonna change completely

362
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,180
Here he comes...wait she?

363
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,380
He shouldn't be a female,
so maybe he just became a female?

364
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,350
This is horrible

365
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,190
That's the worst

366
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,490
Yes, it's horrible

367
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,460
Why are you here?

368
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,430
Hi, I'm Jimmy Onishi

369
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,870
This time, I'm aiming to win the game

370
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,610
What's this? Invi..tation?

371
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,310
He is a man in a million

372
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:43,180
So we're simply asking him out

373
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,750
and apply economic sanctions to him

374
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,020
Not a good idea to invite him too frequently

375
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,790
This will soon give rise to a nuclear weapon

376
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,260
Super absent-minded nuclear weapon

377
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:06,170
I personally think it's dangerous
to have both Kuu-chan and Jimmy at a time

378
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:12,780
They're like Hwasong and Taepodong

379
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,810
It's way too dangerous

380
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:21,390
After my second time,
many comedians said it was hilarious

381
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,060
Full of confidence

382
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,060
He himself also finds it to be hilarious

383
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm Hideko from Fuji-shi

384
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,460
What did you say?

385
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,470
I'm Hideko from Fuji-shi

386
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,530
Hideko from Fuji-shi...

387
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,200
So you're not from Kansai any more?

388
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,400
I'm losing two millions now

389
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,570
and Yoshimoto finance is not lending money to me anymore

390
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:51,220
So if I lose again, I'll be wak...wok...
working for nothing all this time

391
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,850
It's such a shame!

392
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,360
How are we supposed to deal with this

393
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,020
10 people?

394
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,230
So everyone is gathered

395
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,760
-Having Zakoshi here really makes me feel like winning it

396
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,760
-What are you talking about

397
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,990
-This is so awkward     -Yeah it is

398
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,590
This is just the usual members

399
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,360
It's like we're just chilling out

400
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,530
Can't believe that Junior-san is joining

401
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,210
-Good morning     -Good morning

402
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,440
Why did you choose all these members?

403
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,280
Let me ask this first,
Jimmy is that your natural form?

404
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,450
Are you going to start like that?

405
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,320
Yes

406
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,450
How are you supposed to go beyond that

407
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,920
He definitely disadvantaged himself

408
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,890
The contest is not even started yet

409
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:07,830
You're fine with it?

410
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,360
Yeah, there will be more coming

411
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,860
We're already used to your costume

412
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:16,200
No problem at all. This is completely irrelevant

413
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,270
-It's like a blank canvas     -Yes

414
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:25,510
Okay, so do I even need to explain the rules now?

415
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,610
You all brought a million yen

416
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,180
The last person to stay in the room is awarded 10 million

417
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,250
-Yes     -Yep

418
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:39,820
So there's a yellow card and a orange card, and if you get a red card then you're out

419
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:45,800
We've been constantly adding some minor changes every time

420
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,230
And for this time, you guys know it

421
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,800
You can ask for help from one supporter of your choice

422
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,510
And the helper will be coming from here

423
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:00,040
But this helper won't be here for like 1 or 2 hours,

424
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,550
maybe just as few minutes and we'll ask them to leave

425
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:08,050
So I brought my one million as well

426
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,490
-Wow     -Thank you

427
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:17,060
Let's open it...
Like you're opening a FamilyMart chicken

428
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,700
So you won't get your hands dirty

429
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,500
So this is not dirty money

430
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,540
So everyone, please hand me your one million yen

431
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:38,250
-I believe this one million is filled with all sorts of emotions
-Sure it is

432
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,620
We won't be checking this, so I'm counting on you guys

433
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,060
This is amazing

434
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,620
This is so real

435
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,930
Yeah this is definitely real

436
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:54,770
-This is astonishing     -I want all that

437
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,870
That's 10 million

438
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,840
So putting this as well

439
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,510
and this is 10 million plus my 1 million

440
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:07,080
Minus the 1 million you payed, that's 10 million to take

441
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,410
Given all sorts of adult matters

442
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:18,390
This money will be switched with this instead

443
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,660
Like money laundering right

444
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,170
Well, it's somehow troublesome if we don't do so

445
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,170
Yamauchi, are you okay?

446
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,540
Yes I'm fine

447
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,140
You don't look so well

448
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,210
Is there something strange about me?

449
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,910
Well, you seems to be quiet today

450
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,510
I was out from Osaka 8 o'clock this morning

451
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,980
And was working for all this time

452
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,150
So I'm actually a bit tired

453
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,680
Oh you came from Osaka?

454
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:54,190
-Excuse me Matsumoto-san, my face is smirking even in natural form
-Yeah it's a smirking face

455
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,560
Well, maybe we'll take this into account, but it's hard to say...

456
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,030
-You're laughing now right?
-Am I laughing?

457
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,140
Just try to act cool

458
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,270
Act cool?

459
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,040
Shige does tend to speak with a smirking face

460
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,610
He seems to be asking this on purpose though

461
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,410
Well, so just try to act cool

462
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,210
Is this fine?

463
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,490
-Your laughing for sure
-No I'm not

464
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:27,360
We will be taking this into account to some extent

465
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,360
But...

466
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,860
But the audience always say something like
"he's being too nice to Fujimon"

467
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,600
Keep in mind that this contest needs team play,
and it is still a variety show

468
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,440
So please trust us,
we will make sure everything goes smoothly

469
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,570
Jimmy, are you okay?

470
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:45,810
My hands were pinched on Shinkansen...
my hands...my hands...

471
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,140
My hands were pinched on Shinkansen

472
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,180
How are they pinched?

473
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,450
By the door, by the door

474
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,650
Shinkansen's door?

475
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,920
Shinkansen's door pinched my hands

476
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,980
Pinched?

477
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,190
Yes pinched...pinched...

478
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,320
-Your hands got stucked?
-Yes

479
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,460
The train chugged out of the station with your hands stucked?

480
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,200
Yes my hands were like this for quite a while

481
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,730
Your fingers were outside the train?

482
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,830
Yeah starting from the Hamamatsu station

483
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:13,940
Why did you leave it like that?

484
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,570
Why are you sharing such an interesting episode now?

485
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,140
Why are you near the doors?

486
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,450
I wanted to buy Unagi Bento

487
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,850
That's a proper reason

488
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,550
-Unagi Bento is sold near the door...
-He's still talking about it

489
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,890
-Then it bangs
-Yeah the doors banged!

490
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:38,360
-If you shared this later, I must have laughed
-That was close

491
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,570
-Stucked until Tokyo station?
-No, until Shin-Yokohama station and finally relaxed

492
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,140
But then my hands became like this

493
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,370
-The contest starts as the light changes
-Got it

494
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,910
So good luck guys

495
00:33:55,310 --> 00:34:01,080
-This is stressing me out
-Good luck guys

496
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,860
-I'm getting nervous
-Let's move over there

497
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,060
Can I leave my bag here?

498
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,630
Sure

499
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:13,660
Season 5, start!

500
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,470
We're already here for like 20 mintues right

501
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:22,240
Yes, you're right

502
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,610
So it started

503
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,940
Yeah it started

504
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,110
You wanna do something?

505
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,680
No, I'm just thirsty

506
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,980
I'm really thirsty

507
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,320
He's drinking it

508
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,490
He really drank it

509
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,760
What did you drink?

510
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,130
Wait a moment, he really drank it, that's insane

511
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,400
It's a mouthwash dude

512
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,830
Gosh, it stinks badly

513
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,870
It really stinks

514
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,500
That's no joke, Jimmy-san

515
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,270
Well, but I'm really thirsty

516
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,040
You can't drink it just because you're thirsty

517
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,170
-And it starts to stink
-That smells

518
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,110
Yeah it is

519
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:01,210
Are you serious?
You replaced it with something else right?

520
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,810
No, that's for real

521
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,080
Aren't you a fool?

522
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,450
But it doesn't say that you can't drink it

523
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,190
So it's drinkable?

524
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,720
-Just in case someone drinks it
-Well, yeah

525
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,690
But it's still no good to drink it dude

526
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,630
-But it's diluted so...
-This is awful

527
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,700
Of course it's awful

528
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,060
How do you feel?

529
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,770
-It says don't use it for anything other than mouthwash
-It's burning...

530
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,700
It must be burning your intestine!

531
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,940
My chest is burning

532
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,010
That's really dangerous

533
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,340
My chest is burning

534
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:35,310
-Drink some water
-Yeah I should, this is terrible

535
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,980
What are you doing man,
why did you do that right in the beginning

536
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,590
-You wanna eat some eggs?
-Yeah eggs should help

537
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,950
Eat the egg to dilute it

538
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,760
-Egg?...
-Give it a try

539
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,130
Sit here and face up

540
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
This is terrible

541
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,770
-Are you ready?
-Yes

542
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,700
This should dilute it

543
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,240
How do you feel?

544
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,410
It's probably starting to dilute a bit

545
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,780
Why are you shaking?

546
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,790
Because of the soda

547
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,620
Junior and Takahashi were close

548
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,760
You want another one?

549
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,590
That's probably too much

550
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,490
Why did you drink it without a doubt?

551
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,300
This is atopy

552
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,470
Kanoh is the same too

553
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,540
Are you allergic to eggs?

554
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,900
No, no, it's atopy

555
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,370
Kanoh has serious allergies

556
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:40,180
What allergies do you have again?

557
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:48,050
Well I'm allergic to soybeans, pollen, dogs, cats, house dust, and my own sweat

558
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,390
-Sweat?
-Your own sweat?

559
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,560
I have sweat allergy

560
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,390
-So you get itchy when you sweat?
-Yes

561
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,630
Yeah so I can't be sweating a lot

562
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,860
Shall you try some eggs then?

563
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,100
You're not allergic to eggs right?

564
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,330
I ate it already

565
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,200
Oh you mean me?

566
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,900
Can you eat eggs?
Aren't you allergic to it?

567
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,070
I'm not allergic to eggs

568
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,810
What's this?
What's happening here?

569
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,180
-It's therapy
-Therapy?

570
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,880
He's not even allergic to eggs

571
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,320
He laughed

572
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,420
Me?

573
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,590
Tamura-san it's not fair to wear those sunglasses

574
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:32,400
-Yeah take it off
-You're laughing right?

575
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:37,200
-Not at all
-Zakoshi-san please take a look

576
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,910
-Look at me
-Look at Zakoshi

577
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:45,940
Come one

578
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,210
Ah, he passed out

579
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,850
-Take off the sunglasses
-It's too hard to judge

580
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:01,190
Fine, let me get changed then,
it's awful to wear this anyway

581
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,490
-Okay
-Good idea

582
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,830
This costume is not going to make anyone laugh right?

583
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,700
Yeah, we're already used to it

584
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,330
No one will laugh right, I'll get changed then

585
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:16,110
Maybe someone will laugh if you show us a full version Ciao

586
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,680
Ciao

587
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,880
No, it's not gonna work right

588
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,120
-Your voice was surprisingly small
-Yes, it's actually meant to be small

589
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,390
People thought it will be loud

590
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,820
No, you have to say it with love

591
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,290
What about a business Ciao?

592
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,990
Ciao

593
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:42,630
What about in front of a swimming pool?

594
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,700
and it's really noisy

595
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,470
Ciao

596
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,880
That's a "kyaaa"

597
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,380
-Wait Junior-san...
-What about rising sun...

598
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,380
Junior-san

599
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,690
I hate Oogiri

600
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,620
-This isn't Oogiri...
-No it sounds like it is, Junior-san

601
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,500
Junior is very close

602
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,800
No it's not Oogiri at all

603
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,730
It does sound like Oogiri though

604
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:21,840
But you're indeed doing Ciao at all sorts of places right?

605
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,940
Yes, but if Junior-san is the one asking,
it just sounds like Oogiri

606
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,780
If that's the reason,
then I can't even talk anymore

607
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,680
Teach him a lesson, young man

608
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,950
There is no escape here,

609
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,290
You're supposed to do
whatever you've been asked to do

610
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,890
Yeah this young man will do
his Ramen-tsukemen gag too

611
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,800
At a swimming pool

612
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,770
Everybody listen to me!

613
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:54,040
*Ikemen means handsome

614
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:54,040
Ramen, tsukemen, I am ikemen! Okay!

615
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,940
He's loud

616
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,440
He turned around

617
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,210
Do it when your pet dog is dead

618
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,520
Look, it's definitely Oogiri

619
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Dead?

620
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,260
Thank you, thank you so much

621
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,390
Ramen, tsukemen, I am ikemen...Okay!

622
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,930
No it's not okay, it's dead

623
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,430
Well, it's one set including "okay"

624
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,840
Nice one buddy

625
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,040
That's amazing

626
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,210
Well, I'll read him a lecture afterwards

627
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,880
You're really not feeling well right?

628
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,280
Yeah, it was such a bad move

629
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,780
Yeah it is

630
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,350
I shouldn't have done that

631
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,050
I'm pushing myself too hard

632
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,320
It can damage your health

633
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,620
Are you really okay?

634
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,690
Not at all, try to drink some

635
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,560
No way, it clearly says
don't use it for anything other than mouthwash

636
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,000
Well, I must be fully sterilized though

637
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,470
Well yeah

638
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,400
Zakoshi, how is your newborn baby?

639
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,170
They are twins

640
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,270
What's their name?

641
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,910
-It's Half-dev and Full-dev
-Stop lying

642
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,780
How do you spell it?

643
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:11,010
It means Half-devil

644
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,220
No way

645
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,420
What about Full-dev?

646
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,990
It's Full-devil

647
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,660
You got into trouble for that before

648
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,720
She's a girl

649
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,690
Both of them?

650
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,790
She's intersexual

651
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,730
Which one?

652
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:29,130
Half-dev is masculine woman

653
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,430
-So she's intersexual?
-Yes

654
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,270
And Full-dev is feminine male

655
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,610
What happens if you have another baby?

656
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,310
I'll call them Ambalan Dendelen

657
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,210
Ambalan and Dendelen?

658
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,380
-Yes Ambalan and Dendelen
-So if it's twins again

659
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,390
Junior is in a pickle

660
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,350
Ambalan and Kambalan

661
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,720
Ambalan and Kambalan

662
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,020
What about Dendelen?

663
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,130
Dendelen will be for triplets

664
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,600
For triplets, they'll be called
Ambalan, Kambalan and Dendelen

665
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,970
For quadruplets, it's Dondoron

666
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,240
It's Mi and Ami

667
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,100
-No no no
-Eh, it's Mi and Ami?

668
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,910
-No no
-What a cute name

669
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,670
And they are both girls

670
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,280
-For real?
-No no no

671
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,680
They're called Headhunter A and Headhunter B

672
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,980
That's the name of the twin brothers wrestling for W*ING

673
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,890
How did you know that

674
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,720
So it's Miki and Might?

675
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,930
It's Mi and Ami,
because their Dad is Hollywood, so they are Miami

676
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,660
That's awesome

677
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,400
No no no, it's Miki and Tetsuya

678
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,630
Miki and Tetsuya?

679
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,940
Miki and Tetsuya

680
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:43,470
*Miki Tetsuya is another owarai talent from the same comedy class,
Do-wa-zu and Ore ore are both his gags

681
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,740
Do-wa-zu?

682
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,470
Ore ore!

683
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,580
What a sudden Ore ore...

684
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,940
Ore ore...

685
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,110
Want to see my gag "Too exaggerated imitation"?

686
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,480
*Desuyo is a owarai talent famous for his gag "I~am~sorry~", and Zakoshi's gag is to imitate it exaggeratedly
*Desuyo's "I~am~sorry~": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFw1vFxwbGc

687
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,480
What about a "Too exaggerated Desuyo"

688
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,620
OHHHHHH

689
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:03,030
I AM

690
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,930
SORRY

691
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,570
This is killing me

692
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,610
Koizumi Junichiro

693
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:20,240
*Koizumi Junichiro was the Prime Minister of Japan from 2001 to 2006

694
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,240
Too exaggerated Koizumi Junichiro? Okay.

695
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,080
Hello

696
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,720
I'm Koizumi Junichiro

697
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,060
Junior is out

698
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,940
-That was close!
-That was really close!

699
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,170
You saw that many times

700
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,110
That was close!

701
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,210
-You asked for it
-So it's me?

702
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:02,650
First thing first, this applies to everyone

703
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,690
You're drinking too much water

704
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:11,190
You've been drinking it so many times
just to muddle through

705
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,200
Of course it's fine if you're really thirsty

706
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,770
but don't keep it here

707
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:21,700
And up to now, one person is out

708
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:28,480
-Junior
-That scared me! I thought it's me

709
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,800
You're basically laughing all the way

710
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,440
Then starting to drink water and trying to muddle through

711
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,240
I can't deal with Zakoshi

712
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,980
Yeah Zakoshi is hilarious

713
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,850
I was close with that one too, well done for holding on

714
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,880
That was amazing

715
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,320
Takahashi was close too

716
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,450
Takahashi and Junior are always at the limit

717
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,360
I need to be aware of Zakoshi

718
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:22,430
Junior will be given a yellow card
to serve as a warning to the others

719
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,430
That's all!

720
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,870
It's fine to laugh now right

721
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:26,740
That was quick!

722
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,640
Yeah that was really quick

723
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,480
Junior-san you are the one
who asked him to perform though

724
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,480
Well, I'm just asking this in rotation
