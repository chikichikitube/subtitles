00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,850
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,020
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,730
Who is it?

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,600
It's FUJIWARA!

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,270
Stay tuned for our content!
-What?

6
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,030
Stay tuned for our content!
-Didn't you hear?

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,410
What?
-Who's the old man?

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,780
It's your fault, right? It's your problem

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,010
I want you to be louder

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,750
Getting old
-Yes

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,960
Today, we bring you a new work in the program's usual "Someone" series

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,320
That's great to hear

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,560
Hamada loves this one
-Really loves it

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,230
He likes to watch it while eating donburi

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,370
Some new elements have been added to the "Someone" project this time

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,710
The theory we bring is this:

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:12,190
While panicking that there is someone in the house, if another person suddenly appears and asks "is everything okay", you cant help but ask for help from the latter

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,860
As before this will take place in the home of the target

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:22,360
What happens when a person seemingly comes to your rescue when you are in shock

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,640
But they're also in their home, right?
-Yeah

21
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,600
Seems like a criminal act

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,940
You'd panic, right?
-Yes

23
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,640
Think carefully how horrible this would be, being faced with two people

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,690
It's scary to think about

25
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,280
It's tough to imagine
-I can't think how bad it'd be

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,160
Regardless of how many people there are, you'd attack, right?

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,890
Who?
-To whom?

28
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,620
In short, in the midst of the shock they'll first think to protect themselves by getting something

29
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,780
Then they'll be cornered if someone else appears

30
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,390
That's too much
- You'd be scared!

31
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,460
You'd probably just stand there frozen

32
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,360
It's too scary to think about

33
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,920
So, the first target is...

34
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,900
Tom Brown's Michio

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,880
This time the ambush in his room is this suspicious old man

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,050
Too scary

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:37,560
When they are frightened, another suspicious person will come in through the front door

38
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,050
Just the right amount of terror

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,810
Will Michio ask him for help?

40
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,720
So scary

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,290
What what what?

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,380
Horrible

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,560
What what what?

44
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,160
When scared to the point of having weak legs

45
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,600
Are you okay?

46
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,540
What's wrong?

47
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,190
That's definitely how it'd be

48
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,640
Is are okay?

49
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,410
Eh? Who?

50
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,540
I heard voices

51
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,280
There's a weird person standing there

52
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,320
Aren't you also?

53
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,880
A stranger?
-Yes

54
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,750
Scary

55
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,980
Who is this person?

56
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:31,560
First, Michio confides in a stranger that there is a stranger in the house

57
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,360
So, do you live next door?

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,700
I heard voices so I came to see what's going on

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,520
This would also be scary

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Just happened to be close?
-Yes

61
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,710
Sorry, thanks.
-It's okay

62
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:54,940
Just like the theory, Michio opened his heart while forgetting the unauthorized entry

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,930
I'd just be even more scared

64
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,300
And

65
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,570
He grabs a frying pan just in case

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,950
Got a weapon

67
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,360
Hello

68
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,500
Can... can you come out?

69
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,100
What... what's wrong? What happened?

70
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,270
What's the matter?

71
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,150
There really is someone there, and with a pained expression too

72
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,140
What's with this comment?

73
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,810
Very good

74
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,020
Are you lost?

75
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,300
Nice guy

76
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,820
You should say something!

77
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,430
Let's calm down first

78
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,450
You too!

79
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,730
Are you on my side?

80
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,430
Are you going to help me?

81
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,860
Yes, of course

82
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,700
Thank you

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,000
So

84
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,000
What to do?

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,170
First... get out first

86
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:02,950
Get out first, I'll call the police, okay?

87
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,150
Doing the right thing

88
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,320
Not talking

89
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,220
Can I touch you?

90
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,680
"Can I touch you?"

91
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,000
Very daring to go in

92
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,390
Excuse me

93
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,830
Is it okay?

94
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,460
So gentle

95
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,060
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

96
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,440
So gentle

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,300
Okay, let's go

98
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,700
Can you help me?
-Yes, of course

99
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,000
Helping him

100
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,970
Sorry

101
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,780
Ah, I have Coke

102
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,680
Uncle, uncle, have some coke

103
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,690
A nice guy
-Coke?

104
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,580
Coke

105
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,920
Why are you giving him a Coke?

106
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,490
Tea would be better

107
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,520
Let's go to the station first

108
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,330
After they exit the house we reveal the truth

109
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,700
Me? Me? Me? Me?

110
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,780
Who else could it be?

111
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,100
Thank you for your hard work

112
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,310
Is it me? Oh, thank god

113
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,080
It's me
-Yes

114
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,140
It's about me, isn't it?
-Yes

115
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,180
Great!

116
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,980
So, we told him what the theory was

117
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,720
But

118
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,660
He said we'd go to the station together, and I did ask him for help

119
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,460
Although suspicious, he seemed like a nice guy

120
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:33,740
Honestly, I thought he was reliable, so I felt okay about it

121
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,940
And, to be honest, I have confidence in my own strength

122
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,530
If he had attacked me from behind, I could have taken him out

123
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,450
So i'm relieved he didn't do anything

124
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,220
The next target is

125
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,860
Very human

126
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,590
Shinichi

127
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,600
Here we go, trash

128
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,600
This time people the ambush occurs in the toilet by the entrance

129
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,690
Super scary!

130
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,050
This candidate is an interesting choice

131
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,930
So, soon

132
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,180
Whoa, wait a minute! I'm scared!

133
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,970
A scary expression

134
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,980
Whoa, wait a minute! I'm scared!

135
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,820
Whoa, wait a minute! I'm scared!

136
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,250
What!? Scared the hell out of me. Who?

137
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,280
Right at that moment

138
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,160
This is bad!

139
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,790
Are you okay?

140
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,990
Scary!

141
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,990
Are you okay?

142
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,130
Wait! Who are you? Don't just let yourself in!

143
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,800
I heard you shout
-Who are you?

144
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,600
Scared the hell out of me, who're you!?

145
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,070
Don't just come in!

146
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,270
What's going on?

147
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,370
Someone's here!

148
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,640
His brain has shut down due to fear

149
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,110
He's super on edge

150
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,480
This is horrible.
-Is someone here?

151
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,750
Yes, through that door right there

152
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,880
Ah, scared the hell out of me!

153
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,950
Don't know each other?
-No, I don't

154
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,030
What's he mad about?

155
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,490
Don't come over here, i'm so scared

156
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,630
I'm scared to death, who the hell are you?

157
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,400
He's afraid of the person

158
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,100
I'm shivering, my whole body is shaking

159
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,270
It's disgusting. It's scary. So are you!

160
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:16,600
Not only did they not ask for help, they treated the second person as also suspicious

161
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,340
And

162
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,680
I can't even walk a step, I'm really scared to death

163
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,990
Seriously, you stay away from me. Who the hell are you to enter my house?

164
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,900
Bluetooth has entered pairing mode

165
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,320
Seriously!

166
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,030
Pairing mode now

167
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,500
Disgusting!

168
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,430
So, we went over to reveal the truth

169
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,710
A terrible face

170
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,740
Again!?

171
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,710
Wednesday, right?
-Yes

172
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,380
Ugh, I was really, really scared

173
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,690
I was shivering, really disgusting

174
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,190
What about the second one? The guy who came in after?

175
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:11,530
"If someone else comes, you can't help but ask them for help"

176
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,100
Ask for help from him? He's scary too

177
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,870
2 strangers in the house at once, 2 is extra scary

178
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,450
It's scary.
-Yeah

179
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,210
Randomly coming in and encountering people is awful

180
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
I thought I was going to get my ass kicked

181
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,180
So, the next target is

182
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,950
Daishizen's Roger

183
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,390
This time the person is lying in bed

184
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,040
However

185
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:50,030
He put the chain lock on, so we couldn't get in using the key

186
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,640
So, it became a simple prank for an extra cautious person

187
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,820
Roger is as cool and calm as usual

188
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
But he's a strange guy

189
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,060
Getting ready

190
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,200
It's starting

191
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,900
So

192
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,880
Hey? Sorry

193
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:30,880
Hey

194
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,340
Hey

195
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,080
Uncle

196
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,350
Hey

197
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,700
What's this for?

198
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,820
Hey

199
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,960
Talking like an American cop, he receives no response

200
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,010
So cool

201
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,870
But he is shaken

202
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,130
Closing the door first

203
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,520
Got an egg pan

204
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,550
What?

205
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
So, he re-enters

206
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,380
Uncle

207
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,820
Uncle, get out

208
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,050
What's this?

209
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,720
Uncle, you understand, right?

210
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,610
What?

211
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,090
Uncle

212
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,730
Wait, stop, stop

213
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,390
Hey, stop

214
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,690
What's going on?

215
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,860
Go slowly, stop!

216
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,080
He's not even a foreigner.
-Roger is scary

217
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:39,580
Keeping his distance, he drives the suspicious person out

218
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,400
Sweating

219
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,170
Here, we revealed the truth

220
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,330
It was supposed to be like this, but the other person couldn't come in

221
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,360
What's going on?

222
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,530
Yes
-Ok ok ok

223
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,270
It's messed up...

224
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,600
So, the next target is

225
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,580
Bike Kawasaki Bike

226
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,210
The person is hidden in the toilet

227
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,260
And this time the second person doesn't enter through the front door

228
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,670
But actually the balcony

229
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,660
A significant change to further test the theory

230
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,820
So, 40 minutes after returning home

231
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,600
He finally goes into the toilet

232
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:45,890
Closed the door

233
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,550
Are you okay?

234
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,590
Are you okay?

235
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,260
Are you okay?

236
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,990
What?

237
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,930
What happened, I heard you scream so loud

238
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,030
Someone...

239
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,300
Someone?
-Yes

240
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
No, no, no...

241
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,240
You... who are you?

242
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,710
Calm down. What's going on?
-Who are you?

243
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,240
Who are you?

244
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,940
What's happening?
-Who are you?

245
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:27,390
As unexpected visitors appear BKB temporarily seeks refuge in the washroom

246
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,990
Wait, seriously, I'm calling the police

247
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,360
Calm down

248
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,090
No, there's someone in the bathroom...

249
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,600
Is there anyone in the bathroom?

250
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,470
He's not a family member?

251
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,770
Who are you?
-It's okay

252
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,670
I heard a voice. That's the guy, right?

253
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,480
Don't, oh my god, what is going on?

254
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,920
Who who who... you two... who are you both?

255
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,950
It will definitely happen

256
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,990
Where did you... where did you come in?

257
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,720
Yeah, where did you come in?

258
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,260
No, no, i'm asking you

259
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,920
Seriously, where'd you come in?

260
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,190
Who... who... are you

261
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,360
I am on the 3rd floor

262
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,430
How can you come in on the 3rd floor?

263
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,530
You too

264
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,600
Scary as hell

265
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,770
A drama

266
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,900
You're the one who's scaring me!

267
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,400
Don't reply in such a smooth way!

268
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,440
It's a three-way skit

269
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:29,010
He starts retorting to the suspicious people who didn't see themselves as a problem

270
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,780
We reveal the truth

271
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,390
Wh... wh... wh... what

272
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,830
"Forget to doubt and ask for help"

273
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,800
Won't ask for help, not at all

274
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,870
Won't ask for help

275
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,170
But I'm relieved to be able to communicate

276
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,380
Looks like a nice guy on the outside too

277
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,550
But it scared me to death. Suddenly, there was someone in the toilet

278
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,010
And then suddenly appeared a BOY

279
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,010
BKBKBKB

280
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,630
Doing it with glasses on is a little weird

281
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,630
So, the next target is

282
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,300
I'm exhausted

283
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,800
Cotton Kyon

284
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,390
The last target is Cotton Kyon

285
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,050
A person is hidden in this position in the living room

286
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,880
This time the second person will also appear from the balcony

287
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,440
What is the result?

288
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,760
Running towards the balcony

289
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,890
Runing to the entrance is better

290
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,150
Are you okay?

291
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,120
This is bad, this is bad
-Are you okay?

292
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,260
What is it?
-This is bad

293
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:22,760
Who are you?

294
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,000
I heard a sound and came to see what's going on

295
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,330
You wait

296
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,470
Wait a minute

297
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,140
What's happening?

298
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,440
"What's happening?"

299
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,370
Who are you?

300
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,240
I heard a lot of screaming. Is everything okay?

301
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,880
First of all, I thank you.
-It's okay, it's okay

302
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,450
I thought something terrible had happened

303
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,440
Where did you come in?

304
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,720
Thank you

305
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:52,060
First of all, he thanks the man who suddenly broke in from the balcony

306
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,520
Afterwards

307
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,000
Who are you?

308
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,400
No reply?

309
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,830
Don't know each other?

310
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,000
Don't know him

311
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,500
How old are you?

312
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Definitely elderly

313
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,940
No shit

314
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,580
It's scary.
-Scary...

315
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:19,840
Ignoring the balcony man, his focus is completely on the green screen old man

316
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,370
And

317
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,990
What to do?

318
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,020
So, what... take him out

319
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,390
Okay, let's go

320
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,910
What? What is this scene?

321
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,400
That... that...

322
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,700
Do you know each other?

323
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,500
Not at all

324
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,070
What exactly are you...

325
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,010
A memorable line

326
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,280
That's a good line

327
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:55,990
The intruders who broke into the house in the form of "Worthless Nobodies" has left

328
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,100
It's like a live performance

329
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,990
Thank you for your hard work

330
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,470
This is too deadly

331
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,940
What a way to get things done!

332
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,110
Do you know what the theory is?
-What theory?

333
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,510
The old man was standing there, super scary

334
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,120
There's another guy, right?
-Yeah

335
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,720
What do you think of that guy?

336
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,120
Saviour

337
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,420
We explained the content of the theory for Kyon

338
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,370
"Can't help but ask for help"

339
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,100
Bingo

340
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,670
He became a superhero in my eyes

341
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:50,910
In summary
The man who breaks into the balcony on the 2nd floor will also be seen as a superhero

342
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,920
Ok

343
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,890
What do you think of this theory?

344
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,880
Interesting

345
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,080
Everyone reacts differently

346
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,260
What would happen if Superman appeared?

347
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,490
Wearing a Superman suit?

348
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,270
Completely dressed as Superman?
-Yes, yes, yes

349
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,160
Asking "Is everything okay?"
-S written on the chest

350
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,900
You'll laugh, right?

351
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,070
The atmosphere will be eased, right?

352
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,140
How scary, Superman suddenly comes in from the balcony

353
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,610
The first thought would be "He's wearing a Superman suit!"

354
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,320
The first reaction would be "Superman's here"

355
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,890
Let's welcome the next presenter

356
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:42,220
It's Onigoe Tomahawk

357
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,000
Isn't this the newlywed Onigoe?

358
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,710
You don't have to do that
-Both married now

359
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,870
We got licensed on the same day

360
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,970
Hmm? The same time?

361
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,180
The same day and same hairstyle

362
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,800
Hair style is different
-It's the same as before

363
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,800
※She shaved her head in 2013

364
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,980
She didn't even shave it that short then

365
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,650
Wasn't that bald then

366
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,220
Anyway

367
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,850
So without further delay this time we have brought

368
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,490
The program's favorite "King of Appetite"-related project

369
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,530
Programmer's favorite?
-The show's favorite

370
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,630
Please take a look

371
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,020
Blitz! Neighborhood Refrigerator

372
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,610
What do you mean?
-The content of this project is

373
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,440
Its the same as the original "Blitz! Dinner in the Neighborhood"

374
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,440
With no appointment, we suddenly raid ordinary homes

375
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,650
But it's not to eat people's dinners

376
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,750
Instead, they have to eat everything in people's refrigerators

377
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,380
Eh?
-Finish everything

378
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,380
What a messy project!

379
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,520
I guess it's okay.
-Somewhat harsh, right?

380
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,890
What's in everyone's fridge?

381
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,830
I wonder what's in Downtown's refrigerator

382
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,830
I want to know
-Why?

383
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,070
Just ordinary

384
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,070
Probably a lot of takoyaki or something in the refrigerator

385
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,720
Osaka people eat takoyaki!

386
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,580
They'll never eat it frozen!

387
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,360
Absolutely not?
-Absolutely not

388
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Frozen is also very good
-No, no, no

389
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,310
It has to be done in the machine

390
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,260
I feel like you have all kinds of takoyaki in your house.
-Don't be stupid!

391
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,730
You're underestimating Kansai people, aren't you?

392
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,570
Blitz! Neighborhood Refrigerator

393
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,870
Refrigerator?
-Yes

394
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,370
Not "dinner"?
-Indeed

395
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,840
This time the challenge was carried out by these three groups

396
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,480
They'll raid ordinary homes without prior appointments

397
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,470
And then eat all the things in the refrigerator

398
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,040
First, multi-family housing

399
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,720
Then a single-family home

400
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,430
Finally, you'll ask passersby

401
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,220
Wait a minute... in that order?

402
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,350
3 families?
-Going to 3 families?

403
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,890
3 refrigerators?

404
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,720
Eaten in one day?

405
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,500
Eat through 3 refrigerators in one day

406
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,070
The first team to finish eating wins

407
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,500
What is this? This is...

408
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,730
We are the team that is good at cooking

409
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:07,400
Is it an advantage to like cooking?

410
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,410
I'm actually not that much of a big eater

411
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,080
What should we do now?

412
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,580
We're at a disadvantage already
-That's true

413
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,210
Can it all be finished?

414
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,470
First is going to multi-family housing

415
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:20,720
Each team will visit a street with many residents

416
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,490
The first place the big appetite comedians came to was

417
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,390
A street with many college students: Takadanobaba

418
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,100
There is a place called "Maa-chan" there...

419
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,860
Hey, where's "Maa-chan"?

420
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,600
Canteen "Maa-chan"
-It's really "Maa-chan"

421
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,770
Maa-chan, sorry

422
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,970
There are apartments

423
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:42,690
Like a house built with Lego

424
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,780
An apartment with a rich color scheme

425
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,780
Go ask around

426
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,140
It is not too late to make a surprise attack

427
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,320
Hello, we've never met before

428
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,060
Sorry, we're a funny group of comedians called Onigoe Tomahawk

429
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,820
Can we talk to you now...
-Is that okay?

430
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,430
Sorry its not convenient

431
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,890
No good?

432
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,300
Sorry to bother you then

433
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,480
So, they fail at the first hurdle

434
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,140
On the other hand, the team of the professional eaters are looking for people in Shimokitazawa

435
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,910
Hello

436
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,640
I am Angela Sato

437
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,150
Sorry to interrupt, I'm Giant Shirata

438
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,880
The most scary...

439
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,590
Sorry, we are looking to shoot at someone's home

440
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,170
And eat all the things in the refrigerator of someone's home

441
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,990
I'm going to work now

442
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,260
Ah really

443
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,060
Simply put, those of us who

444
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,040
Suddenly ring the doorbell to go to someone else's house

445
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,170
Also with a large rice spoon, is very scary, right?

446
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,260
Standing in the right place.
-Yes?

447
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,140
Not at home?

448
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,280
Because it's a workday

449
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,920
There is no one in the house

450
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,730
Most of the teams can't even get into people's homes

451
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,390
Sorry for the surprise visit

452
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,630
We're shooting to eat the contents of someone's fridge

453
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:13,410
It's okay... but there's just nothing in the fridge

454
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,570
Oh okay

455
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,070
No problem at all.
-It's totally fine

456
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,370
There's nothing to eat in the fridge.
-That's perfectly fine. Is it OK to come in?

457
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,840
OK.
-That's very helpful. Thank you

458
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,200
Lucky

459
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,740
So happy!

460
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,460
The first step for the big professional eater's team

461
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,020
Successfully obtained permission

462
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,900
Asking is difficult

463
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,090
Wow, this is great!

464
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,290
A very fashionable place

465
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,490
Are you a college student?

466
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,490
Yes I am

467
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,490
By the way, may I ask what your name is?

468
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,090
Tomii

469
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,330
By the way, which university are you from?

470
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,100
Tokyo University

471
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,330
Really?

472
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,900
It's not that great.
-So impressive

473
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,330
I'm nothing impressive

474
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,260
What is in the refrigerator of a Tokyo University student?

475
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,450
It must be small

476
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,770
What's in there?

477
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,850
That's about it, right?

478
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,990
This is a great fridge

479
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,290
Let's look below too

480
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,050
There should be a lot of frozen stuff, right?

481
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,490
Quite a lot of things, what is that big one?

482
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:18,790
This is pork

483
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,660
This is chicken, right?
-Yes

484
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,840
Pork and chicken

485
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:28,340
Eel
corn
frozen rice×2
pork
chicken
radish stew
ice cubes

m 0 0 l 210 0 210 380 0 380

489
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,520
Because it is a college student living alone

490
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,910
Gotta eat all of that?
-All of it

491
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,080
Not many ingredients either

492
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,710
In addition, aside from alcohol

493
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,950
Liquid condiments such as soy sauce

494
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,330
Are also counted

495
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,950
It'll be a breeze, right?

496
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,690
Come on

497
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,170
Shirata, who is also the owner of a kebab store

498
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,430
Starts cooking

499
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:54,360
On the other hand, in Nakano's comedian team

500
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,200
We're doing a location shoot about people's refrigerators

501
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,570
I'm actually in the comedy world
-Eh?

502
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,540
Wait, what do you mean by that?

503
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,440
I am a professional

504
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,880
Ah, rakugo

505
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,880
Can you wait for 30 minutes?

506
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,850
No problem at all.
-Is it okay?

507
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,550
Thank you so much!

508
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,440
Coincidentally, they found the home of a peer

509
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,720
A successful negotiation

510
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,620
And later they meet the family

511
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,870
Musashi

512
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,040
Living together with his new wife

513
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,890
What will their refrigerator be like?

514
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,200
Suddenly appeared

515
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,210
Wow, what a big fridge!

516
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,780
After all, its for a couple

517
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,980
Then we'll just open it without further ado
-Please

518
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,080
Excuse me

519
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,640
Refrigerator open!

520
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,650
That's a lot of stuff

521
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,350
That's a lot

522
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,920
That's a lot

523
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,990
As expected

524
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,960
Check this out too

525
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,960
Loaded with stuff

526
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,100
And

527
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,200
The freezer

528
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,770
Wait a minute.
-Isn't it too much?

529
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,370
There's even eel

530
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,640
Having us eat it is just a waste

531
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,080
Three eels in total

532
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,810
There are three eels

533
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,310
And more!

534
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,480
There are six eels.
-Do you like eels?

535
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,990
It was given to us by my disciple's parents

536
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,720
I see

537
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
It's from your disciple's parents

538
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,710

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:33,660
m 0 0 l 170 0 170 530 0 530

546
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:33,660
m 0 0 l 170 0 170 530 0 530

547
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,820
Although it is a refrigerator for two people

548
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,840
The ingredients inside are of a very high quality

549
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,660
That's a lot.
-A lot of meat!

550
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,700
How much mayonnaise is left?

551
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,040
Ah this is full

552
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,640
We've gotta eat it all...

553
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,540
No way, right?

554
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,910
Let's make a kimchi mayonnaise stir-fry with pork since we have kimchi

555
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,380
Add some bean sprouts to soften the taste

556
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,950
The three people who are confident in cooking

557
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:58,730
Prepare to combine unpalatable food into a delicious meal all together

558
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,560
Okay, sorry

559
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,220
The 32nd house

560
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,760
Got scolded...

561
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,900
What did they say?

562
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,070
They said "What are you doing?" And then I explained the content of the project

563
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,900
They replied "Get out!"

564
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,500
So scary
-That was scary

565
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,440
That...

566
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,170
"What?"

567
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,470
The speed from conversation to quarrel was so quick

568
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,910
"Get out!"

569
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,230
12:00 noon

570
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,410
Waited for a long time

571
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,250
Shirata's first course is

572
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,760
Vegetables and cheese with chopped meat

573
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,580
Stir-fried with tomato sauce and takoyaki sauce

574
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,930
Doesn't look too good

575
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,690
Here I go

576
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,760
Shirata, this is delicious

577
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,600
Is it good?
-The takoyaki sauce goes well with this dish

578
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,440
Round carrots, not cut into sharp pieces

579
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,120
Takoyaki sauce does not have a strong presence, right?
-Can't really tell its there

580
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,120
On the other side, Shirosaki is in charge of the cooking team

581
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,750
Here we go. This is a burger with meatballs

582
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,490
Eh?

583
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,190
Meat plus meat

584
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,360
A large quantity

585
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,620
This is roasted aubergine

586
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,790
Wow, it's great to have roasted aubergine

587
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,100
With grapefruit vinegar

588
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,210
They'll be out in the first place, surely

589
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,400
This is braised eel

590
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,500
Eh?

591
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,730
How many bags of eel is this?

592
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,070
Used three eels. Three left

593
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,710
Three more? Eels?

594
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,810
Guimisuke is amazing
-Too strong

595
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,810
※The presenter of the original show

596
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,330
The 57th family

597
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,210
Doing this kind of shoot all the time

598
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,450
I can't do it anymore, my knees are at their limit...

599
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,390
This won't work

600
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,390
This is not the climbing exercise that 180kg people can do

601
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,700
What is Sakai doing? I don't understand

602
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,450
Weak knees

603
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,390
Wow!

604
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,090
So fierce

605
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,820
With pork, sausage, and tuna.
-Used sausage and tuna

606
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,350
And two bags of bean sprouts

607
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,820
Although it looks fine it seems tough to eat so much

608
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,610
And cabbage, enoki mushrooms

609
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,830
And garlic

610
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,940
Let's finish this dish with ramen

611
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,910
How many bags of ramen?
-One bag

612
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,010
What is this system?

613
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,910
I really want to find a nice family

614
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,820
We're doing a project to eat everything in other people's refrigerators
-Eat?

615
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,390
Yes

616
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,120
If it is convenient

617
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,960
Can we come to your home to shoot?

618
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,060
Yes, you can. There's not much in the fridge.
-It's totally fine

619
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,230
So you agree?

620
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,300
OK, they agreed!

621
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,700
Thank you so much!

622
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,480
It took two hours to start shooting

623
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,660
Must be hungry.
-Super hungry

624
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,780
The team of big appetite comedians finally get permission

625
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,770
And were hosted by

626
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,460
Living alone?

627
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,160
Suzuki, a programmer on vacation today

628
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,890
Isn't this refrigerator a little big for one person?
-It's not bad, right?

629
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,020
I'm opening it!

630
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,360
Please

631
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,860
Please, please, please, please

632
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,660
Opening!

633
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,900
Now we've hit the jackpot.
-Great

634
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,330
Can this green onion be eaten?
-The color of this onion...

635
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,030
Onion hell

636
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,700
It's folded in half

637
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,270
Opening!

638
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,680
Do single people eat so much?

639
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,040
With mixed seafood

640
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,610
And beans

641
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:13,880
Wait a minute. Eh? Eh?

642
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,990
A salmon sent by someone else?

643
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,120
Wait a minute

644
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,220
This is heavy

645
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,960
This looks so disgusting ... awful

646
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,070
Do you have to eat it all?
-Stop it!

647
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,200
Don't say disgusting

648
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:37,070
Chicken breast
pork
beef
minced meat
mixed seafood
salmon pieces×11
frozen broccoli

Frozen lentils

m 0 0 l 190 0 190 270 0 270

656
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,750
Although not much at first glance

657
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:36,540
But the freezer is full of salmon chunks and chicken

658
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,010
Let's get started quickly

659
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,810
Get cooking

660
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,310
Every second counts. Can you do it?

661
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,320
I'll do the cooking

662
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,220
Just Himan cooks

663
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,660
And mostly with frozen ingredients

664
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,100
Then

665
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,460
It's kind of...

666
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,720
What is this, dried sour plums?

667
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,500
It's a bit much

668
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,560
Onigoe eat the ingredients that do not need to be made into dishes directly

669
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,720
Just when the big appetite comedian team had only started eating

670
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,480
The professional eaters move toward finishing the first stage

671
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,990
Shirata's not eating anything

672
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,620
The first fridge is done

673
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,520
Yes!

674
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,100
Successfully completed the first stop of multi-family housing

675
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,530
Eating isn't really the issue

676
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,500
It's hard to find people who will let us into our homes

677
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,240
Tomii is a nice kid

678
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,310
Why're you smoking an e-cig?

679
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,780
You're still being filmed!

680
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,450
He had such vitality

681
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,450
He's smoking despite not having eaten anything

682
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:57,790
On the other side is the team of cooking comedians who drew the most abundant ingredients

683
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,690
We can't finish without drinking all the yogurt, right?

684
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,690
Eating and eating and eating

685
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,360
Still no end in sight

686
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,360
But

687
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,770
This is eel fried rice.
-Thanks

688
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,840
It looks pretty tasty but...

689
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,370
Delicious

690
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,140
It tastes great!
-I can keep stuffing myself

691
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,390
No problem? That's good

692
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,880
Although all are full, thanks to the high level of cooking

693
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,380
They can still continue to eat

694
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,290
Done

695
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,820
This is a stir-fry.
-Wow, it's done

696
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,760
Otsuru stir fry?

697
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,690
You can also say Fatty stir-fry

698
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,200
Yummy
-Yummy

699
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,340
You come and eat too.
-I'll eat right away

700
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,540
Is this with spinach?
-No, it's broccoli

701
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,040
Didn't get any broccoli?

702
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,580
That's it!

703
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,240
The next dish is prepared with spinach and seafood stir-fried with margarine

704
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,920
And salmon.
-Then make salmon and pork

705
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,750
Then cook it with some miso

706
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,540
Now at 3pm

707
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,510
The progress of each team is shown in the chart

708
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:13,130
Salt is according to personal preference, add it yourself

709
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:13,930
Looks delicious

710
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,170
This dish is salmon with seafood

711
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,900
Let's eat this much first

712
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,240
The next course is directly out of the pot

713
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,740
The smell is so strong

714
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,080
The taste of margarine is really...

715
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,410
Also

716
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,450
It's been a long time.
-Looks good too

717
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:37,250
It's a stew smorgasbord
-Looks good

718
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,620
They stewed all the remaining ingredients in one pot

719
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,350
This chowder one pot stew is their last dish

720
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,230
Yummy
-Delicious

721
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,570
Super delicious

722
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:59,840
On this side, they spent 3 hours eating

723
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,620
What is this...

724
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,750
Can't eat anymore

725
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,510
Probably don't actually eat much in the first place

726
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,160
This is what despair looks like, right?
-It's true

727
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,060
Is this what it feels like to be in despair...

728
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,560
The chopsticks are now stationary

729
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,820
As a halftime break occurs

730
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,830
Yeah, it's still hot

731
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,030
This is the last of the dried plums. I'm on it

732
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,400
Last one

733
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,800
So sour

734
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,410
Now all the dried plums are gone

735
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,950
Next

736
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,180
Finished eating
-Finished

737
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,350
Yes!

738
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,750
Finished eating

739
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:43,790
The big eater comedian teams completes this stage after 2 hours and 30 minutes

740
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,260
The first refrigerator has been fully raided

741
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,390
By this time, the professional eaters are seeking a refrigerator of the single-family house

742
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,100
I guess it's hard to find a single-family house

743
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,330
Let me change my clothes first

744
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:58,270
So we can shoot at your home, right?
-Yes, you can

745
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,600
Thank you, that's great

746
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,990
Success on the 4th house

747
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,990
Uehara, a family of four, agreed

748
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,350
Isn't it great?
-This is so stylish

749
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,050
So fashionable

750
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,280
Really great!

751
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,610
What is a refrigerator of fashionable people like?

752
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,390
Let's take a look together

753
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,230
Look!

754
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,870
Less food than expected
-Isn't it?

755
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,260
But

756
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,740
Down below?

757
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,480
What happens now?

758
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,370
What should we do now that this has happened?

759
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,840
Unexpectedly, there's 2kg of rice in the refrigerator

760
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,220
2.5kg, right?

761
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,310
Also

762
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,090
It's a two-parter, right?

763
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:53,490
It's really...

764
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,990
This is... what?

765
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,760
Looks like a whole chicken

766
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,460
That's for Christmas

767
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,730
Ready this early?

768
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,000
It was last Christmas...

769
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,910
Roasted chicken

770
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,540
But it's still edible
-Can still eat it?

771
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:15,040
They take all the ingredients out of the fridge

772
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,140
Shirata continues cooking

773
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,200
Shirata should also eat some

774
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,860
This one really does not eat

775
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,520
The big eater comedian team has entered its single-family home stage

776
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,730
Really?
-Really?

777
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,030
We need to pick up the energy

778
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:32,940
We need to show off our skills
-True

779
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,110
But

780
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,230
Absolutely unsuccessful negotiation, right?

781
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,130
I'm sorry.
-We can't?

782
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,100
Sorry, thank you

783
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,500
Who told you to look so scary!?

784
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,900
The dog's not happy

785
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,110
We're doing a shoot called "Blitz! Neighbor's Refrigerator"

786
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,830
Sorry

787
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,600
Okay, okay, it's okay

788
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,750
Negotiation is still an issue

789
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,080
How about changing our target range to older couples?

790
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,450
Even if it's a show, you shouldn't say "let's target old couples"

791
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,720
They just seem like criminals

792
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,460
It sounds a bit bad

793
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,290
The suggestion is that the elderly eat less

794
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,990
What if a passerby hears you?

795
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,800
Hello

796
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,840
Are you a fan?
-Yes

797
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,970
Really? Thank you for your support

798
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,110
I listen to you on GERA

799
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,210
A hardcore comedy fan!

800
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,510
You listen to GERA radio?

801
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,410
Always listening

802
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,180
This lady, although we can't say much

803
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,810
Can we come to your house?
-No, no, no

804
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,180
No?

805
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:32,500
The cooking comedians are still in a state of desperation

806
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,630
It's been 6 hours already

807
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,000
Just gotta eat this part

808
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,870
Then we can escape from here finally

809
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,200
You said "escape"!
-You're being too honest

810
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,500
It's been 6 hours

811
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,840
What is it like to spend 6 hours in a stranger's house?

812
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,910
Washing it all down

813
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,850
Yeah, I'm done

814
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,620
So, the first house is complete

815
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,190
At this moment it is already 6:30 p.m

816
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:12,030
So, let's get started

817
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,690
This is all ingredients in the fridge

818
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:19,970
With about 2.88kg of rice

819
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,710
The all-carb dinner is complete

820
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,540
The professional eaters goes for it

821
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,250
Such a small damn bite!

822
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,080
What are you doing!?

823
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,920
Also, the big eater comedians

824
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,760
It' ok, right?
-Seems fun

825
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,650
The 26th family finally accepts

826
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,060
Her daughter was a big help
-Really helped a lot

827
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Wait a minute.
-It's huge!

828
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,770
What a stylish home!

829
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,670
It's a far cry from Suzuki's house.
-Stop it!

830
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,200
So, they begin shooting here

831
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,130
What will be inside the refrigerator?

832
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,650
Isn't this too little for a whole family?

833
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,260
Although there are natto and kimchi

834
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,160
What's below is the important part

835
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,290
The rest is some water... and wine

836
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,430
Is this another part?

837
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,000
There aren't many vegetables here either

838
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,170
Peaches and other fruits

839
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,460
Thank you, Madam

840
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,600
There are peaches
-I want to eat peaches

841
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,140
Now I want to eat peaches

842
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,710
So now the biggest problem is the freezer

843
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,350
Open!

844
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,330
Not good, the inside of our freezer...

845
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait

846
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,590
Wait, wait, wait.
-Excuse me

847
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,330
Korean pancake, octopus teriyaki, dumplings

848
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,500
On the other side, the team of cooking comedians also successfully negotiated with the single family

849
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,450
These guys can't eat anymore, right?

850
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,100
So fashionable!

851
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,200
Even got a hammock

852
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,000
Even a hammock

853
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,330
This is the home of successful people

854
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,370
Then, I'll open it.
-Please

855
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,410
This part is crucial

856
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,170
This is so critical, please!

857
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,610
Please

858
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,350
There's quite a lot

859
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,710
Here too

860
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,520
A lot of ingredients

861
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,960
The key is the bottom

862
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,820
Filled up!

863
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,010
We can make so many dishes

864
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,020
Below is also...

865
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,360
Wow, no way!

866
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,030
Pizza... even pizza

867
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,870
Isn't pizza a bit much?

868
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,960
Now all three teams are at the same stage again

869
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,070
By now it was 9:00 p.m

870
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,560
Thank you

871
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,830
It looks so delicious!
-It's delicious

872
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,060
Ah, incredible

873
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,330
So... incredible....

874
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,400
Nishimura, I'm done

875
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,200
It's a pizza

876
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,680
The difficulty factor of this dish is so high
-This is great

877
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,680
The cheese is shredded

878
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,860
Incredible...

879
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,930
Don't forget the content of this project

880
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,030
You sound so cool

881
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,100
While two teams are desperately trying to eat everything

882
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,370
The professional eaters have finished
-EH!?

883
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,410
Really?

884
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,550
They're so fast
-So fast!

885
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,330
Yes, actually

886
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:55,880
The professional eater team finished within two hours

887
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,360
Finished!

888
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,000
The duo managed to consume everything

889
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,090
Then, asking passersby

890
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,930
Yes, you can.
-Thank you

891
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,720
They complete a smooth negotiation

892
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,100
Awesome

893
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,770
Awesome awesome

894
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,410
Your place is great!

895
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,410
What a lovely home.
-What's this?

896
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,310
Is this your occupation?

897
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,950
I just do this in my spare time

898
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,480
This is incredible, right?

899
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,280
All of these
-Are made by hand?

900
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,250
It's awesome. It's like being in a boutique

901
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,740
This DIY-loving owner

902
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,090
What's in his fridge?

903
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,100
Good luck!

904
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,400
Super good!

905
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,470
Due to being single, he doesn't have much

906
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
What is this?

907
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,160
Pickled cucumber

908
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:50,480
Even has this kind of stuff

909
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,840
Don't wanna eat this kind of stuff

910
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,980
Bitter gourd what?
-Bitter gourd stew

911
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,850
Did you make it yourself too?
-Yes

912
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,180
I don't wanna eat this stuff

913
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,180
This is ginger slices

914
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,520
Also pickled
-Wow

915
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,270
Why're you pickling stuff yourself?

916
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:06,690
This is rakkyo, which I also pickled myself
-Whoa

917
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,730
The refrigerator is also stuffed with the owner's DIY products

918
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,330
Then

919
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,700
Great!

920
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,550
No need to cook much

921
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,510
The third stage is finished!

922
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,190
It only took 40 minutes to finish it

923
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,660
Yes! Thank you!

924
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,420
Yeah! We won! Yeah!

925
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,990
That team is just too strong, right?

926
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,590
I shouldn't have bothered to eat so much

927
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:51,000
In summary
The professional eater team won!

928
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,770
As expected

929
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:57,110
The first step to find someone is very difficult
-Yes

930
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:01,570
Nothing's been booked so its really tough to find

931
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,570
Our program team also gave these people a thank-you gift, right?
-Yes

932
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,620
Of course, we converted the price according to the contents of the refrigerator

933
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,280
Converted to the corresponding amount for people

934
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,190
If we didn't reimburse them then that's just too...

935
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,290
Just theft

936
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,090
Straight up theft

937
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,260
Everyone who was willing to cooperate was very nice, right?

938
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,600
All super nice people

939
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,060
But when you are eating the people are just watching the whole time?
-Yes

940
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,470
Constantly watching you

941
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,010
One thing, though, although it might not be appropriate to say

942
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,510
As they were all very nice people who let us eat their food

943
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,510
Broad-minded
-True

944
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,390
But in fact, they were all

945
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,180
Super weird

946
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,490
Ouch! Hamada, you're hitting the wrong person!

947
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,320
You've made a mistake

948
00:45:42,990 --> 00:46:14,920
