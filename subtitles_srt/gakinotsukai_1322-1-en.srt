1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,640
Are their hearts connected? Meet up without smartphones

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,600
The rule: Think of a place using the hint on the card, and try to meet up

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,080
I'm in Sancha

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,000
Sancha? ...

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,700
He went to the Tsutaya in Sancha

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,380
The first time, despite Tanaka's dawdling,
they were able meet up in 3 hours 43 minutes

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,360
The 2nd time, Downtown met up after the first hint

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,840
The challenge ended in 3 hours and 32 minutes

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,420
And now they do this again for the 3rd time

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,490
Will they be able to meet up?

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,460
5 seconds till start
5, 4, 3, 2 ...

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,120
3rd ever Gaki no Tsukai CHIKI CHIKI

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,640
Are their hearts connected? No smartphones meet up!

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,580
Even the count guy was too loud

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,220
Hamada's a bad influence on him

16
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,740
And he's a bad influence on Hamada

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,900
This is the 3rd time we're doing this

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,860
I thought we could make this one "The Movie"

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,180
That would be a pain in the ass

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,480
Perhaps even in 3D

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,670
Tanaka has to try hard this time

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,680
For real man

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,060
Even if it's on purpose, he sucks

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,240
Yup

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,560
Nobody thinks it's funny

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,510
I'm not

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,660
I'm not fooling around, I'm trying my best

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,920
It's really lame dude

29
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,060
This series, and the "I Think This Suits You",
I really hate them

30
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,640
I take both of them seriously

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,460
But it's great, how you draw in the audience like that

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,240
That's how you got the job on 'ZIP!'

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,480
This October Tanaka will be a ZIP! regular panelist

34
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,100
That's how?

35
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,960
Congrats, congrats

36
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,200
TN: Ougon Densetsu is a program hosted by Tanaka & Endo

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,200
What's Endo gonna do when 'Ougon Densetsu' ends?

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,620
Tanaka I'm counting on you man

39
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,340
I'll do my best

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,140
My next gig is at the Kokura Horse Racecourse

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,680
You're going there by yourself?

42
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,160
Yup

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,440
Can I come with you?

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,460
Why? Just why?

45
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,320
Can we know the first hint?

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,960
The hint for the first place, is...

47
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,560
This

48
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,200
A Shop With A Long Line

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,260
There's so many places that fit!

50
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,520
Really?

51
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,080
Yeah, yeah there are

52
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,420
Please don't go to some far off place for the first one

53
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,940
That's what messes up

54
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,980
You know, just yesterday,

55
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,310
I saw a place with a huge line while driving through

56
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,290
And it was a famous place
It's been on different TV shows

57
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,020
You probably have experience from hosting 'Hirunandesu'

58
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,160
I have no idea

59
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,120
Well then, let's get in our taxis

60
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,580
They begin at 3:05PM

61
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,820
They all head to a store they think has a long line

62
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:08,270
Matsumoto has been the fastest to meet up in the past. Where will he go?

63
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,650
Musashi

64
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,910
Let's go to the Musashi in Shinjiku

65
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,600
Matsumoto heads to the famous Ramen place Musashi in Shinjiku

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,470
You know, probably...

67
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,850
Like Tanaka, actually,

68
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:41,540
Tanaka and Hamada ... probably have no idea

69
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,790
I have no idea

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,370
As expected

71
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,540
What's that supposed to mean?

72
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,460
Honestly, I can't think of any definitive place

73
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:00,660
As Matsumoto expected, these two can't think of a store that fits

74
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:09,340
And Endo, being informed, might go to place we have no idea existed

75
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:19,630
Towards Ometosando, there's this really, like famous, Pancake store that you line up for

76
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:26,800
And as expected, Endo picks a place popular with youngsters that other's probably won't choose

77
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,990
The one I have hope for is Yamasaki

78
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:37,360
Since I live in Osaka, whenever I come to Tokyo I usually make a choice,

79
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,940
Either somewhere in Shinjuku, near NTV, or Jinbocho

80
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,040
Usually somewhere near those places

81
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,030
Within those, in Shinjuku there's this place that you always have to line up for

82
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,450
In Shinjiku?

83
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,550
Like Matsumoto, Hosei heads towards Shinjuku

84
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,050
Will these 2 be able to meet up?

85
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,170
Meanwhile, Tanaka...

86
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,360
He was still at the Kojimachi studio

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,360
When we had that shoot for Ryuchell,

88
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,980
There was like this Sweets shop near there

89
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,270
That's the one place I can think of
I don't know where it is though

90
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,860
Tanaka heads to a shop in Omotesando he remembers from a shoot last month

91
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,160
Do you think you'll recognise the area when we get closer?

92
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,350
I think so

93
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,050
But ... I don't remember what they sold

94
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,220
Cause, there were young people lining up,

95
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,600
I think it was a Sweets shop

96
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,570
So in that case, I think Endo, maybe he's been there for Hirunandesu

97
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,470
Maybe he though of that place, or he's been there on location,

98
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,940
I think it's that sort of place

99
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,660
I think it's probably a sweets shop

100
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,700
Will Endo and Tanaka meet up @ Ometosando?

101
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,710
Meanwhile, Hamada still hasn't thought of a place to go

102
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,480
Last time,

103
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,610
Last time, on some shoot we did,

104
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,090
Maybe it was in Roppongi,

105
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,540
After we ate sushi, wasn't there a line at some place outside?

106
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,390
There was

107
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,980
What was that, what store was that?

108
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,740
In fact, on location in a previous episode,

109
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,140
There's so many people lined up

110
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,350
Woah, it's packed

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,060
What is that for?

112
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,390
Coincidentally, all 5 members saw a store with a long line

113
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,200
It was a shaved ice place

114
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,140
Shaved ice?

115
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,000
That's the only place I can think of
We all saw it

116
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,970
Roppongi
Head to Roppongi please

117
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,310
There was a line there, right?

118
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,850
Yes there ... was

119
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,140
What was that?

120
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,770
What was that reply? Now I'm doubting myself

121
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,980
There was a line though

122
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,940
There was right?

123
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,940
Finally, all 5 have decided on a location

124
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,130
Mastumoto - Hosei, and Endo - Tanaka could possibly meet up

125
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,670
However, there is one unsure member among them

126
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,520
If this was Osaka I'd be sure

127
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,820
There's a pancake store,

128
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,510
Hawaiian pancakes

129
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,980
A huge line for it

130
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,580
Eggs.. Eggs something

131
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,060
I waited 1.5 hours with my wife to get pancakes

132
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,990
I didn't get it at all
1.5 hours just for pancakes

133
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,500
I don't get it honestly

134
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,750
We're heading towards Shinjiku though

135
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,040
I mean I don't know what the pancake store is

136
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,220
You know just now, I thought of a place,

137
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,520
They line up outside [REDACTED] right?

138
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,930
Oh that's true

139
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,580
Let's go to [EXPUNGED]

140
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,970
I think I've been there with Matsumoto

141
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,210
Yeah, sorry, let's go to !@#!$!@#

142
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,880
Meguro, let's go to Meguro

143
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,190
I'll meet someone at this place

144
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,810
Hosei changes his location to a famous Ramen place in Meguro

145
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,420
In fact, Matsumoto also ...

146
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,740
There's one place ... One place that interests me

147
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,770
Yup,

148
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,950
In Nakame, I think it's Nakame

149
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,280
[*******], that place

150
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,210
There's huge lines outside there

151
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,370
He's already said that famous ramen place,

152
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,720
They're still headed towards Musashi in Shinjiku

153
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,590
There is one more unsure member

154
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,490
What should I do?

155
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,250
If I go ... to the pancake store,

156
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,890
Like most people would say that's the right idea

157
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,400
But it's about the other members
Let's go to a place where guys would go

158
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Endo changes his destination
From a youthful choice, to a guy's choice

159
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,090
What is the store he chose?

160
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,840
Will any of them be able to meet?

161
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,430
I thought you guys would understand this!

162
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,430
subbed by senor_wristband

163
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,200
There! Somebody's there!

164
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,870
Exactly right?!

165
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,280
Matsumoto was the first to arrive

166
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,640
He waits and prays for someone else to come

167
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,990
I guess that's right

168
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,280
TN: Matsumoto did an ad campaign for Yu-Pack; That's him in the poster

169
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,960
TN: His slogan was "Baka Majime" (Stupdily Serious)

170
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,960
It's cause I'm Stupidly Serious
Those guys are just stupid

171
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,520
Thank you

172
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,480
Hamada then also arrives

173
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,880
Look at the line

174
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,520
See!

175
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,760
The line is so long

176
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,240
That's a line

177
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,240
It would be weird for them not to show up

178
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Hosei and Endo both arrive to their destinations

179
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,520
Only Tanaka, the one who doesn't know his store's name, is left

180
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,070
I don't properly remember it

181
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,800
I might be wrong, It might not be here

182
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,200
He wandered around looking for the shop

183
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,320
Ah there it is. Here, here

184
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,760
Eggs ... Eggs & Things

185
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,560
This is it. See, look at the line.

186
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,090
And? There's nobody here

187
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,480
There's nobody here

188
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,760
Time's up

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,720
Time's up, of course

190
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,430
Time's Up!

191
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,440
There's nooobody here

192
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,310
The 5 call each other, to see where they're at

193
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,810
Hello, this is Matsumoto

194
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,800
Hold on, Tanaka. Tanaka where are you?

195
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm in Urahara, at a pancake store, Eggs & Things

196
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,400
You'll get a Double Hand Slap later, alright?

197
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,360
Double Hand Slap?

198
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,440
Who the hell would go to Urahra?

199
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,120
Pancakes, you idiot?

200
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,000
Hamada and I would never go there

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,240
How am I supposed to know stuff like that

202
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,160
In my entire life, since birth, I've eaten at most 4 pancakes

203
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,710
So little

204
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,160
Just 4?

205
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,440
Alright alright, Matsumoto where are you then?

206
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm at the head store for Musashi in Shinjiku

207
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,210
There's always a line here!

208
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,840
I see...

209
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah, I did say that. Matsumoto-san and Musashi

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,120
The thing is though not a single person is lined up here

211
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,520
I had the same idea as you Matsumoto-san
I thought of a ramen place too

212
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Eh? Where, where?

213
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,080
I went to a ramen place. [!@#%] in Meguro

214
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,240
I knew it!

215
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,880
You went there after all

216
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,720
Eh? You thought of here too?

217
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,440
I did for real

218
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,040
Hosei-san, Hosei-san!
I'm at [EXPUNGED], near you at [REDACTED]

219
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,480
That place is really popular yeah

220
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,400
Hamada is the problem here

221
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,760
Uh oh. Uh oh.

222
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,010
Where are you?

223
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:14,080
Well first off, I'm in Roppongi

224
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:23,320
I couldn't think of a place at first. Remember we went to that Sushi place for that episode?

225
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,280
After we left we saw that huge line, remember?

226
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,310
Oh yeah, they were lining up

227
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,040
The shaved ice place right?

228
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,200
Shaved Ice place

229
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,120
There's no way we'd think of that
What's the name of the store?

230
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,880
What's the name?

231
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,440
Eh? "yelo" "kakigori"

232
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,040
"yelo"

233
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,880
Nobody knows it

234
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,360
He's definitely made it up

235
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
It's the first time you've been there isn't it?

236
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,760
It's gotta be a ramen store! Hamada! Tanaka!

237
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,800
Young people are good too

238
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,280
We've all been to this place

239
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,160
I totally get Yamasaki's idea

240
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,180
Right?

241
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,800
There's also the distance. We had to start in Kojimachi,

242
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,320
I thought you guys would understand this!

243
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,960
You guys really are clueless

244
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,680
We're all clueless

245
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's get the next one, let's do it

246
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's meet at the next one

247
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,330
That shaved ice place, from last time ...
I don't know if that's the right idea

248
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,600
If he doesn't even know the name, why would anyone else go there

249
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,650
They told me "No way!" after all

250
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,740
"It's gotta be a ramen place!"

251
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,740
58 minutes from the start

252
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,540
They gather themselves, and look at the next hint

253
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,800
Hotel

254
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,540
Hotel

255
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,630
This is .. It's too general

256
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:18,270
There's over 2000 hotels within reach of the members
This is a pretty tough hint

257
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,890
The key is to consider how the other members will think about this

258
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:43,660
Those ... impoverished comedians can't stay in nice hotels anyways

259
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,800
Hotel Yoko!

260
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,000
Let's go! We'll meet at this one

261
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,770
Why did Matsumoto choose Hotel Yoko?

262
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,510
The people watching TV probably won't get this,

263
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,090
Akasaka Yoko,

264
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,250
Yoshimoto was located in that neighbourhood,

265
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,630
Pretty much everyone stayed at that hotel

266
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,600
It became an Ibis after

267
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:27,690
I've stayed in Akasaka Tokyu a lot in the past too

268
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:35,060
Matsumoto chooses Akasaka Yoko, a hotel many comedians stayed at in their youth

269
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,510
This is so hard!

270
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,090
However. However,

271
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:53,280
Back when I entered Yoshimoto. I think 20-25, maybe closer to 30 years ago,

272
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,680
There was a hotel that every comedian that came from Osaka stayed at

273
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,890
This is a hotel DownTown would really remember.
Alright, let's aim for DownTown.

274
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,400
I've got 2 ideas
1 of them,

275
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:20,310
When DownTown came here from Osaka, when they still didn't have a place in Tokyo,
there's a hotel they stayed at often

276
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,890
I've heard a lot about Akasaka Tokyu

277
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,770
Wasn't it Yoko?

278
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,200
Oh yeah Yoko. So Yoko, or,

279
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,110
In Roppongi, what was that place called,

280
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,170
Ibis

281
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,600
Well let's head towards Akasaka

282
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:41,110
Hosei and Endo both head towards that historic Yoshimoto hotel

283
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,510
What about Hamada and Tanaka?

284
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,690
When we were in Akasaka, I pointed out that place that changed names

285
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,260
Akasaka Tokyu

286
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,060
I think the first big hotel I stayed at when coming to Tokyo was that one

287
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,540
Either that, or Yoko

288
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,110
We stayed in small places

289
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:07,910
But should I use these memories? Cause I think perhaps, in Roppongi,

290
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,910
the Grand Hyatt

291
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,660
Let's go to !@#!

292
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,550
What hotel did Hamada choose?

293
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,600
Considering the distance, I say Westin

294
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,740
Tanaka ignores using memories as a hint, and heads towards Westin in Ebisu Garden

295
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,400
I think I have the right idea

296
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,830
I'll definitely meet someone

297
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,460
I'll definitely meet somebody

298
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,910
Seriously, Westin in Ebisu Garden Place

299
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,340
I'll meet up for sure!

300
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:53,400
Seriously, if they go to some cliche place like Hyatt, or New Otani,

301
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,090
If there's nobody here I'll be shocked

302
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,460
Seriously if nobody comes,

303
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,430
I'll have to rethink my relationship with these guys

304
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:13,400
Everyone besides Tanaka has a good chance of meeting up

305
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,340
Matsumoto arrives near his location

306
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,600
There's gonna be someone here

307
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,830
However ...

308
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,170
There's no celebrity aura here

309
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,970
There would be a crowd if a star was here,

310
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,290
But those guys can't do this, in the first place

311
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,460
Oh there's someone there! There is!

312
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,110
There's someone there

313
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,310
Oh there's someone there! There is!

314
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,430
There's someone there

315
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,940
Exactly, right?!

316
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,110
This is it right?

317
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,110
There was some distance between us

318
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,290
Oh thank god

319
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,710
This is it right?

320
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,200
I knew this is the place

321
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,290
If you're a Yoshimoto comedian,

322
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,890
Hotel Yoko

323
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,890
Hotel Yoko

324
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,370
Eh, but why are only you here?

325
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,770
I had the same confidence

326
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,740
This is the only answer for a Yoshimoto comedian

327
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,110
Seriously

328
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,370
Even Nishikawa Norio stayed here

329
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,660
Everyone, all the seniors,

330
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,230
Hanshin Kyojin-san stayed here

331
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,630
Everyone's stayed here

332
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,170
I don't understand why they aren't here

333
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,660
I think because Cocorico are from a different generation

334
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:48,510
Those guys got their break in Tokyo, so they don't really have experience with hotels

335
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,430
I thought DownTown-san would be here

336
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,400
Isn't Hamada scary?

337
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,510
Time's Up!

338
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,170
Eh? Where did Hamada go then?

339
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,600
Hamada?

340
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,890
I just gotta say
Yamasaki and I have met up

341
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,600
Of course we did

342
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,660
Listen, Hamada,

343
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:19,890
What's your agency? Where are you from boy?

344
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,170
Where are you from? Jinrikisha?

345
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,000
Are you from friggin Hori Pro?

346
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,400
Where?!

347
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,490
My, my agency is Yoshimoto

348
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,910
Yoshimoto right?

349
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,460
So then,

350
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,110
What hotel have you stayed at?

351
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,490
So you're at Yoko then?

352
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,800
Yes!

353
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,430
It was Yoko after all

354
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,260
Where are you, actually

355
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,910
Where I'm at right now?

356
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,310
The Grand Hyatt

357
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,170
Why?

358
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,400
What is that? What memories do you have there?

359
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,970
We've never even been there

360
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,690
Is the summer fatigue getting to you?

361
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,170
Just hold on-

362
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,940
Did you not have this idea at all?

363
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,580
I did have the idea, but I'd heard Yoko was demolished

364
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,630
It's standing proud right now

365
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,660
That place, Ibis,

366
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,260
Oh yeah, I've heard Ibis was demolished too

367
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,890
I'm at Hotel Ibis

368
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,710
Right? What's with that choice?

369
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,260
Endo, oi, Ibis is no good

370
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,760
The Ibis is gone, and next year it'll come back as a different place

371
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,040
I mean, that's still,

372
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,720
You guys think you're hot shit cause you met up right?

373
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,520
They said "Hotel", so you have to consider a lot of places. Right Tanaka?

374
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,350
Yes, I agree

375
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,370
Where are you?

376
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm at the Ebisu Westin

377
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,680
Ebisu's Westin?

378
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,040
Why Westin?

379
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,160
Why? Why Westin Tanaka? Why?

380
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,840
I'm gonna get you fired from ZIP!

381
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,650
Your turn idiot

382
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,920
Please, not that,

383
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,480
I was thinking about the distance, how far you all were

384
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,880
That's why I thought it was the Ebisu Westin

385
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,800
This is a shock

386
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,760
I wish you at least went to the Marudo Inn next door

387
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,280
That was another place too

388
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:31,200
Then we could've gone "Oh wow we ended up next to each other!!!", and then cut to commerical

389
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,440
That's what the director was hoping probably

390
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,730
What's wrong with you people? Are you guys idiots?

391
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,700
Next week - Meet Up Without Smart Phones - finale

392
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,540
Their idea for the 3rd hint?

393
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,720
3, 2,

394
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,160
Dogenzaka

395
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,210
There's a big XXX in Ginza

396
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,620
Or in Shinya

397
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,360
There's no other answer but Nikotama

398
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,040
There's someone there!

399
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,060
Will all 5 be able to meet?!
