00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,840
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,730
Letâ€™s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,340
It's New York!

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,110
Are you gonna be like those lying on the street in New York today?

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,710
Are we like that?

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,440
They don't agree
-You usually seem a little slack

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,830
We are working hard today
-Full of energy today

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,110
I'm working so hard together I even got a Matsumoto-style haircut

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,850
The hair is also wrong!

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,990
It's more like Bito Takeshi

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,680
Who is Bito Takeshi!?

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,490
How can Bito Takeshi and Matsumoto have the same hairstyle?

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,500
This is the same Matsumoto

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,660
It's obviously the same as Bito

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,930
Well, then its the same, in short i'm full of energy

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:54,810
Without further delay, we bring you the latest version of the "Someone is Here" series

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,180
Hamada loves this one

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,070
He's super happy now

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,010
He wants to watch this while eating a burger

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,950
This is his side dish
-His absolute favorite

21
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,180
We've kept you waiting then

22
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,220
Absolute favorite

23
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,850
It's this:

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,130
There's Someone in the Third Row in the Back Seat is Occupied Prank

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,980
This is it

26
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,060
If it's really good, if Hamada laughs too much, his face might break open

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,570
His face will snap

28
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,940
We might see it happen

29
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,880
So, after this, the pranker in the back seat

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,870
Also has someone behind them

31
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:41,420
And, the machines that are so niche they have achieved zero sales

32
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,530
And, when pretending to catch a big fish, up to 5 people can be pulled into the water

33
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:16,120
There's Someone in the Third Row in the Back Seat is Occupied Prank

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,020
About four years ago, we did a "there's someone in the back seat" prank

35
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,820
So it was 4 years ago!

36
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,350
So scary, this one

37
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,940
A normal reaction

38
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,880
The target of the prank was someone sitting in the passenger seat with someone behind them

39
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,650
Indeed scary

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,440
A simple setup

41
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,170
The face of the pranker is too horrible

42
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:46,160
This time, there will be someone in the third row behind the person that thinks they are pranking the person in the first row

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,380
The reverse prank is like this

44
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,650
So, the first target is

45
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,070
Einsetin's Inada

46
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,270
Who is called for the "back seat is occupied" prank

47
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,970
Due to being a scary-looking comedian

48
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,110
He is asked to be the setter

49
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,080
So, he quickly gets into the back seat

50
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,650
The target in the passenger seat is...

51
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,850
Anthony, who knows all about it

52
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,470
My phone seems to have been left there

53
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,850
I'm sorry, I'll be right back. Can you give me a minute?

54
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,910
Okay, okay.
-Sorry, sorry

55
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,630
Being lured away, Inada's chance appears

56
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,440
Tough for Anthony too

57
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,950
A great expression

58
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,000
So creepy
-Scary

59
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,450
Get ready to be scared

60
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,690
An arguably unsettling expression

61
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,890
He's looking in the rearview mirror

62
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,890
Checking

63
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,370
After getting into position

64
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,370
Here we go

65
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,630
Ah I see

66
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,010
A great image

67
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,670
Here we go!

68
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,470
A good composition

69
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,220
The Trifecta Prank

70
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,250
Will he realize?

71
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,210
His focus is ahead

72
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,160
I really hope he notices

73
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,860
Of course, Anthony won't pay attention to Inada

74
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,830
And probably because his attention is on the front row

75
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,370
He doesn't pay attention to behind him at all

76
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,570
His body is so far forward

77
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,010
A stalemate occurs

78
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,010
An endless wait

79
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,980
So, after 5 minutes

80
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,050
The man in the third row also pokes his head forward

81
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,150
He's offside

82
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,380
But Inada still fails to notice

83
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,880
Both sides are waiting to move forward

84
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,270
The distance after 10 minutes begins to close

85
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,290
He's moved so far forward

86
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,290
So

87
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,350
It scared Anthony too

88
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,110
Almost touching

89
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:51,010
The truth is revealed

90
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,250
Wait a second, wait a sec, let me calm down

91
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,920
Ah, so scared...

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,400
Gross, I want to throw up

93
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,100
Disgusting, I want to throw up

94
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,580
I'm exhausted

95
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,230
I still don't understand what's happening

96
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,530
Wait, I need to calm down

97
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,650
Ah...ah... my brain has turned around

98
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,410
So we explained the whole thing to him

99
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,370
Ah~ like that...

100
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,550
Typical Wednesday Downtown

101
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,810
And so, the next target is

102
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,830
Anthony must be tired too

103
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,800
Kasuga

104
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,840
Audrey's Kasuga

105
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,440
Kasuga has a lot of patience

106
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,030
Indeed

107
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,580
He's good at waiting

108
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,880
However, like Inada, his focus is also ahead

109
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,490
And is completely unaware of the behind

110
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,100
An interesting image

111
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,870
So, for this man who is known for his endurance

112
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,030
30 minutes passes

113
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,040
Quite a while

114
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,940
It's not easy for anyone

115
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,970
This guy is good

116
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,680
Perseverance

117
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:14,680
And so, little by little, the third row moves forward

118
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,820
To this extent

119
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,410
They're almost side-by-side

120
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,480
Right next to him

121
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,900
Finally

122
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,490
Quite forward both of them

123
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,440
This reaction is too real

124
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,440
That's it!

125
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,960
A huge surprise!

126
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:49,210
The truth is revealed

127
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,400
Not as much of a response as I expected

128
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,270
That's because of my professionalism

129
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,780
He'll realize if I react too much
-I'll realize?

130
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,500
After the "Oh!", I was planning to continue with Anthony

131
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,120
I felt something behind me

132
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,320
But I didn't turn around because I didn't want everything to be revealed

133
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,510
As expected of WedDown!

134
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,460
After testing this a few times

135
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,020
We explore what happens when the person in the passenger seat is also unaware of what's going on

136
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,360
Double-prank style

137
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,400
This time the targets are these two

138
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,040
A great lineup

139
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,650
What will happen?

140
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,010
Here we go.
-Scary enough

141
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,690
Nice expression

142
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,690
Here we go. Here we go

143
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,800
It also depends on who notices first

144
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,830
Indeed

145
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,720
Here we go. They're all here

146
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,680
What the hell is this!?

147
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,870
3 offenders with different crimes

148
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,570
The crimes committed are not of the same kind at all

149
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,160
The total silence of a prison van

150
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,740
And so it continued for 15 minutes

151
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,090
Not realized yet?

152
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,520
So close!

153
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:36,660
For some reason, Sakai begins combing his hair

154
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,660
At this time

155
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,780
After all, there are two of them

156
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,780
For Sakai, there are two more people

157
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,780
Meaning unknown

158
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,190
What is it?

159
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,260
Sakai and ...

160
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,190
What's going on?

161
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,710
It is indeed necessary to ask what's going on

162
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,080
Wants to get out first

163
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,730
What is it?

164
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:09,300
Sakai, who was completely baffled by the situation, gets out of the car voluntarily

165
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,320
However, the man behind has not yet been noticed

166
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,840
So, of course, the prank is not yet over

167
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,370
Such a long "oooh"

168
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,260
A long sound

169
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,390
Eh?

170
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,530
Eh...?

171
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,270
What's going on?

172
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,800
No...
-Still in the car...

173
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,900
I also don't...

174
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,140
Something's going on...

175
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,240
Eh eh eh?

176
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,440
What's going on?

177
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,610
Eh? Why can't I open this door?

178
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,980
What's going on?

179
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,950
Eh, what... eh?

180
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,890
Not good not good

181
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,920
I'm completely confused.
-I don't know what's going on either

182
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,960
The truth is revealed

183
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,430
A very small mask

184
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,300
There's another guy back there? You saw it?

185
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,960
I saw both of you

186
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,840
Eh?

187
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,180
Behind... eh, didn't you see?

188
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,970
Sakai mistakes the project for something to do with psychics

189
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,610
Something's gone wrong!

190
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,510
So, the last group of targets is

191
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,030
Midori

192
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,750
These two

193
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,750
This time, Shizuru's Ikeda was the setter

194
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,060
Seems to be watching some kind of video

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,510
It's break time after all

196
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,570
There is also the possibility that the back row will realize first

197
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,890
Lilly is concentrating on watching a video of Kamaitcahi

198
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,180
And Moriyama is concentrating on Lily

199
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,680
A stalemate occurs again

200
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,560
So

201
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,980
Eh...

202
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Although one of them knows, the other one doesn't

203
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,580
What? What?

204
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,370
It does get confusing!

205
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,050
What?

206
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,950
No, no. What's the deal?

207
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,740
This one seems to know something

208
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,300
Eh...

209
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,640
What? What?

210
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,080
No, no. What's the deal?

211
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,110
What is this project?

212
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,200
Indeed

213
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,550
There is definitely some kind of prank

214
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,580
So, Ikeda

215
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,720
Ikeda

216
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,770
He's like the Mona Lisa

217
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,300
A demure face

218
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,460
So funny

219
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,370
He is wondering why the truth hasn't been revealed yet

220
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,840
That's great

221
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,940
This is awesome!

222
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,990
Jumped

223
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,990
Bounced to the right

224
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,130
That was close. A dive to the right

225
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,170
Run, run, run!

226
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,930
Why?

227
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,450
This is really scary

228
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,050
Scary indeed

229
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,560
Eh...

230
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,130
What are you looking at?

231
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,440
What?

232
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,930
Lilly saw both

233
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,310
Eh...

234
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,310
Which side are you on?

235
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,110
What did you say?

236
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,240
What is the situation of these three people?

237
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,520
He's been...

238
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:27,900
The truth is revealed

239
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,790
"He's always been there"

240
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,520
Wait for me to calm down. What's going on?

241
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,570
-Lips are quivering

242
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,740
Super scared

243
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,020
Moriyama

244
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,980
Eh, this...who...that...

245
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,590
What's going on with his mouth

246
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,640
Eh... who is being pranked here?

247
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,750
First time

248
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,580
What's the matter with your mouth?

249
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,770
When words of joy, anger, sorrow, and sadness are coming to me like crazy

250
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,650
My mouth always twitches and doesn't stop, it's been like this since I was a child

251
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,090
Really, it's genetic

252
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,090
â€»After the broadcast, Moriyama's relatives contacted him and said that their family members were really like this, and he tweeted that he imagined the whole family at his funeral with quivering lips

253
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,210
This one is the scariest

254
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,470
Can't stop shaking

255
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,440
In summary
You'll be scared to shaking

256
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
This is great

257
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,710
What do you think?

258
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,120
What the hell is this result?

259
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,950
In short, it is shaking with fear

260
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,060
The result is that this guy is the last person to be set up, right?

261
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,230
This lip is the most frightening

262
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,750
That's awesome!

263
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,930
It's genetic

264
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,930
The guy in the third row was probably also scared, right?

265
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,570
"Is there someone hiding behind me too?"

266
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,140
He doesn't dare to trust

267
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,310
Maybe he checked at the start

268
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,940
Let's welcome the next presenter

269
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,750
It's Chocolate Planet!

270
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,260
The Chocolate Planet Constellation!

271
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,430
Yes, we are the Chocolate Planet Constellation

272
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,390
Ok

273
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,530
You should correct him

274
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:58,500
I'd like to ask, what is Chocolate Planet's strength?

275
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,600
Kawashima, what are our strengths?

276
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,570
Parody, right?

277
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,240
Thank you very much

278
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,010
Feels like a trap

279
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,680
In my opinion, its small props

280
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,820
Ah, that's true.
-The small props used in our routine are all made by me

281
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,360
I made this "no contact ring"

282
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,760
You put it on your finger to press the elevator button without having to touch it

283
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,870
It's suitable for now
-Yeah

284
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,600
This one passed the first stage of the Good Design Award

285
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,600
{Good Design Award", the highest award for Japanese design, was established in 1957 and is one of the four major design awards in the world

286
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,270
Did you create it?
-I did

287
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,480
So this time, we bring a theory about creations

288
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,380
It's this:

289
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,820
There are businesses that are so focused on niche areas that they don't even sell a single piece of machinery

290
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,220
This is it

291
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,860
Well, focusing on too niche areas, not a single piece of machinery sold

292
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,090
There must be
-There must be in this world, right?

293
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,630
I think so
-Not even one?

294
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,400
I actually made a very niche machine

295
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,030
This is it

296
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,600
Never seen it before

297
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,500
This is it

298
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,470
We have all had screen cover fall on the floor, right?

299
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,810
There are times when you can't pick it up, right?

300
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,110
Especially when there are no nails
-Especially

301
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,720
The machine that solves this problem

302
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,390
If it falls, you press this like this

303
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,790
The cover is picked up

304
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,700
With this

305
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,830
Don't be afraid
-No more fear. No more fear of having no nails

306
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,960
It helps elementary school students

307
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,560
A machine that can help elementary school students

308
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,100
No fear
-Yes, yes

309
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,710
What's wrong?
Matsumoto-san said "no fear", you shouldn't just reply with "Yes, yes".

310
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,110
The machine
-No fear

311
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,840
The second time it was dropped he picked it up easily

312
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,500
What's going on?
-This needs to be considered, right?

313
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,680
What's wrong? What's wrong?
-You didn't use "no fear" at all

314
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,380
If you drop it, you can't not pick it up with this "no fear"

315
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,590
He picked up again directly!

316
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:19,980
There are businesses that are so focused on niche areas that they don't even sell a single piece of machinery

317
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,820
First of all, FUJI SEIKI of Fukuoka Prefecture

318
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,450
The rice ball salt-spreading machine: Salt-spreading Machine No. 5

319
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,160
It's quite big

320
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,360
Salt injection port

321
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,760
It sprinkles salt on the surface of the rice balls on the conveyor belt

322
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,830
Flips it over and sprinkles it inside once too

323
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,100
Salt injection port

324
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,830
A machine for sprinkling salt

325
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,930
Awesome

326
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:50,410
As it is an excellent machine that can perform precise portion adjustment in 0.01 gram units

327
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,210
It is sold at

328
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,750
4 million yen

329
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,210
Eh?

330
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,810
4 million yen?

331
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,820
The price is high, but it has the performance to match

332
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,520
The development cost of this machine is about 100 million yen

333
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,120
100 million?
-Yes

334
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,260
Salt spreader developed with substantial funding

335
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,360
How many units have been sold?

336
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,770
A total of 1,336 units were sold

337
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,600
Awesome

338
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,600
It's already paid for

339
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,040
Really sold a lot

340
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,310
Yes, the rice balls sold in convenience stores and supermarkets

341
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,410
A best seller!

342
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,080
All need to be sprinkled with a small amount of salt

343
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,690
There are about 500 factories nationwide that make rice balls

344
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,290
Almost all factories have bought this salt spreader

345
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,590
I see

346
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:44,430
An overwhelming market share of about 90%

347
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,760
It is really a best seller

348
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,730
Awesome

349
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,430
That's awesome!

350
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
All the rice balls we eat will pass through this salt sprinkler

351
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,600
Factories that actually use this salt spreader

352
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,010
Every day we ship 20,000 rice balls to large supermarkets

353
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:03,250
So its impossible to salt each by hand

354
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:07,150
What are you talking about?

355
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,280
So it's deadly without a salt spreader?
-Without a salt spreader, it's a disaster

356
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,990
A realistic statement

357
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,230
So, this machine for salting costs 4 million yen

358
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,400
Has sold more than 1300 units

359
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,260
Very impressive

360
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,370
Next is the TADASHI manufacturing facility in Osaka Prefecture

361
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,340
Special machine for cutting off the scales of mackerel: The bamboo mackerel scales removal machine

362
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,870
What is this?

363
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:37,880
The mackerel has pronounced hard and spiny serrated scales near the caudal fin

364
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,490
Sliding the mackerel down on the prong scale remover

365
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,120
A blade is set up between conveyor belts

366
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,920
Look so healing

367
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,490
Automatic scale removal

368
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,200
In terms of its use

369
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,600
It removes the need to remove scales when making sashimi and dried fish

370
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,840
And what is this machine used for?

371
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,510
This machine is a special machine for processing fried mackerel fillets

372
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,310
The application is very narrow

373
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:07,980
Yes, the use of a fairly narrow range of machines, whats the sale price?

374
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,480
3 million yen

375
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,020
Three million?
-Yes

376
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,620
Another machine the same price as a car

377
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,360
How many units have been sold?

378
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,260
Sold 50 units since the start of the sale

379
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,400
Still selling quite well

380
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,900
Did you get your money back?

381
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,060
I haven't got my money back at all, and I still haven't

382
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,600
To fill the development cost of the scale remover

383
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,110
The new items now in production are

384
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,380
For making chicken wings wrapped in rice

385
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,880
It's a machine that makes chicken wings wrapped in rice

386
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,350
A little confused about what he was talking about

387
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,450
You can still understand a little bit, right?

388
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,960
Next is DREMAX in Saitama Prefecture

389
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:58,760
Strawberry root removal machine M-HT15

390
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,000
This is not good

391
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,430
Put the strawberries one by one on the rotating turntable

392
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,130
Its quick

393
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,310
The circular rotating blade then removes the root tip

394
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,440
This ah...

395
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,570
No, right?

396
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,150
This machine can cut the roots of 30 strawberries a minute

397
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,780
That's good

398
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,480
The effort needed is unordinary

399
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,420
Can't it all be done mechanically?

400
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:28,160
Because the strawberry is divided into the upper and lower part of the part it still require human input

401
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:34,160
The price of this semi-manual strawberry root cutter is

402
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,530
That's a lot of work

403
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,970
Not fully automatic isn't good

404
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,970
1.2 million yen

405
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,470
1.2 million?
-Yes

406
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,410
I thought it was a bargain considering the amount of work we had spent

407
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,210
Really?
-Really?

408
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,410
Isn't that a good price?
-No, not at all

409
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,980
Don't the buyer companies have anything to say about the selling price?

410
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,510
They say it's too expensive

411
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:56,150
Considering the operator's fee, it is a bit expensive

412
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,750
Why's he angry?

413
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,890
How many units have been sold?

414
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,060
Sold 18 units

415
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,630
It's selling well out of all my products

416
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,600
So I have a feeling that it will be a big hit from here on

417
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,800
Really?
-Yes.

418
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,970
This one will be popular

419
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,740
People who use it say, "I can't stop using it"

420
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,370
This is the initial development stage, right?

421
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,710
By the way, this company is engaged in fruit and vegetable cutting special machinery manufacturing

422
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,880
So that's it

423
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,750
The most recommended items now are

424
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,290
White potato slicing special machine

425
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,190
This is a special machine for white potato slicing

426
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,760
It is priced at 6 million yen

427
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,760
Still expensive

428
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,770
How many units were sold in the end?

429
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,770
It's fast!

430
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,870
Sold 8 units so far

431
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,000
8 units

432
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,000
8 units...
-Yes

433
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,070
Does it pay for itself?

434
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,270
I've earned a lot with this

435
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,270
Really?

436
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,380
Made a lot of money?
-A lot

437
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,040
Can you make money with this?

438
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,650
He said "money".
-Really?

439
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:00,220
Evaluated as a "groundbreaking product," additional orders are now coming in

440
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,750
It's true, it's true

441
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,790
Is it true?
-Seriously

442
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,960
There are many business machines that focus on niche areas outside of the food processing industry

443
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,160
This person is very interesting

444
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,700
There is a TTN company in Osaka that develops

445
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,830
It's all from Osaka!

446
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,840
The Pawn Tapper special printer writing tower tool man

447
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,840
â€»Buddhist written in Sanskrit on the top half and Chinese characters on the bottom half

448
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,440
Writing Tower Toolman

449
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,970
After the dedicated software starts

450
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,980
After entering the name of the preceptor and the name of the giver

451
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:33,720
It is very easy to print the text on the pawn tapper

452
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,790
A unit priced at 800,000 yen is a relatively high price

453
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,560
It has sold

454
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,030
Sold about 500 units

455
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:50,870
Well, in this industry, I think there is an overwhelming market share

456
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,970
All of them are pawn tabas

457
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,870
So that's how it is

458
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:59,080
So, we asked the abbot of Shinnyuji Temple who actually uses this machine

459
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,510
Wi-Fi capable

460
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,250
Color can also be printed out

461
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,880
Color printing

462
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,020
Pretty easy to use

463
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,020
This machine I have here is the third one i've bought

464
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,920
Leaving aside for the moment that the color funciton is a mystery

465
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,330
It does reduce labor

466
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,200
You have to write more than 10,000 a year...

467
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,300
If you use this, you can do it all in a week or less

468
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,340
There's loads so its convenient

469
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,140
I see

470
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,610
Yes, although it is focused on niche machinery

471
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,510
It will surely sell

472
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,120
This is a machine for sweeping aside feed for cattle: JUNO

473
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,920
Push feed

474
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,690
Very interesting

475
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,960
About 1000 units were sold in Japan

476
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,190
He's using the strawberry thing!
-What are you doing when you're on the phone?

477
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:51,860
Well, I think the dairy farmers will buy it

478
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,730
Doesn't work

479
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,460
Can you concentrate on the phone?

480
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:59,670
There is also this special machine for making paper neat, the paper bashing machine

481
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,270
Sorting only?

482
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:05,140
Products developed for printing companies and book production companies

483
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,350
Overseas sales network also available, total sales of 10,000 units

484
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,680
Awesome

485
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,980
Very good sales

486
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,320
Really?

487
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,220
Feedback from actual use is...

488
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,290
Our company is a reference book producer

489
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,530
If you try to make the paper neat by hand

490
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,360
It takes about 15 minutes or so

491
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
It takes 5 to 6 seconds to finish with this machine

492
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,930
Awesome

493
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,500
It would be disturbing without it

494
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,740
In addition, 30 units have been sold of a machine that makes sandbags

495
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,340
There's even this kind of thing

496
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:40,910
And about 300 units sold of one for growing shiitake mushrooms on logs

497
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,410
This is also very time consuming

498
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:47,050
Machinery for breaking up haystacks

499
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:47,050
There is a demand for machinery regardless of the area

500
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,020
But in the midst of all this, this Fujiki agricultural machinery of Osaka Prefecture

501
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,860
Osaka again!?

502
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,660
Mulching the insulation film of an arched greenhouse

503
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:58,460
The developer of a large number of agricultural machines specializing in only one area

504
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,460
Mulch stripping machine

505
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,960
Special machine for digging pits for seedling planting

506
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,400
There have many machines with less than 10 units sold

507
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,400
Electric clamp for stem removal of ginger

508
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,740
What the hell?

509
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,040
Specialized machine for pulling out posts

510
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,700
That just looked like scissors

511
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,840
So

512
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,340
On the shore of the beach

513
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,110
It prevents clams from escaping

514
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,210
We've made special machines for pulling clam nets

515
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,720
This thing doesn't work. The number of sales is 0

516
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,750
It's true!

517
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,220
0 units?
-0

518
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,750
It exists!

519
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,020
Can't sell any?
-No

520
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,060
A special machine for pulling a net to prevent clams from escaping

521
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,060
Finally found a machine that did not sell

522
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,260
To prevent escape

523
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,760
Therefore, the theory has been proven

524
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,930
Can we have a look at that machine?

525
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,030
That machine is no longer available, its been thrown away

526
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,100
Dismembered and thrown away

527
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,600
This statement...

528
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,240
Too much of a nuisance

529
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,240
Angry?

530
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:48,880
In summary
There are machines that have not sold but they have not survived

531
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,620
That's it, what do you think?

532
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,020
Strawberry, strawberry, that machine
-Yes

533
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,990
He moved his hands a little too late

534
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,060
That's because the operator's skills didn't keep up with the machine

535
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,560
It cut the root too much, right?
-Too much

536
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,400
The tasty parts are cut off

537
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,130
The part near the root 1mm seems to be poisonous
-No, it's not.

538
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,300
Don't talk such nonsense
-Eat all of it directly, it's not poisonous

539
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,670
Scale removal machine
-Yes, there is that one

540
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,480
It didn't make its money back

541
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,310
They should make a cost recovery machine
-Cost recovery

542
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,320
This is all your fault!
-Is it us?

543
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,620
Completely

544
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,390
All of them?

545
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,460
10:0
-So emotionless

546
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,260
I think it should be at least 6:4

547
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:44,570
Now is everybody's theories

548
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,320
Tonight's presenter is...

549
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,520
Tamura Kenji!

550
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,250
Seems to be super-level, he's on TV everyday

551
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,800
This is the only national program i'm on!

552
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,760
So, let me ask you all

553
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,260
After watching so many variety shows
-Yes

554
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,970
When going out on location and having to save someone who was about to fall into the sea

555
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,720
Wouldn't everyone go along with being dragged into the sea by the other person

556
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,520
1 or 2 people

557
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,340
It is reasonable to say that this is the limit

558
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,340
If you use two hands

559
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,810
This...

560
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,110
Wouldn't it be fun if we could drag more people into the water

561
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,730
No, no, no...
-I've always had this in mind

562
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,740
I don't know, is it possible to do it?

563
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,820
That's why I brought this theory.
-I see

564
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,620
Let's witness it together

565
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:42,290
If you act as if you are about to be dragged into the sea when a big fish is hooked, you can pull up to 5 people into the water with you

566
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,930
Acting?

567
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,430
Isn't that what happens when you catch a big fish?
-That's how it is

568
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,680
Shouting "no good, no good" and so on

569
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,950
There should be someone to come and help

570
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,410
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

571
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:57,240
Then the whole group of people dragged into the water

572
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,780
See how many people they can pull in with them, right?

573
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,150
Up to 5 people?

574
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,580
Is 5 people possible?

575
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,460
Saying, "No, I'm going to fall..."

576
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,760
Then falling in

577
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,160
It'd surely be funny

578
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,130
It feels like something will happen...

579
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,510
It feels like something will happen

580
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:23,500
If you act as if you are about to be dragged into the sea when a big fish is hooked, you can pull up to 5 people into the water with you

581
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,420
This time, the stage for verification was on a boat that departed on the tide of the Miura Peninsula in Kanagawa Prefecture

582
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:38,180
Three comedians are tasked with dragging people into the sea with them

583
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:46,320
And gave fake program announcements to their close juniors stating "they can't go home without catching sailfish"

584
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,130
Under the guise of this, they will attempt to take people into the sea with them

585
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,200
The first challenger is

586
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,730
Thank you--Hello, everyone...

587
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,330
Here he is, Ogata

588
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,670
Panther's Ogata

589
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,040
I believe you are usually the one who gets pranked
-Yes

590
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,240
I'm super happy

591
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,470
I really want to be the party responsible for pranking

592
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,340
For physical strength, I absolutely won't lose in terms of my waist and legs

593
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,580
After all, I used to play soccer

594
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,350
I was a midfielder

595
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,520
The attacking strikers were flattened by me in one fell swoop

596
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,990
So i'll definitely drag all the people down cleanly

597
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:24,060
It is true that the focus is on the physical strength

598
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,940
And Ogata will use his centripetal force to take down these juniors

599
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,970
They look the type to be beaten easily

600
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,070
Are these guys trustworthy?

601
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,940
The relationship of trust is very strong

602
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,880
Anyway, they're gentle guys, and I think they're going to come running to my rescue

603
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:47,420
Can he successfully drag people down by exploiting his seniority?

604
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,520
The choice of people is important

605
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,990
The Ogata-gun!

606
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,820
Thank youâ€”â€”

607
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,030
The first thing is to make a decent opening

608
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,930
Any tips? Tips for bringing in the fish

609
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
When hooked, it creates a lot of tension

610
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,870
So you all need to focus your strength together...

611
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:11,030
In this way, the captain subliminally plants the idea of all banding together

612
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,910
On the day of the storm, we set sail for our mission base

613
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,850
Ok ok let's go
-You got it?

614
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,480
Yes yes yes

615
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,250
If you fall into the sea in this condition, it is really dangerous

616
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,120
So we have to help each other

617
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So

618
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,760
Remember to shout "HIT" when you catch it!

619
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,550
Under the captain's command, the group started fishing for sailfish without any suspicion

620
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,400
HIT

621
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,300
How does it feel to be a sailfish?

622
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,140
Eh, did you catch it?

623
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,840
I can't believe it. I can't believe it. It's heavy

624
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:49,760
Then, Ogata establishes the rule that all members must gather after "HIT"

625
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,920
It's gone

626
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,680
Gone?

627
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,620
What the hell are you doing?

628
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:58,400
Next, Ogata gets to work

629
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,290
Wait a minute, this is in the, oh!

630
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,440
Hooked!

631
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,460
Sailfish. Sailfish hooked!

632
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,430
A one-handed grip on a pre-designed weighted fishing rod

633
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,670
It feels right

634
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,130
This is where the sailfish show begins with all its might

635
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Pull it up!

636
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,710
It hurts. It hurts. Hold me fast

637
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,010
Hold on, hold on, it hurts, it hurts

638
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:25,560
They can't let the sailfish take the boss away, so they do their best to protect Ogata

639
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
It is really strong!

640
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,750
But five people in this state

641
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,620
Can he do it?

642
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,680
It's hopeless, right?

643
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,990
Next

644
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,720
Dangerous, dangerous, really dangerous

645
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,560
All the power is at the front

646
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,990
Wait, that's dangerous!

647
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,920
So unreasonable

648
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,970
It's too unreasonable...

649
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,430
He simply wants to jump, right?

650
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,590
It's not reasonable!

651
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:43,620
Ogata tries the strategy of taking himself and the rod toward the surface of the sea

652
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,630
He's gone mad

653
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,000
The body is tilted more than the fishing rod, creating such an amazing image

654
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,680
However, it is worthy of a group of fools led by Ogata

655
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,320
With no sign of doubt, they assist with all their might

656
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,550
Won't Ogata go down first?

657
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,260
After that, it was a stalemate for 2 minutes

658
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,790
What kind of location shoot is this?

659
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,860
That's dangerous!

660
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:19,560
Pulled back by his group, the mission is declared a failure

661
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,040
Next

662
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,810
Can you take it easy? The fish is off the hook

663
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,300
"Be gentle and supportive"... like an idiot's lecture

664
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,480
That was really dangerous just now

665
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,950
They were stronger and protected me more than I expected

666
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,590
Truly protected him

667
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,320
Who made the most effort?

668
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,560
Nedate

669
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,460
Nedate

670
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:45,930
He had such a tight grasp on me

671
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,360
He's as strong as an ox

672
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:53,100
The fact they went this far to save me makes me happy, but also a little angry

673
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,810
Thus, he understands that dragging people into the sea is not a simple matter

674
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,140
One more time... can you give me one more chance?

675
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,580
Sure, go ahead

676
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,150
Ogata starts his 2nd challenge

677
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,330
Elsewhere, the 2nd challenger is

678
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,280
TKO Kimoto

679
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,030
Centripetal force is indisputable

680
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,030
I am very confident

681
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,880
Kimoto, who is known for being strict with his juniors

682
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,750
Will use a battle plan that uses the fear of seniors as a weapon to drag people down

683
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,240
We're gonna catch today!

684
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,570
So

685
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,350
This group begins fishing

686
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,150
HITâ€”â€”

687
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,540
In order not to arouse suspicion they first carry out the normal fishing process

688
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,720
Caught a squid

689
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,520
Let's get started!

690
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,090
Kimoto launches the real challenge

691
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,990
The opening point is very well chosen

692
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,690
Whoo-hoo! Hooked!

693
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,630
Wait a minute

694
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,600
Very large

695
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,230
Ah...

696
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,670
At this point is good

697
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,820
Compared with Ogata's group

698
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,720
The Kimoto group's willingness to gather towards their leaders is significantly lower

699
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,840
Didn't come at all

700
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,710
Somebody help!

701
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,710
What should be done?

702
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,510
OK, please!

703
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,870
Even with a personal distress call, the rate of gathering is still sporadic

704
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,740
The force of support is also noticeably weak

705
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
The result:

706
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,060
Tugging at people

707
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,230
He uses his own initiative

708
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,830
Had to use this trick

709
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,440
I can't do it myself

710
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,540
Help me a little bit. Help me...

711
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,790
He is forced to pull his juniors himself

712
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,060
So

713
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,010
Three, come!

714
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:44,810
Ok

715
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,670
Launching a final sprint with a one-handed grip that is unimaginable for catching a sailfish

716
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,420
This is so weird

717
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,190
One hand is also too strange

718
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,360
That's dangerous!

719
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,040
That's not good enough

720
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
You don't see this very often

721
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,400
Shinomiya is the only one dragged into the water

722
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,210
Not great

723
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,040
But Shinomiya fell down

724
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,980
Kimoto could not hide his dissatisfaction with the dismal result

725
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,980
It's so dismal

726
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,220
So

727
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,220
Why did you let go?

728
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,350
Hands...

729
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,560
I am very sorry

730
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,490
I am very sorry

731
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,340
On board the ship, a lecture begins

732
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,120
I didn't ask you to apologize...

733
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,380
Next, the last challenger is

734
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,040
Very powerful

735
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,280
Alco & Peace's Hirako

736
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,070
My 182 cm 97 kg physique is not for nothing

737
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:49,550
Played for Tohoku as a football player in high school

738
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,880
Tackling, pushing, squeezing, in short, trying to slow down the opponent

739
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,790
This type of movement is necessary for this

740
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:02,360
If the max number of people that can be brought is 5

741
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,060
Then the goal is certainly 5

742
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:08,040
5 targets including his partner Sakai

743
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,340
Hirako will attempt to drag all the people down with his own power

744
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,200
What you catch is not a fish, but your own weak heart

745
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,810
Yes
-Understood

746
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,310
Don't really buy it

747
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,790
The challenge starts

748
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,570
Looks pretty cold

749
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,650
Ah HIT HIT HIT HIT HIT HIT

750
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,480
Wait a minute, it's heavy!

751
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
So heavy, so heavy, so heavy, help!

752
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,720
Support!

753
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,160
Both sides of the waist. Come here. Come here

754
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,290
1 here, 1 here

755
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,330
Wait, wait, wait, wait, it's really heavy

756
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,830
Wait, wait, wait. It's really heavy

757
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:42,700
Reel it!

758
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,800
Not my legs!

759
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,670
Not the legs, hold the waist!

760
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,510
Reel it quick!

761
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,070
Reel it!

762
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,910
The legs are dangerous, my waist!

763
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,380
It's true you'd ask "why aren't you reeling it in?"

764
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,910
Reel it!

765
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,520
Despite being shouted at, Hirako will never reel it in

766
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,520
It'd make you angry!

767
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,860
Not the feet, not the feet, but the waist

768
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,400
Aiming to pull down 5 people on the first try

769
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Carefully assigning each person's position while figuring out the best formation

770
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,370
Why don't you reel it in?

771
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,170
Reel it!

772
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,670
You should reel it

773
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,200
Wait a minute, the line will break ... so heavy

774
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,170
Reel it first!

775
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,840
Can this really be reeled in?

776
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,970
It can, it can

777
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,440
Okay, hurry up and reel it

778
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,310
Please reel it quickly!

779
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,690
On the other side, Ogata didn't even make it into the water

780
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,100
Nedate!

781
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,690
Yes?

782
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,580
Looks like a tuna documentary

783
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,050
Because you are too strong

784
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,290
Yes

785
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,430
Be more gentle next time

786
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,090
Got it!

787
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,990
He uses an inexplicable reason to assign the strong enemy to the further location

788
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,860
Then, before Nedate's arrival, he uses a lightning-fast operation

789
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,950
Aiming to pull down 4 people at the same time as the maximum

790
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,610
Wait a minute

791
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,090
Nedate is excluded

792
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,750
Wait a minute

793
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,030
Good acting skills!

794
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,980
Great acting!

795
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,780
Hooked - HIT !

796
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,620
Yes, the best performance

797
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,180
While Nedate is...

798
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,420
He's coming!

799
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:14,240
The battle plan works as Nedate's arrival is delayed

800
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,420
Nedate is coming!

801
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,560
What to do?

802
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,890
Dangerous!

803
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,400
One by one, one by one, one by one

804
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,460
After approaching

805
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,150
So

806
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,930
You can do it!

807
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,910
Nedate...

808
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,280
Would like to see it again

809
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,610
Fell into the sea at the same time as the enemy Nedate arrives

810
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,150
He could have got three

811
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,520
He tried his best though

812
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,750
With this judgment, two people were successfully pulled down

813
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,630
Nedate downed!

814
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,960
It's really dangerous!

815
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,860
Super dangerous. Are you okay?

816
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,370
On the other hand, the Kimoto Army is...

817
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,050
Try again?

818
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,940
You too!

819
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,340
Same as in your live performances

820
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,070
At the place where you should be rushing

821
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,240
As soon as something went wrong you retreated

822
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,380
Already lecturing about other things

823
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,950
Yes, it is.
-This is the key moment!

824
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,880
It's...
-Right?

825
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:15,640
Bringing lecturing to a level that has nothing to do with fishing

826
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,990
So unhappy

827
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:20,600
When the customary Kimoto lecture is well and truly over

828
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,070
Let's fish!

829
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,460
No energy

830
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,800
It'd definitely be like this

831
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,490
The 2nd challenge begins

832
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,730
I can't catch...

833
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,600
Because the atmosphere is not very good now

834
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,040
Here it comes-

835
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,270
HIT

836
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,480
Already saying the atmosphere is bad

837
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,980
Assemble!

838
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:44,320
The lecture had an effect

839
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,520
The Kimoto army come to support more actively than the first time

840
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,850
Little tighter?

841
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,140
But

842
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,360
Please let go

843
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,240
The youngest junior, Melody Kobayashi, tries to remove his hand

844
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,740
"Please let go" was very clear

845
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,450
Next

846
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,550
Shinomiya again?

847
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:23,600
Just like earlier, he ends up taking only Shinomiya with him

848
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,520
Melody
-Yes

849
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:32,900
Melody, you just said "please let go", right?

850
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,300
He heard!

851
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,830
Kimoto's group is bad

852
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,670
It's already the worst atmosphere ever

853
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,480
This fishing trip is not fun at all

854
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,580
Kimoto and I hosted a radio program together

855
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,500
I feel like I really shouldn't listen to his advice from now on

856
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:53,080
Back to Hirako, who's been in a stalemate for 7 minutes

857
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,750
It's hopeless

858
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,720
Why?

859
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,520
Make a wall, make a wall

860
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,820
Here I am... make a wall in my place

861
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,360
What? A wall?

862
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,310
Guiding them to the front with enigmatic instructions

863
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,520
He successfully distributes everyone equally around him

864
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,070
It's dangerous, Hirako!

865
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:20,170
Finally, with everyone in place

866
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,080
He's so irritating, this guy

867
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,210
So annoying!

868
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,170
So when Hirako decides to fight

869
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,510
Get out of the way!

870
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,880
Working so hard!

871
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,190
Move your foot away!

872
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,260
My feet are dangling!

873
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,550
Then after 10 minutes of struggling with the false sailfish

874
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,060
The moment has finally come

875
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,600
Move your feet away. Move your feet away

876
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,900
Move your feet away

877
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,380
The last two fell down!

878
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,690
Awesome!

879
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,890
So natural!

880
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,720
It was really an accident

881
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,220
Scary!

882
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,340
Awesome!

883
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,450
Perfect

884
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,900
So strong!

885
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:19,090
Surprisingly, he acheved the desired goal and successfully dragged all five people into the sea together

886
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,570
So impressive

887
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,470
Brilliantly, he validates the theory

888
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,870
Thank you, Hirako!

889
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:27,230
On the other side, Ogata, refusing to give up, continues

890
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,160
Fighting with a style beyond imagination

891
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,220
It has become another competition!

892
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,460
What is this situation?

893
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Then

894
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,780
That's not the main idea, is it?

895
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
Who wants to see it like this?

896
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,720
It has become tasteless

897
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:13,320
In summary
Hirako achieved success

898
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,920
What do you think? Sure enough, pulling down five people is a wonderful scene, right?

899
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,800
Mayama?

900
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,760
Very moving to see it finally happen, just like catching a fish

901
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,440
They didn't catch them, just let them go

902
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,680
The last two people naturally fell down

903
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,650
Yes

904
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,070
The posture was very natural, just like a crane machine

905
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,460
It was very interesting

906
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,250
I see

907
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,450
Next time see if it can be done with a bungee jump

908
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,390
What a dangerous idea!

909
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:43,500
It's a one-person thing

910
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,980
Only those who take the lead will be saved...

911
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,500
