2
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,580
A worldwide cooking show

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,280
Cooking Hatto shite boo!

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,960
Cooking Hatto Shite

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,700
Ok, first of all.
- Yes.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,930
Our popular regular guest.

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:25,400
Yes. Our guest is Mrs. Cathy Tsukamoto from Shimantogawa cooking school.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,540
Please come in!

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,150
Teacher.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,780
Hello.
- Thank you for coming.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,280
Now teacher,
- Yes.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,390
Everyone watching this show is looking
forward to your cooking.

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,390
What's today's cuisine?

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,060
I'm going to make borscht today.

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:47,990
Oh, borscht?

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,600
It's Russian popular cuisine, huh?

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,900
Yes it is. Speaking of borscht, it means
one thing in Japan, right?

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,130
Yes.
- I think so.

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,040
Borscht is a cuisine, right?

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,570
Yes.

21
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,810
But in Russia, there are lots of borscht.

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,310
Are there?

23
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,880
There are so many kinds of borscht,
so it is kind of confusing.

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,580
So it is impossible to make borscht today.

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,950
I understand.

26
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,160
I don't like it.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Teacher..Your apron must be surprised.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,000
It didn't listen to me.

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,310
It didn't..?

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,940
It's annoying huh?

31
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,310
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,140
That's OK.

33
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,980
You should cut that scene

34
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,310
No no that's fine.

35
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,980
People would think I have bad manners.
- No, no one would.

36
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,150
I will make a dessert today.
- Dessert?

37
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:46,650
Dessert.

38
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,590
Sounds good. From which country?

39
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,220
Russia.

40
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,090
Oh Russia? It sounds rare.

41
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,190
Yea, please teach us how.

42
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,000
I have a funny story.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,370
Huh?

44
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,870
On my way to come here, I was driving then..

45
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,140
What is it?

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,010
What is it?
- Hilarious.

47
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,310
A hilarious story? I see..

48
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,510
Yes!

49
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,210
Now the crabs...
- Crabs?

50
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,050
Yes, crabs.

51
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,920
Strange to use crabs for dessert huh?

52
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,650
I don't really...

53
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,150
I have never heard.
- Me neither.

54
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,520
I think so. Then I'm going to put fresh cream on the crabs.

55
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,160
Fresh cream?

56
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,560
This is very unique dessert.

57
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Unique? How can you tell that?

58
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,070
What are you looking at?

59
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,040
What makes you decide it's unique or not!

60
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,310
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,710
Really.

62
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,420
I'm a bit strange today.

63
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:50,980
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,150
That's OK.

65
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,050
Apply the fresh cream..
- OK.

66
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,860
He is cheating on me.

67
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,930
Teacher.

68
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,800
I know it.

69
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,130
I'll kill him.

70
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,440
Why men are..

71
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,570
They always cheat on women.

72
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,170
Yea..it is a hard problem.

73
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,640
But I'm sure my husband does.

74
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,780
Oh does he?

75
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,610
He does. What do you think?

76
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,150
It is a hard question. That might be their nature.

77
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,250
Then put the fresh cream on..

78
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,090
Spread it.

79
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,090
OK, I will do that.

80
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,090
Really?
- Yes.

81
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,530
OK, I spread it on the crabs.

82
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,530
This is unique huh?

83
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,030
What makes you think it's unique?

84
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,640
What makes me think..

85
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,640
"No breasts."

86
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,740
Ryoko-chan is shocked.

87
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,040
She must be shocked.

88
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,180
No that's fine.

90
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,210
How is it? It's evenly spread on the crab.

91
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,450
Oh no way.. have to hurry.

92
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,620
I need garlic.

93
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,390
Have to hurry?

94
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,090
Yes. They will escape.

95
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,390
OK, I brought garlic.

96
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,460
Hurry! Hurry!

97
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,100
This is a big accident!

98
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,110
I'm so sorry.

99
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,610
Cut out this scene from the show!

100
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,610
No that's OK.

101
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,820
Ryoko-chan must be surprised.

102
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,020
And some lettuce.

103
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,520
Lettuce.

104
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,520
Yes, wrap it with the lettuce.

105
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,520
OK prepare lettuce.

106
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,820
I'm sorry.
- OK.

107
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,560
Here is the lettuce, and the crabs are here.

108
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,000
You know what?
- Yes?

109
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,970
It's really hilarious.

110
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,640
Oh your funny story, teacher?

111
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,610
What?

112
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,810
I'm clumsy.

113
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,280
I came here by car today, and
there were no place to park.

114
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,450
I was waiting for any vacancy.

115
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,320
In fact, you just need to wait.

116
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,860
If you wait huh?

117
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,860
Somebody left.

118
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,860
Then I could park.

119
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,960
Ok, back to the lettuce.

120
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,300
Do you have carrots?

121
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,670
OK, one?

122
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,340
The more the better.
- OK.

123
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,770
OK ryoko-chan, bring them all.

124
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,340
But one is enough for today.

125
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,180
Then smash lettuce with carrot.
- OK.

126
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,580
Lightly.
- OK.

127
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,020
Do you know why lightly?

128
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,120
You have to remember before getting married.

129
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,690
Hey Ryoko-chan, this is a really important question.

130
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,960
If you can't answer, you might not be able to get married!

131
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,530
Not to break fiber.

132
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,300
Yes that's the answer.

133
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,570
Smash it gently.

134
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,570
Let's smash.

135
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,970
OK, smash gently.

136
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,870
Not to break the fiber.

137
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,160
I won't come back!

138
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,640
OK then, cooking..

139
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:34,840
Bye.

140
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,970
See you next week.
