3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,040
Everyone's so excited!

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,040
QUIET!!!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,430
Yeah, everyone's so excited!

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,990
You know, when I think about it, I seem like I'm always angry on TV.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,370
Yeah, yeah.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,320
I have the image of always being angry.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,320
I'm really thinking of not getting angry anymore...

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,320
Ah, ahh!

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,880
Is that so?

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,460
Yeah, I'm thinking of that but, I bought the TV Taro the other day...

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,460
TV Taro?

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,280
You know, TV Taro.

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,770
Something like a TV guide?

16
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,770
Yes, it's a monthly subscription,  and it's called TV Taro.

17
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,200
Ok, ok.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,640
I'll never forget, March 26th, I bought the TV Taro.

19
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,580
Ok, ok, the date doesn't really matter...

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,710
Well, it does.

21
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,480
So, what about the TV Taro?

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,030
Well, you only need to buy that once a month, right?

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,740
So, that's why I bought it on March 26th.

24
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,280
Then I went home, and I was reading it... I really didn't notice at first.

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,310
Ah, I see, I see...

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,650
Huh? I've seen this before...

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,890
I looked at the cover again...

28
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,030
It's the March issue.

29
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,030
So you bought the same one?

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,990
It's definitely the convenience store's fault, right?

31
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,800
Why?

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,020
Because the next issue of TV Taro is already out!

33
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,390
It comes out on the 23th!

34
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,390
They hadn't changed it!

35
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,000
And the cover of TV Taro. It's always some portrait of a Hollywood star going like this...

36
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,010
One doesn't really notice the changes every month.

37
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,840
When you see it on the shelves, you think it's the right one! You think: it has to be the April issue!

38
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,270
I bought the TV Taro just for 3 days!

39
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,930
Absurd, isn't it!?

40
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,860
However, that was your mistake, right...?

41
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,860
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,340
Because you don't agree with me, I get more pissed off!

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,100
Well, it's your fault for not checking, right?

44
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,120
It's completely the store's fault!

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,930
Why is it looking like I'm wrong or something?

46
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,830
You could have just checked to see...

47
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,050
No, no, no, no...

48
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,030
Hamada-san...

49
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,320
It's the end of March and you see the TV Taro on the shelves...

50
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,530
You don't bother to check!

51
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,250
Well, if you thought the store was wrong, why didn't you just go back and return it?

52
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,420
Who goes back to the store at 5:00am in the morning?

53
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,320
Just go back the next day then!

54
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,510
The next day!

55
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,600
But...

56
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,150
If you thought they were wrong.

57
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,860
You go for me... I'm too tired for that...

58
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,570
In the old days, I would of, I would of went back and said: GAAAAAA!

59
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,570
I'm too old for that!

60
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,510
I don't have the energy anymore...

61
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,510
Look, I went to McDonald's the other day.

62
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,510
Because the meat was missing.

63
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,510
Huh?

64
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,510
Bread, bread, beef, bread.

65
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Oh, it's supposed to be...

66
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,030
What kind of food are you eating anyway??

67
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,030
Well, don't you eat McDonald's?

68
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,460
What kind of burger?

69
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,320
The one that's double.

70
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,270
Double...

71
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,110
You're so young!!

72
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,600
You're eating that kind of stuff at this age?

73
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,590
No, no, my wife got it for the kids, and I heard.

74
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,590
"What is this??"

75
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,130
So I got up and looked...

76
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,130
It was bread, bread, meet, bread.

77
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,460
Bread, bread... ahh... I see, you're right.

78
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,760
I asked her and she said she just bought it so...

79
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,130
I thought: "that's interesting"... I said "Give it to me"

80
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,430
I wrapped it back, changed my pajama...

81
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,480
took the receipt and drove the car.

82
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,780
Ok...ok...

83
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,690
So, the people in the store were like: "Ah, it's Hamada"?

84
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,650
I just barged in with the burger, so no one tried to come close to me.

85
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,360
I guess they probably knew I was pissed off.

86
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,110
They probably saw fumes coming out of your head...

87
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,220
I thought I went in the store normally, but my face was probably like this...

88
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,480
So young!

89
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,700
They said "Yes?"

90
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,680
Ah, it had to be just some part-time employee, right?

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
So I said "Could you get the manager, please?"

92
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,270
No, no, no, no. I'm not wrong, right?

93
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,740
Probably in the back they were saying...

94
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,170
"Manager, there's a gorilla in the store".

95
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,400
Not a gorilla!

96
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,560
Not a gorilla, I was just standing like this.

97
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
And the manager comes and says "How can I help you?"

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
So I asked "Are you the manager?"

99
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,500
I swear you didn't speak that nicely!

100
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,550
"Are you the manager?", he says "Yes" so,

101
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,540
I said "I bought this earlier but..."

102
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,090
"...could you tell me if this is correct or incorrect?"

103
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,270
What kind of question is that??

104
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,270
Just in case, right?

105
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,270
He says "Huh?" opens it and notices...

106
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,270
"Ahhhhhhh!!..."

107
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,140
Yeah...

108
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,670
"We're sorry"

109
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,670
"Well, which is it, correct or incorrect?"

110
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,980
That's enough! Show mercy on him, he said "sorry"!

111
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,980
Well, I want to hear it.

112
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,860
"It's... incorrect"...

113
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,670
You made him say "It's incorrect"

114
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,910
I replied "That's right, right?"

115
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,640
I have the receipt here, I just bought it.

116
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,390
Oh really... and  then?

117
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,010
"Bye"... and I left.

118
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,270
No, wait, wait. You got a new one, right?

119
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,380
They insisted but I said "No thanks". And just went home.

120
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,240
I just wanted to tell them that.

121
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,690
That "You're wrong!"

122
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,420
Such an evil personality...

123
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,890
Why? They might make the same mistake with another person, right?

124
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,050
Refusing the new sandwich is... It's just nasty...

125
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
"Yeah!!"

126
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,500
Wait, wait, what do you mean by "Yeah!"??

127
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,700
You wanted them to owe you, so that you can demand stuff later, right?

128
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,410
What kind... What kind of stuff??

129
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,930
Something... like.... mmmm... small fries....

130
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,830
That's why...
