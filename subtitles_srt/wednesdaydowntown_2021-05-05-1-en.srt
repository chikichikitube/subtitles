00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,030
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,550
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,130
Kazutoyo Koyabu

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,700
It's Koyabu
-Thank you very much

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,590
So let's get right to the point

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,270
Have any of you here ever had to fake something for a show since you entered the industry?

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,080
Yeah, faked a lot

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,650
The best time was with a psychic medium

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,010
Doing a show in a place where there are rumors of ghosts

10
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,880
It was said that there was a ghost in a phone booth there

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,910
So we went to the phone booth

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,990
Then came a sound of jingling bells

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,560
They said it was the spirit's voice

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,150
But I realized it was the psychic hitting the side of the phone booth with small stones

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,930
I've learned since then

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,850
Psychic programs are just lies

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,370
That's what they do

18
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,640
Recently, regulations in the TV industry have become more and more strict

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,000
Fake information in a literal sense has all but disappeared

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,250
So, today I bring this hypothesis about such fraud

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:22,580
Artists who are required to participate in misleading TV shows can't help helping the program

22
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,030
Has this been done before?

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,880
Yes, a similar theory was done two years ago

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,490
This time it is a comprehensive upgrade, single-cut verification

25
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,870
Will the performers risk their lives for the sake of the show and blatantly mislead

26
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,660
In this era of various rules and regulations

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,910
Do they dare to cross the red line of moral degradation?

28
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,990
Emotions are strangely high.
-Does it still exist?

29
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,220
This time, I want to reveal the truth in broad daylight

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,950
Why are you so angry all of a sudden?
-Yeah

31
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,420
To sum up, next we will verify the taboo of fraud

32
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,200
Also, for businesses that borrow performers' names

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,370
No matter how unpleasant the content, will they accept if the pay is high enough?

34
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:29,000
Artists who are required to participate in misleading TV shows can't help helping the program

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,120
First of all, the first difficulty level 1 target is

36
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,730
The embodiment of tenderness

37
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,380
Ganbare Luya's Yoshiko

38
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,740
The stage for this validation is

39
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,220
Yoshiko and Shouinji introduce the stores they frequent

40
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,650
The fradulent program is set up in such a way

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,630
Why would you want to hear about the stores frequented by these two people?

42
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,890
So, we took a look at the stores Yoshiko frequented beforehand, but

43
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,410
The trip was accidentally double booked

44
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,210
Suddenly, she's informed that one of the stores is reserved for Shouinji

45
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,620
And is unable to participate in the location recording

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,700
So, we want to talk a little bit about it.
-OK

47
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,890
Stores frequented by Shouinji

48
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,370
Originally, there was one that wasn't possible, but we repeatedly negotiated

49
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,660
It took a lot of effort to get permission

50
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,250
A tough situation to say no to

51
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,390
She's told that one of Shouinji's choices was difficult

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,810
The suggestion is to present it as a shop that Yoshiko often goes to

53
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,210
Making for an embarrassing request

54
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,260
The shop that Shouinji often goes to

55
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,170
Would it be okay to present it as one of the places you regularly frequent?

56
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,990
Eh, I see, I see

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,980
Although a little surprised

58
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,140
The offer is accepted smoothly

59
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,420
It'd turn out like this

60
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,240
So

61
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,010
This place's speciality is tomato noodles

62
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,380
Understood

63
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,320
Have you ever eaten tomato noodles?

64
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,430
Never, I have never eaten tomato noodles

65
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,280
To sum up, Yoshiko knows nothing

66
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,570
What to do?

67
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,480
And she's told this is a confidential matter known only to the producer

68
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,210
It happens

69
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,220
Shouinji doesn't know either?
-No

70
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,260
Ah, I see

71
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,770
With none of the staff supposedly informed

72
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,240
The location shoot begins

73
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,770
This is the guest who frequents this restaurant

74
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,520
Hello, everyone I'm Koyuki

75
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,520
※Koyuki - Japanese actress

76
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,240
Sorry, sorry

77
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,580
A little bit low energy

78
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,840
Tormented by guilt, right?

79
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,160
I'm Koyuki

80
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,180
Welcome, Koyuki

81
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,800
First of all, the opening shot in the vicinity of the restaurant

82
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,340
So the first spot

83
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,250
I'll ask Yoshiko-san to take us to the store she usually goes to

84
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,680
Ah it's stuck on top!

85
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,670
The name of Shouinji still remains on the signboard and is roughly covered with stickers.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,550
A detailed operation

87
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,020
Please

88
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,120
No energy at all

89
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,780
Over there? This way?

90
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,300
No energy, no energy at all

91
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,870
Please

92
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,030
Next, Yoshiko leads the way to the restaurant

93
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,850
At the orders of the above

94
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,230
This is Ikejiri

95
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,750
Oh yes, it is Ikejiri

96
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,420
Searching desperately

97
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,720
Over there? This way or this way?

98
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,950
Desperately looking for tips from others

99
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,090
Realizing she forgot to consider which direction to head in

100
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,500
Yoshiko is unable to hide her wavering appearence

101
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,860
Who are you looking at?

102
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,310
So under the setting of going to a frequently visited place

103
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,620
The last thing that should have happened, happens

104
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,060
What?

105
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,010
Wow, loads of people!

106
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,410
They are going in the opposite direction

107
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,390
So, a way to turn around is needed

108
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,260
Is it on this road?

109
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,470
Right here

110
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,310
Wait a minute. Isn't this a convenience store?

111
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,330
Sorry

112
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,310
Joking, its actually over here

113
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,690
While being stupid, she turns around naturally

114
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,050
Very clever

115
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,340
Very skilled

116
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,940
Quick-witted!

117
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,540
Here, she tries had to remember the instructions show to her briefly

118
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,330
Finally, they arrive

119
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,830
Wow, this place looks great
-Yeah

120
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,940
This is it（DAIDAI）

121
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,060
After entering and sitting down

122
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,690
Soon, the recommended dish, tomato noodles, is served

123
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,690
But she's never had it

124
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,210
This is really delicious

125
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,240
When was the last time you ate it?

126
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,980
Recently...?

127
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,850
When unable to answer, just don't say anything

128
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,180
You have to say something!

129
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,870
Really should

130
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,710
Should answer straight away

131
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,320
To Yoshiko, who simply wants to escape

132
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,920
Next, enter the special recommendation!

133
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,540
She is continuously shown the former signs of Shouinji

134
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,730
Now...

135
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,690
The dishes supposedly recommended by Yoshiko will automatically appear

136
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,640
Eh? This!

137
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,540
Is it this?
-This is it

138
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,280
Is this a must order?
-Absolutely

139
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,510
The special recommended menu imposed on Yoshiko

140
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,600
Poor thing

141
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,400
With a load of chilli

142
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,470
What you see here is  punishment-level Mapo Tofu

143
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you finish this every time?

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,690
Yes
-Really?

145
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,810
Scared by the special recommended menu that she has never had before

146
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,340
Yoshiko's expression continues to fade

147
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,320
No energy at all

148
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,270
Is this something that anyone can eat?

149
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,180
Can you?

150
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,680
No problem

151
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,390
I see, so you're good at eating spicy food?

152
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,390
Indeed

153
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,910
Wow... sorry, the smell is in my nose its choking me

154
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,150
Such a small voice

155
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:09,260
This is...

156
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,440
So, she eats the spicy food despite not actually being able to handle it

157
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,320
That's tough

158
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,210
How is it?

159
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,850
This is it, it's delicious!

160
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,880
So loud!

161
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,850
Really is

162
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,250
This is the taste!

163
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,350
Ah, its just...

164
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,150
Is it hot?

165
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,930
It's hot, of course!

166
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,290
She's angry!

167
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,750
Under such stimuli

168
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,700
Yoshiko becomes unable to hide her anger towards the staff

169
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,220
Its natural

170
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,340
Thus, we reveal the plan

171
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,530
Do you know what show this is?

172
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,120
I often visit the…

173
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,270
We're actually Wednesday Downtown

174
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,700
Embarrassed

175
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,010
Bastards!

176
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,960
A normal reaction

177
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,370
What did you think when you were asked to lie?

178
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:23,270
This is how TV is

179
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,540
The next target for difficulty level 2 is...

180
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,920
Lalande's Nishida

181
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,550
The setting we prepared for him this time is

182
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,530
What'll happen this time
-Yeah

183
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,850
A program like "Sunday Kitchen"

184
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,070
It is scheduled to air on Sunday morning

185
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,320
This time, we want to make use of your high-level cooking skills in comparison to other comedians

186
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,520
Wait a minute, we're doing that!?

187
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,640
I don't do much cooking

188
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,430
Ah... Is that right?
-Yes

189
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,380
This is tough

190
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:12,210
If you search for comedians skilled at cooking, your name comes up

191
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,720
Really? Let me see

192
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,990
For dessert and stuff

193
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,730
It comes up with Nishida

194
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,690
Huh?

195
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,120
So wrong

196
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,100
This isn't Lalande's Nishida, its Sekenshirazu's Nishida

197
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,070
So, this time, the setup is that the staff made a mistake

198
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,250
And mistook Lalande's Nishida for

199
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,320
Sekenshirazu's Nishida, who likes cooking

200
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,010
Sekenshirazu?

201
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,980
Also comedians

202
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,540
Another duo with a "Nishida"

203
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,150
I'm sorry, I don't really know many comedian duos

204
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,540
Its fine, its fine

205
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:56,290
In such a way, Nishida is mixed up with someone not even of the same gender

206
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,840
At this point, the proposal is put forward

207
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,800
Could you pretend to be good at cooking?

208
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,610
Just for this show, is that ok?

209
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,060
Definitely not

210
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,180
Oh, really?

211
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,080
It's a cooking program

212
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,620
It doesn't matter because you can just follow the teacher's instructions
-Yeah

213
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,280
Ok, well, I guess its fine

214
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,390
So

215
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,080
Let's spend a good time together by cooking

216
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,770
Feels real

217
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,500
Although not known for cooking, he wears the clothes of a chef

218
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,940
And the program quickly starts

219
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,370
In the pre-cooking talk section, we intentionally let the discussion end hastily

220
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,950
Today, the dish we're making together is Acqua pazza

221
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,240
Acqua pazza...?

222
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,100
A dish he has never heard of before

223
00:11:53,100 --> 00:12:00,920
This time, they're making Acqua pazza, a dish with a very high threshold for novice cooks

224
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,920
An Italian fish stew

225
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,520
Doesn't understand a word of it

226
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:06,090
So, the materials in front of you can be used to your heart's content

227
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,060
Let's start cooking now!

228
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,160
Amazing...

229
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,280
He copies the process of the person next to him, beginning with washing his hands

230
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,870
Who am I, where am I, what am I doing, an empty brain

231
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:33,030
The amateur chef Nishida's fradulent battle begins

232
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,250
Unsurprisingly very unenthusiastic

233
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,620
If you lie, you'll lose energy, right?

234
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,360
Here, Nishida observes the taking of the main ingredient of Acqua pazza, snapper

235
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
But...

236
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,140
Okay, now what do we do?

237
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,900
Does Acqua pazza have to be made with snapper?

238
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,230
Or just any fish?

239
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,760
In such a way

240
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,630
He has no idea even what type of dish it is

241
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,580
Nishida, frozen in place, is overwhelmed by every move made

242
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,650
Poor thing

243
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,970
At this point

244
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,630
Can you make this dish with any kind of fish?
-Huh?

245
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,000
Can you make it with any kind of fish?

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,630
Oh, of course, in season fish is the best

247
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,750
So...

248
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,270
Instead of a big fish

249
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,890
He picks a small fish that looks easy to handle

250
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,220
But still doesn't know what to do

251
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,440
After that, in order not to miss the other's every move, he works at a sideways angle

252
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,850
But then, something unexpected happens

253
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,620
His view is blocked by the cameraman taking a close up of the food

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,090
He's unable to copy

255
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,920
Completely blocked

256
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,020
He moves immediately to try and change his view

257
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,990
However, he cannot escape the one-on-one camera coverage

258
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,300
He's doing nothing

259
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,130
Thus, he can only rely on hearing to cook

260
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,720
How can you cook by hearing?

261
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,400
Do you clean up as you go along?

262
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,260
Yes, it's usually done by the time the food is served

263
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,980
So, he also starts to clean up

264
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,200
And then, at the last minute...

265
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,920
He finally breaks through into the enemy's area

266
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,520
He's there, he's there, watching super closely

267
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,740
Done

268
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,660
The final result is revealed

269
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,730
Although not as good as the other person's dish...

270
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,610
It at least looks like something

271
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,970
You couldn't sell this

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,200
Here the truth is revealed

273
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,930
You've worked hard
-I have?

274
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,730
We are Wednesday Downtown
-Ah?

275
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,750
A sigh of relief

276
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,510
I was so scared, so scared

277
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,570
Great!

278
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,380
I've really never done this even once before

279
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,020
Acqua pazza, I thought it was pasta at first

280
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,660
I thought he was gonna make Italian...

281
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,580
But there was no pasta around anywhere

282
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,150
Finally, the verification of the difficulty level MAX

283
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,100
The target is

284
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,710
The goal is

285
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,930
The Mommy

286
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,300
I have a show to discuss with you

287
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,760
The MC of the show is Hamada
-Oh!

288
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,180
This time, it's a show where entertainers return to their hometown after a long time

289
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,870
The choice of Hamada as host doesn't match at all

290
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,490
A show full of warmth and fraudulence

291
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:05,230
There's one thing I'd like to discuss before we go on location

292
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,730
There's an issue with including family

293
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:17,670
Even if it's your own family, they can't be filmed because of restrictions

294
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,970
This is the setup

295
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,510
Oh, parents?

296
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,100
Going to shoot in homes now

297
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,580
It's tough because of coronavirus

298
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,160
So we need to discuss something

299
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,320
We'll prepare a detached house and pretend it's your old home
-Ok

300
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:44,510
And prepare a pair of extras to pretend to be your parents

301
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,900
For me?

302
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,930
A fake hometown and fake parents, Sakai's whole part will be completely fake

303
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,930
Unheard of super hardcore industry talk

304
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,860
The Mommy's two can't help but smile bitterly

305
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,630
You are called "Mommy" still, right?

306
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,780
Obviously called "Mommy" still ...

307
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,590
But my mother was on TV

308
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:14,560
There is a risk of exposure if someone sees and realizes

309
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,010
Yeah

310
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,000
Well, because it is a member of the general public, we can put a mosaic on the face

311
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,900
Ahhh I see

312
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,320
Indeed, if you put the mosaic on...

313
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,810
Is this kind of thing really possible?

314
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,440
Not the type to think to hard about something

315
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,380
The studio portion of the show will be recorded in three days

316
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,620
Hamada's people are aware

317
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,550
Hamada's name was brought up

318
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:44,060
This exterior part, if we don't do something about it...
-Wow, no...

319
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,840
Hamada's getting excited about the project

320
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,460
Hamada... I see....

321
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,540
Using MC Hamada as a strong backing

322
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,640
The staff pushes the messy negotiation forward hard

323
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,470
They'd definitely be afraid

324
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,270
They'd feel compelled to accept

325
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,600
I've heard that Hamada can be pretty scary

326
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,240
It seems that staff are afraid to disobey him

327
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,310
Indeed, that's right

328
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,750
So, if we refuse, it will cause a lot of trouble

329
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,420
Well, these things happen from time to time

330
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,970
Not even once has it been exposed

331
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,120
The TV industry is really like this

332
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,060
From time to time

333
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,700
Every now and then

334
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,780
Sometimes programs can't be completed without some trickery, so...

335
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:31,020
A reassuring image of an experienced fraud

336
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,380
Safe and secure

337
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,910
First, the fake parents are vetted

338
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,660
I want you to choose yourself

339
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,150
Like an audition?

340
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,800
And so, the director immediately calls in the extras

341
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,730
What can you say?
-Hey, wait a minute

342
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,810
I'm completely confused. What's going on now?

343
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:03,350
I... Anyway
-It's fake

344
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,770
Actually, it's not very important. It's just parents...

345
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,350
Yeah, and the mosaic, right?

346
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,750
It's just a report

347
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
This is airing in the daytime anyway

348
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,650
But this kind of thing usually gets exposed

349
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,000
No one will watch it

350
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,400
No way, Hamada's hosting it!

351
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,310
True

352
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,120
It's ok if we don't promote it... it's too late to pull out now

353
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:39,170
"If we don't promote it, we'll be able to get by without the fans noticing"

354
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,850
Says Sakai, who continues to talk to himself

355
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,690
At that moment

356
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,770
And so, the extras enter

357
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:18,060
Here are some alternate parents

358
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,650
You can choose the parents you like from them

359
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,450
Favorite parents?

360
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,380
Can we see the faces

361
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,230
So

362
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,960
Can I see? Sorry

363
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,250
Ah, similar

364
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,160
Ah, this one is pretty good

365
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,100
Surprisingly, he finds an extra who looks like his real mother

366
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,670
It feels like it will work.
-The same vibe...

367
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,000
But

368
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,200
And what about the father?

369
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,440
Father... is there only two choices for fathers?

370
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,010
How tall are you?
-179

371
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,320
Ah so tall, our family is very short

372
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,850
Is that so?
-I'm the tallest in our family

373
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,050
Well, if they are sitting down to shoot, it could be ok.
-Yes, indeed

374
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,220
Do some editing to adjust the height or something

375
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,240
Can you change height in post?

376
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,970
Can it be done?

377
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,640
Well...

378
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,030
I guess, post-editing, shrink him a little...

379
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,820
Then please choose one of these two

380
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,690
After being told that height can be adjusted by post-editing

381
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,720
The selection is complete

382
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:33,000
After which the "family" exchange information for 30 minutes

383
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,790
Finally, they visit Sakai's fake hometown

384
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,210
And a house studio prepared beforehand

385
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,240
Must be a weird mood in the car

386
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,920
Although it is a bit bad to say

387
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,480
Sometimes things like this are exposed

388
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,910
Has it happened?

389
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,400
Sometimes by other teams
-Hmm yes

390
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,040
If people like me that aren't used to it are involved then it could happen I guess

391
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,050
This will be very bad if it's exposed to Hamada, right?

392
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,250
If the forgery is exposed

393
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,290
No one on his side will tell him

394
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,690
It's been fine so far

395
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:10,960
In light of Hamada's dull senses, they were reassured

396
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,500
As long as you don't say anything yourself

397
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,320
It's something I'll take to my grave for sure.
-Thank you

398
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,520
Shortly after being reassured

399
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,910
So, here we are at...

400
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,080
The character's are wrong

401
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,590
The characters on the nameplate are wrong and the nameplate is just a piece of paper

402
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,140
Which shocks them both

403
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,190
What a crude forgery!

404
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,710
Is such a crude practice really possible?

405
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,120
However, everything that will be exposed will apparently not be shown

406
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,000
Believing this, they continue to shoot on location

407
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,430
It's too rough, right?

408
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,790
Ah, there's a dog

409
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,380
Yeah, did I not say?

410
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:12,940
Next is the Shiba Inu that he doesn't remember at all

411
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,830
His name is Genji.
-Genji?

412
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,290
Look, isn't he cute?

413
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,490
Because in shooting you can not simply muddle through

414
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,720
You have to get closer and get involved

415
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's because he's never met me before...

416
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,070
Scared of dogs

417
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,940
He's scary, sorry

418
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,660
That...

419
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,360
It's... it's been too long

420
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,320
Usually quiet?

421
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,050
Usually quiet, but there's a lot of people he doesn't know today

422
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,100
Nicely done

423
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:50,930
When a stranger calls a strange name, he will certainly bark

424
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,630
Genji（Real Name: Nana）

425
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,970
Uh... so

426
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,690
Can you take us to your room to have a look?

427
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,270
My room? No problem

428
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,020
Does he know where it is?

429
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,600
You can't get past it, can you?

430
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,100
Where is it?
-That one

431
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,190
Here

432
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,350
What?

433
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,750
I've missed this bag so much

434
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,600
Red schoolbag

435
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,290
Hey, what is this?

436
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,000
And so the shooting continued in the room full of traps

437
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,790
Opening the last room...

438
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,590
What's in there?

439
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,100
What room is this?

440
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,780
For some reason, its the waiting room at TBS with the leftover extras

441
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,840
That's weird. That's weird

442
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,550
Let them leave!

443
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,660
That now, this...

444
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,270
This room is a room that cannot be opened

445
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,280
Can't open?
-Can't be opened

446
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,070
Is it your parents room?

447
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,630
Parents... yes this is my parents room

448
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,270
My parents...

449
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:15,860
And so, the location shooting ended with the reunion of the impostor family

450
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,250
Well, thank you very much for giving birth to me

451
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,860
So embarrassing!

452
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,190
Wait, your mom is crying

453
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,090
Okay, OK, thank you all

454
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:34,270
With the finish, discussions about post-editing plans begin

455
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,010
It's a little bit confusing, some parts are too outrageous

456
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,570
The sailor suit uniform

457
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,080
How can that be dealt with?

458
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,780
Well, anyway, find a way to edit it

459
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,370
Sorry sorry sorry

460
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,290
What about your father's face?

461
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,720
I think its okay to not use the mosaic

462
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,090
No
-No?

463
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,520
The father is not so good
-Not so good?

464
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,620
Ok for the mom though?

465
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,250
No resemblance on the father's side

466
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,790
He's too tall

467
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,870
So much taller than my real father

468
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,110
What was said before about shrinking in post?

469
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,220
What is he saying?

470
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,080
If you can shrink him a lot...

471
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,560
At this point, we reveal the truth

472
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,990
What program were you told you were on today?

473
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,780
Today is "I'm Home, Mom"

474
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,480
In fact, this program is fake

475
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,170
Eh? Not "I'm Home, Mom"?

476
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,450
It's actually Wednesday Downtown

477
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,220
Eh? Wait a second...

478
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,590
Did you notice anything strange today?

479
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,130
Ah, seriously, this program faked too much

480
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,110
Saying "it's never been exposed once"

481
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,270
"Hamada's shows often have this kind of thing"

482
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,780
When the staff introduced themselves, they made it seem like they were professionals

483
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,560
Did you really believe that height can be modified in post?

484
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,450
Do I... I don't know so much about TV!

485
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
It's probably possible

486
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,600
You shouldn't ask us young artists who lack popularity to do this kind of thing

487
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,710
We'll really do anything we're told

488
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,410
In summary
They'll do anything

489
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,950
Seriously

490
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,080
Poor people!

491
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,120
How about it? What do you think?

492
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,960
Well, how to say...

493
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,550
The part of mankind called sin

494
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,460
These things happen

495
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,690
But this is could also be seen as being professional in a sense, right?
-That's true

496
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,360
Because it's to do with work, they take it seriously

497
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,520
The difference between professional and non-professional is here, right?

498
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,530
No, no, that's not the case

499
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,700
He's right

500
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,250
Look, now because of Youtube

501
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,830
The difference between professional and non-professional is a little unclear

502
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,290
Those who can fake are professionals, right?

503
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,820
That's not true, that's not true

504
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,740
I think if you look carefully, you can find some fakes on Youtube

505
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,310
But the last group of artists, The Mommy, had it tough

506
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,440
They were told it was Hamada's show...

507
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Hamada is the kind of person who would say the VTR was boring

508
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,410
"You can fake it, but make it interesting for me"

509
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,980
That's not the case!

510
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,010
That's his motto!

511
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,100
What the hell? It's not!

512
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,060
Let's welcome the next presenter

513
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,400
No no no...

514
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,730
It's FUJIWARA!

515
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,030
So

516
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,400
Once performers become famous

517
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,380
They will get lots of offers for business opportunities

518
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,890
What type of things?

519
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,320
Eh?

520
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,510
Clothing

521
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,130
Certainly clothing

522
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,190
Food

523
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,290
Barbecue restaurants

524
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,430
Stuff like colored contact lenses too

525
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,870
Yeah, i'm involved in that
-Oh really

526
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,400
I'm working on colored contact lenses and western-style clothes

527
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,620
Oh yeah

528
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,230
Is that a serious project?

529
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,440
It's seriously being planned

530
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,860
I've attended meetings and stuff

531
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,040
Really?
-Yes

532
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,270
Seriously

533
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,440
Yes
-What?

534
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,730
Isn't there that type?

535
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,710
What?

536
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,990
Just use the name for endorsement and nothing else
-I guess

537
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,040
So, how about this

538
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,660
I bring you a theory about entertainer endorsement

539
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,890
It's this:

540
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:14,200
No matter how unpleasant the content, will entertainer's endorse anything if the pay is high enough?

541
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,430
I see

542
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,310
Your ex-wife made that milk tea shop

543
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:24,410
She didn't make it

544
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,080
She didn't?

545
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,300
If she did, i'd say "wow"

546
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,510
So weird

547
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,450
Do it then i'll spit out a "wow"

548
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:43,130
No matter how unpleasant the content, will entertainer's endorse anything if the pay is high enough?

549
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,180
The initial target is

550
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,460
Teshima Yu

551
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,260
Maybe

552
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,780
Initially, her agent tells her about a restaurant

553
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,310
But no details are known yet

554
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:07,720
There is a restaurant endorsement job coming up

555
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,820
For me？
-Yes

556
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,890
What type?

557
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,860
We will talk about the details gradually

558
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,600
It seems the owner is a big fan of yours

559
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,850
Quite convincing

560
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,500
He wants to work with you

561
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,100
Are there really such people?

562
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,000
They want to try it out

563
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,370
Probably a big pervert

564
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,010
Highly probable

565
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,050
It doesn't feel like an ordinary person

566
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:35,810
Really?

567
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,950
Like weird fetishes or something

568
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,490
"That kind of guy is either a pervert or has weird fetishes"

569
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:49,500
Teshima has a deep understanding

570
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:54,400
I think I must give people a dirty kind of impression

571
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,940
So i'd like a simple and fresh store

572
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,470
Somewhere where women can easily enter

573
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,480
She wants a refreshing place

574
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,480
However, the name of the restaurant is...

575
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,810
"Yakiniku Teshima"

576
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,750
I think I've seen it somewhere before

577
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,410
Will she lend her names depending on the amount of money?

578
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,320
This...

579
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,370
So, a few days later

580
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,270
Discussions with a fake agency

581
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,440
Getting to the point

582
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,040
About planning a restaurant, have you ever thought about what kind of restaurant you want to plan?

583
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,550
If I go out to eat

584
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:49,120
Almost all the restaurants I go to are barbecue restaurants.
-Yakiniku restaurants?

585
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,790
It would be nice to plan the type of restaurant I like

586
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,060
The thing she likes, by chance, is yakiniku

587
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:04,000
So, the store's name is firstly put forward

588
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,940
Teshima Yu Catering Plan

589
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,970
Turn to the first page first

590
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:15,410
Ahhhhh so good
-Yes

591
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,770
Simple and straightforward

592
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,850
"Yakiniku Teshima"
-Yes

593
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,650
That's not the name of the restaurant, is it?

594
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,150
That's the name of the restaurant?

595
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,420
Ah, the name of the restaurant?

596
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,490
How about Yakiniku Teshima Yu?

597
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,490
Is it OK?

598
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,330
How to say... no, I'm happy.
-Ok

599
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,490
Happy and a little shy

600
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,140
The feeling of happiness and shyness

601
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,080
It would happen

602
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:45,430
Although a little concerned about the name of the store, it passes

603
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,110
Have you ever thought about how to do a barbecue restaurant?

604
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,250
The kind where you can go with a little privacy

605
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,950
A store with a slightly dark feel

606
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,150
It's impossible for you to go to "Yakiniku Yu Teshima" in disguise

607
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,030
Please turn to the next page

608
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,890
It's the design of the store
-Wow

609
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,650
The picture is pretty cute

610
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,460
What about? How does it look and feel
-It's cute!

611
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,770
It's not too fashionable so it has a welcoming feeling

612
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,270
I really like the atmosphere

613
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:17,240
This A plan seems to be consistent with her thoughts

614
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,830
Of course, the main attraction is coming

615
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,350
Plan B.
-Wait. Oh, okay

616
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,720
This is the Teshima design

617
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Is this the outside?

618
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,860
Yes, they are signs

619
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,850
Looks like its in Shin-Okubo

620
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,660
Hey, it's great
-Yes

621
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,200
This is inside? My photos

622
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,670
Yes

623
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:49,670
It's all Teshima Yu

624
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,120
"Delicious and cheap"

625
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,610
A and B are not at all similar

626
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,570
Yeah

627
00:33:55,050 --> 00:34:01,180
It's a little unsettling, it looks a little like a adult store, maybe a bit confusing

628
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,450
She said it

629
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,250
A little rude

630
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,170
Could be a bit embarrassing for the owner

631
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:10,500
In other words, it's like a customs-free store

632
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:16,480
So it seems she wont choose B

633
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:22,970
The choice of A will use up a lot of the budget
-Hmmm

634
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:29,510
This is a question of endorsement fees or planning fees

635
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:34,480
If you choose A, you can get about 30000 yen a month

636
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,890
B will require less money spent on publicity

637
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:46,860
So for this one you can get 500,000 yen per month

638
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,850
A huge difference

639
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,170
A blatant demonstration of how the pay gap works

640
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,870
This one seems to be a bit more suitable for the masses

641
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:00,340
Hey, it's bad!

642
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,010
A is maybe a bit too higher class

643
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,800
She heard the fee

644
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,520
How about choosing A?

645
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:15,330
Slowly, she changes her choice with impossible reasons

646
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,250
The second one is not normal at all

647
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,190
After re-considering

648
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:26,940
If we go with plan A, people may think i'm getting too cocky

649
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,440
I know

650
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,140
Then how about going ahead with plan B?

651
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,610
It's cute

652
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,770
It has a good feeling

653
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,680
Teshima, who is easily and superficially obsessed with money

654
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,860
At this point, she is left alone with her agent

655
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,120
What will they say?

656
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,400
It would have been better to go with A

657
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Indeed

658
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,470
But the pay is completely different

659
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,210
If we think about the future

660
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,680
It would be good for settling down

661
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
Yeah

662
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,880
Yeah

663
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,800
After confirming Teshima's thoughts

664
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,510
A is much better

665
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,840
Next

666
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,040
About the background music in the restaurant

667
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,190
In the case of program A, it's jazz

668
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,060
Please listen

669
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,060
So sad!

670
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,530
But you do often hear this kind of music being played

671
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,840
At trendy barbecue places

672
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,110
It's very good. It's an immersive feeling

673
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,940
This is the other

674
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:45,850
Teshima Yu♪ Teshima Yu♪ Yakiniku Teshima Yu♪

675
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,190
Ju Ju Ju (the sound of barbecue) One piece into the soul♡

676
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:53,160
What do you like? Barbecued ribs?

677
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,460
Or me? ♪

678
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,990
Custom-made

679
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,730
Awful

680
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,830
Teshima Yu♪ Teshima Yu♪ Yakiniku Teshima Yu♪

681
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,270
Will this keep going?

682
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:10,030
Yes, it'll loop

683
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,740
"Or me?" Is that ok?

684
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,810
Do you care about the lyrics?

685
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,110
Yeah

686
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:23,590
It doesn't seem like the background music of a restaurant

687
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,590
"Or me"...

688
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,750
But of course, in terms of renumeration

689
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:35,050
Scheme A is only used as is, so you will not be paid

690
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:40,170
Scheme B will give you an extra 100,000 yen per month

691
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:46,040
Which is better A or B?

692
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,510
B

693
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,980
I already remember it, its catchy

694
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,200
Be strong!

695
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:58,780
The rhythm is good, don't you think?

696
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,300
How!?

697
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,020
You've got a good thing going

698
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,470
It's pleasant to listen to

699
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,120
600,000 yen now

700
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,210
After that

701
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:13,010
For social media, you'll get 10,000 yen every 1000 likes

702
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,270
200,000 yen when introducing the name of the store on a TV program

703
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,870
Downtown DX

704
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:25,110
Those two will roll with the topic

705
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,850
Yes, they answer people's questions. Both are very kind

706
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:37,060
As all of the unpleasant proposals are accepted, a feeling of freshness is long gone

707
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:43,230
It ends up with a large contract totaling 1.22 million yen per month

708
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,450
So, the truth is revealed

709
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,350
So embarrassing

710
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,170
What the hell?

711
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,880
I'm scared, what is it?

712
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,720
Th-that, what?

713
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,020
Something happened, right?

714
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,650
We are Wednesday Downtown
-Wow!

715
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:09,860
"No matter how unpleasant the content, will entertainer's endorse anything if the pay is high enough?"

716
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,300
if it's between 30,000 yen and 500,000 yen

717
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,170
You'd choose the 500,000 yen one, of course

718
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,540
Those signs

719
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,570
Those are used in the adult places, right?

720
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,160
And so, we know that Teshima is unfortunately not resistant to money

721
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,900
Next is an additional verificaiton

722
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,020
The target is

723
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,930
Nana Suzuki, who has ranked 1st in popularity lists before

724
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,950
She's risen?

725
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,550
I definitely wouldn't do it

726
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,200
I might

727
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,740
I still need to work harder

728
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,970
Yahagi~ Yahagi~

729
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,500
That would be even worse

730
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,910
I'd refuse that just out of embarrassment

731
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,980
Here, the plan is also discussed in advance

732
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,620
My favorite is yakiniku

733
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,430
The same as Teshima Yu, she hopes to run a yakiniku place

734
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,730
Please turn to the next page

735
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,490
"Yakiniku Nana Suzuki"
-Yes

736
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:23,070
Oh, yakiniku, i'm so happy!

737
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,840
Is the name of the restaurant "Yakiniku Suzuki Nana"?

738
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,110
Yes
-Awesome

739
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,070
That's great.
-What do you think?

740
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:36,580
How is it? It's clear and easy to understand

741
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,900
Store name tentatively adopted

742
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,050
Please turn to the next page

743
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,550
Super chic
-Thank you

744
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,190
Very fashionable
-Thanks

745
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,990
I like it
-The vibe?

746
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,160
I like it

747
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,030
Please turn to the next page

748
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,030
Another option has been prepared

749
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,830
Eh? What is this?

750
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,500
This is too much, right?

751
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,540
This is a design that completely highlights Nana Suzuki

752
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,200
It fits Teshima Yu's persona at least

753
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,610
I'm glad, but..

754
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:10,510
I feel a like it won't do so well

755
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,320
I think its a bit unapproachable

756
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,550
She said it

757
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,470
Indeed

758
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,160
Well, I think it will fail

759
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,160
Suzuki Nana shows clear disapproval of this look

760
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,480
A normal reaction

761
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,270
Regarding your fee

762
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,200
If Option A is used

763
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,010
It will use a lot of the budget

764
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,200
Yes, I understand

765
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:40,040
We can give you about 30,000 yen per month, 30,000 per store

766
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:46,810
The initial cost of B is not much
-Ok

767
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:50,720
So you can get 500,000 yen per month for this one

768
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,990
So much difference
Yes, every month

769
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,560
Is the difference really that big?
-Yes

770
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:01,630
After all, its a comprehensive use of your image and name
-I see

771
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,130
That's what it is

772
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,260
Ah, just give it a go!

773
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,440
That was fast
Super fast

774
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:15,480
But, the menu is cheap. If it's cheap and tasty, people will come in, right?

775
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
I think people will come
-Agreed

776
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,290
Said herself it looks like it will fail

777
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,950
After all, it is a ready-made store

778
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,350
I choose B
-Okay, I see

779
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,290
Thank you

780
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,770
Quick decision!

781
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,480
Next, the background music

782
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:34,480
Nana Suzuki♪ Nana Suzuki♪ Yakiniku Nana Suzuki♪

783
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,800
Ju Ju Ju (the sound of barbecue) One piece into the soul♡

784
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,770
Is it beef tongue you like? Grilled ribeye?

785
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,570
Or me?♪

786
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,580
Awesome

787
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,310
How about this one?

788
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:51,210
People eating will feel tired, right?

789
00:42:51,750 --> 00:43:00,460
It's like one of those advertising trucks going around Shibuya

790
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,630
Correct answer

791
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:08,800
For Option A, you will not be paid monthly

792
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,790
Plan B will give you 100,000 yen per month

793
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,440
A big difference

794
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:22,140
Option B is more compatible with store B. I choose option B
-Got it

795
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:27,080
How about a discount when you play this music
-Good idea!

796
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,990
Personal proposal of a discount program

797
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,960
Suzuki ends up with a full package of 1.22 million yen per month

798
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:44,330
The truth is revealed

799
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:44,330
Whoa, what's going on!

800
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,510
How could she also do this

801
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,900
Thus we explain the project

802
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,610
So annoying!

803
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:54,210
Really, really annoying

804
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:57,180
What will people think of this?

805
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,320
What if my work is reduced?
How much work do you have now?

806
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,020
I can't make it work if I have less than I already do now

807
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,520
It is really unimaginable

808
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,360
In summary
The next challenge is Yakiniku Asahi Nao

809
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,860
What do you think?
-So scary

810
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,070
Can people change like this?

811
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,070
Is it possible to switch so easily?

812
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,870
Women of that rank...

813
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,520
At the stage of planning, wouldn't producers voice their opinions?

814
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,200
This is better and so on

815
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,080
Up until there i thought it was ok...

816
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:37,520
They wouldn't let their people just do whatever they want, right?

817
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,090
I guess

818
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,400
But how about if this kind of opportunity really came to you

819
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,960
Would you go along with it?

820
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:50,100
Honestly, Wednesday Downtown is a show that is using someone's name

821
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,220
Downtown's
Really?

822
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,220
Using the Downtown for fraudulent purposes

823
00:44:58,240 --> 00:46:14,780
