Laying Eggs

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,780
Today is our wedding day

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,340
Yuuko-chan is late

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,140
Koji-san!

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,660
Yuuko-chan!

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,140
I'm sorry

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,980
You're late Yuuko-chan!

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,980
You look so pretty Yuuko-chan!

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,220
Thank you Koji-san

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,660
My parents almost found out

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,380
Is it OK?

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,980
OK, let's start our wedding day

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,380
It's just us two

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,740
Yes, but can't be helped

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,420
Oh, one ring is missing

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,580
Koji-san it's under there

18
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,100
OK

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,780
Let's have our wedding kiss

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,780
It's Fish man

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,980
Hey! Where are you Fish man?!

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,540
Damn

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,460
Where are you?

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,860
Hey!

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,780
You're bothering us on our wedding day!

26
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,660
Let me give birth

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,700
Koji-san

28
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,700
You OK?

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,700
I'm OK
- OK?

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,140
Don't get married with this strange dressed lady

31
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,620
We couldn't afford anything better,
but you're beautiful Yuuko-chan

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,900
I chose it myself!

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,700
Hey, leave! Leave now!

34
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,740
What? What is this Wedding day?

35
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,700
This type of wedding... can't beat an "8 peoples" wedding

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,460
What are you saying?

37
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,300
What is an "8 peoples" wedding?

38
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,540
Yeah

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,500
You're in the way, just leave!

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,260
Huh?

41
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,740
Please break up

42
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:16,980
Hey

43
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,060
Break up with me

44
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,220
When did we ever date?

45
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,460
When did we 2 ever date?

46
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,420
Huh?

47
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,660
I'm going to lie, I'm going to lie from now

48
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,100
You raped me!

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,260
You told a lie, right?

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,860
Why are you so surprised?

51
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,580
You said you were going to lie, right?

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,700
Oh, yeah

53
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,940
It's not "Oh yeah"

54
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,300
Why did you come here? Leave!

55
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,260
What so good about this girl... leave her

56
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,700
What did you say!

57
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,020
OUCH! OUCH! OUCH!

58
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,940
Please stop! Everyone did you see it?!

59
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,780
You're over-reacting

60
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,020
It wasn't anything

61
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,500
Yeah, what are you saying

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,860
You're disgusting

63
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,660
... how can he die?

64
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,580
Yeah

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,940
Ha.. there's no way you can kill me

66
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,820
Damn

67
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,740
But!

68
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,380
If 2 people love each other in a church

69
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,620
And can forget about their embarrassment
while dancing like an octopus

70
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,500
My ugly self will turn into a skeleton

71
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,060
There you go Yuuko-chan

72
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,980
He will become a skeleton

73
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,300
Do you really think so?

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,220
It's OK, dancing like an octopus is
easy, just make your lips like this

75
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,580
Stop!

76
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,980
He's turning into a skeleton

77
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,940
You're right!

78
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,340
OK.. Yuuko-chan.. forget about your embarrassment

79
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,980
Let's do the octopus dance

80
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:43,940
OK

81
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,220
Let's start

82
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,860
"Octopus, octopus, octopus dance"

83
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,700
"I am an octopus, octopus"

84
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,660
Hey

85
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,500
Why are you taking pictures?

86
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,380
Shouldn't it be a video

87
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,060
Why are you so quiet?

88
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,580
You told us that if we did the Octopus
dance you would turn into a skeleton

89
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,580
You lied!

90
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,900
If you get married to her, what will you do about this baby?

91
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,620
I have nothing to do with that baby

92
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,340
Listen to this child's message!

93
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,580
What's the message?

94
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,980
You both close your eyes and listen to this child's message!

95
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,820
Will I understand if I hear the message?

96
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,300
Yeah

97
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,220
You...

98
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,420
Close your eyes!

99
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,820
Yuuko-chan let's listen to the message

100
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,500
OK

101
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,300
I'm glad (censored)

102
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,260
Hey!

103
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,420
We can't broadcast that kind of language!

104
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,020
Let's go

105
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,580
Wait!

106
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,580
Use the "peeeep" sound!
