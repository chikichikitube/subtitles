1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,810
The 4th time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arehende!

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,490
Let's Play World Tabletop Games!

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,620
Tanaka was really looking forward to this

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,560
He's seriously enthusiastic about it

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,530
Am I totally in charge of this series now?

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:21,400
Matsumoto            Hamada

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:21,400
Hosei                      Endo                     Tanaka

8
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,860
I mean you came in at a totally different time

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,030
I heard you went to the Kojimachi studio early

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,040
To Kojimachi?

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,600
I went there from my house because it was nearby

12
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,610
Tanaka learned the rules from experts already

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,740
I arrived early to learn the games

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,380
There's new games again?

15
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,280
All new games have been brought in, they'll be fun

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,920
If Tanaka's so stoked for this, let him do it by himself!

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,780
I'm really not that stoked

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,150
A lot of them are from cold places aren't they?

19
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,420
A lot of European games...

20
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,360
A lot of indoor games

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,560
They're all games you can play in your home

22
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,260
I want to play some outdoor games

23
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,170
There's a Japanese one too

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,400
There's a lot of card games too

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,540
That's true there's a lot of cards

26
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,680
I've actually bought some of these games

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,410
Eh? Do you play with your family?

28
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,810
Yes

29
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,680
Eh?!

30
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,580
Eh?

31
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,920
Doesn't your family hate you?

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,220
What? No, they don't hate me

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,990
Really?

34
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,160
I heard your daughter doesn't talk to you

35
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,660
That's just because of puberty

36
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,090
Oh really?

37
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,630
That can't be helped

38
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,500
She must not play with you then

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,500
Actually I've managed to get her to play

40
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,870
She listens to music while we play

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,940
She's not focusing on the game at all!

42
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,640
But she's still playing with us

43
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:40,310
This is a non-profit sub by a fan for fans

44
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:40,310
This sub is provided as is with all errors

45
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,450
The first game is from Canada "Bellz!"

46
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,020
There's a magnet inside of this

47
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,190
You use it to pick up your color's bells

48
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,330
It's a pretty simple game

49
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,030
The larger side's magnet is strong

50
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,170
While this side is weak

51
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,870
Alright lets go around the table in order

52
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,000
Endo: Gold

53
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,270
That's bad

54
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,280
You got them all

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,080
I'm pretty sure that's wrong

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,150
You can't take other color bells

57
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,080
What the heck, you got three too many

58
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,050
Are you an idiot?

59
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,820
You didn't even use the big side but

60
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,290
The magnetic force was still too strong

61
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,950
It's surprisingly difficult

62
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,860
I'm green?

63
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,790
Hamada: Green

64
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,720
Is that one really okay?

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,660
It's fine isn't it?

66
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,730
The first one is pretty hard isn't it

67
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,900
Ahh, one's stuck in the middle

68
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,730
Is this even possible?

69
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,000
It's possible, it's definitely possible

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,130
Oh it's my turn

71
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,370
So I'm pink right?

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,240
Matsumoto: Purple

73
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,610
Is it even possible to get a pink one?

74
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,610
Look this is how you do it

75
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,010
Yep, no good

76
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,520
But I was pretty close right!?

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,520
Well, yes, I suppose so

78
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,120
Is this even possible?

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,750
Is this possible, seriously

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,750
This is really hard

81
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,620
It's possible

82
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,460
Can I try now Tanaka?

83
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,560
Housei: Blue

84
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,090
Go ahead

85
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,860
Well we won't get anywhere if we don't try

86
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,600
Wow, amazing!

87
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,800
He actually did it?

88
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,540
Now what?

89
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,640
Now it's Endo's turn

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,010
Okay

91
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,940
Those are yours Hosei

92
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,280
Do you play this every week?

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,380
Endo: Gold

94
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,420
Ooh, not bad

95
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,520
Like this right?

96
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,260
But if I don't take it I can keep going?

97
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,690
Yes, you can take it or keep going

98
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,330
For now I'll just take it

99
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,690
Wait what color am I again?

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,730
Hamada, you're green

101
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,830
Oh green

102
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,700
That's definitely no good

103
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,140
How many times will you repeat the same mistake!

104
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,470
Are you an idiot!?

105
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,470
No I thought I could do it

106
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,010
What color am I again?

107
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,410
Matsumoto you're purple

108
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,990
Matsumoto: Purple

109
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,450
Ah okay okay

110
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,950
That's pretty lucky

111
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,950
There's one on its own

112
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,020
Of course

113
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,930
Why don't you try for another one?

114
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,290
That one's definitely possible

115
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,060
Oh well done!

116
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,070
That one's probably possible too

117
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,640
Ah

118
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,770
That was scary

119
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,210
It just turned towards me

120
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,880
It was just like "Eh?"

121
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,080
You can do it, you can do it

122
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,850
It just turns towards me

123
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,950
And it's like "What!?" but I was going for a different one

124
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,020
This one's big

125
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,020
Is it possible?

126
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,830
Whoa!

127
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,800
Okay okay okay

128
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,730
That was pretty skillful

129
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,070
Alright I'm stopping here!

130
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,400
Three is good I think

131
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,870
Now I'm winning right!?

132
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,970
No it's a tie

133
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,040
No look, Hosei's are smaller

134
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,610
Oh you're right

135
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,480
Eh, is that how it works?

136
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,250
The size of the bells matters?

137
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,180
No they're worth the same points

138
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,890
Ehh??

139
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,290
The point is controlling the magnetic force

140
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,990
I can get these two probably

141
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,170
Well done!

142
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,400
That surprised me...

143
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,900
The four of them kept getting bells

144
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,170
Amazing!

145
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,840
What the heck

146
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,810
Cool!

147
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,710
You could probably do it with the bigger side

148
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,680
The bigger side?

149
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,780
Ooh Nice!

150
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,290
Oh I want to do that, that was cool

151
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,520
That one is definitely possible

152
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,460
Which one? This one? Really?

153
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,530
You're right it's separated

154
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,500
Here comes a fugly one

155
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,200
An uninvited fugly is coming

156
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,200
Amazing

157
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,610
He did it

158
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,870
Alright this is enough for now

159
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,880
Suddenly he's back in the running

160
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,580
It's pretty hard for me now

161
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,250
You can get that one over there

162
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,480
That one right

163
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,460
It wants to come too

164
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,460
A fugly is trying to come too

165
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,600
I didn't even ask for her

166
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,930
"Let's go back together"

167
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,370
You go back first!

168
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,100
She can't read the mood

169
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,740
"My place is pretty close by", that's not the point!

170
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,810
That's how it is

171
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,780
JUST GO HOME BY YOURSELF!

172
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,020
Geez

173
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,690
Endo, you're going for another? That one's pretty dangerous

174
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,630
That one huh

175
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,700
It looks like she'll come over by herself

176
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,500
Try calling her over by herself

177
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,040
You won't do anything bad anyway

178
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,340
Just do it quickly

179
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,280
I mean honestly

180
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,580
In times like these, I'd never doing anything improper

181
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,960
There's not enough magnetic force

182
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
It's cause the bell's too big

183
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,290
Yeah that's why

184
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,960
Eh? You're ending your turn?

185
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm ending it

186
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,670
But that's still pretty good. He's got 7

187
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,670
This one is okay right?

188
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,210
Alright, nice

189
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,070
Hamada's pretty fast at this

190
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,010
Uh oh, that's looking a little loose Hamada

191
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,580
But the other side is still fine

192
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,020
You say the other side, but this is impossible

193
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,150
With your talent power it's possible

194
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,090
No way, no way

195
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,460
Now you're in the lead Hamada

196
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,260
Hamada, Endo, and Hosei are all in the lead with 7

197
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,430
This one's possible too

198
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,670
You can do it

199
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,710
I've met up with this girl several times already

200
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,810
Then she should come to you real quick

201
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,050
Can we stop this conversation!?

202
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,950
You're the one who started it!

203
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,850
This is definitely bad

204
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,720
This is just a game about getting bells

205
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,420
I'm sorry but it's just a game about getting bells

206
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,190
It became a nasty game while we were playing!

207
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,830
You can't play this game with your family!

208
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,730
No it's just bells

209
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,930
I can't play this with my daughter!

210
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,860
No it's just a game about getting bells!

211
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,740
The final results are in, Hosei wins!

212
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:57,080
The next tabletop game is from Germany: "Grab It!"

213
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,490
The objective is to take the cards matching the dice

214
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,660
A simple game except for one thing...

215
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,990
There's a lot of interesting games from Germany

216
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,190
Yeah, kinda similar to Japan

217
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,230
So small!

218
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,830
Damn these are small, I can't really see them

219
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,100
You can't see these?

220
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,570
I'm a bit worried

221
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,000
It's fine

222
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,100
I'm a bit worried

223
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,480
You're just messing around though

224
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,950
Tanaka sorry but, I can't see the dice

225
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,850
You can't see these?

226
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,480
I'm worried about those too actually

227
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,620
I'm worried, y'know the colors are kind of

228
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,050
If you can't these then this game is

229
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,950
Pretty much impossible

230
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,760
It's pretty much impossible

231
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,920
Seriously?

232
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,660
Is being unable to see bad?

233
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,200
If you can't see then none of the games will be fun

234
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh really

235
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,670
Alright then, let's play is like they do on the show Arashi

236
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,340
Yeah, all five of us playing it together

237
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,710
The fire mark means that you can't take any cards

238
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,080
Let's start

239
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,450
I can hardly see

240
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,830
I don't see the green one

241
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,260
Is that all of them?

242
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,300
How many cards are there?

243
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,400
Oh there's five

244
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,400
There's five cards

245
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,410
Wait why are there five cards?

246
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,110
Ah, there's two heart cards

247
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,910
This is fine

248
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,910
So the round is over?

249
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,710
Yes, now we roll again

250
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,980
It's gonna heat up from now on as there are fewer cards

251
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,120
Okay, you're out!

252
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,820
Why?

253
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,960
Because there's a flame

254
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,720
What does that mean

255
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,530
You're an idiot

256
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,190
Such an idiot

257
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,100
When a flame is rolled you can't take anything

258
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,130
None of them?

259
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,900
It was the first thing you were told

260
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,740
I already hate this game

261
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,680
Ehh, hang on a second

262
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,080
Why did you take it from me

263
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,150
What is that

264
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,250
What even is that

265
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,250
Which one

266
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,350
The pink one, what is it, a pig?

267
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,160
The pink one I already grabbed

268
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,060
That was the one you tore out of my hands

269
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,590
No I didn't tear it out

270
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,560
I don't think there are anymore

271
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,560
That's all of them

272
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,730
That's it right? They've all been taken right?

273
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,940
Are you even looking to see if we made a mistake?

274
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm looking

275
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,710
You're definitely not!

276
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,580
You're not checking at all, seriously

277
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,980
You're frantically checking the cards right now!

278
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:48,750
The next game on Let's Play World Tabletop Games is-

279
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,420
"The Mind" is a German game

280
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,130
It's a cooperative psychological game

281
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,740
You play the cards from 1-100 in ascending order, "The Mind"

282
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,640
In addition, there's one important rule, that is-

283
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,210
You can't talk

284
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,580
You can't say what your card is but

285
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,710
For example, if you had the 100 card

286
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,380
You're not going to play it any time soon

287
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,650
You'll hold on to it until the end

288
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,760
So you can wait for a while

289
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,720
And signal that you're going to hold

290
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,030
Alright let's play

291
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,300
It's subtle but difficult

292
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,800
Can we look now?

293
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,800
Yes

294
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,110
Aaand start

295
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,700
If you think it's okay you should just play it right?

296
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,070
Well of course

297
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,970
Just play that immediately

298
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,210
It's still so low

299
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,180
He's still worried?

300
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,550
It goes up to 100 so

301
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,900
This is good, this is good

302
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,570
Remaining are Matsumoto Hamada Endo

303
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,380
The eye contact is very important

304
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,380
Yeah, that's true

305
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,550
I want you to sense what I'm feeling

306
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,720
I want you to read my expression

307
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:13,360
Probably if I played my card it wouldn't be right so

308
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,640
Are you serious?

309
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,670
I mean it goes up to 100 right?

310
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,040
100. From 1 to 100

311
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,410
Alright, if that's the case then

312
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,790
Did that really just happen?

313
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,260
Did that really just happen?

314
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,560
Such a small difference

315
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,000
I didn't realize this could happen

316
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,270
This is pretty unbelievable

317
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,940
You wouldn't play it

318
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,680
Matsumoto and Hamada, off by one, fail the challenge

319
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,950
2nd Attempt

320
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,450
Now then

321
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,960
Let's start

322
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:48,090
Remaining are Hosei Matsumoto

323
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,530
He's serious huh

324
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,600
We just have to have to believe him

325
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,300
If he's gonna go that far

326
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,930
The Mind - 2 Card Version Challenge

327
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,960
That was good wasn't it?

328
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,100
The Mind - 2 Card Version

329
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,570
2 cards is pretty tough

330
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:40,340
There's 100 cards so there's 90 cards in-between us

331
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,630
Without further ado, let's start

332
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,970
Play that immediately!

333
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,940
There was a chance, there was still a chance!

334
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,110
No there wasn't!

335
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,320
There's always a chance in this world!

336
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,880
What the hell!

337
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,190
There's no such thing as 100% in this world!

338
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,460
There is! This was 100% certain!

339
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,860
The deck starts at 1!

340
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,390
He got me so concerned about the first card

341
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,430
My heart was pounding

342
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,530
If this bit failed

343
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,530
it wouldn't have been funny at all

344
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,140
The timing was really difficult

345
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,770
I got so scared when he slid the card

346
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,710
Ah right, wait a minute

347
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,460
Well this stuff happens too doesn't it

348
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,070
Amazing

349
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,730
I was worried

350
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,270
You're already done

351
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,770
For now we're safe, incredible

352
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,890
Again?

353
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,420
Off by one again?

354
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,890
You should've played it!

355
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,130
Well I kinda understand

356
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,790
45 is way too big

357
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,260
You should've played it

358
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,830
The tension had risen so high

359
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,100
But I was waiting for something around 30

360
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,010
Let's go again

361
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,110
Again? Another go at the 2 card version

362
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,640
It was going so well

363
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,440
Yeah, starting from 1

364
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,480
2nd Attempt

365
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,480
Will they clear it this time?

366
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,650
This is so simple but it's fun

367
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,900
Now, let's start

368
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,350
It took some courage to play that

369
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,020
Indeed, to play an 11 at the start

370
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,400
There's no way right?

371
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,930
This hurdle...

372
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,730
We've overcome this hurdle

373
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,100
This is good, well done

374
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,210
Let's go. Have some courage

375
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,130
I've done it. We're clear

376
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,300
It's here, he's in the zone

377
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,140
He's entered the master state

378
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,750
The order is even stranger now

379
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,850
He's in the master state but...

380
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,270
Being unable to speak is tough isn't it

381
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,740
Just go

382
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,870
Have some courage

383
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,220
You passed

384
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,350
What about the master

385
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,050
He's still focused

386
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,020
He's still in the master state

387
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,020
He's been focused the whole time

388
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,090
I really want us to win

389
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,300
The master still isn't ready

390
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,870
I hope this is okay, I'm doing it

391
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,610
It passed, he's through

392
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,550
Okay okay okay, only 3 more cards

393
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,790
It's like he's sitting, waiting for his make-up

394
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:02,190
He doesn't have make-up on

395
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,190
and he's waiting for it to be applied

396
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,760
He changed much faster this time

397
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,330
Right? He changed much faster this time

398
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,100
It's just these two

399
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,440
Yes, it's just them

400
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,940
Alright then, I'm gonna surprise you a bit

401
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,390
Did it pass?

402
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,660
Come on!

403
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
Master!

404
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,760
I still had these, I totally should have been the master

405
00:23:33,660 --> 00:24:09,960
Translation - Tekno        Typesetting - Teknova
Timing - Teknonavi         QA - TeknoProasheck
Consulting - fubintien

406
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,530
I didn't think he had two cards in the 90s

407
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,730
It's absolutely possible

408
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,400
Two cards in the 90s, why would I think that

409
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,210
That's why I said that I should've been the master not you

410
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,850
Then you should've just become the master

411
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,010
I was totally the master

412
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,290
Midway you guys started saying master master,
I didn't understand at all

413
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,260
And then you started talking about make-up

414
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,930
But we got pretty close
