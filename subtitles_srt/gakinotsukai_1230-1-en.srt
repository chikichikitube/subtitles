00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:07,960
Tonight's Gaki no Tsukai: The 3rd installment of the Nostalgic Song Drive!

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,000
Whenever ANYTHING happened they would make us all sing this song

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,000
In this series, they drive while listening to songs they have memories about

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,030
However today is a rainy day

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,760
It's rare isn't it? There's usually no rain on Gaki

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,930
That's true

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,760
Yes, Gaki is rather lucky when it comes to weather

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,230
On the "No Laughing Series" too

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,460
On "No Laughing", there's a lot of trade professionals right?

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,900
There's some messed up folks in their ranks too

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,600
Rain Men

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,530
TN: Rain Man means someone unlucky who makes it rain when they show up

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,460
There's a lot of rain men

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,060
Messed up?

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,260
There's gotta be like 70 of them

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,730
There's like 100 staff members right?

17
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,860
I think even more

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,860
More?

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,160
Hamada, are your hemorrhoids alright?

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,800
I haven't gotten the surgery yet

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,330
Actually I too, I've got a straight up reserve army waiting

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,410
Both of you have hemorrhoids?

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,710
A straight up reserve army in waiting

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,460
If they break out, I might have to get surgery too

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,300
What do you mean "a straight up reserve army"?

26
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,500
They're not hemorrhoids right?

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,330
Nah, they're almost, they're becoming like hemorrhoids

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,830
Oh really

29
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,960
When you get tired they break out?

30
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,560
Yeah

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,830
So on "No Laughing" there must be a lot

32
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,360
I've heard there's actually a lot of hemorrhoid-comedians

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,030
I've heard a lot about hemorrhoid-comedians,

34
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,360
But the top of the pyramid is Hamada-san

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,460
I'm at a rather low position

36
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,460
Please raise your rank

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,900
It's so annoying

38
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,900
It's so annoying

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,430
TKO Kinoshita, and I think Kosugi from Black Mayonnaise too

40
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,660
Oh yeah Kosugi too

41
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,400
I've heard when it gets really bad he places a napkin there

42
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,660
Kosugi is known for hemorrhoids

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,230
His pants chafe him so he places a napkin

44
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,960
I thought "I wanna avoid that"

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,330
They say it looks like the crest of a chicken

46
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,400
Woah, really?

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,400
No no, that's a different type

48
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,410
They're an anal fistula
Anal fistula?

49
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,200
They're not the same as piles or fissures

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,130
They happen in a different place

51
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,460
Seperate from the anus?!

52
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,900
Yes, in inside the anus

53
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,330
It's a hole in a different place,

54
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,830
Inside the anus!

55
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,000
So there's like a tear there

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,430
Around the anus

57
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,430
Ow!

58
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,800
Why does that happen? Lack of hygine?

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,000
That's pretty rude

60
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,000
No

61
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,910
Well I do think it's rude, but,

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,910
That's not why idiot

63
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,060
It's cause they worked hard for Yoshimoto

64
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,720
It's cause they worked hard to grow Yoshimoto from a tiny little agency

65
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,900
Matsumoto-san. Today we're on a drive

66
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,660
Yes

67
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,060
Yes today...

68
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:02,830
Last time we listened to everyone's nostalgic songs, but this time is different Matsumoto-san

69
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,530
That's right

70
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:13,210
This time, everyone will record themselves at home, singing the song acapella by themselves

71
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:20,310
Recording using those nostalgic cassette tapes, really singing all by ourselves

72
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,360
They gave us really difficult homework this time didn't they?

73
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,860
For this drive, they'll listen to acapella renditions of songs they recorded by themselves at home

74
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:36,860
"Because of this digital age, listen to my analog recorded song"! Music Memory Drive Start!

75
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,330
So everyone sang a song they liked,

76
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,800
Well speaking of songs we liked Matsumoto-san...

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,030
Most of us recorded 4

78
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,800
Yes, I did 4

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,700
That's true, I did too

80
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,130
Look at this please!

81
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,760
There's so many

82
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,910
They gave me the big one, the case is different

83
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,910
The case is different!

84
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,160
Is that from a past first date?

85
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,500
He's very enthusiastic

86
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,030
He's very enthusiasitc

87
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,930
Someone put a tape in when we get on the highway

88
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,730
Should the driver put his in?

89
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:12,200
Ah should I start then?

90
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,030
Let's listen now

91
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,100
Even putting the casette in...

92
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,500
Very nostalgic

93
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,560
It was nostalgic recording it

94
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,560
It was!

95
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,760
Enough to make you die....

96
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,460
So serious all of a sudden

97
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:38,700
Suffering and Sadness, Two or One of those feelings

98
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,930
This is Nagabuchi Tsuyoshi right?

99
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:48,100
Everyone, from here or there, burdens themselves with it

100
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,500
Stay Dream, it's a famous song

101
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,360
It's not a single right? It's from an album

102
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,230
Yes, from an album

103
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,330
The album Stay Dream

104
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes I've heard Stay Dream

105
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:56,000
Even if you sit down and try to block, the answer is Nothing

106
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,000
He's good

107
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,430
Ah, thank you

108
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,060
Enough to blow it away

109
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:13,500
Anger or Frustation, one or two of those things

110
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,250
We have to listen to this?

111
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,230
That's what this episode is about

112
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,330
This is what it's supposed be like

113
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,730
It's supposed to be like this

114
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,930
We're not saying this song is bad, but you could have picked a more upbeat song for the first one!

115
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,700
That's true

116
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,400
It may be a famous song, but maybe something more up-tempo would be better

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,800
Ah, that's true, actually

118
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:40,700
Don't get so glum

119
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,600
The voice is really coming through

120
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,530
You're at least singing loudly. You were by yourself too.

121
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,730
That's true, I did this in the living room in the evening I think. Around 5pm.

122
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,830
I thought it would be bad to sing so loudly at night,

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,180
So I did it in the evening

124
00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:03,630
We're all stuck in this endless maze

125
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,860
He's got the voice down

126
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,060
Did you...Look at the lyrics while singing?

127
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,660
Yes, I was looking at the lyrics

128
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,760
What the hell is this

129
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,950
Yeah, what is this

130
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,800
And it's raining too...I'm gonna get depressed!

131
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,660
It's a bad atmosphere

132
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,160
Ah it's over now. That was Nagabuchi-san's Stay Dream

133
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
When I was in high school and doing my best playing baseball,

134
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,100
It was my senpai's last match ever, and we lost, because of my mistake

135
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,100
So when I was really down about it, like "I really messed up"

136
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:47,460
That senpai brought a tape to me, and said "Listen to this". And it was Nagabuchi's Stay Dream.

137
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,600
He said "Listen to this, and do your best again"

138
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,630
And I cried

139
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,030
You cried?

140
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,030
I cried, as expected

141
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,930
It was your fault?

142
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,930
It was my fault after all

143
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,700
I felt bad about it, and this song expressed that

144
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,930
I get it

145
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,360
That is...

146
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,660
Enough to make you die....

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,530
Enough already

148
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,080
I said enough

149
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,460
Let's listen a bit more

150
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,500
We're listening after my story?

151
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,830
I thought you told him to play it

152
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:29,890
Ah, so we listen to it again taking to that story into account? ... I, I think I've heard it enough times

153
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,870
Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

Listen to my singing voice!
Nostaligic Song Drive!

156
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,560
Alright

157
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,230
Yama-chan you go

158
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,460
Please do

159
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,110
You have so many you can't find it, can you?

160
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,110
Give me a sec

161
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,100
Keep in mind, please become a Director

162
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,830
Take the current mood into account

163
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,130
Alright, for now, I guess this one

164
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,630
Alright, go ahead

165
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,230
Alright, let's listen

166
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,600
Let's listen

167
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,330
You recorded this in Osaka?

168
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,300
I did this in Osaka, in my house, while the kids were at school

169
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:16,330
The cheap sake I drank last night

170
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,300
Listen ...

171
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,300
I told you!

172
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,000
Be a director!

173
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:23,330
Maybe it's the cheap gin that gave me this headache

174
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,060
Be a director!

175
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,160
It's copying Endo's kind of

176
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,000
The vibe is the same

177
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:33,900
Asa no Sillouhette - Igarashi Hiroaki

178
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:33,900
You bring a hot coffee to me in bed

179
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:41,330
My white shirt hanging over your shoulder

180
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,700
What do you guys think?

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,400
This half-assed impression he's doing...

182
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,900
Please don't be gentle

183
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,060
I think he got it wrong

184
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,380
It's not supposed be an impression

185
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,060
It's supposed to be you singing acapella

186
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,700
Like the basics I guess

187
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,730
It's difficult to say "Goodbye"

188
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,560
It was a good thing you said that

189
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,900
Oh really? I'm singing normally though

190
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,700
No no no no

191
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,600
Listen to it

192
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,430
Why does a man try to get a woman?

193
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,530
He is good at this though

194
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:15,030
Please don't tell me your telephone number

195
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,130
But still this is...

196
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:23,530
Cause I know too well how sad the end of love is

197
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,800
This is a less well known song right?

198
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,300
Yes, from the album Sand Castle

199
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,100
But like, a more famous song could be better

200
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,000
But I have memories of this song

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,850
When are these memories from?

202
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,900
Theyr're really from, when I was in Osaka, before I came to Tokyo

203
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:47,200
Well it's exactly as the song says, "The gin I drank last night" and then "My head hurts" the next day

204
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,870
And the exact same thing happened to me while I was listening to this

205
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,350
And the girl I was dating at the time, well I didn't really drink coffee

206
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:06,250
I got her to bring me tea, while she had my white shirt hanging off my shoulder

207
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,200
I got really turned on

208
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,700
You got turned on?

209
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,060
Yes, it was that,

210
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,500
She was wearing just my shirt, my oversized shirt

211
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,650
I'll go then

212
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,550
A woman, something a bit more cheerful

213
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,000
All we've had are sad songs sung by men

214
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,150
Right, of course, I apologise

215
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,550
We're on a drive after all

216
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,900
I thought my song would be good because it's raining

217
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,700
Ah the mood right now?

218
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,800
So Hamada-san's...

219
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:45,200
Right after we kiss, don't say anything

220
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,350
Your voice is so quiet

221
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,500
Sakurada Junko!

222
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:53,400
I might break out in tears, that's how much my heart is shaking

223
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,750
Hold on, this song?!

224
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:52,440
Hajimete no Dekigoto (The first event) - Sakurada Junko

225
00:10:53,750 --> 00:11:04,400
Even if you don't care, I do

226
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,200
So creepy

227
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,100
This is like...

228
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,750
He's singing like he's about to die

229
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,450
Like he's about to die, his last words

230
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Yeah really

231
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:11,350
It was an act big enough to change the world

232
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,700
His voice is so quiet

233
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,500
It really is

234
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:21,550
I've been pretending to be mature, following you all this time

235
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,600
Yeah, I couldn't really get my voice out

236
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,900
It's a woman's song after all

237
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,200
He's not singing in the correct key

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,250
I thought this song was more passionate

239
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:29,400
I was singing right after I woke up, so my voice was still gravely

240
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,900
I see, you weren't prepared

241
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:40,500
The overwhelming tears make me dizzy, and I don't get angry because I love you

242
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,300
Why did you sing first thing in the morning?

243
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,600
Oh no

244
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,250
You were being too considerate to your wife

245
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,100
No no no

246
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,450
You should really loudly

247
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,700
Was your wife sleeping?

248
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,700
You should sing loud enough to make your wife barge into the room

249
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,650
This was the song of our first idol

250
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,850
This is one of her most famous songs

251
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,050
So Tanaka-san?

252
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,950
This one please

253
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,070
How should I say, "The First Experience?", sorry right "The first event"

254
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,450
I'm counting on you Tanaka seriously

255
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,600
I'm kinda worried about Tanaka-san's

256
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,950
Honestly, he's not very good at singing

257
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,950
Oh, really?

258
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,900
Oh really? Tanaka is a bad singer?

259
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,250
And it's acapella too

260
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:37,100
You could count happiness on one hand

261
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,150
Eh? What is this?

262
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,850
I think Endo knows this one

263
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:48,050
You need more than both hands to count sadness

264
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,800
Sachiko - Banba Hirofumi

265
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,800
This is kinda creepy

266
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,400
It's not creepy!

267
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
This is creepy

268
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,650
Like a haunted tape

269
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,400
Isn't this too quiet?

270
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:58,700
No matter how clean your heart is, you can still believe in ugly things

271
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:10,400
Even if you cry now, one day this will be a funny story

272
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,100
Man you're so quiet

273
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,100
It's hard to sing, even though I picked this song

274
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,050
Sachiko, I remember that street

275
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,070
There it is

276
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,950
Sachiko, live on

277
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,750
It really does

278
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,700
His voice really tapers off at the end

279
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Even if it's a sad love story, when you forget the laughing good times,

280
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,150
He SUCKS

281
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,550
He's too quiet, and he sucks

282
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,150
You really are super quiet

283
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,150
He hasn't improved at all

284
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,650
See his voice is breaking

285
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:38,550
I'll stay by your side until you remember

286
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,350
Hosei-san has told me that many times

287
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,750
It's been consistently bad so far

288
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,300
Just pick a song with a key you can sing!

289
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,050
That's true, I tried so many times

290
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:54,000
Why did you go and make up rules for yourself for no reason, just sing acapella

291
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Back in Year 2 or 3 of middle school, at an event for appreciating music

292
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,100
At the neighbourhood Toyonaka Civic Centre, Bunba Hirofumi-san actually performed this song live

293
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:16,700
So that was the first time I ever saw a professional singer live

294
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,900
I was really amazed by a pro singer's awesomeness.

295
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,850
His presence?

296
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,850
His presence

297
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,800
That was really impactful to me. Even now this song,

298
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,100
It was a popular song

299
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,100
I can't forget this song

300
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,050
Man you suck at singing

301
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,900
Matsumoto-san, your turn please

302
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,900
You're right

303
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,600
It's gotta be, this one, I think

304
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,310
You suck at singing

305
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,750
Next, what nostalgic song will Matsumoto sing?

306
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:56,950
You know of it, Yokohama Harbour

307
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,250
Ah yes

308
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,510
What kind of memories do you have of this?!

309
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,550
Isn't this a really old song?

310
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,950
Oh you know this song?

311
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,950
I've heard the first phrase before

312
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
He sucks!

313
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,450
No no listen

314
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,000
His voice is all over the place

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Isezakichou Blues - Mina Aoe

316
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,400
A dream sprinkled in the lights of Isezaki

317
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,000
This part, from here\

318
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,700
His voice is breaking

319
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Passionate love,

320
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,050
Dooby Dooby Dooby Doo-ahhh

321
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,600
The light stops

322
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,050
So goddamn passionate

323
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,550
Very passionate

324
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,900
Like a dad singing

325
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,900
You guys should be this passionate!

326
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,350
My memories of this are with my father

327
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,850
Yeah

328
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:46,950
My dad loved Aoe Mina

329
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,950
This is Aoe Mina-san?

330
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,150
My dad liked her

331
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:56,700
At the time, she had slightly blonde hair, and had that erotic atmosphere

332
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:03,550
So my dad would always get excited about Aoe Mina, and my mom would get pissed off

333
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,300
I thought "So creepy"

334
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,350
My excited dad creeped me out, and my angry mother creeped me out too

335
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,200
I really hated it when I was a kid

336
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,700
I get it

337
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,150
Your mom's jealousy

338
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,650
My mom would go "What is that crap? So indecent!"

339
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,350
Don't show your spouse those feelings, right?

340
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,500
I would say mine was the most powerful singing today

341
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,200
No no no

342
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,400
Well there were other powerful ones

343
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:41,200
What do you think? We've done one rotation

344
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,400
What should we do?

345
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,950
Yama-chan are you going?

346
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,850
Yes

347
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,700
We haven't listened to a cheerful song yet

348
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,700
Yeah

349
00:16:54,050 --> 00:17:00,350
The harbor light changes in the morning

350
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,350
You're going at max tension right away

351
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:10,450
At the moment, the first seagull flew

352
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,350
Your voice is really strong!

353
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,650
He got us with this one

354
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,650
He's really belting it out

355
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:18,950
The Day the Gull Flew - Watanabe Machiko

356
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,750
Which number song was this?

357
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,850
This was like the 9th song I recorded

358
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,900
Yeah makes sense

359
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,850
You really got into it

360
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,720
He went off right from the start

361
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,050
Do you think the tears will disappear?

362
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,400
I'm still in love with you

363
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,010
He's very loud

364
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Who was this again?

365
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,450
Wataname Machiko

366
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,480
The Gull?

367
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,050
An off season harbor town

368
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,480
The Day The Gull Flew

369
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:55,850
AAaahh moi shadow only

370
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,850
"Moi", he's saying moi

371
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:01,200
The gull flew, the gull flew

372
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,000
Amazing

373
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,200
Amazing right? It's flying

374
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,800
It's flying

375
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,800
I want to clap for this, amazing

376
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,300
Nobody's sang so loudly until now

377
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,300
Yeah, very impressive. He was really into it

378
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,180
He really was
I was totally into it

379
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,100
Is the 2nd chorus in there too?

380
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,400
It's in there

381
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,700
Wow

382
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:33,900
Only good men have a fondness for the harbor

383
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,200
His voice is really strong!

384
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,800
I was dancing too

385
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,800
I didn't expect to break up

386
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,250
I can see it, moving like this

387
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,650
This one, yeah,

388
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:51,000
I didn't expect to break up

389
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:50,650
You gotta have this much excitement

390
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,600
Yeah you're right. Once you try it you figure it out

391
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:57,050
Only the view of the harbor

392
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,100
You're right, once you try it

393
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,250
The bitter scent of the tide

394
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,690
Shut up

395
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,400
He got told to shut up

396
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,850
You kind of need to go all out when you sing

397
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,990
That's true

398
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,300
So now, the past mood was the worst

399
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,300
I got it, I understand

400
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,850
No more sad songs

401
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,850
This is really, this one is cheerful

402
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,250
It's cheerful right? That's all we want to hear

403
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,800
Yes please, play it

404
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,000
This one is pretty nostalgic

405
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
It's nostalgic?

406
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,750
Oh I know this

407
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,100
I already got it

408
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,100
Yeah I know this

409
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,300
Oh Endo you got it?

410
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,400
I got it

411
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:43,100
You're not a side piece, Baby don't cry

412
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,100
I said that to my friends as a joke, Baby I was kidding

413
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,900
Counting the stars by the beachside

414
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,800
Zokkon Life - Shibugakitai

415
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,800
There's been no improvement

416
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,400
Seriously?

417
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,250
Is this the extent of your vocal range?

418
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,300
What do you mean, c'mon cut it out

419
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,100
No no , my voice isn't monotonic!

420
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,600
Yeah seriously, you sing at one pitch

421
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,850
Seriously?

422
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,650
I thought I sang this well

423
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,500
You make my heart sting so good, more than anyone else

424
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,750
Listen!

425
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,700
Well you are getting into it

426
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,410
Don't give it over, Don't give it over

427
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,500
Yes yes

428
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,300
I guess there's no pitch variation in this song

429
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,040
The best romance, ZOKKON!

430
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,000
Zokkon? Zokkon Love

431
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Yes Zokkon Love

432
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,800
I have 2 older sisters, and my oldest sister loves Shibugakitai

433
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,050
Ah, that generation

434
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,550
She had posters all over her room,

435
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,750
Could you turn it off Matsumoto-san?

436
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,550
Well keep going

437
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,090
He doesn't wanna hear himself singing

438
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,450
Please listen to me

439
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,300
It's hard to understand him or his singing

440
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:05,850
So this is just a song I've heard a lot, that was my memory

441
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,300
Oh really?

442
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,750
Maan Tanaka sucks at singing

443
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,250
You all suck at singing, generally. That pisses me off a bit

444
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,000
I think this is a song everyone knows

445
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,150
The love between 2 pen-pals

446
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,350
What a somber singing voice!

447
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,450
Yeah for real

448
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,250
This singing style

449
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,350
This song gets you excited

450
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,600
That's true

451
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,200
This is a great song isn't it?

452
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,200
It's a great song

453
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:43,500
Under a Big Onion - Bakufu Slimp

454
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,500
Yeah this is kinda dark

455
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,700
No, the lyrics are just like that

456
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:52,350
Cause we're too young, Too far apart

457
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,450
This sounds like a buddhist chant

458
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,400
Why are you singing so somberly?

459
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,100
But it's supposed to be like this!

460
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,100
It's a more cheerful song than this

461
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,550
Cause, I think I got it,

462
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:05,950
Cause this is a song you sing with other people, it has a different feel

463
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,850
But I was alone singing by myself for a while,

464
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,100
So in terms of excitement, this somberness is inevitable

465
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,100
This mood...

466
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,600
Starting from here, this part it changes

467
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:25,700
The photograph in the card holder

468
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,000
It's the same!

469
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,050
It hasn't changed at all

470
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,000
It'll go up a bit, just wait a bit more

471
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,500
Cause this is a famous song isn't it?

472
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:31,650
That smile doesn't waver

473
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,400
See, I'm getting into it

474
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:46,100
Under that big onion, was the first time I met you

475
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,000
He's trying to hit the note

476
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,400
Listen to the hook, that's what I want you to listen to

477
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:53,050
Get off at Kudanshita station, and go down the hill

478
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,100
This is like Enka

479
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,450
It's turning into Enka

480
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,650
It is, didn't he say it gets better?

481
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,700
He fuckin sucks

482
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,900
He made it depressing

483
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,150
Yeah, acapella makes the song depressing doesn't it?

484
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,500
I got it. It's depressing

485
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,040
Next Week

486
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,450
Next week: Music Memory Drive finale

487
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,400
More nostalgic songs in acapella!

488
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,950
Don't miss the passion of the soul!

489
