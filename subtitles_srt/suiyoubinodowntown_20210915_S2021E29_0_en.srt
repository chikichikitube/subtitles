00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,190
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:05,850
Thanks for having us

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,030
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,990
Anyone there?

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,160
There is, of course there is

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,200
It's Shoji Tomoharu!

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,680
No shouting

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,780
Mikitty! No spray version
-An original

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,360
Because of the epidemic
-Epidemic Limited Edition

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,250
So folks, it's not too late

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,660
The lecture series, we all like it, right?

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,510
There is such a series

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,340
I'm bringing a new perspective on the lecture series today

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,000
Really?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,680
Are there any more?

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,180
This is it, please take a look

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,600
While lecturing someone, it's ok to add Nagabuchi's lyrics

18
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,960
So that's it

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,770
Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi, I really like his stuff

20
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,610
Kakuta, do you like him too?
-I like him

21
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,970
A lot of his lyrics are like tenets of life

22
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,640
I also like him a lot

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,300
So wouldn't it be a good idea to mix his lyrics in while lecturing someone?

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,560
His words themselves are all very good
-No doubt about it

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,590
The problem is how to blend them in

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,120
You can't do it when flirting with someone, right?

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,920
No, no, no, no.
-Indeed

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,860
He has a song called "Captain of the Ship" which is 13 minutes long

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,330
You can just use all of the last seven minutes, right?
-Yes

30
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,200
Really?
-It's true

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
It's all about uplifting sentences
-Yeah, yeah, yeah

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,420
It's all about "live and let live" and "you must finish"

33
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,040
Are you that obsessed?

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,370
What? What's wrong?

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,110
You're really the worst, seriously

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,510
No, no, what he's saying is weird

37
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,950
It's because his lyrics are really inspiring.
-That's right

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,090
If the person realizes, the lecture will end immediately

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,890
Also,

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,870
If you have a strong will, you can control your body even after falling asleep

41
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,350
And

42
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:04,020
There are no residents whose nearest station is "Meibijo Station" on the Tokyo Monorail

43
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,960
While lecturing someone, it's ok to add Nagabuchi's lyrics

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,650
So the first challenger is

45
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,810
Thank you for having me

46
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,130
Moriyama

47
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:45,440
As per the theory, the contestants will choose from the following 10 famous songs written by Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi

48
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,060
Moriyama's choice is

49
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,120
In terms of what is better to include in a lecture

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Nagabuchi's "Dragonfly"

51
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,840
Seriously?

52
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,930
The famous song "Dragonfly", which became a household name as the theme song of the drama of the same name

53
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,060
Came from Osaka to Tokyo resonates with me

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,430
This song is also very much in line with my own situation

55
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,440
So the most suitable for my current situation is "Dragonfly"

56
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:36,800
※If the lyrics are spoken incorrectlythe score will be reduced

57
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:20,360
This time, the lyrics are divided into ten levels according to the difficulty of adding the lyrics

58
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,950
Is it possible?

59
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,230
Must be tought

60
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,670
With a time limit of 30 minutes, the highest score wins

61
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,970
The shorter the lyric, the less the score

62
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,120
But if in the process of lecturing

63
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,120
Yeah

64
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,480
They will be disqualified if the other person points out the lyrics

65
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,730
To the north to the north is only 3 points

66
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,150
Normally you wouldn't point out something like that

67
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,210
The juniors who are the targets are

68
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,970
Kyon's Cotten, a Tokyo-based junior

69
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,070
A junior of Moriyama's for five years

70
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,800
It's probably not a bad choice.
-Is it?

71
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,580
This kid seems quite innocent

72
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,880
Probably a good target

73
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,480
You think he won't realize?
-Yes

74
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,470
And so

75
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,920
A fake project of "2-shot talk with comedians who are close"

76
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,230
Kyon is called to participate

77
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,680
While waiting for the official filming, the "Dragonfly" lecture begins

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,710
Dragonfly lecture

79
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,590
How many lyrics can be mixed in?

80
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,840
How is Nishimura?

81
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,740
He's good

82
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,310
Ah but...

83
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,850
I saw your show...

84
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,320
Really? Thank you.
-It was fun

85
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,180
I liked that part

86
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,950
What?

87
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,150
That high school girl

88
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,520
Ah Sachiko? Thank you

89
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,300
Is that a character you use in the theater?

90
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,070
No, that's just for the screen

91
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,770
You should continue with the character

92
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,870
Eh——

93
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,340
Since it's popular its best to run with it

94
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,570
Really?

95
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,040
You should definitely keep using it

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,640
Really?

97
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,280
Yeah

98
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,050
But to have a persona isn't enough

99
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,720
As if standing there with an irrelevant face

100
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,950
Yeah

101
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,890
So impressive, so natural

102
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,490
And he agreed

103
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,560
I want to grow up to be a person like you in Tokyo

104
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,830
What do you mean mean be a person like me?

105
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,770
From the masters to the seniors who are near the same level as you, everyone supports you

106
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,870
No, no, I'm not that good

107
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,040
I just

108
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,740
I'm just praying to stay true to myself

109
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,090
Oh so cool

110
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,090
He said cool

111
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,570
Didn't notice? He even said cool

112
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,570
Risky move

113
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,980
Although the lecture itself is a little weak

114
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:47,120
So far, Moriyama has not been discovered, and the lyrics of "Dragonfly" have been added naturally

115
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,470
Samurai SLICE

116
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,010
※In April 2021, Samurai SLICE moved from Yoshimoto, Tokyo to Yoshimoto, Osaka

117
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,010
They've come to Osaka, haven't they?

118
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,270
Came to Osaka and were immediately invited to the theater there, right?

119
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,800
It's great that they dared to move to Osaka.
-Yeah

120
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,410
What they are doing now

121
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,100
Will they keep a loser like me in mind?

122
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,280
This is a bit too much, right?

123
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,290
As long as they don't notice it's fine

124
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,750
Keep in mind?

125
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,490
What do you mean keep in mind?

126
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,190
I usually look up words I don't know when I come across them

127
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,340
This is bad

128
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,960
Keep in mind...

129
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,370
But Samurai SLICE's performance in Osaka was also very good!

130
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,070
Very good, really interesting

131
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,840
So, especially in this world

132
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,720
It makes people feel like sitting on pins and needles

133
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,610
Sitting on pins and needles?

134
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,110
What does it mean to sit on pins and needles?

135
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,350
Moriyama is really a man of culture!

136
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,820
You are too uneducated, okay?

137
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:53,050
Nagabuchi's unique use of words and phrases, which are not used in everyday conversation, arouses suspicion

138
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,100
Indeed, so unique

139
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,850
Unexpected, Moriyama experiences a crisis

140
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,420
So many words i've never heard today

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,220
But it seems the lyrics don't immediately come up when searched, so he's safe for now

142
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,350
Checking immediately when encountering

143
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,370
But you create things like this

144
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,710
Where are you going to fly next?

145
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:19,880
To win the King of Conte

146
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,420
You yourself are also  counting the nights you can't bear  to cheer yourself up

147
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,230
I actually counted

148
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,500
Only 5 minutes remain

149
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,560
What kind of person is this

150
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,270
He was a good choice.
-Yes

151
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,000
Kyon is very underdeveloped in regard to detecting "Dragonflys"

152
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,850
And so, Moriyama pushes ahead

153
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,580
Sure enough, after listening to you face to face, I really think you look very happy

154
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,780
Yes

155
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,890
I think you look like a happy dragonfly

156
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,090
A happy dragonfly?

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,060
Too much too much

158
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,090
So funny!

159
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,030
If you were compared to a dragonfly

160
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,760
Is the happy dragonfly Nagabuchi?

161
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,570
Really, do a good job!

162
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,580
Moriyama Disqualified

163
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,130
So at this point, the truth is revealed

164
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,740
Betting on a big one

165
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,410
Are you lecturing? Moriyama?

166
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,610
It wasn't a lecture

167
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,880
I was scared when this kid kept checking things

168
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,780
I was so scared that I couldn't breathe

169
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,240
The next challengers are

170
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,810
Thank you for having me

171
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,620
Oasis' Okubo

172
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,460
How about Miyuki Nakajima?

173
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,150
Using Miyuki Nakajima's famous song "FIGHT!"

174
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,240
She lectures I AM Noda, a junior

175
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,510
The phrase "FIGHT!" is a good one

176
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,750
I want to say "please keep fighting" to him

177
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,620
I think it should work

178
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,710
How will it turn out?

179
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,120
It was a few years ago, right?

180
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,630
You once asked me for advice

181
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,400
You and I talked once, didn't we? Over a drink.
-Yes, yes

182
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:17,570
That's when you said you wanted to work harder and wanted to enter the R-1 and so on

183
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,970
But you've always been so comfortable with the status quo. How old are you?

184
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,480
I'm already 44.
-44

185
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,980
If you don't put more effort into it, it'll be too late

186
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,320
How can I put this

187
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,590
Shivering in the cold water trying to swim upstream

188
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,090
I've never seen you work that hard

189
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,200
What kind of person talks like that?

190
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,230
It's good to have fire in your belly

191
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,540
You're not too old

192
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,110
When the sun shines on the surface of the water, can you see the fish underwater glittering

193
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,610
Yes, yes, yes, very beautiful

194
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,650
The glow is the fish's scales that have flaked off after being injured and are floating in the water

195
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,390
Impressive

196
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,960
Ah, that's it

197
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,400
The more damage you suffer, the stronger the light will be

198
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,900
You haven't even been hurt, have you?
-No, I haven't

199
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,190
Okubo cleverly integrates the lyrics into the dialogue

200
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,410
And they resonate with Noda

201
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,870
Great! He's moved!

202
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,310
The fish are going upstream

203
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,060
Very determined

204
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,520
Have you been watching a lot of National Geographic or something lately?
-Yeah I have

205
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,760
Are you still borrowing money?
-No

206
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,860
That was a long time ago

207
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:56,470
A guy I met in the theater company when I was in my 20s

208
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,740
Isn't there a way to get an easy loan, like the ones posted on telephone poles?

209
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,570
He fell into that trap

210
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,130
Then people came to his door

211
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,280
Said that he and his family would never have a place to stay again

212
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,300
What? Did the debtor tell him that?
-Yes

213
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,090
Is this a lecture?

214
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,800
I'm just trying to discourage you because it happens

215
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,940
I won't cause anymore trouble

216
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,770
He didn't understand it though

217
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,670
And so

218
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,840
Great, not found out

219
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,940
I actually witnessed you

220
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,780
Witnessed?

221
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,680
You saw?
-Yeah

222
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,820
Eh? When?

223
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,040
Yesterday, on the steps of the tram stop

224
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,780
The concept has changed

225
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,930
It seems like you can't hold your head up when you walk

226
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,840
I was so shocked that I ran away

227
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,670
Eh? Eh?

228
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,540
Felt scared and ran away

229
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,480
But in Shinjuku...
-In Shinjuku

230
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,680
Shinjuku?  -You weren't there?

231
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,850
Eh, I wasn't in Shinjuku yesterday

232
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,890
I was just scared for no reason then

233
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,890
I thought "how did the Noda I knew become like this?"

234
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,180
It wasn't you?

235
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,060
She continues

236
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,700
I came across a male producer or someone of a slightly higher status than us

237
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,830
I was invited to drink with him

238
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,170
I just thought I'd be better off if I were a guy

239
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,780
Then I may not have to try so hard to please men

240
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,250
I wish I were a man

241
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,240
7 points?
-Streak

242
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,660
Adding this is impressive

243
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,240
So strong

244
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,440
All of it?

245
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,840
The score is super high

246
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,130
Still hasn't realized

247
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,000
Okubo executes a beautiful combo

248
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,990
Is it just because Noda is an idiot?

249
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,040
Immediately afterwards

250
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,700
Surprisingly, you and Takeda have a good relationship.
-Yes, we're very close

251
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,010
After all, he has a junior high school education

252
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,150
Is he just a junior high school graduate? No, he went to college, didn't he?

253
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,710
Is that wrong?

254
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,750
Is that wrong? I wondered

255
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,750
So I'm wrong?
-He'd be happy if you remembered

256
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,180
It's not right, he went to college

257
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,450
She forcibly attempts to add "after all, he has a junior high school education" to the list

258
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,180
What are you talking about?
-Yeah

259
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,830
At this point there were still five minutes left

260
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,440
Seriously, you can do it, FIGHT! FIGHT!

261
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,680
I will, I can do it

262
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,940
FIGHT!

263
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,340
What you are saying is...

264
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,300
FIGHT!

265
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,780
No, no, no, sorry

266
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,120
I really did not expect you to say this

267
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,920
It's been really enlightening

268
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,770
Not only does he fail to notice the lyrics, but he also receives a rewarding lecture

269
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,310
Okubo's impressive performance nets her 86 points

270
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,210
Awesome

271
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:21,440
The truth is revealed

272
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,800
The lecturer is an important choice

273
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,690
Hello

274
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,010
Is this Wednesday Downtown?

275
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,440
You look really happy

276
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,110
Wait a second, because...

277
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,950
No, is this for real?

278
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,750
Don't be so happy, tell us what the theory is

279
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,350
Don't just think that being on this show is great

280
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,490
That...

281
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,490
This time is the real lecture

282
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:43,160
"How to use fish as a metaphor for a sense of futility"

283
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,660
This outlook is accidentally interesting

284
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,950
The next challenger is

285
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,990
I also came to participate

286
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,330
Shoji Tomoharu

287
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,910
Captain of the Ship" by Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi

288
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,390
I want to see this one

289
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,310
This is my choice

290
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,170
This will be quite tough

291
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,130
Among the many tracks of Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi

292
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,990
I chose "Captain of the Ship" because it conveys an extraordinarily strong will

293
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,950
He will lecture his junior, Garittochu's Kumagai

294
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,960
Kumagai also knows that I am particularly fond of Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi

295
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:26,770
I sang this song several times when we went to karaoke

296
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,770
Will it be too obvious?

297
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,770
Might be tough

298
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,770
So this is a bit worrying

299
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,790
Have you decided what you want as a moving gift?

300
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,960
No, you don't have to be so polite

301
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,370
Just say, just say

302
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,970
Don't act like you're embarrassed to ask
-OK

303
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,840
I'm serious.
-Okay, I get it

304
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,640
"What do you want as a moving gift?" The answer is too slow

305
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,110
Thus begins the lecture

306
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:17,220
You have concerns about interacting with everyone, and you're limiting yourself

307
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,020
The lyrics start from here

308
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,360
I feel like you do

309
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,960
You should say what you want to say

310
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:31,400
Even if someone frowns and says you "love to be in the limelight"

311
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,680
it's much better than saying "you are a good person"

312
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,900
Even if someone frowns at you and scolds you for being in the limelight

313
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,900
So it's wrong here

314
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,230
Those long-winded arguments will also follow you later

315
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,700
You'll make seniors and juniors worry about you

316
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,620
Not up, not down

317
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,390
Nor to the right or to the left, you just keep going

318
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:11,980
and not to the right or to the left you just keep going all the time

319
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,130
Two versions

320
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:19,520
Before you say believe in me, you must love the self that can always believe

321
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,900
Before releasing the words that you believe in me before you must love the self that can always believe

322
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,310
Happiness is not something to be but something to feel

323
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,770
Are you underestimating me?
-No, really

324
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,440
You despise all human beings, not just me

325
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,940
I really don't underestimate the human race

326
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,110
Don't underestimate humans

327
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,180
What were we before becoming comedians

328
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,850
Human beings
-Human beings, right?

329
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,550
We're human, right?
-Yes

330
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,700
Hot blooded

331
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,400
In the end, you and I are just human beings

332
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,910
Don't look at human beings with such rotten eyes

333
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,430
You've been dead for almost 3 years

334
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,040
I can't believe it's been as long as 3 years...

335
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,670
Live well
-Yes

336
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,380
Live on, live on, live wonderfully

337
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,280
Ok... Ok...

338
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,960
The passionate lecture continues

339
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,790
30 minutes have passed

340
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,090
The truth is revealed

341
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,010
Really?

342
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,070
Didn't realise

343
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,460
How do you feel after listening to Shoji's words just now?

344
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,970
He is so angry, has he been under a lot of stress recently

345
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:52,740
Talking about life and death, it was a bit much

346
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,950
When explaining himself, what he was saying seemed pretty good

347
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:06,360
The scores are as follows, Okubo ranks first with FIGHT!

348
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,620
Wonderful

349
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,370
What do you think Asahi?

350
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,410
Sure enough, at the end of the day, everyone was overwhelmed by passionate emotions

351
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,680
The fact that they were lyrics didn't really matter

352
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,970
They just paid attention to the emotions and didn't realise

353
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,810
So, you could get "Yosoro" in there?

354
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,980
※Nautical term meaning "keep going straight" also appears in the lyrics of "Captain of the Ship".

355
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,810
"Yosoro" is impossible, right?

356
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,980
How can you do it without "Yosoro"?

357
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,820
That's too tough

358
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,350
If you added it, the score would be very high

359
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,850
That'd be like giving the song's personal details out!

360
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,520
Kakuta, as a fan of Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi, do you want to try it?

361
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,260
It was amazing, but I don't want to do it

362
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,230
Watching was enough

363
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,730
In addition, additional versions of this lyric project were made prior to the broadcast of this episode

364
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,570
You are so unbelievable

365
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,240
And so, the second one will also be broadcast in the near future

366
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,000
Let's welcome the next presenter

367
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,200
It's Chocolate Planet!

368
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,020
Spray-less version of Ikko

369
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,420
Don da ke!

370
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,270
What are you guys up to?

371
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,470
So much to do

372
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,070
How long are you guys going to mess around

373
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,200
Hey, stop!

374
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,520
Stop everything!

375
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,720
Sorry

376
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
So let's get straight to the point

377
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,250
Have you ever dozed while standing up on the subway?

378
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,620
Yes, quite often actually

379
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,280
Maybe once

380
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,470
Although you're dozing off

381
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,920
Whilst being shaken around

382
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,020
You won't let go of your hand, right?
-Indeed

383
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,430
When you doze off, you'll move but your hands are still...

384
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,030
I've never seen anyone collapse.
-It's rare

385
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,170
There is no such person who dozes off, right?

386
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,000
Eh? What type of person?

387
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,940
One more time.
-Just dozing off

388
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,840
There are no such people, right?

389
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,710
No way

390
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,910
That's dangerous

391
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,520
So we bring you this theory

392
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,000
If you have a strong will, you can control your body even after falling asleep

393
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,150
For example?

394
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:25,460
You'll keep holding onto the ring because of the will to not let go as its dangerous

395
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,170
Please take a look at the VTR

396
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:36,010
If you have a strong will, you can control your body even after falling asleep

397
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:43,110
This will be verified by holding a rope connected to a basin

398
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,950
Very simple construction

399
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:49,550
The theory is valid if the test subjects can sleep for 1 hour continuously while not letting go

400
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,150
Impressive to be able to sleep under these conditions

401
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:58,500
By the way, whether they're asleep or not will be judged by a brain specialist

402
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,020
The first challenger is

403
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,970
Midnight challenge

404
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,640
Hello everyone, thank you for having me

405
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,270
A man that must be mentioned when speaking of tenacity

406
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,770
Yes

407
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,680
Yasuda Dai Circus' Chief Yasuda

408
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,110
Looks like it might work

409
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,780
Do you have a battle plan?

410
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,820
Wearing pajamas

411
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,450
Just keep my brain asleep and right hand awake, right?

412
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,050
So that it will not fall

413
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,690
Only retain consciousness here

414
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,970
You can't do it

415
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,630
Only here is awake, the brain is asleep, it can work

416
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,670
Simple to say at least

417
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,800
Seriously?

418
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,120
The challenge soon begins

419
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,620
Is it that simple?

420
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,470
I'm gonna fall asleep by sheer willpower

421
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,540
Letting only the brain sleep

422
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,920
What does it mean to fall asleep by willpower?

423
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:44,400
After maintaining this posture with his eyes closed for 10 minutes

424
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,110
A strong alpha wave has appeared

425
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,480
The moment this wave breaks

426
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,550
He will have fallen asleep

427
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:59,160
The Chief is just one step away from sleep

428
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,800
Later

429
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,890
He's asleep

430
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,270
That's impressive

431
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,050
The clock starts from here

432
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,170
The Chief, as declared beforehand, continues to hold the rope firmly after falling asleep

433
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,450
After 5 minutes

434
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,370
At this point

435
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,600
The hand holding the rope relaxes for a moment

436
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,960
Before gripping again

437
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,830
And

438
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,980
The same phenomenon continues with a certain frequency

439
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,610
Now he is in a very unusual state

440
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:02,990
He's drifting between the sleep state and awake state, these two types of brain waves are appearing simultaneously

441
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,150
Is it rare?

442
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,660
Yes, i've been doing these tests for 35 years

443
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,700
It rarely happens

444
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,430
The Chief is indeed a unique individual

445
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:20,200
The Chief actually achieves the seemingly impossible state of "half asleep and half awake"

446
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,680
But the position of the basin gradually lowers

447
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,050
17 minutes after falling asleep

448
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,420
The basin descends to here

449
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,850
At this point

450
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,500
It's making a "hiss, hiss" noise as it drops

451
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,970
Finally "hiss, hiss" and it dropped

452
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,520
Nice hit

453
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,970
Looks like he just woke up.
-It's true

454
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,920
Good morning

455
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,320
I messed up

456
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,690
Were you holding the rope in your dream?

457
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,660
I think I was confusing reality and dreams

458
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:21,470
I had a dream that I couldn't sleep because I was holding onto a rope

459
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,370
The next challenger is

460
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,140
Awesome

461
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,640
Thank you for having me

462
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,440
Hello
-Hello

463
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,900
Sunshine Ikesaki

464
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:38,450
Ikesaki held the line with his eyes closed for 20 minutes

465
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,000
Sleeping well

466
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,590
He's now asleep

467
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,370
Sleeping nicely

468
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:53,530
As before, he successfully keeps the rope steady

469
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,620
Looks like a sleeping chimpanzee

470
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,400
This is not an animal experiment

471
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,470
But if you look closely

472
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,320
Little by little, the hand is loosening

473
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,850
You can see the rope moving slightly

474
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,860
Thus, the basin gradually descends

475
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,860
After sleeping for 40 minutes

476
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,570
The basin is almost touching his head

477
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,950
At this point

478
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,970
Slowly

479
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,320
Turned into a hat

480
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,590
This is...a bit of a strange result, right?

481
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,730
Let it fall down!

482
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,360
Not how I thought it'd go

483
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:01,550
Unfortunately the least harmful interaction between man and basin in the history of variety shows

484
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:07,400
I thought I'd fallen asleep and woke up

485
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,870
So I better pull it up

486
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,510
Eh

487
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,050
So boring!

488
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,320
Indeed

489
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,070
But very real

490
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,870
The next challenger is

491
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,370
Thanks for having me

492
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:29,060
The third challenger is Audrey's Kasgua

493
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,960
Confident?

494
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,360
Just need to keep it like this, right?

495
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,230
Nothing difficult, right?

496
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,730
But confident... it's difficult to say if I am or not

497
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,940
I was told to do so so I will do it

498
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,840
That's my Wednesday Downtown approach

499
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,040
They're always saying "wait"

500
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,140
And telling me stuff like "don't sleep while answering questions"

501
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,750
So i'll definitely sleep with this in my hand, of course!

502
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,520
So good

503
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,650
Kasuga thinks it's a simple job to do only what is required

504
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,600
A look of self confidence

505
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,620
But after 1 hour with closed eyes

506
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:12,270
There is no sign of sleep

507
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,550
Must be tired after an hour

508
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,750
Can't sleep

509
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,610
It's just been an hour now. You haven't fallen asleep, right?

510
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,780
Didn't fall asleep

511
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,850
You can't start if you don't sleep

512
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:30,450
Well, yes, yes, the timer starts only after you fall asleep

513
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,400
Too aware to sleep

514
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,330
I'm sleepy...

515
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:44,770
It's been...about 3 hours

516
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,700
Oh really?

517
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,370
Still can't sleep?

518
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,880
I'm closing my eyes and saying "must sleep" in my mind

519
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,240
Isn't this how it goes?

520
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,950
It's making me more sleepy

521
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,280
I'm getting there

522
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,880
The staff want him to sleep quickly

523
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,120
Afterwards, he still can't sleep

524
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,520
And so came the morning

525
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,190
No way

526
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,530
It's already 6am
-Oh

527
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,730
You need to get to your next job

528
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,520
He talked a big game

529
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,900
So you're disqualified

530
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,600
Damn it...

531
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,910
I guess it's too tough for me to fall asleep

532
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,110
In this way

533
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,910
Please call me again

534
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,070
Very impressive

535
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,650
There are other things that I can do

536
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,770
A touch of sadness

537
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,590
I'm sorry

538
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,460
The final challenger is

539
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,690
Hello
-Hello

540
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,090
Thank you for having me

541
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,630
Magical Lovely's Noda Crystal

542
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,100
If you drink

543
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,000
You'll fall asleep faster

544
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,310
Sleeping wine
-Yes

545
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:01,210
Noda also belongs to the group that cannot sleep in new environments

546
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,850
So he has some chilled whiskey to get him off to sleep

547
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,020
That's better

548
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,650
After 10 minutes

549
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,700
At this point

550
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,260
He's asleep

551
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,050
Quick

552
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,160
As he's sleeping, the challenge begins

553
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,370
But

554
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,950
So quick!

555
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,200
Hurts doesn't it

556
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:44,720
Surprisingly when falling asleep he pulled the rope down hard

557
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,090
And the rope broke causing the basin to fall

558
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:57,170
The result was unexpected. In short, the challenge failed

559
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,400
I don't even feel the pain...

560
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,840
But it scared me to death...

561
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,210
Ah, no

562
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,410
Did you let go?

563
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,680
You're annoying. I don't know

564
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,820
So humiliating...

565
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,220
Don't do this

566
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:24,390
This is Downtown's show... how could I do this

567
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,360
Noda, are you drunk?

568
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,230
They're watching

569
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,070
Now I'd like to have a good sweep.
-Really?

570
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,600
Sweep

571
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,770
Eh

572
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,510
You seem to be stuttering
-Unclear, I know

573
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,480
Eh, is this going to be shown?

574
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,150
You want to show this type of result too?
-Yes

575
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:49,790
He seems to have drunk too much

576
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,900
Actually drunk

577
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,520
Originally I wanted to sleep until... drink until I fall asleep

578
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,090
So humiliating...

579
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:00,760
Don't do this, everyone stop, don't shoot

580
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,070
Otherwise no one can go home

581
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,900
Damn...

582
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,140
No one can go home

583
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,450
What are you talking about?

584
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,160
What's going on?
-What are you upset about?

585
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,910
I looked sharp when I turned up...

586
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:18,080
So when everyone that came today... no one can go home

587
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,080
What happened

588
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,300
He's crying

589
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,220
Too much pressure

590
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,620
What's wrong with this guy? The verification is over. Enough is enough

591
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,430
What's going on here?

592
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,800
I can't drink wine...

593
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,100
Can't drink and still
-Yeah

594
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,770
I thought everyone couldn't go back home

595
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,400
Drank to have to fall asleep.
-I thought I wouldn't be able to sleep

596
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,810
If you cannot sleep until the morning we cannot go home

597
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,810
Cute, didn't realize he had such a side

598
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,500
We've got enough footage, it's fine

599
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,410
But you fell asleep at least
-Yeah

600
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,220
So that everyone could get home ok

601
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,520
Understood, thank you very much

602
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,190
I'm sorry, I'm so busy...
-Sorry...

603
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,620
Sorry... everyone is busier

604
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,660
I just have worries, I... just like to think too much...

605
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,960
Sorry, everyone, please go to bed

606
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,670
I can't have the big shots scared because of me

607
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,740
I'm sorry...

608
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,100
Well, everyone is working

609
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,620
Not entirely incomprehensible

610
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,720
Ah... I screwed up

611
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,920
Not going home at all

612
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,520
It's okay. It's okay. You didn't mess anything up
-I'm sorry...

613
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,690
Noda shows an unexpected side

614
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,800
But what exactly is his state of mind?

615
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,220
Everyone is in a bit of a bind

616
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:47,100
When a little more sober, we re-listen to what he has to say

617
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:55,550
If you know that others suffer because of you, you will cry

618
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:03,250
They are also raised by decent parents so they know not to cause other people trouble...

619
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,690
Aren't most people good like that?

620
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,790
I don't know

621
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,890
I hope everyone can be like that

622
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,460
I'm sorry
-I'm sorry

623
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,770
Thank you very much at this late hour

624
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,330
Thank you

625
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,170
What kind of project is this?

626
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:24,840
To sum up, although accidents occurred frequently

627
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,680
The winner is Sunshine Ikesaki with 41 minutes and 12 seconds

628
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,020
What does everyone think?

629
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,520
Four out of four
-Yes

630
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:45,130
What sort of mood should I have been in watching the last part?
-Yes

631
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:50,030
I've known Noda for a long time but i've never seen him like that

632
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,070
But he is a sensitive person who takes care of others

633
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,940
The staff is in a difficult situation due to not being able to start until the person falls asleep

634
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,680
It's hard to fall asleep in the first place, isn't it?
-Yes, it is

635
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,520
So the staff really had their work cut out for them

636
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,190
Falling asleep in that situation is very impressive, indeed

637
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,160
Kakuta is suddenly very serious

638
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,530
It is not possible to treat Noda Crystal as an ordinary good person

639
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,460
Have you been drinking too?

640
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,260
No I haven't

641
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,330
Don't cry!

642
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:30,940
Now it's time for Everyone's Theories

643
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,960
The next presenter is...

644
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,310
Tamura Kenji!

645
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,420
Thank you

646
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,180
Isn't this everyone's favorite man?

647
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,350
You've won a prize

648
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,690
Everyone's favorite?

649
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,730
I have never met anyone who hates him

650
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,860
I'm like curry

651
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,910
Is that so?

652
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,350
Let's get to the point

653
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:55,130
I brought a theory related to the station of the monorail

654
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,790
This is it:

655
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,740
There are no residents whose nearest station is "Meibijo Station" on the Tokyo Monorail

656
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,740
※Tokyo Monorail：A Tokyo-based railroad company that operates only one route, the Haneda Airport Line

657
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,070
What do you think?

658
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,840
Kakuta, do you know of this station?

659
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,600
I know, because people...

660
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,420
Whenever they go pass they think "I don't think anyone lives here"

661
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,590
Passing by while thinking?
-Yes

662
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,720
I don't think I remember anyone ever getting off there

663
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,190
But the station exists, right?

664
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,290
Yes, it exists, Hamada

665
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,920
It is a station located near Haneda Airport

666
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,240
The station is surrounded by airport-related facilities and factories

667
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,020
The people who work there?
-Yes

668
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,150
There should be people who use the station to commute

669
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,540
But is it the closest station to anyone's home?

670
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,630
If so, there should be people leaving from there in the morning

671
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,420
Indeed

672
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,920
And so, a survey was conducted around the station

673
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,010
I'm really sorry about today, Hamada

674
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,170
I cut my bangs too short

675
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,090
So the circle is a little small

676
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,860
Can't even speak clearly...

677
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,210
It's summer, so its natural for it to shrink

678
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:08,300
There are no residents whose nearest station is "Meibijo Station" on the Tokyo Monorail

679
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,480
We immediately went to the station to find out...

680
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,200
The station is there

681
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,880
As said, the only buildings or factories near the station are those related to the airport

682
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,930
No residential-like structures were found

683
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,030
So we headed in the direction of the residential area

684
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,540
And didn't encounter anyone while walking for 8 minutes

685
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,710
But 8 minutes is an acceptable range

686
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,450
Finally we found passers-by

687
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,100
Excuse me, we are TBS

688
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,910
Do you live near here?

689
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,670
Yes

690
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,140
What is the nearest station to your residence?

691
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,410
Tenkubashi

692
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,740
You don't use Meibijo?

693
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,010
No

694
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,100
After that too...

695
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,960
Tenkubashi

696
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,660
Tenkubashi

697
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,360
Tenkubashi

698
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,690
The nearest station to the residents here

699
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,170
The old man just now...

700
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,440
As you can see, it's Tenkubashi

701
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:07,790
Was that necessary?

702
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,040
Because he also uses Tenkubashi

703
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:14,860
It is true that no one lives closer to Meibijo

704
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,870
Eh? Is the theory true, then?

705
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,680
It was proven almost straight away

706
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,270
Incidentally, there are other stations in the area

707
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,710
Haneda Airport Terminal 1 Station Terminal 2 Station, etc

708
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,700
A total of 4 stations are located in the hinterland of the airport

709
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,110
Of course, since there are no residences around here either

710
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:40,190
So again, there are no residents whose homes are closest to these stations

711
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,560
Then the survey was extended to the whole of Japan

712
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:52,900
Surprisingly we found a similar pattern

713
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,550
First...

714
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,340
Umijigaura Station on the JR Tsurumi Line in Yokohama City

715
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:06,210
This station is actually located in the hinterland of the Toshiba factory

716
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,860
It is a station for Toshiba employees only

717
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:17,850
Since there are no residences within 2 km, it is not the closest station to anyone's home

718
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,880
Following the model of corporate stations

719
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:29,900
There is an unmanned station in Toyoura-cho, Gadatabata-gun, Hokkaido

720
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,640
It is located at the connection between the mountain and forest tunnels

721
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,410
A "small front station" that barely shows its face in a gap of only 80 meters in total length

722
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:51,940
There are no roads around the station, and the only way to get to the station is by train

723
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,890
If you want to walk from the station to the road

724
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,400
You have to walk for 1 hour in the mountains

725
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:09,540
In terms of anyone living there, you have to go another 6km down the road to get there

726
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,990
Of course, no residents would consider this to be the closest station to their homes

727
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,710
But why exactly is a station located here?

728
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,670
Because this place was originally a single line open to traffic

729
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,890
If the trains weren't staggered, the efficiency of transportation would be affected

730
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:28,770
And...

731
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,040
The tunnel is very long

732
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,980
It was used by steam trains previously

733
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,800
So there had to be a place for the smoke to go out

734
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,950
Only a specific amount of smoke could be exhausted while the trains are staggered

735
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,120
That's why this was set up

736
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:54,190
For the above two reasons, the signal station was set up during World War II

737
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,690
Now it is no longer used

738
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:04,000
After the end of the war, it was used as a fishermen's colony for about 100 people in the coastal area at the foot of the mountain

739
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:14,810
The station was upgraded to a passenger station, "Koboro Station," with the privatization of the national railroad in 1962

740
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,050
But

741
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:22,190
Since there are almost no schools and stores, no one has lived here for a long time

742
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,790
Thus, there exists a small station that no one uses

743
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,880
Why does it still exist today?

744
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:40,140
In fact, in 2015, JR Hokkaido expressed its intention to abolish it

745
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:46,120
However, in view of the fact that many tourists came to visit the station at that time

746
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,720
Toyoura-cho is trying to hold on to the station no matter what, and is actively working on maintenance and management

747
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,690
That's why it has been kept until now

748
00:41:54,290 --> 00:42:01,590
The unique railroad structure has captured the hearts of secret area lovers and railroad fans

749
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,650
Although it's a station that one can't even walk on

750
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:08,850
It's a potentially popular tourist attraction

751
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,540
There are many other stations like this that are like secret places

752
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:21,920
A view of the rapid flow of the Kinkawa River is available at the "Lookout Seiryu Station" in Yamaguchi Prefecture

753
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,860
So straight!

754
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:29,330
Kushiro Wetland Station located in the middle of a large wetland in Hokkaido

755
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,280
Next: In Shizuoka Prefecture

756
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:40,750
Oodai Lake-san Station" was built in the middle of the lake

757
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,360
Of course, this station is definitely not the closest to anyone's home

758
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,970
But it is relatively popular with tourists

759
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,650
Passengers come from all over Japan to enjoy this beautiful scenery

760
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:03,890
Although these places are not used by residents, they are perfect as tourist destinations

761
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,170
Such stations are located all over Japan.

762
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:14,310
However, there is a "Furunan Station" in Hoyan-cho, Ten Shiro-gun, Hokkaido

763
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,470
It is a station that is not even a tourist attraction

764
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,720
Conducted by JR Hokkaido

765
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,550
According to a survey, only a few days in a year has visitors

766
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,230
The number of passengers at Furanan Station

767
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:37,990
From the 27th year of Heisei to the first year of Reiwa, it was 0 for 5 consecutive years

768
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:43,550
In other words, this station is not used by any residents or tourists

769
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:50,810
As far as you can see, this station is surrounded by pasture and grassland

770
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,480
Almost no one lives near the station now

771
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,980
With the development of personal transportation, the number of people using the railroad decreased

772
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:06,290
Thus it eventually hit 0

773
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:11,800
So what exactly does this station exist for?

774
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:18,030
The features of this rare station have attempted to be put to use

775
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,710
And ways to attract tourists and keep the station have been sought

776
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:27,640
Have you done anything to increase the number of tourists

777
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:33,980
We made a mascot with the theme of the secret station

778
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:40,050
Yes, there is a mascot named " Furfur Meow" at Furunan Station

779
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:44,660
The inspiration for "Furfur Meow"

780
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,590
Surprisingly...

781
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,060
Was the storage cabinet on the platform

782
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:58,470
Even if there is nothing, mascots can still be born

783
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:01,900
Thus, the theory is confirmed

784
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,700
Yes, it holds

785
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:07,160
But because it was established too quickly we had to go a bit further

786
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:13,010
And delve deeper into the existence of such places in Japan

787
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,440
Serious content that runs counter to Wednesday Downtown

788
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,660
I think it's good once in a while

789
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,430
It's bad to finish on saying something is bad

790
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,450
The mascot at the end is disgusting

791
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,400
Saying that...
-It's just a mascot

792
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,950
It's cute!

793
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,130
What do you think, Kakuta?

794
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,460
I feel like i've learnt something

795
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,580
You have learned something, right

796
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,140
Every now and then, a nice theory pops us
-Yes

797
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,150
Occasionally...

798
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,580
It's shocking to see

799
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,790
"Wow, it's actually a nice theory," etc

800
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,320
You realize halfway through

801
00:45:42,890 --> 00:46:14,780
