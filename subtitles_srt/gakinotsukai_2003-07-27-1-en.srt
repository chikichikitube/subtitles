00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
The Summer of 2003

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:10,800
The "Downtown Errand Boys" perform a severe rendition of
the "Don't Laugh Penalty Game"

00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:20,340
Color Codes :

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,090
These are the four who received punishment

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,490
Downtown regular and member of Cocorico duo - Tanaka Naoki

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:25,490
Downtown regular and member of Cocorico duo - Endo Shozo

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,490
Nishinomiya's favorite son - Yamasaki Hosei

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,490
Downtown's Matsumoto Hitoshi

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:43,490
and the one standing in the Penalty Game Command Center is this man

11
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:55,490
Downtown's Hamada Masatoshi

12
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,490
Can you withstand it?

13
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,490
Merciless traps await to make you laugh

14
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,990
No matter how ridiculous the circumstances

15
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,990
No laugh will go unpunished

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,990
The more you MUSTN'T laugh

17
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,990
the tougher it will be to stop

18
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,990
Your fate will be progressive lunacy the more you resist

19
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,990
and for those who are unable to resist laughing...

20
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,990
the "blowdart in the butt" penalty awaits you

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,990
Welcome Team Matsumoto to...

22
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,990
The Don't Laugh in Overnight Bath House Stay

23
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:05,990
Welcome everyone to the Hamada vs. Matsumoto-
Cocorico-And "Other" Bowling Tournament!

24
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,790
Everything began with this showdown

25
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,790
The base rules for the match were bowling standard

26
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,790
However, Matsumoto team must line up and bowl together

27
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,790
The tournament has begun, but how will
this abnormal bowling match go?

28
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,090
Up first was Hamada, followed by Team Matsumoto

29
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,090
All eyes on Hamada as he has taken top spot

30
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,090
If he gets a spare here, it'll be bad for us won't it?

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,390
Now enters Team Matsumoto who have never once practiced

32
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,810
What will happen to their collective balls?

33
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,810
ok..Ready?
Go!

34
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,810
Come on,come on,come on,come on!

35
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,090
The back and forth continued along a close match

36
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:44,090
where after 9 frames Team Matsumoto leads 118 to 113

37
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:57,450
For our nail-biting Hamada it's spare or bust on this, his final frame

38
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,690
That was awesome

39
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,680
Oh man!

40
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,230
Looking at that last throw

41
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,140
I'm pretty sure he's been practicing,
remembering 3 years of Batsu (penalties) games he's done

42
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,780
And just as Team Matsumoto was coming to accept the reality of Hamada's strike...

43
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,350
Hamada pulls out a spare to finish at 133

44
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,540
If we don't get a strike or spare in our two shots, it's over

45
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,600
So we've got to get it on either the first or second bowl

46
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,840
Oh boy do they want a strike or a spare

47
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
And now the moment of truth

48
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Alright guys, we can do this.

49
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,760
Oh crap this is gonna be close

50
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,170
That alley is narrow

51
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,330
IF we knock that one down..

52
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,330
then we have another throw right?

53
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,260
and then we'd need another 5 p... yikes, we've hit a tough spot here

54
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:35,380
Team Matsumoto can win by getting this remaining pin and then another 5 pins

55
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,270
What the Hell?!?

56
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,530
Let's do this right guys
--Yes
--Yes we can
--Yea

57
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,530
Aw my ball went off!

58
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,530
Damn!, all of them Went off!!

59
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,200
That means Team Matsumoto gets to do the Penalty (Batsu) Game!!!

60
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,390
Team Matsumoto - Batsu Game!

61
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,640
Now what you've all been waiting for

62
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,890
we're going to watch a batsu game!

63
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,180
Now they're probably gonna say it hurt

64
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,180
and that it was tough

65
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
as they always complain

66
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,750
that's cause that's how it was supposed to be

67
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,070
Compare that to what I had to go through in the Onigokko (Demon Jail a.k.a 24 Hour Tag)!

68
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,170
Alrighty, let's introduce the losing bunch

69
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,350
You're the only one who can't make that face

70
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,390
We all settled on that face just before coming on

71
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,440
Uh, what did you guys mean?  Like this?

72
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,970
You can't do it at all. You're weird.

73
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,740
Well, why don't we talk about...

74
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,160
Actually, if I start talking about it now, I wouldn't stop

75
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,950
In all honesty, it was extremely...

76
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,920
Hold on, in one sentence, how was the batsu game this time around?

77
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,240
Well, I'd have to say that my heart and my, eh hem, my...

78
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,190
See, look at what's happened to him.  What's happened to us!

79
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,190
It hurt my heart and my rear

80
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,190
A really BIG hurt

81
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,010
I may just require some tender loving care after the show

82
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,070
You got hurt on your ass?

83
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,150
You'd be surprised

84
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,150
For an ass like yours...

85
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,150
We're showing it to everyone today right?

86
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,720
Kind of like a big time movie debut

87
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,020
Just I don't really have much of an opener to give for this

88
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,810
Then tell us about getting punished for laughing

89
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,930
Honestly, I was the only one who thought this time I was on the light side

90
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,970
After 10 minutes I came to realize I was mistaken

91
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,120
Alright, let's get right down to the show

92
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Our batsu game. Enjoy.

93
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,690
Here are the four travelling to a hot spring resort in Yamanashi

94
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:30,810
To begin a cruel night where a kind of expression raises the pain

95
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,160
6:00 PM

96
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,490
They arrive at the resort Hamada prepared

97
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,490
where that wolf awaited them with open arms

98
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,490
O' weary travellers

99
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,490
You guys are late

100
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,330
Downtown former Manager and Guide
Hiroshi Fujiwara

101
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,110
Would you please come line up over here?

102
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,530
Why are you stuttering?

103
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,310
As you know already, today we are doing a batsu game

104
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,800
Hamada has left me in charge here

105
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,570
Consider my words as His words and don't cross me

106
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:13,030
First, no matter what happens inside this resort, you must not laugh

107
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,030
First Rule


Do not laugh under any circumstances inside the Onsen

108
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,170
If you laugh, you will receive a severe punishment on the spot

109
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:23,530
Second Rule


A severe punishment is guaranteed to whomever laughs

110
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:23,650
The game begins as soon as you cross the entrance threshold

111
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,000
Is a slight smile ok?

112
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,650
Third Rule


The Batsu game starts once you cross the entrance threshold

113
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,980
Not even a slight smile

114
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,650
What about when something bright shines on your face or something? That happens.

115
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,800
That's not what I'd call a smile

116
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,680
Let's get this party started. Come on in.

117
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,550
Remember the game starts after this point

118
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,060
Is that it from you? Tell us "don't laugh" and on your way?

119
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,070
Start here?

120
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,210
You've all started now so please don't laugh

121
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,160
The Game has started !

122
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,690
This way

123
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,350
You have all the amenities - cooler, store, lounge and great scenery

124
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,960
Pretty isn't it?

125
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,370
I don't get why you're stuttering like that

126
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,630
Hey Yamasaki

127
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,350
yes?

128
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,040
You're small so you can probably benefit from eating all this stuff here

129
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
Well if I want to stay small...

130
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,530
We do have things like little festivals if you're interested

131
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:26,840
A fake poster showing "Gasu",
their producer

132
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,410
Wait a sec.  Endo was laughing too!

133
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,830
Matsumoto Mocking :
"Endo too.  Endo too"

134
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,670
The show is by Gus, THE Gasu.

135
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,370
Interested in checking it out?

136
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,260
So it's "out" with as little a laugh as that?

137
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,680
That, a little peep, anything really

138
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:19,450
Two very old ladies
Disguised as Schoolgirls

139
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,950
Wanna clear your calendar for the day? (and spend it with me)

140
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,950
Sure

141
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,200
Matsumoto tries to hold down the laughs by grabbing his sides

142
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:47,900
Here?

143
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,170
The board above the room reads:
Matsumoto, Cocorico, and Mr. "Other"

144
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,720
Eh, what's this?

145
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,780
There is a lot of floor space in here

146
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,760
It feels big

147
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,970
Ms. Nagai will be here shortly to talk about your stay

148
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,300
Sit back and relax

149
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,810
That was a dangerous spot back there

150
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,960
That "Gasu" Festival was seriously getting to me

151
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,570
I saw it right when I walked through the door

152
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,060
I was like "yikes, don't laugh" and forced it down

153
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,590
I saw it while we were getting the tour

154
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,780
They put it right where I would have to see it

155
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,710
right above the cigarettes and candy

156
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,590
There's all these tricks and stuff

157
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,590
like traps

158
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,270
Tricks or traps, yeah?

159
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,510
Seriously dude, stop it.  You're trying to trap us yourself.

160
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,660
Stop it already
--Ok I'm serious.

161
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,240
But you can't expect me not to talk

162
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,040
Just not that kind of funny talk

163
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,840
But I already saw them!

164
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,460
It's not when they come out, it's when that music plays

165
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,800
That song, yeah

166
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,380
Ok, I'm getting serious now

167
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,810
You let your guard down before

168
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,870
I wonder why food is always scheduled during these things

169
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,840
What the hell?

170
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,730
Living Crawfish in the bowl !!

171
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,700
That's awesome

172
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
What kind is it?

173
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,150
Excuse me

174
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,010
Haughty Ms. Nakai enters

175
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,690
Let me welcome you today to Isawa Hot Spring Resort

176
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,200
Is this your first time staying with us?

177
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,170
We've been here before I think

178
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,400
Oh, well you might already have heard this

179
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,820
Isawa Hot Springs is a prominent tourist attraction in Japan

180
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,230
And there are 64 separate rooms, making it comparable in size to Tokyo Dome

181
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,840
Surprising isn't it?

182
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,800
Tanaka expertly covers his laugh
and escapes from the Punishment

183
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,030
The matter of dinner has yet to be decided

184
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,810
Will you dine Japanese style or Western?

185
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,770
Since we're in a hot spring, why not Japanese style?

186
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,570
And what about Mr. Matsumoto?

187
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,640
I'll go with Japanese

188
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,340
And Mr. Yamasaki?

189
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,340
I'll have Japanese too

190
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,840
Mr. Tanaka?

191
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,640
Japanese style please

192
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,410
And what about Mr. Green Pea?  (Play on Endo's name: "Endo-mame"="pea")

193
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:32,600
Mr. Green Pea? Which will you be having?

194
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,390
I'll have Japanese

195
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,600
So for Japanese style it will be:

196
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,690
Mr. Matsumoto, Mr. Yamasaki, Mr. Tanaka and Mr. Green Pea, correct?

197
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:48,810
I'm certain I've tired you out with my questions for dinner

198
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,810
Excuse me now

199
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,300
Whoa that was bad

200
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,980
You know you laughed Tanaka

201
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,480
And calling me Mr. Pea, I haven't been called that in years

202
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,480
Is anyone going to change now?

203
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,230
It'd probably be more relaxing

204
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,870
You're changing?

205
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,140
Tanaka glares at Matsumoto for trying to
make him laugh with a fart

206
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,990
Tanaka, undress

207
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,630
Endo takes one look at Yamasaki's belly and laughs

208
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,100
Stop making us laugh!

209
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,100
It's not my fault!

210
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,100
It's not my fault! I just undressed and you started laughing!

211
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,800
What?!? Why you grabbing me?

212
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,500
You satisfied now, Zaki-san (Yamasaki)?

213
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,560
He purposely tried to make me laugh

214
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,360
And it's ok for Matsumoto to fart like that?

215
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,980
Whatever

216
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,310
People fart.  And I'm gonna fart a lot more too.

217
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,740
Do you have to put your butt in people's faces when you do?

218
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,740
You were directing the smell our way right?

219
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,030
Honestly, you've got to cut that stuff out
--Everyone did already

220
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,590
7:00 P.M
1 Hour has passed since the game started

221
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,050
Fujiwara has arrived to bring the four to bathe

222
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,490
I'm coming in

223
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,160
There's a bath prepared for the dirty likes of you

224
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,600
Hurry up and get there

225
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,030
You guys stink

226
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,910
Hurry up cause there's a bath for the dirty likes of you

227
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,990
Stinkers

228
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,870
Stinkers?!

229
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,580
Just go straight ahead

230
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,790
The board above the room reads:
Matsumoto, Cocorico, and Mr. "Other"

231
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,030
This sign is dangerous

232
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:18,170
Our four happen to come across Ms.Nakai and her adulterous lover

233
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,950
Oh geez this is getting bad

234
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:45,540
Fake commercial poster for
condoms featuring their producer,Gasu

235
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,770
I wish they'd stop pushing Gasu on us

236
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:07,380
Matsumoto the Menace tries to make the others laugh
by leaving his penis poking out of the top of his towel

237
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,960
Excuse me

238
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,940
Give it a rest Matsumoto

239
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,550
Oh this is nice

240
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
Now I feel like I'm at a hot spring

241
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,390
Feels good

242
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,530
I was beginning to think they wouldn't let us in

243
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,780
Man this feels good

244
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,100
Here enters a strange old geezer

245
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,610
He starts to wash his dentures in the pool

246
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,510
That was close!

247
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,120
Especially the last part as he was getting out

248
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,200
Here enters Black Bob who is susceptible to hot water

249
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,700
Ew hot

250
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,330
hot

251
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:20,510
hot hot

252
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:20,960
hot hot hot

253
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,770
hot hot hot hot

254
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,220
hot hot hot hot hot

255
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,050
Matsumoto on the edge of laughing

256
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:34,910
Hot

257
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,260
Aw damn, thats gonna hurt pretty bad since i'm naked!!

258
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,260
Damn I do feel for you!

259
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,330
That sucks

260
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,090
That really hurts

261
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,860
The four quickly exit the pool

262
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,530
Further surprises await our fed up four outside the pool

263
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,050
Where did I leave my underwear?

264
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:40,050
Black Bob searches for his
underwear in the changing room

265
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,050
I can't find my underwear

266
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,380
Pull it out

267
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:13,880
Pull it out! Pull it!!

268
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,380
Pull it out! Pull! Pull!!

269
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:14,980
Pull it out! Pull! Pull! Pull!!

270
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,310
Whoa, it's deep!!

271
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,150
It stings for a long time even after you pull it out

272
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:35,470
Endo clothes have been switched with the pro wrestler costume of Dynamite
Shikkoku (a reference to a comedy skit character created by Endo years ago)

273
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,710
OK, I got it

274
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,490
I am absolutely not going to laugh from here on out

275
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,430
Did I bring this with me?

276
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,910
Yamasaki, do you remember me having this coming in?

277
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,660
Yama-chan discovers Black Bob's
missing underwear

278
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,090
Wait

279
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,440
Hold on a sec

280
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,330
It's gonna hurt

281
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,410
With nothing else to wear, Endo leaves
the room wearing the wrestler costume

282
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,800
It's a disadvantage, that is, cause Endo's just fine with it

283
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,480
Dynamite Shikkoku Sighted!!

284
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,230
Something stinks in here

285
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,310
Excuse me?

286
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,380
There's something stinking up the place
--Yea something stinks

287
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,380
You think so?

288
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,440
It stinks

289
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,440
What does it smells like, do you think?

290
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,940
I don't smell anything

291
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,280
It's kinda like a foot odor

292
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,090
That's it!

293
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,430
It's that sock over there!

294
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,690
Aha so it was a sock

295
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,380
Wanna whiff it?

296
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,420
It's that smell example from the last game

297
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,130
The thing they always throw out in the show

298
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,640
What a stench!
--Damn what a stench!

299
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,710
I don't smell anything

300
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,600
Why don't you try smelling this

301
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Ugh this stinks

302
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,420
I don't smell anything

303
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,420
Some sense (of smell) he's got there

304
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,890
Oooowwwww!!

305
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,300
Tanaka, you idiot, get rid of that sock

306
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,010
It's stinky

307
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,810
This is incredibly smelly

308
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,610
Find some place to stick it in

309
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,870
Put it in that

310
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,040
Makes me sick

311
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,440
Are you going to put it with the crayfish?

312
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,140
Oh look, those things are still in there

313
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,660
I was just laughing cause they were still there

314
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,170
Well it is a Batsu (penalty) game after all

315
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,800
Oowww!

316
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,220
It hit the bone

317
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,360
We're standing at the gates of hell this time

318
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,340
Why would they leave those things there?

319
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,340
To make us laugh

320
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,440
Alright I think I've figured it out

321
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,930
We all get along too well

322
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,990
It's one way at work...

323
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,780
and outside work, that kind of relaxed "Oh look they're still there" thing

324
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,740
it's that "Oh look they're still there" way you said it...

325
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,530
And this guy here saying "Oh I don't smell anything"

326
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,480
This place reeks of your efforts to get the other person to laugh

327
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,170
I think you'd better throw that way of thinking out

328
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,510
I get it now
--Yea me too

329
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,730
We should be thinking about this condition like Pavlovian responses...

330
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,440
It was Matsumoto!

331
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,870
Why!?!

332
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,490
No way!

333
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,530
That was just dirty Matsumoto

334
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,400
You were trying so hard to pull us in so you could get us to laugh

335
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,270
I did not. I was just talking on and I was surprised even myself.

336
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:57,140
Endo, it's getting cold. I wonder if you wouldn't mind changing?

337
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,050
Did he say "cold" or "old"?

338
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,670
yeah, could have been either one

339
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,420
The wrestler act is getting old I said

340
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,950
Nothing else to change into, but why don't you put the robe on over it ?

341
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,500
What?

342
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,470
What are you doing?

343
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,970
I'm biting my cheek, you know that soft part right there

344
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,320
Like this

345
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,370
Doesn't it sting?

346
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,370
It's like leather

347
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,830
Endo, would you mind doing the octopus dance?

348
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,370
You can stop - it's not that interesting

349
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,250
Excuse me

350
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:42,090
There's a guest here to see Mr. Green Pea(Endo)

351
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:48,030
Mr.Fukuwari Ryo has come to see
them and has brought sweets

352
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,170
Please have a seat

353
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,290
I wasn't sure what you like but I brought some goodies for you

354
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,550
Oh why thank you

355
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,340
Mind if I try one?

356
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,690
Go right ahead

357
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:19,990
This is good stuff. You did good.

358
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,120
For some reason a foreigner sneaks into the room

359
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,560
Hey Fukawa

360
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,560
Tell me that thing you heard?

361
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,940
I'm really sorry but I'm talking with friends right now

362
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,640
Come on, tell me what you heard

363
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,790
Tell me what you heard

364
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,210
Look, I can't right now

365
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,720
Tell me what you heard

366
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,600
Tell me what you heard

367
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,750
Ok, but just this one time

368
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,790
"Don't get mad just because I used the corner of the eraser"

369
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,080
the eraser...

370
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,840
the eraser's...corner

371
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,710
Again again

372
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,100
You suck Fukawa

373
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,630
What? Who the hell makes those calls?

374
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,760
What's this all about Fukawa?

375
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,760
I don't really know

376
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,810
Oh you know, all right

377
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,510
the eraser's...corner

378
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,720
Persistent little bugger, aren't you?

379
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,500
Go home! Would you just get him out of here now?
--Yea, get out of here!

380
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,950
Really, thanks for coming all this way and for the treats (goodbye)

381
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,340
You're making me look bad

382
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,770
You need to go home, seriously

383
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,210
Eras...

384
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,080
Era...

385
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,650
Elas...

386
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,990
rubber thingee...

387
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,060
Eraser's...corner

388
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,540
"rubber thingee"???

389
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,360
Fukawa!

390
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,010
We're telling you to go home

391
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,440
You've got quite a fan there Fukawa

392
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,410
You don't need to do that thing here

393
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,460
It's not as if I purposely brought him here with me

394
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,870
The fact is that this guy isn't leaving until you leave

395
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,570
You have to go home now

396
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,620
Don't misunderstand me

397
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,550
"Don't get mad just because I used the corner of the eraser"

398
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,610
Eraser

399
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,590
Eraser's corner

400
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,650
Elaser's corner?

401
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,170
Again again

402
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,020
This guy just doesn't take a hint

403
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,550
Doesn't make a move to leave

404
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,900
Go home!
--We've had enough already

405
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,500
I'm leaving (Fukawa)

406
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,610
For some reason Endo got two darts!

407
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,210
Ow

408
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:18,710
Ow Ow

409
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,210
Ow Ow Ow

410
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:19,780
Ow Ow Ow Ow

411
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,780
One more?

412
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,820
"Don't get mad just because I used the corner of the eraser"

413
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,750
Excuse me. So sorry

414
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,150
It would be bad if we kept getting stung like this through to tomorrow morning

415
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,480
Our butts will be swiss cheese!

416
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,720
Oh boy...

417
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,550
Those were some posters they did of Gus

418
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,790
yeah, pretty well done. Almost got me.

419
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,630
Not much in the way of an ad design

420
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,330
But it still catches your attention

421
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:08,380
It has a way of burning itself into your mind
--Yes indeed

422
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:12,440
You laugh when, for no reason, your mind thinks back on it

423
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,760
All it takes is one solid moment to find its way in

424
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,460
you laughed...

425
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,420
No, I was nodding my head in agreement

426
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,070
I can't believe that counted!

427
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,590
He made me do it!

428
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,010
Hold on!

429
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,300
I said hold on

430
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,970
This is barbarous

431
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,120
Barbarous I tell you

432
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,700
We were talking about those favorite posters of yours
--Yes we were

433
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,560
the fact that those posters are such attention grabbers

434
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,720
They're ballsy

435
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:16,700
Hey Yamasaki, you need to tighten up just before the dart hits.
If you move around too much, it hurts more.

436
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,920
That inviting smile of yours...

437
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,130
Are you laughing?

438
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,830
Are you mad?

439
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,150
Matsumoto, is that your 'busting out laughing' face?

440
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,660
I think you're laughing

441
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,450
Absolutely, he's laughing

442
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,310
Am not, I just feel strange.

443
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,180
Tell me his face doesn't look funny

444
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,170
It does?

445
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,880
That face gets misread

446
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,680
It's a quirky grin

447
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,200
You always have a half smile on your face

448
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,720
It invites laughter you know

449
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,970
Don't I normally wear this face?

450
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,380
With puffy skin under the eyes

451
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,270
Oh damn you guys!

452
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:38,610
Only two hours in, the four are steadily becoming being prey for the blowdarts

453
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,860
And now that wolf returns to their room

454
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,840
Listen up

455
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,890
Hamada..I mean..the likes of you...

456
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,720
I didn't laugh at all!

457
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,140
We weren't laughing!

458
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,620
Fujiwara, you can't talk funny like that

459
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,050
That was totally Fujiwara's doing

460
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,520
How many times are you going to screw up trying to correct yourself?

461
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,200
Even for the likes of asses like you...

462
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,620
Hamada has told me to prepare...

463
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,230
..a meal...heh heh

464
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,220
Am I the only one called for laughing?

465
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,550
Just me???

466
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,470
Cut it out Fujiwara.
--Come on.

467
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:32,120
Can you give us the short version? And in one go? We'll wait.

468
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:38,600
Hamada's kindness truly extends across the Northern Hemisphere

469
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,600
The meal is ready

470
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,300
in the main room

471
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,750
This is ridiculous

472
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,070
Please take your time and enjoy

473
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,950
Is it a real meal?

474
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,950
Lucky us

475
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,990
Ijiri Okuta is for some reason eating here

476
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,420
Our friend Fukuwa is
here also

477
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,000
What are you doing here Fukawa?

478
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,430
I won't bother you this time

479
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,870
What about you Ijiri?

480
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,020
I had some work in the area

481
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,080
I had some work in the area
So I stopped in

482
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:49,980
You were laughing the whole time
--Damn right you were

483
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,800
Easy on me please

484
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Thank you
--Thank you
--Thank you

485
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,230
It's nice to have a full meal

486
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,060
Pardon me

487
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:24,000
I hear that the chef would like to meet you.  Is that alright?

488
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:34,670
A black sushi chef
enters the room

489
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:08,470
Please feel free to ask any questions about your meal

490
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,580
Mr. Tanaka, do you have any to ask the chef?

491
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,330
From what ocean were the fish taken from?

492
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,330
Dunno

493
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,240
Mr. Matsumoto, have you any questions?

494
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,170
What do you call this?

495
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,780
Dunno

496
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,770
Yamasaki, you've got to cut that out already

497
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,820
I'm sick of this. How long is this going to go on?

498
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,370
Is everything satisfactory?

499
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,340
Excuse us

500
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,110
What kind of work?

501
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,110
Impersonations

502
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:27,320
Who did you come with?  You're not alone are you?

503
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,660
You mean what comedian I'm working with?

504
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,660
A sweaty old man

505
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,860
Did he go home already?

506
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:42,980
It's quite popular work, really taking off

507
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,740
You laughed didn't you?

508
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:51,980
Did you really have to ask him that question?

509
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,050
What kind of work is that??

510
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,060
It's late so I'm heading back to the room

511
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,500
You staying long?

512
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Overnight

513
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,910
Where to next?

514
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:09,900
Kofu

515
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:10,890
Huh?

516
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,890
Kofu

517
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,530
I just sucked in a breath

518
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,530
when he said he was going to Kofu

519
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,300
It will be quite something

520
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,270
everyone's rear after this is over

521
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,230
that's for sure...

522
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,980
they'll be peppered with sting wounds

523
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,230
and the ass isn't that clean

524
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,210
That's gross

525
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,260
Oh well

526
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,930
Make him stop that

527
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,930
What the hell you doing?

528
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,530
What do you want us to do? You did it to yourself.

529
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:57,550
When you try to do stuff like that, you fall into your own trap

530
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,530
Right?

531
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,780
Dig your own grave

532
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,480
You have a double eyelid?

533
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,480
yeah

534
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,700
Oh I see it now

535
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,120
Matsumoto, don't you have a double lid?

536
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,680
They really gave it to you this time

537
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,800
Probably ticked them off wiggling as much as you did

538
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,880
It must be close to 8 o'clock by now

539
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,460
--What's wrong?

540
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,250
It looks like he's about to laugh

541
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,650
They just said you're out

542
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:12,530
Why am I out?

543
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,490
Another deep one they gave you

544
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,440
Why only me? What about Tanaka?

545
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,130
Really, what happened just then?

546
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,650
He was making a strange face

547
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:40,070
And right as I was thinking "what are you doing over there"

548
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:44,400
He fell into his own trap I think

549
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,260
There's something wrong with whoever's judging

550
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:52,410
I didn't laugh one bit

551
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,670
What's wrong with you?

552
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,100
Seriously what's wrong with you?

553
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,490
I couldn't do it with a straight face

554
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,270
It's impossible

555
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,970
You were trying to make us laugh the whole time, weren't you?

556
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:00,820
I thought I'd put on an interesting face,
but then my insides went all funny on me

557
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,500
Excuse me

558
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,530
Mr. Green Pea(Endo), a guest is here to see you

559
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:14,590
It's decided then, they're going to call you Mr. Green Pea to the end.

560
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,160
The Hayashi Couple, Pe & Pahko stop in
on their way home from work

561
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:27,640
We were just working in the area, a couple towns over, not far

562
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,890
Hey Endo, long time no see

563
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:36,640
I've been thinking your Downtown show could use a new opening song

564
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,780
Downtown Downtown the raccoon's balls...

565
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:45,730
are swinging hard and there's no wind blowing

566
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:52,210
Plenty of people come to Ishiwa Hot Springs right?

567
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:55,900
Well I was talking to Ms. Nakai and she tells me, very serious like,

568
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,580
"I'm not a member of SMAP" (famous boy band with many rotating members)

569
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:07,600
You know that song of theirs?  I'll sing it.

570
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:31,190
This is for you

571
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:32,990
These are the best

572
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:38,750
There are ten, but two are enough

573
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:46,670
I don't know if I know them, but the conversation's getting dull so adios

574
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,710
Sorry

575
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:58,280
That was a close one

576
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,530
Man, she laughs a lot

577
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,320
I was so close, I even let out a little noise

578
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,930
It's been three hours

579
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:12,410
The time is 9 o'clock and there are a few more visitors for our four

580
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,870
What are you doing?

581
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,750
I've been waiting this whole time

582
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,260
Itao Itsuji
(Comedian)

583
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,030
How long will you make your superior wait?

584
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,500
How can you NOT laugh at that?

585
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,160
Tanaka

586
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,620
I'll be waiting for you downstairs

587
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,170
Why is he wearing that suit?

588
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,960
What's between you two?

589
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,490
What's with those clothes?

590
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,610
Your laugh was perfectly obvious

591
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:26,040
You mean that counts?

592
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,550
Come on!

593
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,010
He had a chauffeur with him

594
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,350
Similar to those corporate consortiums

595
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,960
Like he's there to watch out for some rich brat

596
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,740
It feels like he's an old era caretaker for rich people

597
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,260
Like Taisho family
--Yeah, like for the Taisho imperial family

598
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,650
What are you doing?

599
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,160
Seriously, what are you doing?

600
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,920
I've been waiting this whole time

601
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,340
Everyone's waiting

602
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,170
Are you going or aren't you?

603
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,490
Endo disguises his laugher by drinking water

604
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,530
Which is it?

605
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,640
I was really looking forward to this trip

606
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:45,010
What can we do about this?

607
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:04,160
Tanaka, I'll be waiting for you

608
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,350
Why not go with him?

609
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,480
This hellish night has just begun

610
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,180
Those things bite

611
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,890
Yeah

612
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,650
Those darts don't just stick into your clothes

613
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,650
It goes into your ass
--Yes it goes right through into your ass

614
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,390
Yamasaki, your normal expression tends to naturally look like you are smiling

615
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,390
Right, but I also don't have wrinkles

616
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,390
Even when you didn't laugh, you still get punished

617
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:44,840
Those penalties weren't all the same either

618
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,730
Yeah your's weren't fair

619
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:50,960
They were nice when they were doing Tanaka

620
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,960
And for me it's like "Bam"

621
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,580
So unfair eh?

622
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:01,580
Endo you covered your laugh by drinking water

623
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,470
Yea he did that twice
--This guy here pretends he's drinking water

624
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,450
Yeah that was just wrong

625
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:09,060
I saw that and was like "geez"

626
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:09,520
Fujiwara did a good job

627
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:17,520
No way, he was really irritating with his weird attitude and
and his girly clothes...

628
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,400
10PM - 4 hours have passed since starting

629
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,900
While the four took an interview with a (fake) African tv crew

630
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,780
Hamada arrived on the scene

631
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,930
This is a batsu game, not a vacation!

632
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,100
Tanaka

633
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:38,850
How do you find this "Don't Laugh" batsu game?

634
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:42,810
Say it in a north
eastern dialect

635
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:50,280
I think it's pretty hard

636
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,040
He's so laughing right there. Call out Matsumoto.

637
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,490
What? That should have been ok!

638
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,000
That's strict! Too strict!

639
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,890
Suck it up

640
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,860
No doubt about it - Hamada is here

641
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,840
It hurts

642
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,180
Could I have you take a look at my ass?

643
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,970
It feels like it's getting bad down there

644
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,790
Whoa! It's totally sprinkled with marks
--What?!!!

645
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,290
This is going to leave a scar forever

646
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,260
Show us the whole thing

647
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,510
Not just the upper back part

648
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,220
Don't spaz on me

649
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,490
The judges are cracking down hard now

650
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,490
I got lucky just now

651
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,850
Add 1 more dot to the count

652
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,590
The four check their butts though the mirror without thinking

653
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:38,200
Its 10:30

654
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,350
Still another 10 hours to go

655
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,400
Did I scare you?

656
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,790
Our asses are a mess

657
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,470
That's part of a batsu game. Right?

658
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,620
But it'll leave a grudge

659
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,150
Huh??

660
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,410
Why'd you have to go and make a face like that?

661
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,750
My way of talking is normal

662
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:54,360
Who has been hit the most?

663
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,320
Endo        Matsumoto          Yamasaki         Tanaka







Cause they're calling me out when I'm not laughing

664
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,830
Endo        Matsumoto          Yamasaki         Tanaka







You go back there and tell them there's something wrong with their judge

665
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:04,080
Endo        Matsumoto          Yamasaki         Tanaka







Rather you laughed I bet

666
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,080
Endo        Matsumoto          Yamasaki         Tanaka







No, they do it to me anyway

667
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,670
and they go soft on sweet Tanaka

668
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,280
We're all accountable for our fate

669
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,450
Not here it seems

670
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,070
Guys, don't get confrontational

671
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:16,410
Huh?

672
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:23,990
You were obviously laughing!

673
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:25,680
Endo hides his laugh by drinking water again

674
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,990
and you did it again

675
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:29,990
And he always get away with it

676
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:33,600
I said it sounds...(Laughs)

677
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:38,640
Aww man

678
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,230
That definitely hurt right?

679
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:54,390
Let's change the mood a bit

680
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,190
Let's play a game

681
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,800
An easy game, everyone plays it

682
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:05,820
Impersonations, Past, Present, East and West!!!

683
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:13,480
Answer a certain question while impersonating
an appropriate character

684
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:13,390
Give an answer while doing an impersonation

685
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,000
You know the drill, right? You've done it before.

686
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,610
Ready? Here we go

687
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:19,690
Starting with Endo

688
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:24,730
Name something red in the style of Mr. Morishige Ichi

689
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:29,230
Pasta

690
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:31,030
What the hell did you say?!

691
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,920
Post, like our mailbox

692
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,560
Come on, look at the player guys

693
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:45,340
You've got to watch to see if the impersonation is good or not!

694
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:51,550
Again, name something red in the style of Mr. Morishige Ichi

695
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:56,950
Apple

696
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,490
Yamasaki, something red

697
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,730
Lamp

698
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,510
I can't handle this game anymore!

699
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,950
I can't do it

700
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:28,460
Spare me this once!

701
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,660
What was it you said?

702
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,280
Uh, lighter

703
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,360
You said "lamp"
--Ah lamp?

704
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,520
You're mixing them up!

705
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:45,740
In a game like this, there's a penalty expected with that!

706
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,170
Lamps would categorically include lighters

707
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,210
Fine, might as well call any damn thing red and it'd be fine then

708
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,830
Did I really say "lamp"?

709
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:56,830
You said "lamp"
--Yea you said "lamp"

710
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,410
Even so, that still counts doesn't it?

711
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,210
The answer doesn't matter, it's whether you laugh or not, right?

712
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,210
Well YOU thought it was red

713
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:06,210
I did. I really did!
- You meant the flame part right?

714
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:08,870
The flame part, exactly

715
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,120
Ok, let's continue on

716
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:17,690
Name something green in the style of Mr. Kuwata Kesukei

717
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:19,690
Start with Endo

718
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:23,810
Look at him!

719
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:28,760
He's doing a tough impersonation, so pay him some respect

720
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,460
Yamasaki, look at him!

721
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:44,070
Ehhhhh?! Seriously?!!
--You laughed!

722
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,500
He thought his impersonation was going to be so funny

723
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,560
Here we go

724
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:02,880
Name something green in the style of Mr. Kuwata Kesukei

725
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,230
Watch him now

726
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:08,010
Bell pepper

727
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:24,560
What the hell ....seriously!

728
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,710
Stop this game already!

729
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:47,880
This is so dirty. My ass...

730
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:50,310
What are you talking about "fever"?

731
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,650
Bell pepper. I said "bell pepper"

732
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:55,810
Its cause of the Kesukei impersonation

733
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:59,050
You gotta try harder not to laugh at things like that

734
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:01,480
Next - Matsumoto

735
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,800
Name something green in the style of Mr. Kuwata Kesukei

736
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:10,030
Watch him. Watch his face!

737
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:17,230
??#@$%??

738
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,660
What was that?

739
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,660
What did you say?

740
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,170
I wanted to say "Whole grain batter"

741
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:40,540
The pipers are coming out in force

742
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,230
Yamasaki, you better watch yourself

743
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:53,050
Yamasaki, you're supposed to look this way

744
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,920
You can't avoid looking at his face

745
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,790
I've been laughing this whole time and I can't understand it

746
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,570
This whole thing is just too silly

747
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:06,650
I swear i'm not gonna laugh again!

748
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:10,250
We're going to change it up and jump to Yamasaki

749
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,670
I'm making it so, as of now, you can laugh as much as you want

750
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:36,980
Everyone is free to laugh for the moment

751
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:24,650
I was so happy when you did this

752
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:29,060
It cut the stress in half

753
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:36,170
Ok, ready

754
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:42,110
Green thing, in the style of Kuwata Kesukei

755
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:44,630
Everyone look at him. Look at his face.

756
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:49,940
Long grass

757
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:56,870
I couldn't understand what you said

758
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:58,870
Grass grass grass grass

759
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,340
What are you doing?

760
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,500
No! It was these two men!

761
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:08,930
What the...!
--It was Yamasaki

762
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,910
Why why?

763
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:14,330
It was those two!

764
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,950
Are you serious?

765
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,950
Wait just a second!

766
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,710
What the hell man!

767
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,840
Can we stop playing now?

768
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:31,800
Luckily for Matsumoto, he managed to escape his punishment

769
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,590
I heard "gra-ass"

770
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:36,590
You have to use the right accent

771
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:38,910
At least I wasn't saying "gra-asses"

772
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,780
11 o'clock, and our four are 5 hours in

773
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:48,090
The cruel batsu game calculated by Hamada still continues

774
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:53,310
Oh I forgot I had something for you. Let me go get it.

775
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:56,820
That's ok.
--We've had quite enough.

776
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:05,730
I wonder what it will be, oh I wonder what it will be.

777
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:09,690
There we go

778
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:11,690
What is that thing?

779
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:14,820
It says what will happen...next time you laugh

780
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:21,510
Hamada's Special :- Batsu game dice

781
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,750
The stuff on there looks bad

782
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:22,920
A slap

783
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,920
Thai kick
--Thai kick one gonna suck!

784
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:30,960
Only options are either a Slap or Thai Kick!

785
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:31,920
Getting a Thai kick is awful

786
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,710
A slap doesn't feel so good either

787
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:38,040
Let's play "Gopher Nose Hairs"

788
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:44,260
The one who pulls the least nose hairs receive the penalty

789
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,940
The one with the fewest, right?

790
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:52,450
This is separated from the laughing rule?

791
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:53,350
Huh?

792
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:55,510
Laughing has nothing to do with this, right?

793
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,400
Ready, Set.

794
01:08:58,210 --> 01:08:59,650
Go

795
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:03,430
Give it a good yank and put them down on the table

796
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:06,310
I got nothing

797
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:10,000
Oh! I think I laughed

798
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:18,730
It was funny I didn't have any hairs

799
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:25,840
It's a slap

800
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:27,910
Matsumoto Receives a Slap!!

801
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,450
Who is doing it?

802
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:43,480
You're doing it???

803
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:50,050
What the hell was that?!
--Get back and pull those hairs!

804
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,400
Count how many hairs

805
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:04,640
You're supposed to pull hair!

806
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:09,410
Look

807
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:11,410
Ok, you got 1

808
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:12,200
Matsumoto?

809
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,200
I have 0

810
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,420
Whoa, how many do you have there??

811
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:32,810
Thai Kick!!

812
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:38,150
Matsumoto & Tanaka receive a Thai Kick!!

813
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:36,950
Which of us goes first?

814
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:39,380
Whomever, now stand up

815
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:41,810
Oh no, not this guy again!!

816
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:48,910
Oh no no no! Let Tanaka go first please! Let him go first please!
--No no! Let Matsumoto go first!

817
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:11,340
My God!!

818
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:15,210
This is hell!

819
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:18,360
We're in hell !

820
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,780
I hate this

821
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,380
I've been slapped, kicked and everything

822
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,270
Hey Yamasaki

823
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:28,530
I didn't do it

824
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:30,530
That's not what I mean

825
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:31,950
This is hell isn't it?

826
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,570
You bet your ass it is

827
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:35,460
Isn't this worse than the Demon Jail game (24 Hour Tag)?

828
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:38,160
How could you say that?

829
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,590
This is really bad
--Seriously?

830
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:43,830
Yeah
--Everyones asses are speckled with red dots, look!

831
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:49,410
I can't see what the fuss is about cause it's only temporary

832
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:51,410
No, these things will leave a mark, look

833
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,410
Jeez!

834
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:56,250
You weren't kidding

835
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,850
What a huge ass you have here!

836
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,770
That was slutty!

837
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:14,610
There's no need to wiggle it around like that

838
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:18,390
He talks like he wants sympathy, but really he's being funny

839
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:23,530
Cause he wants to add one more mark to his senior's posterior

840
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:26,950
He's fun teasing, you know?

841
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,910
Look at mine

842
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:34,060
Yamasaki, look at it

843
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,440
Do I have any?

844
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,890
Hold on there!

845
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,140
Why? Stop!

846
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:56,110
Thai Kick

847
01:12:56,110 --> 01:13:01,470
Yamasaki receives Thai Kick!!

848
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:03,470
Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh Shit!

849
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:17,710
He used his strong leg on him

850
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:22,660
The sound it made was a deep thud (Like boom)!

851
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:28,060
Our four are making instant Yakisoba (fried noodles)
- a gift given by Hamada

852
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:31,030
It'll make a crackling noise as it cooks

853
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:54,260
I'm done through, Tanaka!

854
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:58,220
We made these plans a year ago

855
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:11,720
Are you really not going?

856
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,620
Why are you being like this?

857
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:29,360
I thought we were friends!

858
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,790
You're going

859
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:43,850
Itao throws a bag at Tanaka

860
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:49,340
I can't take it anymore!

861
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:06,270
I'll be waiting!!

862
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:17,340
Just tell him you can't go

863
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,300
But they made plans a year ago

864
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:30,210
A nice, easy 3 minutes passed for the rest of us

865
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:36,870
I'm going to use the toilet
--I'll go with you.

866
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,150
Only one urinal available

867
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:14,950
What just happened?

868
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:17,200
You scared me!

869
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:19,990
They went to the bathroom

870
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,990
Something must have happened in the bathroom

871
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,290
What do you think it was?

872
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,290
No one even laughed

873
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:32,770
I'm scared now!

874
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:44,200
6 hours have passed and the time is now midnight

875
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:49,510
Our four accompany Hamada to a live show in the performance hall

876
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:55,810
A fake poster advertising "Gasu's moving Zoo"

877
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:07,600
Yet another fake poster

878
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,950
The show will be over on that stage there

879
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,340
Buzz!!

880
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:31,010
A mysterious conductor
makes his entrance

881
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:37,850
With that, let me introduce our performers

882
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:44,240
The man who represents Japan, a comedian of extraordinary talent

883
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,530
Yamashita Shigenori

884
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:45,540
And thank you very much

885
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:50,130
Next up, our second performer of the evening

886
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:53,280
Yazawa Eikichi

887
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:09,480
Yazawa Eikichi
(Producer Nakamura)

888
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:25,050
The mic's not turned on!

889
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:37,920
He was singing the "unplugged" version

890
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:49,090
Eikichi makes an encore appearance

891
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,730
He should've got a working mic!

892
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,510
His voice is so low!

893
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,000
Tell 'em to stop pushing him on us

894
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,250
He's done it twice already
--Yea it sucks

895
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:30,670
Yazawa, do it again

896
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:35,980
Keep your eyes open

897
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:56,590
Ha

898
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,260
He said "ha", who sings "ha"??

899
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:15,230
What's he singing "ha" for?

900
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,530
How long will this gag last?

901
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:23,530
I have no Idea

902
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,290
I think it's only for tonight

903
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:29,290
We're slipping if we are thinking that is funny

904
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:38,450
Lastly, let's give a warm welcome to one of Japan's bright stars

905
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,910
Matsuura Aya
(Played by Maeda ken)

906
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:02,390
I'm gonna bust a gut!

907
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:15,660
Laugh and enjoy it to the end

908
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,120
Those moves were awful

909
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,800
Thanks so much everyone. Goodnight!

910
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:31,360
Tanaka's included. All three, ok?

911
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:34,060
Come on!

912
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,160
There's no stopping that show once its started

913
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:59,180
It's like they think it's not such a bad thing

914
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:04,220
12:30 am - Our four wash off and refresh

915
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:09,260
However, more traps lie in wait for them

916
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:22,220
What were you doing in that last scene?

917
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:25,820
You didn't think anyone was watching you then

918
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:30,320
So what if you were doing it without thinking

919
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,750
That's a sickness

920
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:37,970
I didn't know whether that time counted in the game

921
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:42,020
And that water just wouldn't come out

922
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:47,150
We're heading into the final stretch,
but how was it up to this point?

923
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,670
Looking back on it, how was it?

924
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:54,080
Things really changed after Hamada showed up on the scene

925
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:57,860
Endo was amazing I thought.
He knew right away when Hamada was there.

926
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:00,830
It got stricter didn't it?

927
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:03,980
It was so obvious

928
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,950
1 am

929
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:11,010
Something is about to happen to Matsumoto and Tanaka

930
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:18,840
Matsumoto notices that his clothes were swapped off

931
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:29,820
Tanaka too notices the change in his clothes

932
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:39,540
Tanaka and Matsumoto are directed
to wear the "Pink lady" clothes

933
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:50,700
Pink ladies on the scene!

934
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:11,130
Our four have been completely silent
since returning from the bath

935
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,710
You can change out of that now

936
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:24,280
The tissue box and bug spray on the table are blocking the shot

937
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:28,510
Wadda ya think you're doing?

938
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:44,260
It's here!
--Oh wow

939
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,600
Premium fruits

940
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:51,910
A gift bestowed by Hamada for the likes of you

941
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:55,060
Hamada's kindness is truly...

942
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:58,480
..truly a mystery of the Orient

943
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,230
What a load of crock!
--Yeah

944
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:07,570
Its no mystery

945
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:13,420
Gripe while you eat

946
01:28:13,690 --> 01:28:15,220
Do what?

947
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:17,020
Complain I think?

948
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:20,530
Everyone gripe while you eat

949
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:24,310
Ugh, I hate this

950
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:27,460
I don't want to take any melon
--Me neither

951
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,520
Why does it have to look so good

952
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:34,660
Come on, let me eat

953
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:45,830
It was only a slight one

954
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:48,080
You should know that you deserve it

955
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:52,670
OUCH!! It hurts so bad!!

956
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:53,840
THAT HURT!!

957
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,530
That settles it, I'm not going to laugh anymore

958
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:01,220
What's the deal with this pineapple?

959
01:29:04,910 --> 01:29:06,170
Gimme a break

960
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,870
It goes down so easy

961
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,570
So firm in my mouth

962
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:17,610
5 minutes later, our four are still griping!

963
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,830
It's such a cool temperature

964
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:28,940
I want to eat this stuff tomorrow too

965
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,970
It's been sometime since we ate a meal like that

966
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:38,210
You ate like you hadn't had a meal for some time

967
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:45,230
Don't chew while you talk

968
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:48,480
Is it ok to chew and talk like that?

969
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,810
Can't help that

970
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:57,210
The speed at which it shoots out is faster

971
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:03,600
That's enough griping

972
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,980
We'll be listening to some radio now.
Could you turn on the switch?

973
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:12,780
This thing here?

974
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,460
It's Monday and you know what that means -

975
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:32,400
So let's get right to it. Welcome to Heipo's "All Night Standards"

976
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,990
Tell us about your evening lifestyle

977
01:30:55,530 --> 01:31:00,660
I haven't had one for years

978
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:03,270
Don't you go through mail?

979
01:31:03,810 --> 01:31:08,050
Are we out of time already? I wish we had more.

980
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:11,560
Time flies as the saying goes

981
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,560
Until we meet next time

982
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:17,320
Stay Mediocre!

983
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:24,520
By the way, what did Ijiri actually do for this game?

984
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,760
I thought he'd show up with Fukawa

985
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,110
I can see that

986
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:32,890
Ijiri really can smoke those cigarettes

987
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,690
Excuse me

988
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:37,570
Speak of the devil

989
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,800
I was about to go to bed...

990
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:46,210
but I couldn't without apologizing for earlier

991
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:51,160
I brought some ramen to say I'm sorry

992
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:55,300
I'm really sorry

993
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,810
That's very noble of you

994
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,460
Hey Fukawa

995
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:07,900
Tell me that thing you heard

996
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:11,050
Will you just cut that out?

997
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:14,740
I'm only going to do this once

998
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:16,450
then you have to go home

999
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,060
Tell me that thing you heard

1000
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:23,660
Don't get mad just because I used the corner of the eraser

1001
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:28,160
The eraser's corner you say?

1002
01:32:30,230 --> 01:32:31,490
Go home

1003
01:32:37,070 --> 01:32:38,960
Take him home already

1004
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:52,010
Don't get mad just because I used the corner of the eraser

1005
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:54,350
The eraser's corner you say?

1006
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,780
By yourself! You cheater!

1007
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:01,460
By yourself! You cheater!

1008
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:06,050
I'll do it for you too, so relax

1009
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:14,330
Don't get mad just because I used the corner of the eraser

1010
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:19,100
The eraser's corner!

1011
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:36,300
My ass!

1012
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:39,360
Again

1013
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:42,150
Again Again Again

1014
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:46,470
Don't get mad just because I used the corner of the eraser

1015
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:48,720
The eraser's corner!

1016
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:55,380
Is the roof on your house low?

1017
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,620
The eraser's corner!

1018
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:03,480
Uh, he said something different this time

1019
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,070
Yo, Fukawa told you something different

1020
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:10,680
I'm not with them!

1021
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:14,370
I didn't laugh, come on you guys!

1022
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:16,890
Why do you have to pick on me?

1023
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:24,180
Fukawa, make them go home

1024
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:27,420
We get it already

1025
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,560
He told him something different though

1026
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,820
Again!

1027
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:34,820
We've moved on

1028
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:38,850
2 am - eight hours into the game

1029
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:44,250
The fatigue of our four is at its highest, having had few breaks from the fear

1030
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:49,920
Please head to the main hall one by one and by the following order:

1031
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:51,910
Tanaka

1032
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:53,080
Tanaka - Yamasaki

1033
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:54,520
Tanaka - Yamasaki - Endo

1034
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,520
Tanaka - Yamasaki - Endo - Matsumoto

1035
01:34:57,130 --> 01:35:00,370
When one of you returns, the next person goes

1036
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:05,500
Also, don't tell others about it when you get back

1037
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:12,430
Scary
--Creepy indeed

1038
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:17,740
I'm going

1039
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:18,600
First : Tanaka

1040
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,760
This place?

1041
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:28,450
(reading) Please enter from the side door

1042
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,290
What's in here?

1043
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:48,770
Oh come on! Give me a break!

1044
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:52,930
The identity of this mystery person
will be revealed later

1045
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:55,720
You're holding your ass

1046
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:01,030
How'd you do? Did you fail?

1047
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:08,140
2nd : Yamasaki

1048
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:24,140
3rd : Endo

1049
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:46,580
What'd you bring back?

1050
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:48,580
A gift for you

1051
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:53,510
Did you go in?

1052
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:55,850
I couldn't

1053
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,800
You're the last one so make us proud

1054
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,960
What do you mean 'you couldn't'?

1055
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,120
4th : Matsumoto

1056
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:09,440
Tanaka, Yamasaki and Endo all sank due to an unknown trap

1057
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:16,910
And now, to reveal the mystery...

1058
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:24,480
A gathering of Mongolian wrestlers

1059
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,080
Suga Kenji
(Producer)

1060
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:06,780
Impossible, impossible.

1061
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:15,240
So now you know what I meant when I said I couldn't go in

1062
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:18,660
Mongolian wrestlers

1063
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,820
Did you see up to when they started wrestling each other?

1064
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:26,490
I saw, I laughed, but they showed me more anyway

1065
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:30,360
They go at it right up to the end don't they?

1066
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:34,860
Seems they like to blowdart you and kick you out

1067
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,850
They stick to the same pattern

1068
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:39,820
This is the worst

1069
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:48,000
Matsumoto makes a suspicious move

1070
01:38:53,950 --> 01:38:55,660
Would you stop that already?

1071
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:57,730
Why?

1072
01:38:58,270 --> 01:39:03,790
As it gets late, Yamasaki laughs
at even the slightest thing

1073
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:01,690
What is it?

1074
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:11,590
We're fish in a bowl

1075
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:13,480
What are you saying?

1076
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:16,000
You can see it from there

1077
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:17,980
In the window (camera)

1078
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:21,850
And I thought, "oh they're all looking at me!"

1079
01:39:34,450 --> 01:39:36,340
Hold on

1080
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:38,340
Really, please stop it

1081
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,760
I'd say sorry, but they've been focusing on me too often

1082
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,730
That's why I say let them do you guys every now and then

1083
01:40:21,170 --> 01:40:24,430
What the fuck?!! Give me a break, seriously!

1084
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,750
That one was naughty

1085
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:29,630
Hold on, I've got a fever!

1086
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:43,310
Hamada, from the command center, sends an old friend back to their room

1087
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:47,630
and as expected...

1088
01:41:00,990 --> 01:41:03,640
Yazawa Eikichi
(Producer Nakamura)

1089
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:26,790
I almost fell for it when his fingers hit the window

1090
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:32,280
The number of overpowering characters has grown

1091
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,520
It's like the more he appears, the funnier it gets

1092
01:41:41,730 --> 01:41:43,170
I really need to pee

1093
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:54,960
But I don't want to go there

1094
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:04,590
I didn't need to go much that day since they didn't give me water

1095
01:42:05,490 --> 01:42:07,200
You didn't even give us water!

1096
01:42:23,050 --> 01:42:25,570
You scared me!

1097
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:50,320
Geez!

1098
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:03,010
I'm not surprised

1099
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:06,070
What did you expect it to be?

1100
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:08,230
You know what?

1101
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:13,990
I had to stop my pee midstream

1102
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:18,940
So it feels like I didn't even go

1103
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:24,340
You still feel full

1104
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:30,370
3am - the punishment continues 9 hours into the game

1105
01:43:39,110 --> 01:43:42,440
You're tired I bet, but there's still more

1106
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,960
Eh, at this point...

1107
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:51,530
At this point, there are bedspreads over at the shop...

1108
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:54,050
..for the likes of you

1109
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,830
Mistress Fujiwara begins
laughing unexpectedly

1110
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:14,300
Isn't he awful?

1111
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:17,450
So mean

1112
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:21,410
I'm begging you

1113
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:34,910
But now we're heading down to the lobby to test your courage

1114
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:37,700
Courage Testing Time

1115
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:44,540
Our four will pair up and take a stroll through a Japanese garden

1116
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:47,060
Off we go

1117
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:50,570
What did he mean by "courage test"?

1118
01:44:53,370 --> 01:45:01,250
A fake "Missing" poster of producer Gasu

1119
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,530
That was so funny!

1120
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:17,490
Anyone would laugh to look at a poster like that

1121
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:22,890
I don't think things are going to jump out and scare us like before

1122
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:25,230
That wouldn't make much sense

1123
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:28,650
It's outside the rules, and I will trust in the rules.

1124
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:37,290
Scary!

1125
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:42,150
Nishijima
(Singer)

1126
01:46:06,010 --> 01:46:07,900
Village of the damned!

1127
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:09,900
Beware the cursed!

1128
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:12,400
Is that you Heipo?

1129
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,380
You scared the hell out of me

1130
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:15,730
Haven't you already done this gag before?

1131
01:46:15,730 --> 01:46:20,140
Enough already, let go of him

1132
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:22,030
You're totally missing the point of this game

1133
01:46:22,030 --> 01:46:24,010
I'm scared, let's get out of here.

1134
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:26,530
There's nothing scary here

1135
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:30,670
You're getting in my way

1136
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:39,040
Take a glance at that poster on your way out

1137
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:43,450
Watch out for some stuff outside

1138
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:47,590
Be careful not to stare too long or face a terrible fate

1139
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,810
on three...three

1140
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,000
No way

1141
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:05,230
What the hell?
--No way

1142
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:17,380
I hate being scared

1143
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:30,020
Nishijima
(Singer)

1144
01:47:45,830 --> 01:47:48,260
Village of the damned!

1145
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:50,960
Beware the cursed!

1146
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:56,090
I'm scared. Let's leave this place

1147
01:47:57,890 --> 01:48:00,140
Get me out of here!

1148
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,610
They haven't had Heipo do his funny laugh once yet

1149
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:10,990
Endo heads to the bathroom alone

1150
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:36,240
How could they?...

1151
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:50,190
Meanwhile...

1152
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:58,470
That stinks!

1153
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:02,340
Eww smelly!

1154
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:12,420
I forgot about the 'don't laugh' thing

1155
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:17,460
A complete, momentary lapse

1156
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:26,820
I'm definitely NOT going to let them see me laugh

1157
01:49:27,090 --> 01:49:32,040
Is that so?  I heard you from outside, in the hall.

1158
01:49:47,610 --> 01:49:49,330
Tired?

1159
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:52,750
Are you tired?

1160
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:56,170
Its time for lights out

1161
01:49:56,170 --> 01:49:58,420
Then what about the stage lights outside?

1162
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:02,740
Its lights out

1163
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:08,950
4 am - Our four are hoping for some sleep, however...

1164
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:11,380
I can't sleep on that!

1165
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:13,830
I'll get all cramped

1166
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:18,760
I wish I could jump under the pillow, away from the lights

1167
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:25,150
Just laying down horizontal nearly puts me to sleep

1168
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:29,110
Does your butt hurt too?
--Yes
--Yeah

1169
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:34,070
Our fatigued four instantly fall off to sleep

1170
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:44,230
I will be reading a children's story to the likes of you now

1171
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:55,120
A long time ago, there was an old man and woman

1172
01:50:56,110 --> 01:50:59,080
When the old man went to the mountains to cut firewood,

1173
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:02,050
a temple priest appeared before him

1174
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:08,720
and they sat down and had lunch together

1175
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:12,410
Then a merchant brought up the road carrying a large jar...

1176
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:17,180
..came up the road bringing a large jar

1177
01:51:19,610 --> 01:51:22,580
Mistress Fujiwara again starts
laughing unexpectedly

1178
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:26,000
Inside the jar was a cute, lively ba...

1179
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,150
..a cute, LOVELY baby...

1180
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,150
This is awful

1181
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:50,840
What exactly do you think is so funny?

1182
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:53,270
I'm like, wha~??

1183
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:54,800
I don't get it

1184
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:58,850
that face

1185
01:52:05,870 --> 01:52:06,860
Seriously...

1186
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:08,750
Really, give us a break Fujiwara

1187
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:10,750
It's awful

1188
01:52:12,530 --> 01:52:17,750
Our four are close to sleep, but the Devil's Hand,
Hamada, is about to strike again

1189
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:21,090
And that devious plan is this -

1190
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:27,930
Tonight is crucial

1191
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:31,890
"Tonight is crucial" = Longtime
running gag on show)
(see : David Husein, Thane Camus)

1192
01:52:31,890 --> 01:52:35,220
Tonight is crucial

1193
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:25,530
He just won't give up

1194
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:28,950
I saw Endo laughing too

1195
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:36,560
He's so persistent!

1196
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,110
What can we do about this?

1197
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:08,470
Damn it!

1198
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:12,520
Hey! Wait! They called me out!
--He didn't laugh

1199
01:54:25,210 --> 01:54:30,250
7 am - our four greet the morning with only the briefest of respites

1200
01:54:34,930 --> 01:54:36,550
Time to wake up

1201
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:40,780
Hey wake up

1202
01:54:41,950 --> 01:54:44,020
Wake up

1203
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:54,470
Looks like he isn't used to being woken up like that

1204
01:54:57,980 --> 01:54:59,960
Nah... Just joking

1205
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:06,530
Breakfast has been prepared.  Would you please head to the main hall?

1206
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:09,230
What a face you're making there!

1207
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:11,230
Makes one mad

1208
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:16,340
The African TV crew was next to them at breakfast

1209
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:23,990
But our four paid no attention. Obviously they are sick of laughing

1210
01:55:24,530 --> 01:55:30,200
Our four prepare to return home after 14 hours of batsu game

1211
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:36,230
They leave the room together without saying a single word to each other

1212
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:38,750
You were exhausted
--Absolutely

1213
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:59,990
Turn to the resort workers and properly thank them

1214
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:42,210
If you're going to do it, do it right

1215
01:56:54,630 --> 01:57:00,030
Our four's hellish 2 day, 1 night stay is over

1216
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:07,050
But they will carry the pain of the blowdart's needle in their hearts forever

1217
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:15,870
4th Place: Tanaka Naoki - 20 darts

1218
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:23,800
3rd Place: Endo Shozo - 29 darts

1219
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:31,900
2nd Place: Yamasaki Hosei - 39 darts

1220
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:46,660
1st Place: Matsumoto Hitoshi - 52 darts

1221
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:56,650
Altogether, it was 140 darts

1222
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:06,280
Next time, how are we going to determine players? Teams?

1223
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:09,520
As long as we get back at Hamada

1224
01:58:11,770 --> 01:58:13,840
We'll do another 4 against 1, right?

1225
01:58:14,650 --> 01:58:17,980
If you lose, we'll use a blowgun on YOU!

1226
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:22,480
You had quite the face giving orders in the Command Center

1227
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:28,600
Honestly I thought you a dictator

1228
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:34,190
You could take over the world

1229
01:58:34,910 --> 01:58:35,990
He could

1230
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:40,490
Reminds me of Tesla trying to take command of the spaceship Yamato

1231
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:47,510
"Take him to the brig!"

1232
01:58:50,030 --> 01:58:57,860
Those comedians went because they lost a bet, not
because they wanted to taste the blowdarts

1233
01:58:57,860 --> 01:59:07,860
