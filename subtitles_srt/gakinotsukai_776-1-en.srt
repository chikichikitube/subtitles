00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,000
We have a time issue, so this special won't include all of the material

16
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This was a 2 hour special but it still wasn't enough time for all of our punishments

17
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,890

They start the Batsu game where they must not laugh or get punished

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,880
We already seen this scene

26
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,020
So, whatcha ya think? you're going to be studying
here, It's not bad, huh?

27
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,880
but then when they were heading to Morning Assembly...

28
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,110
Hey!

29
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,880
Why were you late?

30
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
My bicycle had a flat tire.

31
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,500
and you?

32
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I overslept.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,300
Come closer

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,000
Why are YOU late?

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
My little sister got sick, so I took her to the hospital.

37
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,000
Why are you late?

38
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,000
My sister got sick a---

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why are you late?

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
My sister--

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You little... come with me!

42
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,000
Principal's greeting

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They were greeted by the Principal and the teachers

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,440
Teacher scolding students for not wearing slippers inside the school

45
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,970
Why aren't you wearing your slippers ?

46
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,970
Don't do that again, now get out of here!

47
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,000
You come closer

48
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,550
Why aren't you wearing your slippers?

49
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,400
Someone is playing a prank on me and took the slippers from my locker.

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
Why aren't you wearing your slippers?

51
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,390
Someone took them from---

52
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,390
You moron!, come with me.

53
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,390
That's enough!

54
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,990
Reading Haiku?

55
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,390
Fujiwara Hiroshi
(former downtown manager)

56
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,990
Fujikumi sensei

57
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,390
Open your books to page 57.

58
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,390
Fujikumi sensei requested to open page 57 to study the modern 31 syllabled verse and the haiku.

59
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,390
This textbook has a trap

60
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:03,560
Along with Ishikawa Takuboku and other famous poets, there's a section for the works of Suga Kenji--the chief producer of the show.

61
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,560
what will his haiku talk about?

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Next is Suga Kenji.

63
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
They fell easily for the trap

64
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,560
You are going to need imagination

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:35,560
There will be questions that they have to create a story from.

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,560
The 4 of them will use this blank textbook
to create a story from the title

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,560
This is the title

68
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,730
3 Matsuzaka cows

69
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Title
3 Matsuzaka cows

70
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,840
Matsumoto, you start

71
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,230
What is this feeling of "freedom"

72
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,970
that's what the Matsuzaka were thinking...

73
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,630
Why are you looking at me like that?

74
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,560
Matsuzaka can't keep still, so suddenly he went outside...

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,690
Hana Masa arrived

76
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Because the teacher's laughing!

77
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Next, Yamazaki

78
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,050
Matsuzaka and Hana Masa are 3 calves

79
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,560
How...

80
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,550
how do we care for them then eat them?

81
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Lunch scene

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,750
They all eat their various box lunches, and take a much needed rest.
however this will never last long!

83
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,520
(Tsuruko) Let's answer questions!

84
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,750
Tsuruko will answer any question from the Kuchibiru West High school

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Grade 3 Class C
Broadcasting from school

86
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,750
Let's hear the question that can't be answered

87
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,200
Nice to meet you

88
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,750
Your high pitched voice sounds nice

89
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,750
Thank you

90
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,750
Please introduce yourself

91
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,200
Grade2, class C, Koumoto Junko

92
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:53,750
Jun-chan

93
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:53,750
Koumoto
Junichi

94
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,750
Everyone calls me Jun-chan

95
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,750
So, what problem, can I help you with?

96
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,750
I fell in love with someone

97
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,990
You fell in love.. what's your age? 10?

98
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,180
I'm 17

99
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,110
17... Is this your first love?

100
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes, it's the first time, and I have weird feelings

101
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,750
I know it's hard, but can you say his name?

102
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,750
If not, how about just the initials?

103
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,140
Uh.. ah.. Hitoshi

104
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,750
What?  What?

105
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
H-kun.. with H-kun...

106
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
H-kun?

107
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,470
Because it's Hitoshi

108
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:28,680
With H-kun... when I do it with H-kun... he feels good.. then it's done

109
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,720
Usually you do (censored)

110
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,600
Hitoshi-kun... H-kun, doesn't have anything

111
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,600
What are they saying?

112
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,430
Yeah, really

113
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,720
End of broadcast

114
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,720
The real Jun-chan appears

115
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
I caught you!

116
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Jun-chan, was that OK to say that over the air?

117
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,100
Sure, no problem

118
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,390
Because I didn't say any names...

119
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,100
I didn't say Matsumoto-kun's name so it should be OK

120
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,640
You should have said his name

121
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,770
I can't do something like that, if I did...

122
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,720
If I said his name, he would be angry

123
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,470
But you did "it" with Matsumoto-kun, right?

124
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,720
I did

125
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:31,850
In the pool

126
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,850
we did "it"

127
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,720
Give me a break

128
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,750
Science Class scene

129
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,990
For today's class, I'd like to study about

130
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,990
Hosshan Sensei (Comedian)

131
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,990
Science Teacher

132
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,550
the science of breathing.

133
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,350
Udon Noodle

134
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:08,550
Hosshan Sensei was explaining to the four how breathing works

135
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,350
Hosshan Sensei is a professional at passing things through his nose. (Do not try this at home)

136
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,350
That's...who wouldn't laugh at that?

137
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,350
Sensei, that's just wrong.

138
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,350
This is freeze frame of breathing

139
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,350
We already get that

140
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,050
This is no good. this is the type of tube for going down the throat.

141
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,450
Later on...

142
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,450
So you now understand how we inhale oxygen and then exhale carbon dioxide

143
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:57,430
Hosshan sensei, you have a phone call, please report to the teacher's lounge.

144
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,430
Ok I have to go.

145
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,430
Hosshan Sensei had to leave, but there's no relief to our four since the wolf came in to ensure they laugh again.

146
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,430
Hosshan Sensei went out because he has a meeting, so I brought a Video with me.

147
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,430
I really have a bad feeling about this

148
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,430
Yea me too

149
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,430
The Balance of Life

150
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,430
In the Neutral world there's a Balance & Order

151
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,430
there are animals that eat grass and bugs and there are animals who pray on other animals.

152
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:48,430
It's called the Cycle of life, and it creates the balance in the neutral world to make everything in order

153
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:56,430
it starts here from the very grains of sand where millions of Microorganism live

154
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,430
and then we take the sample of sand and study the Microorganism that lives in it.

155
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,430
we found Heipo

156
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:15,430
Heipo (Director)

157
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:19,430
Heipo multiply & duplicate itself and creating hundreds of similar Microorganism resulting in what we call the Heipo multiplier

158
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,430
How can you control yourself?

159
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:41,430
Then Heipo emerges from the ground and grows, but he get prayed on by small Animals, and then bigger Animals pray on them.

160
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,430
--It's not easy

161
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,430
Seriously, How can you not laugh at that!

162
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,430
and the snake get prayed on by an eagle, and then the greatest Animal prays on both.

163
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,430
Then Heipo returns to the sand once again

164
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,030
thus creating the balanced cycle of life

165
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,430
That's too much

166
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,430
Matsumoto explodes by himself!

167
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,430
It's been 5hrs and 30 minutes since starting

168
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,430
Matsumoto has a break down all by himself

169
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,430
I've been thinking...

170
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,430
You guys...

171
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,430
When I'm... I'm...

172
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,430
ready to laugh, like just now...

173
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:42,880
right?

174
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,480
What?

175
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,430
Like now, right?

176
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,430
Yeah

177
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,430
It's not our fault

178
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,430
We're just listening to you

179
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,430
If I were in a Batsu game with my senior

180
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,430
if he...

181
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,430
was having a hard time...

182
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,430
I would take the punishment for him by laughing first

183
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:27,280
So you're saying if we see
that you are ready to laugh, we should laugh
and take the punishment for you?

184
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,430
I'm not saying that in so many words

185
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,430
But, yes

186
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,430
Again we were just listening seriously, we didn't do anything

187
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,430
For example if I were with my senior Shinsuke

188
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,430
Yeah

189
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,110
Yeah

190
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,880
Right?

191
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,430
If he was in trouble and I...

192
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,430
saw that Shinsuke might be hurt

193
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,430
I wouldn't want him to take more punishment...

194
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,430
Club Activity

195
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,660
Everyone lets go and see the clubs

196
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,430
They are going to see the club activites with Fujikumi sensei

197
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,610
What's waiting for them?

198
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,430
Doomo Tsuyoshi    Doomo Koichi

199
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,430
Totally different

200
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,430
Because they are totally different

201
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,430
And then someone appears

202
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,830
Matsumoto pinches his butt
to stop from laughing

203
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:47,430
Tsunsuku

204
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,270
And then...

205
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:11,430
Rapper
(Tajima Manager)

206
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,430
"My name is Tajima Yuichi" "I'm the number 1 bad boy in Yoshimoto"

207
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,430
"I want you to hear my rapping skills"

208
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,430
"Listen now, to my rapping skills"

209
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,990
Matsumoto fell for all 3 tricks

210
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,230
Extended dance scene

211
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,430
While eating in the Gym, Itao's wife appears with Madonna's song

212
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,430
Itao's wife

213
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:05,430
Itao's Wife

214
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,230
Her famous style of dancing is 100% effective in making them laugh

215
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,430
Actually she has a super version of this dance

216
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,430
That's excellent

217
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,430
Very good

218
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,430
What's with that sad face

219
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,890
--I can't stand it

220
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,430
Don't make that sad face

221
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,890
Stop making that face

222
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,430
What the hell?

223
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,430
I understand already

224
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,980
Yes we get it already

225
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,430
Don't get excited

226
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,430
What the hell?

227
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,430
She's amazing

228
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,430
Hamada Silent Library Game

229
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,430
We're entering the Library keep quite!

230
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:46,430
Hamada takes the four into a library where he'll make them play a batsu game within a Batsu game, the Silent Library!

231
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:53,430
These are four cards, and uh...I think you know the rules already

232
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,430
The one who draws the card which has the "lip" on it receives a punishment

233
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,430
Ok, Ready...set

234
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,430
Tanaka got the Lip card

235
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,430
Ok, here's Tanaka's punishment

236
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,430
Thai Kick

237
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,430
You gotta be kidding me!

238
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,430
This is so wrong!

239
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,430
Tanaka stand over here

240
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,430
This is wrong, this is the worst punishment yet!

241
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,430
Tanaka come over here

242
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,430
Are you for real?

243
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,430
Quiet!

244
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,430
Tanaka be quiet!

245
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,430
Ok again

246
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,430
Ready...set

247
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,430
Matsumoto-san punishment is...

248
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,430
Tickling army

249
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,430
Come in

250
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,430
Ok that's enough

251
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,430
Why are you laughing?

252
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,430
Yama-chan you're taking it gracefully

253
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,430
Shocking remark!!

254
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,430
A student should sleep early

255
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,430
Go to sleep

256
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:56,430
After the lights went out there was a shocking remark from Matsumoto!

257
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,430
It's annoying that we can't tell what time is since there's no clock in this class

258
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,180
Our four can't tell what time it is since there's no clock in the classroom

259
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,430
Can I say something?

260
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,630
If it's pass 12 o'clock

261
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,630
then it's my birthday

262
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,630
Current time
1:13 AM

263
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,630
Did I have my birthday? I don't know...

264
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,630
Happy Birthday

265
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,630
Happy Birthday

266
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,630
Happy Birthday

267
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,630
(Fujiwara):- Matsumoto Happy Birthday, now go to sleep!

268
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,630
What the...

269
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,630
This is wrong!

270
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,630
Matsumoto has reached his Birthday

271
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,630
Matsumoto Happy Birthday

272
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,630
Now go to sleep!

273
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,630
Matsumoto Out

274
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,630
That's incredible

275
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,110
You should let me know which scenes you want aired

276
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,110
At the end...

277
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,110
when we finished the graduation, and the Diamond group appeared

278
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,110
Oh, yeah

279
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,110
Why were they mad?

280
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,110
Yeah, Diamond was really mad

281
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,110
Chief Producer

Suga Kenji

282
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,110
I wondered why Diamond was so mad

283
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:33,110
I asked the staff and they said that he was supposed to have a rifle, but it wasn't ready

284
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,110
Chief producer Suga

285
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,110
Diamond Kesuke is supposed to carry a gun

286
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,110
Oh, that's why he was mad!

287
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,110
He wasn't carrying anything.. that's why his hands were lonely

288
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,110
He took out his anger on us

289
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,110
Diamond Scene

290
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,740
Graduation students, you may leave

291
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,110
During the graduation

292
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,360
a group of men were waiting in the silent forest

293
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,340
The 4 had no idea

294
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,110
The group is...

295
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,110
The Angry Diamond Group

296
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:24,210
(Old lady #1)  (Suga Kenji)  (Nakamura)   (Old lady #2)

297
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:24,210
Police woman  Diamond     Hatomura   Police woman

298
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,210
Why are you so mad?

299
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,210
Punisher from Hell

300
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,210
And finally

301
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,210
Super Sadist Hamada unleashes his final beating

302
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,210
Who the hell are you?!

303
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,210
We already left!

304
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,210
We have come to the end

305
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,210
By the way
Super Sadist Hamada
Couldn't stop...

306
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:36,480
Number one comedian, Super sadist Hamada is going to follow them to hell!

307
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,510
Stop!  Stop!
