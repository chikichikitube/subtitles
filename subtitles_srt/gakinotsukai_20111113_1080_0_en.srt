1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,480
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai!

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,100
"This ain't ecological, right?"

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,160
"Scorching heat bare-hand hell:
no-chopsticks battle!"

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,440
Matsumoto-san...

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,440
Yes?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Downtown

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hamada Masatoshi

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Matsumoto Hitoshi

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,440
I don't get it

10
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,740
Oh, don't you? We can't use chopsticks

11
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,840
Today we're gonna see if we can eat all the food bare handed

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,170
That's why it's a "no-chopsticks battle"

13
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,870
We all got fired up talking about this in the meeting

14
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,910
But thinking about it, there's nothing to be excited about

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,780
We're not even betting on anything

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,780
Right, we do have the right atmosphere though

17
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:38,790
No-chopsticks battle!!

18
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:38,790
Scorching heat bare-hand hell!

19
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,480
Welcome to the no-chopstick hellfire battle

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,790
Starting tonight for all to see!

21
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:46,230
No-chopsticks fight

22
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:46,230
You have 90 seconds to eat up all the hot food without chopsticks

23
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:46,230
rules

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,780
Waiting for our members is a full-course of hot food

25
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,230
Their challenge will be to eat everything bare handed within 90 seconds

26
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,200
Charm

27
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,200
Each member's performance will be rated following these parameters

28
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,200
Finger technique

29
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,200
Madness

30
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,200
No-chopsticks fight

31
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,200
Smartness

32
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,200
Speed

33
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,200
rules

34
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,900
The best eater will be decided by the rest of them, following these 5 parameters

35
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,540
"Madness"?

36
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,840
Yeah, madness

37
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,440
By this I mean "being majestic, manly, aggressive"

38
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:09,550
"Being majestic, manly, aggressive"

39
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:09,550
Madness

40
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,900
"Aggressive"?

41
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,760
"Majestic"...?

42
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,340
It's hot food, so it's about how aggressive you can be despite that

43
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,720
Oh, it's basically the attack stat

44
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,720
That's why I called it "madness"

45
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,600
We also have "charm" here

46
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
"Charm"?!

47
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,180
What does charm mean here?

48
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,180
What's that?

49
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,040
It's "the power to prevent our viewers from zapping"

50
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:23,100
Avoid having the audience change channel

51
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:23,100
Charm

52
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:23,100
The power to make the audience feel the urge to watch it again

53
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,800
It's how you leave a mark

54
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,060
It's also "the power to make the audience want to see it again"

55
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,040
I see

56
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,100
This is so hard!

57
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,100
Is that "charm"?

58
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,180
Some may think "then why aren't you all comedians?"

59
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,340
That's right

60
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,340
We're seven

61
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,660
He's here to tell 'em "don't underestimate me"

62
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,840
Nakamura Yoshinobu

63
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,840
Producer

64
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,860
That's why he's joining us?

65
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,860
He volunteered

66
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,840
What do you think of his exhausted look?

67
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,680
What do you think of his exhausted look?

68
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,460
You can tell he went through a lot

69
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,320
That's a feature

70
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,850
In a way, I'd store this view in my hard-disk so I can

71
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,850
see him again and again...

rules

89
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,710
The best performance is going to be rated by the other 7 contestants

90
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,620
Let's dive into it, here's our first dish:

91
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,620
Our first one

92
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,620
What is it gonna be?

93
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,780
What is it..?

94
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,660
Bare handed hell! No-chopsticks battle!!

95
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,660
Chuuka-don

96
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,660
Second dish

97
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,660
Third dish

98
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,660
Woah!

99
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,660
Holy shit, it's a chuuka-don

100
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,620
There will be a finger-bowl for each contestant to use

101
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:30,500
You can use the provided finger-bowl filled with water

102
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,040
Oh, so you can cool off?

103
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,600
It would be impossible without it, wouldn't it?

104
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,500
It depends on how much you're gonna rely on it, I don't think I will

105
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,500
Are you kidding me?

106
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,070
Really?

107
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,070
That would be incredible

108
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,070
Who's gonna go first?

109
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,070
Usually it's Endo

110
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,160
So how about this time you go first, Tanaka?

111
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,780
I see, should I go first?

112
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,840
Sure? You'll be in charge of setting the
overall course of action for this show

113
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,180
It's all up to you

114
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,180
That's right

115
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,980
Just bring it!

116
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,980
Alright, Tanaka

117
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,580
Yeah

118
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,940
Please go to the challenge room

119
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,990
Huzzah!

120
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,790
He flipped the excitement switch on

121
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,790
All the way up to 11

122
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,660
I'm gonna show y'all my madness!

123
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,940
Walking down the infernal road to prove his worth

124
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,570

Show us your madness, Tanaka!

128
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,140
Let's try to call him: Tanaka?

129
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,070
Yeah?

130
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,270
In order to release my madness...

131
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,170
I don't feel like

132
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,170
using the finger bowl at all

133
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,360
Woah, already?!

134
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,360
Are you kidding us?

135
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,240
Of course you all know about this, but...

136
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,580
The food is really scorching hot and
you have nothing to pick it up with

137
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,860
I'm aware of that

138
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,280
But as you said before,
it's up to me to set the starting point

139
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,220
That's right

140
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,960
I'm gonna become a good ol' guidepost for ya

141
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,260
I'm gonna become a good ol' guidepost for ya

142
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,360
What the f-?

143
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,260
A guidepost?

144
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,260
That sucked

145
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,800
You can start as soon as the chef
places the bowl on the table

146
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,180
I'm ready!

147
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,500
Woah!

148
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Are you serious?!

149
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,500
That's too hot!

150
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,220
They cook it right beside you?

151
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,120
This can't be real!

152
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,710
I guess it's gonna be hotter than at a normal chinese restaurant

153
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,900
It's boiling

154
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,480
Alright!

155
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,920
Chuuka isn't really easy

156
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,920
It's gonna be hard

157
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,220
Let's get ready for this

158
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,220
We're going

159
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,740
Tanaka's no-chopstick battle

160
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,940
Starts from now!

161
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,250
How is he gonna conquer those quail eggs?

162
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,660
Now the rice is hot too...

163
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,500
Oh, it started!

164
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,260
Here we go

165
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,520
I'm ready

166
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,380
Let's go!

167
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,980
Go for it!

168
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,880
Bon appetit!

169
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,120
Don't waste your time around

170
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,960
It's time to strike

171
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,960
Here I go

172
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,680
Just go

173
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,240
Come on, come on, come on!

174
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,240
Come on, dude

175
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,260
Don't hesitate

176
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,860
He won't do it

177
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,620
This won't go well

178
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,920
What the hell are you doin'?

179
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,920
What's that?

180
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,220
Time is running out, man

181
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,320
No way, no way, no way

182
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,100
This sucks so bad

183
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,560
He's not doing good at all

184
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,940
He sucks

185
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,390
He can't even touch it

186
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,390
Come on...

187
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,490
He didn't even take a single bite

188
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,920
You're doing really bad, man

189
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,880
We can't give points to this

190
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,880
Not good at all

191
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,580
What a filthy mess

192
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,320
No way, no way, I'm done, he's so weak

193
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,120
There's no smartness in him

194
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,320
Surely there's no charm in this

195
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
No charm, no speed, nothing

196
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,120
That much?

197
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,410
Now I'm scared of this

198
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,540
Look at all the rice flying around, this sucks

199
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,800
Oh my

200
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,800
He's barely doing anything

201
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,720
That was his worst one yet

202
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,540
You're running out of time

203
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,480
This guy is seriously the worst

204
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,180
Four

205
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,100
Three, two...

206
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,340
And it's over!

207
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,920
That sucked

208
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,260
That was bad, wasn't it?

209
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,720
The end

210
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,720
It couldn't have gone worse than this

211
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,840
Alright, let's vote

212
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,160
What a lady

213
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,740
Eh? Gimme a break...

214
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,840
What should we...?

215
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,150
Acting like a little girl

216
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,020
Maybe we expected too much from him

217
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,660
No doubt about it, his score is gonna be so low

218
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,320
I don't think anyone is going to praise him

219
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Yeah, me too

220
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,390
Are you all done?

221
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,390
All done here

222
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,060
Alright, three, four and...

223
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,060
Here

224
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,060
Ok, let's flip this

225
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,880
Well, it figures

226
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,880
Really? So generous of them

227
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,160
Oh, I see...

228
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,300
Makes sense, yeah

229
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,760
Hamada's choice is a bit extreme

230
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,760
How about you, Hamada?

231
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,820
It's just a dot for me

232
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,820
A single dot, huh

233
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,600
But I guess it's not wrong

234
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,240
Yeah, it's something like this

235
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,240
Nothing to complain about it

236
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,980
What the hell were you doin'?

237
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,080
That's what we all thought of you

238
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,180
Nothing to be surprised about

239
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,580
What, did you expect something different?

240
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,140
Yeah, you shouldn't be surprised

241
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,900
We had high hopes for you

242
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,560
Let me say something, the thing I hated the most

243
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,560
Yeah

244
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,440
Is that you said no finger-bowl
but you tried to reach out to it once

245
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,340
For a second yeah, he did

246
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,520
As soon as I saw that I thought "hah!"

247
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,930
"That fucker did it!"

248
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,730
No doubt about it:

249
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,730
You should definitely use the finger bowl

250
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,730
Seriously, you have to use it

251
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,500
Would you have made it if you'd have used it?

252
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,570
No way

253
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,570
Eh? What do you mean?

254
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,570
Not even

255
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,540
Not even if I would have used it

256
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,700
Not even with it?

257
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, it's impossible

258
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,000
Even with it?

259
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,110
Second dish

260
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,550
Bare handed hell! No-chopsticks battle!!

261
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,550
Chuuka-don

262
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,550
Third dish

263
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,720
Their second dish is going to be...

264
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,550
Grilled squid

265
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,210
Grilled squid

266
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,550
"Grilled squid"...

267
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,650
I think this is way easier than chuuka-don

268
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,650
You think so?

269
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,280
Yeah

270
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,640
License? Are you ink?

271
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,590
Sure

272
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,750
I'm squiddin' ready

273
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,880
Just quit it with this bullshit, please

274
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,840
Let me do it!

275
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,460
Don't ever make puns again

276
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,460
I'm ready for the no-chopstick cuttle!

277
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,460
So lame...

278
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,580
His spirit is seething as if shrouded in flames

279
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,800
Fujiwara
Kazuhiro

280
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,800
Grilled squid

281
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,800
challenge dish

282
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,700
Blaze up, Fujiwara!

283
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Fujiwara!

284
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,670
I can hear you

285
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,920
How about the finger bowl?

286
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,400
It's here, make sure to see how I use it

287
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,220
Oooh...

288
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,010
It's beside him

289
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,010
Yes

290
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,240
Alright, get ready

291
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,010
Yeah

292
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,010
Eh? Still cooking it?

293
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,010
What the hell?

294
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,260
Holy shit!

295
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,640
I didn't picture it to be like this

296
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,640
This is not okay

297
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,350
It's crazy

298
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,480
I underestimated it

299
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,160
It's boiling

300
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,190
Alright, let's see Fujiwara's no-chopstick battle!

301
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,190
I didn't think so

302
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,590
I wouldn't know how to handle this myself

303
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,960
What do you do?

304
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,580
How about that broth?

305
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,900
They're pouring it in!

306
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,660
It's even worse than chuuka-don

307
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,500
I bet he's so angry

308
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,500
This is not ok

309
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,680
It's so hard

310
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,680
He thought he could do this

311
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,260
I wonder if he can

312
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,980
Huh? What is he doing?

313
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,980
What's this for?

314
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,940
...Fujiwara?

315
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,840
Huh? What the--?

316
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,880
That wasn't funny at all

317
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,800
I'm sure it felt better inside his head

318
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,420
Not only didn't he make us laugh

319
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,120
What a waste

320
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,560
He also wasted all his water, what now?

321
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,120
Alright!!

322
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,700
He's not starting at all

323
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,060
Madness!

324
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,460
He went full madness on that

325
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,460
The madman!

326
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,920
He transformed

327
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,460
That was outstanding

328
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,460
Really

329
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,700
It's all starting from here now

330
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,800
He got no water left

331
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,100
Look! He's spreading it!

332
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,580
Right over his body

333
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,580
That's what he did

334
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,520
This guy is seriously amazing

335
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,180
Madman! Madman! Madman!

336
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,660
Look at him go

337
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,180
Incredible

338
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,050
He's striving like crazy

339
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,650
I can smell his madness

340
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,650
This guy is pure madness

341
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,020
Go! Finish up that last bit!

342
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,300
Eat up!

343
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,340
He gotta spread it

344
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,490
How exactly does this work?

345
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,490
He got no other choice

346
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,300
How can it benefit you?

347
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,120
Five seconds left

348
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,100
Four...

349
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,660
Three, two, one...

350
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,420
You're doing great, Fujiwara

351
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,720
That was incredible

352
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,720
Time's up!

353
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,800
He really did it, amazing

354
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,800
I'm speechless

355
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,580
Look, his personality changed

356
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,840
He's not the same as before

357
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,840
Scary!

358
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,220
Let's reveal our scores

359
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,120
It's close to full marks to me

360
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,340
I think that's good

361
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,980
Yeah, he did really good

362
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,540
I think it's ok

363
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,440
Both his madness and speed were outstanding

364
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,120
Thank you so much

365
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,560
No complaints here

366
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Good job, really

367
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,680
You were incredible

368
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,660
Maybe it lacks "charm"...?

369
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,660
And look

370
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,440
It's so unexpected how Nakamura's score is so harsh

371
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,960
He could have been kinder

372
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,320
Are you kidding me?

373
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,600
He deserved more

374
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,300
He even volunteered

375
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,640
So strict, woah

376
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,540
So cool

377
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,540
I'm expecting a lot from the rest of us

378
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,760
Third dish

379
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,810
Chuuka-don

380
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,810
Fifth dish

381
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,810
Fourth dish

382
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,810
Grilled Squid

383
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,540
The third dish

384
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,600
Is combini spaghetti

385
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,810
Combini spaghetti

386
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,880
Combini spaghetti

387
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,880
Fourth dish

388
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,880
Grilled Squid

389
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,880
I don't get it

390
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,080
It's time for his dormant wild nature to rise

391
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,760
Combini spaghetti

392
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,760

393
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,760
challenge dish

394
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,380
Go for it, Endo!

395
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,830
It starts as soon as the spaghetti is fully
microwaved, just like in convenience stores

396
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,770
It's gonna swell with hot air

397
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,770
Yes, yes

398
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,220
C'mere, spaghetti!

399
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a balloon

400
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,770
Look, it's a hot air balloon

401
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,770
Just look at it

402
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,740
Isn't that a bit too much...?

403
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,740
Yeah, probably

404
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,810
Three seconds left

405
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,800
This is dangerous

406
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,800
It really is

407
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,840
It's dangerous

408
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,840
Are you all ready for this?

409
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,740
Let's go

410
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,280
Here I go

411
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,780
Start!!

412
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,980
Is he gonna be ok?

413
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,480
He's going for it

414
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,360
The vinyl---

415
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,200
Go!

416
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,860
Release your madness!

417
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,860
Alright alright!

418
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,140
Use you madness!

419
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,140
Here it is

420
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,410
You're just scattering food around

421
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,410
Dig into it!

422
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,410
Aye aye

423
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,620
What the heck...

424
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,720
Come on!

425
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,220
You can tell he's burning his mouth

426
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,920
He lost it

427
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,920
Just grab 'em all

428
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,890
He's talking so much

429
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,400
But he's not eating at all

430
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,340
But he's really aggressive

431
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,340
Can't deny that

432
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,760
His madness is on point too

433
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,760
He's just making a show, that's all

434
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,770

478
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,280
He mostly pretended to eat, and because of that his score is low

479
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,980
Here's the next dish

480
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,870

495
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,460
Hamada, the mad dog!

496
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,800
Is it immersed? Oh, it is

497
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,800
It is

498
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,640
Woah...

499
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,680
This is gonna be hot

500
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,760
Yeah, he gotta pull that out from here too

501
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,760
Can he do it?

502
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Alright, get ready

503
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,360
No-chopstick battle: begin!

504
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
Here we are

505
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,360
How can he...?

506
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,130
Come on

507
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,860
How is it possible?

508
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,860
Time is ticking away, man

509
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,520
Why are you dropping it?

510
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,120
Don't let it go

511
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,120
Take it out from there

512
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,600
Why dropping it?

513
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,900
Just grab it

514
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,900
Get it out quick

515
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,980
That hurts!

516
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,780
He got it out

517
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,140
It's so hot

518
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,140
It is

519
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,790
He's really making an effort

520
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,920
That should do

521
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,400
We're almost at 30 seconds

522
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,580
Come on

523
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,000
What a waste of time

524
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,590
You're wasting time, man!

525
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,230
He's still not done yet

526
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,240
It won't come out!

527
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,700
So fuckin' hot!!

528
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,330
That gap isn't enough

529
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,440
It's smaller than the hamburg steak

530
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,540
He opened a cut smaller than the hamburg itself

531
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,120
All right, moving on

532
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,120
Take a bite!

533
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,360
How is he supposed to eat that?

534
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,360
Yeah, how?

535
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,060
Just take a nice bite out of it

536
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,060
Oh, he's gonna use his fingers

537
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,380
He's trying to cut it

538
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,060
He became his own knife!

539
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,150
He's respecting manners

540
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,150
Just go for it

541
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,050
Go, go, go! Show us what you can do!

542
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,420
I bet it's hot as hell inside

543
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,890
You can do it

544
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,120
Show us what you got

545
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,500
Shit, that's really hot

546
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,820
He's taking so much damage from its insides

547
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,620
His technique isn't bad at all

548
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,620
This is freaking me out

549
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,830
Giving up now?!

550
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,600
He's done for

551
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,640
There's no time left! Only 15 seconds

552
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,680
This is freaky

553
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,040
I can't watch this anymore, why is he doing this?

554
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,760
Come on!

555
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,760
You're running out of time!

556
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
Just eat it

557
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,580
Time's--- man, he sucks

558
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,680
Come on, just go

559
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,680
He barely ate anything

560
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,960
And it's over

561
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,260
Such a pussy

562
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,260
Look, he's finally eating

563
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,600
Is it me or did he get thinner?

564
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,540
I'm done here

565
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,540
He looks pissed off

566
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,600
What's wrong?

567
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,780
Woah, he's pissed

568
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,470
He's mad 'cause he did awfully

569
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,700
First off...

570
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,470
That happens

571
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,480
First of all, it took you way too much time to open it up

572
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,480
Yep, a bit too much

573
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,840
You fucking try then

574
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,740
He kinda became Mori Shinichi for a sec

575
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,640
We'll do our own, we will

576
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,660
That cut was smaller than the whole thing, wasn't it?

577
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,600
The gap wasn't enough

578
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,080
It does happen sometimes

579
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,890
Combini spaghetti

580
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,890
boil-in-bag hamburg steak

581
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,890

sixth dish

584
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,720
Their fifth dish is... tanmen

585
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Their fifth dish is... tanmen

586
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,590
Tanmen

587
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,590
boil-in-bag hamburg steak

588
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,590
sixth dish

589
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,720
It's tanmen

590
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,590
A though one

591
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,590
Definitely

592
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,040
The challenger is our most composed
yet passionate man: Inomoto!

593
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,500
Inomoto
Takafumi

594
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,500
Tanmen

595
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,500
challenge dish

596
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,200
Are you for real?

597
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,340
How can one possibly eat this?

598
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,340
Unbelievable

599
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,070
Isn't this a bit too much?

600
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,540
How many degrees is that?

601
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,710
It doesn't matter, just look at that

602
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,300
Too much...

603
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,160
Woah

604
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,720
So goddamn hot

605
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,380
How are you supposed to...?

606
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,960
This one's impossible

607
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,600
I mean, your hands...?

608
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,180
Hot!!

609
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,220
Fuck!!

610
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,620
You gotta praise his efforts

611
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,240
He's already trying his best

612
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,660
Look at him go

613
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,780
Holy shit!

614
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,780
Woah!!

615
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,440
Grab the noodles!

616
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,440
How can he put his fingers inside that?!

617
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,040
He's incredible

618
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,500
He's been trembling no stop

619
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,420
He's shaking like crazy

620
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,940
He really is

621
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,440
Amazing

622
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,040
Bravo, bravo!

623
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,920
Outstanding

624
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
He's really good at this

625
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,920
Awesome!!

626
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,920
Hot!

627
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,800
He's an expert

628
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,700
This is insane

629
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,640
You're doing great!

630
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,500
This guy is incredible

631
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,500
And he keeps on eating

632
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,640
That was incredible

633
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,640
Unbelievable

634
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,790
Thank you

635
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,040
But your right hand has been shaking the entire time

636
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,960
At one point...

637
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,930
I thought about using it

638
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,930
As a ladle to scoop up the broth and drink it

639
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,930
I see

640
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,470
But it's just impossible by nature

641
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,270
But it's just impossible by nature

642
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,270
Of course it is

643
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,270
Don't say it, then

644
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,420
Here's our next dish

645
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,410
sixth dish

646
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,110
Tanmen

647
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,110
boil-in-bag hamburg steak

648
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,110
eight dish

649
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,110
seventh dish

650
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,110
Seafood paella

651
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,980
Seafood paella

652
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,980
Tanmen

653
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,980
seventh dish

654
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,980
It's a paella

655
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,980
Seafood paella?!

656
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,880
Can I just

657
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,780
Can I have few words with my manager, please?

658
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,980
What the hell!

659
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,680
Why?!

660
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,920
Need his permission?

661
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,190
Why can't you do it?

662
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,340
I really can't, I just can't

663
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,320
But we all already did it

664
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,640
That's right

665
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,660
No point in wasting time here, how about you go, Yoshinobu?

666
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,660
Me?

667
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,440
Counting on you

668
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,500
And then only those two are left

669
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,500
That's right

670
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,560
Alright then, I'll go

671
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,630
He's really strict, he's gonna get mad at us

672
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,630
He kinda is

673
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,670
Let me prove you wrong, then

674
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,900
Really?

675
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,900
You heard him?

676
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,500
So cool!

677
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,040
Madman!

678
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,700
Whatever, you're not a comedian, who cares

679
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,540
We're not gonna put you on air

680
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,540
Come to think of it

681
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,310
He's the only one not getting his appearance fee

682
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,720
He's the only one not getting his appearance fee

683
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,720
And yet he's so confident

684
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,540
After this, we'll see the overly confident no-fee man

685
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,160
Who's gonna show us the ultimate madness

686
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,760
He's the bare-handed master!

687
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,680
Have you seen his face?!

688
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,580
I've seen it...

689
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,670
Have you seen that?!

690
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,870
How couldn't we?

691
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,970
That's the face you make when you drink poison!

692
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,640
Enough of it

693
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,640
Gimme a break

694
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,370
We've seen enough, haven't we?

695
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,370
Let's call it a day, guys

696
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,520
Thanks for the meal

697
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,000
His miraculous madness shocked everyone

698
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,310
We'll get to see his performance soon!

699
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:10,340
But before that, Yamazaki the king of sloppy
eaters gets ready for his challenge

700
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:11,150
Boiled udon

701
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:11,150
Yamazaki
Housei

702
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:11,150
challenge dish

703
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,220
Are you ready?

704
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,120
Yama-chan's no-chopstick battle: start!

705
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,380
This isn't safe at all

706
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,380
He's dead

707
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,380
Woah...

708
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,240
Here it is

709
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,240
Look at all that vapor

710
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,660
The bowl is hot too

711
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,660
Come on

712
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,960
Come on, come on

713
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,360
Hoz!!

714
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Did he mean "hot"?

715
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,600
Hoz!

716
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,540
That's all he's sayin'

717
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,550
Can't blame him

718
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,040
The way he shouts is always the same

719
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,350
He's not gonna make it

720
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,950
He hasn't touched a single udon yet

721
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,300
That's not the finger bowl!

722
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,650
Holy shi---- so hot!!

723
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,650
He just wants to get hurt

724
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,120
Wait a minute guys

725
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,180
Are you using that?

726
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,120
That's not it

727
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,620
That's broth

728
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,420
It's broth, not water

729
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,130
Wait--- gimme a sec--

730
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,130
The finger bowl is over there

731
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,780
This guy fucking sucks

732
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,340
That's not the right bowl

733
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,970
He might be the worst one yet

734
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,970
Wait--

735
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,870
Just grab one, soak it and eat it

736
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,480
That's against the rules!

737
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,200
That noodle you just ate was outside the pot

738
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,200
You can't eat that one

739
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,500
Well, it's gone now

740
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
That one cooled off, right?

741
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,500
Yeah

742
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,980
Sduck nma troh....

743
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,630
What?

744
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,820
I have an udon stuck in my throat

745
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,420
*cough* *cough*

746
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,090
*cough* *cough*

747
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,380
He just coughed at you

748
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,660
Just a regular cough for you

749
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,160
Dude, you've been coughed at by Yoshinobu

750
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,120
Staking his pride as a man,
Matsumoto ventures to challenge UFO yakisoba

751
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:30,070
Matsumoto
Hitoshi

752
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:30,070
Yakisoba

753
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:30,070
challenge dish

754
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,280
I also want you to witness

755
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,620
The three minutes it takes for the hot water to cook it

756
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,620
I see

757
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,210
So you'll see I'm not cheating

758
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,210
Makes sense

759
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,810
Woah

760
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,740
I'm telling you guys, you shouldn't underestimate me

761
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,120
I'm not here to play around

762
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,380
Shit, that's hot

763
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,020
He already said it's hot

764
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,020
Running out of madness already?

765
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,040
Alright, cover it up, place it down and start the timer

766
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,040
Ok, ok

767
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Let's have it rest for 3 minutes

768
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,140
That's how much it takes

769
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,340
Look, I'm even warming up the sauce so I can't possibly escape

770
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,340
Alright, alright

771
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,780
That's nice

772
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,100
Oh, I see...

773
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,710
See? Can you sense my madness?

774
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,710
The madness is starting to show up

775
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,580
In few seconds you can open it up

776
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,960
And start, three, two, one...

777
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,220
Let's begin: here's Matsumoto's no-chopsticks battle

778
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,950
The sauce fell down

779
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,140
He dropped it?

780
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,000
It's inside the boiling water!

781
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,060
Hey!

782
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,190
I'm gonna get burned

783
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,040
I didn't plan this!

784
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,420
No way!

785
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,460
And start, three, two, one...

786
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,960
Let's begin: here's Matsumoto's no-chopsticks battle

787
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,160
The sauce fell down

788
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,460
He dropped it?

789
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,520
It's inside the boiling water!

790
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,580
Hey!

791
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,750
I'm gonna get burned

792
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,600
I didn't plan this!

793
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,200
No way!

794
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
I didn't expect this!

795
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,880
He had no reason to get in this situation...

796
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,500
Look how scared he looks

797
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,500
He made the whole thing way harder

798
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,320
This is pathetic

799
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,830
He's a lady

800
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,140
Look at her!

801
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,440
He's not even using the finger bowl!

802
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,740
Does he even know he can use it?

803
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,640
It's hard to watch

804
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,040
What the hell is he doing?!

805
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,940
He hasn't done anything so far

806
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,060
All of this just for the sauce...

807
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,520
Hurry up and pick em up!

808
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,520
What are you doin'?!

809
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,760
Finally, finger bowl

810
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,360
Come on!

811
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,660
He used it way too much

812
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,260
All he's doing is saying "it's hot"

813
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,880
He dropped the pot!

814
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,480
Dude...

815
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,660
Where the hell did it go?

816
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,460
This is fucked up

817
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,560
Open up the sauce, quick

818
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,560
There's no time

819
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,340
Mix em up

820
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,720
Like this, go

821
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,440
Now you have to mix them

822
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,600
Eat it!

823
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,820
Hurry up and eat!

824
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,120
Mix them up, quick

825
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
What am I looking at...?

826
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,160
What is this?

827
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,840
You barely even touched 'em!

828
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,060
What was that for?

829
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,580
Mix 'em up, come on!

830
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,560
He spilled his finger bowl all over, look at him

831
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,860
Look at that finger bowl

832
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,720
Hurry up and mix it up!

833
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,140
Eat! Eat!

834
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,040
Please eat something

835
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,040
Quick!

836
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,520
Eat up!

837
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,120
Time's up!

838
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,600
Did he eat it?

839
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,440
Nope, he didn't

840
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,220
Well... how should I put it...

841
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,020
Everything I wanted to do has been
done by Nakamura before, so...

842
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,790
Everything?

843
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,790
What do you mean?

844
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,190
I wanted to do the exact same moves he did and stuff

845
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,080
Huh? What do you mean?

846
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,660
Seen how he gulped down his bowl?

847
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:53,740
Ultimate Way Of Eating Madness Revealed

848
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:53,740
coming up

849
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,000
I wanted to quickly change character like he did

850
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,440
But I ended up becoming gay instead

851
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,340
The time has come

852
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,580
Nakamura
Yoshinobu

853
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,580
Seafood paella

854
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,580
challenge dish

855
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,200
Here's Yoshinobu's performance,
a perfect example of madness

856
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,620
Holy crap

857
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,160
How are you supposed to eat this one?!

858
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,160
Are you kidding me?

859
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,340
This isn't humanly possible

860
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,100
It's impossible

861
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,140
How can a human being survive this?

862
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,600
Maybe the toppings?

863
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,600
But there's rice

864
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,560
Huh? Really?

865
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,920
You gotta be kidd---

866
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,320
Holy shit, he has a plan

867
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,740
No way!

868
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,300
Unbelievable!

869
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,080
He's gonna shove his face inside it

870
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,040
His heart is too strong for us

871
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,040
So cool

872
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,140
Here comes Yoshinobu's no-chopstick battle

873
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,150
I think the stuff on top of it is too hot to eat

874
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,580
Shellfish?

875
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,580
He went for that

876
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,440
He ate it

877
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,320
No way!

878
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,940
Is he fireproof?

879
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,940
Look at him!

880
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,520
Bare hands master!

881
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,590
My stomach hurts

882
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,490
Incredible

883
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,760
He's the MVP

884
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,140
Are you kidding me?

885
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,440
He's a monster!

886
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,440
Monster!

887
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,540
The monster appeared!

888
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,640
I'm dying

889
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,280
Gimme a break

890
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,280
My stomach hurts so bad

891
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,940
The shrimp!

892
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,620
He's peeling it

893
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,800
He's doing it

894
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,000
He's even peeling the shrimp

895
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Even the shrimp?!

896
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,440
He did it and ate it!

897
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,440
He ate it!

898
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,440
Enough, please...

899
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,440
He's the maddest of all

900
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,960
His fingers too

901
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,660
His finger technique is great

902
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,660
Look, the shellfish

903
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,860
Look at his face

904
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,800
I want to see him go for the rice

905
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,200
There's still time for that

906
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,020
Go!

907
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,370
Really?!

908
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,540
For real?!

909
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,240
Man

910
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,220
He's scooping it up with both his hands!

911
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,560
I can't believe what I'm watching

912
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,560
Look at his face!!

913
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,640
He did it!

914
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,640
Outstanding

915
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,780
I can't

916
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,410
This is too much

917
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,180
Incredible, really

918
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,220
Incredible

919
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,040
My stomach...

920
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,340
Time's up!

921
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,780
I'm speechless

922
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,760
That was simply incredible

923
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,000
Have you seen his face?

924
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,960
I've seen it

925
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Seen his face?

926
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,130
I'm glad I did

927
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,900
That's the face you make when you drink poison

928
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,770
That's the face you'd do if you got poisoned

929
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,400
Pure agony

930
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,320
It makes me wanna watch the whole thing again

931
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,320
I agree

932
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm ready for a full rewatch

933
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,840
I really want to

934
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,640
Incredible, this guy is incredible

935
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,640
The given time wasn't enough

936
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,950
I think I'm gonna ask for his autograph later

937
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,550
One for me too, please
