00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,650
This is Suiyoubi no Downtown
Welcome everyone!

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,620
MC: Hamada Masatoshi
(Downtown)

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,520
Hori Miona

00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,520

00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,520
Ogi Hiroaki
(Ogi Yahagi)

00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,520
Ōkubo Kayoko
(Oasiz)

7
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,720
So let's begin. Here's the first presenter!

8
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,720
Come in!

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,830
It's Fujimon!

10
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,830
Yes, yes. Hello, hello

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,830
Presenter:
Fujimoto Toshifumi
(FUJIWARA)

12
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,830
Hello everyone!

13
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,830
Fujimonty, isn't it?
Fujimonty

14
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,840
What's Fujimonty?

15
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,670
So everyone, I know it's out of the blue but→

16
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,510
have you seen any people who have had plastic surgery?

17
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,850
There are, yes

18
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,850
Well, there are some

19
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,180
There are but you
wouldn't tell the person

20
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:43,090
Of course you can't say "ah, you've had surgery" and point it out to them

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,860
No, you can't

22
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,860
You can't say that for sure

23
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,920
It's too hard

24
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,920
Of course not

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,630
So with that,
here's the theory I've brought here today:

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,670
Theory: If a female celebrity you haven't seen for a long time has had loads of plastic surgery, it's hard to point it out

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,270
You made it that hard?

28
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,640
(Ōkubo) Someone they
haven't seen in a while

29
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,710
Maybe someone like
Hamada-san could say it jokingly

30
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,980
No, I don't think I would

31
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,980
Really?

32
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,980
Once when I was on a shoot with Ogi,

33
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,650
There was one person
there who'd had it done

34
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,150
I think I know who you mean

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,150
Who?

36
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,160
It has to be that shoot

37
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,160
Right

38
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,490
And when that person wasn't around,
Ogi came up to me and said →

39
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,200
"Jeez..."

40
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,770
"They were so different, I laughed"

41
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,830
But I don't think they heard him

42
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,640
There were a few people there.
That person was so bad

43
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,470
They'd done it that much?

44
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,340
Yes, so much.
Even Fujimoto-san was laughing

45
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,340
I didn't laugh!
I kept in, unlike Ogi

46
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,710
Isn't "keeping it in" strange too?

47
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Coming up...

48
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,750
When a female celebrity with makeup in the style of plastic surgery appears,

49
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:52,220
How will the comedians react?

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
And then...

51
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:59,560
Unsuccessful comedians face off!
Who's the best at taking bentos from backstage home?

52
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:12,880

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:23,560
Theory: If a female celebrity you haven't seen for a long time has had loads of plastic surgery, it's hard to point it out

54
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,360
So, our first targets are...

55
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,500
Alright!

56
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,500
It's Tokyo Shopping Street Tour!

57
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,530
Daian

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,530
Tsuda Atsuhiro

59
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,530
Yūsuke

60
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,000
And the person who'll be our plant,

61
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:43,640
Nīyama Chiharu

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,710
the first female celebrity we
haven't seen in a while...

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,710
We give Nīyama a makeover
using special makeup in the style of plastic surgery

64
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:56,890
She'll appear midway through as a guest
in Daian's fake town-exploration shoot

65
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,760
Itadakimasu

66
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,200
Hot!

67
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,440
This would really burn me

68
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,440
Do it! You got so far already

69
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,680
After they've roamed around a little,

70
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,350
at last...

71
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,980
We send in the plastic surgery monster

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:30,660
And we haven't told Daian about the guest,
so it will be a surprise appearance

73
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,200
It says we've got a special guest who comes to this restaurant often when they're in Togoshi Ginza

74
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,370
Oh? It's Nīyama Chiharu-san?

75
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,470
Wow, really? Come in!

76
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,640
Seriously?

77
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,640
Hello

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,410
Hello! I'm looking forward to working with you today. I'm Nīyama Chiharu

79
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:58,480
Eye bags

80
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:58,480
Lips

81
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,910
We've added as much volume
as possible to her eye bags and lips

82
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,120
An extremely gaudy plastic face

83
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,520
This is Daian's
reaction to seeing it

84
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,290
Hello. How do you do?

85
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,290
Hello

86
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,290
All their excitement's gone

87
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,360
Nice to meet you.
Yes, I'm excited

88
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,370
They don't know what to do

89
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,870
We're Daian. Pleased to meet you

90
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:26,010
As expected, they can feel something's wrong
but they didn't say anything

91
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,310
Then...

92
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,410
Do you come to this area often?

93
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,080
From the time I debuted, my office has been in Meguro so...

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,250
So I've spent time walking and eating in these streets

95
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,490
He can't even look at her face

96
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,790
I haven't been able to do it recently of course

97
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,820
Yūsuke's not looking anymore

98
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,630
But I'm hoping we'll be able to do it again soon

99
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,930
He will

100
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,930
If he looks, he'll laugh

101
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,960
That's true

102
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,030
I think so

103
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,500
(Nīyama) So I can go with my
daughter and teach her the custom

104
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,170
This is not good

105
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,170
He's looking at her from the side!

106
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,840
It's just too perfect

107
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,940
How old are you now...

108
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,940
I'm 40

109
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Wow!

110
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,480
You don't look it. Really, you haven't changed at all

111
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,080
Oh, really?

112
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,820
You haven't changed at all

113
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,390
It's clear that isn't that the case

114
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,290
Tsuda tells a lie he didn't have to tell

115
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,590
And then...

116
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,930
Staff) Alright, it's OK. We're done at this restaurant

117
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,000
Staff) Daian, could you two wait here for a little while?

118
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,340
We let Daian have some alone time...

119
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,040
You seriously...

120
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,250
You're so bad

121
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,150
It's so bad

122
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,150
Did she just do it?

123
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,420
Because she's still not used to it

124
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,990
Everyone's finding out soon if that's the case

125
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,560
Everyone will know

126
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,890
Seriously, it's like Angelina Jolie

127
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,400
She got Angelina Jolie lips

128
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,840
It's like Obake no Q-Tarō, isn't it?

129
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,010
The lips, really

130
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,080
Can she really change that much?

131
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,180
She used to be cute, before

132
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,020
Seems she's been through a lot

133
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,260
They're getting excited talking about her plastic surgery in secret

134
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,420
Ogi was like this too

135
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,130
Totally,
I remember

136
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,130
I know

137
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,130
You were like this, Ogi

138
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,260
And then when filming restarts...

139
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,670
the group go to a Korean food restaurant recommended by their special guest

140
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,910
And then...

141
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,310
Staff) Sorry, we need to fix your makeup Nīyama-san

142
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,410
They fix the makeup on her bulging lips

143
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,820
Seeing this, Daian...

144
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,790
can't stand it and start to laugh

145
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,460
Then when she accentuates
her mouth while eating...

146
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,100
He laughed!

147
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,100
She's going to notice

148
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,180
He's just laughing

149
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,180
She can't blow

150
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,180
She can't blow

151
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,450
I'd laugh if I were them

152
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,450
Nīyama's doing it

153
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,980
She's making them laugh

154
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,350
(Ogi) It looks like it

155
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,350
Honestly

156
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,050
Nīyama-san, need any water?

157
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,590
(Nīyama) I'm fine, thank you

158
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,200
It's really good. Wow

159
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,630
(Yūsuke) Like, the flavor is...

160
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,700
This is hopeless

161
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,700
Tsuda...

162
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,300
Isn't he bad?

163
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,300
Why so much...

164
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,370
He's out of control

165
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,370
Nīyama-san overdid it

166
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,140
Because Nīyama-san
can't see her own face, right?

167
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,480
She can't, and she's
trying to make them laugh

168
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
It's her fault too

169
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,150
A mosquito stung me

170
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,620
What time of the year do mosquitoes sting you?

171
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,720
Today's the coldest day in 20 years

172
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,990
Why did a mosquito...

173
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,990
(Tsuda) What's up with this guy?

174
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,760
Why at a Korean restaurant...

175
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,430
They're trying to make it about something else

176
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,430
Yeah

177
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,430
Like 'look, we're laughing
at something else!'

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,900
Why did a mosquito sting you? This guy...

179
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,370
They try to fake it but...

180
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:22,310
for some reason the plastic surgery makes them crack up and they can't stop laughing

181
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,220
Manager

182
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,220
Then, in the car on the way to their next location

183
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,460
She was different when she was on TV a year or two ago

184
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,420
Isn't anyone she knows saying anything?

185
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,360
Like her makeup artist or manager

186
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,330
Well I guess it's hard to tell someone that

187
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,130
Can they say it casually?

188
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,700
Even if they do...

189
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,000
That might be OK

190
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,000
She might say something like "Sure"

191
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,240
No but it's... What should we do?

192
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,510
We're not going to say, are we?

193
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,480
Although they considered pointing it out...

194
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,250
in the end Daian did not bring up the surgery all day

195
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,090
But they might as well have

196
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,420
Right? Since they laughed so hard

197
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,490
And after the segment with Nīyama is over...

198
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,500
and Daian are alone,
it's time for the...

199
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,800
Prank Reveal

200
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,300
Staff) How was today?

201
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,270
I want to come here again

202
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,710
It was fun, wasn't it?

203
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,880
Staff) Is there anything on your mind about today?

204
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,250
Those lips were incredible...

205
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,580
Staff) Honestly, what did you think when you saw them?

206
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,380
I was surprised. Like...

207
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,450
But you hear about people doing stuff like that sometimes

208
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,520
You can't mention it

209
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,220
Staff) By the way

210
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,090
Staff) This show isn't "Tokyo Shopping Street Tour"

211
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,100
Huh?

212
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
I see

213
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,300
(Yūsuke) What do you mean?

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,710
Like a psychopath. Scary

215
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,140
Suiyoubi no Downtown, right?

216
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,480
So...

217
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,980
I heard all of it

218
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,920
You laughed too much! From the start

219
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:13,360
Theory: If a female celebrity you haven't seen for a long time has had loads of plastic surgery, it's hard to point it out

220
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,360
What is this?

221
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,890
It's just your lips, right?

222
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,190
It's not just my lips!

223
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,700
Your eyelids are so weird

224
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,700
Yes, yes

225
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,170
Under them?

226
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,170
That's right. The puffy eye bags that are trendy now

227
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,000
Cheekbones too?

228
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,140
No, these are all mine

229
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,740
Ah...

230
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,140
Ah... sorry...

231
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,070
(Nīyama) You're just insulting me now

232
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,080
And so, our next targets are...

233
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,010
Hello! We're Ginshari!

234
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,520
Ginshari

235
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,520
Hashimoto Nao

236
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,520
Unagi Kazuhiro

237
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,020
We've arrived

238
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,020
Yes we have

239
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,850
And the person who'll be our plant,

240
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:46,590
Anzai Hiroko

241
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,920
the second female celebrity we
haven't seen in a while...

242
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,390
A special guest

243
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,430
I didn't know

244
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,430
I'm nervous

245
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,560
Well then, shall we call her in?

246
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,600
It's Anzai Hiroko-san! Please come in

247
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,170
Hello

248
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,170
Hello, welcome, thank you for coming

249
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,040
Anzai-san

250
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,910
Hello, I'm Anzai Hiroko

251
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,880
This time, we've increased
the level of surgery

252
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,740
Eye
bags

253
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,740
Lips

254
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:12,850
Surgery Level

255
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,650
As well as her lips and eye bags,

256
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,850
Nose bridge

257
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,850
we've Avatar-ized her nose

258
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,650
Hello. Seriously?

259
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,650
Seriously? Seriously?

260
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,160
Hello!

261
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,160
Hello, welcome, thank you for coming

262
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,230
Hello, thank you.
I'm Anzai Hiroko

263
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,230
His face now

264
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,230
They can't hold it in

265
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,830
It's coming out

266
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,830
Look at Hashimoto

267
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,370
No, she's my age

268
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,600
Seriously?

269
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,370
Ah, I'm happy. Thank you

270
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,400
From gravure, right?

271
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,310
I knew this would be funny

272
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:40,780
Manager

273
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:40,780
And, like before,
when Anzai and the staff leave them alone...

274
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,210
Do you remember how her face used to look?

275
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,150
Back then? I do but...

276
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,620
She was in her teens then, wasn't she?

277
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,790
Well, that...

278
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,520
Like it's...

279
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,560
I don't even know if I can look properly

280
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,060
She's so different compared to back then

281
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,300
I don't mean anything bad by it but...

282
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,700
It's like Kaiji

283
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,200
You can't tell her that

284
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,570
I definitely won't

285
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:10,110
As expected her new face is a hot topic

286
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:16,610
But they don't seem to be mentioning it to her so...

287
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,420
I just love Korea

288
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,550
I go there all the time

289
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,260
What do you go there for? The food?

290
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,160
For the food and for beauty

291
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Ah, beauty too

292
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,090
For things like Yomogi steaming, right?

293
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,090
That's right, that's right

294
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,260
For perspiration

295
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,170
The one that that goes up your butt?

296
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah, yeah. Like that

297
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,070
With the words "Korea" and "beauty",

298
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,370
we hinted at
plastic surgery but...

299
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,540
They didn't bite

300
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,610
Manager

301
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,940
However, when they're alone again

302
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,450
To tell you the truth, I don't even know if it's her

303
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,450
No, it's her. It is.

304
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,750
That's her voice. It's fine

305
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,160
I didn't really know her voice

306
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,160
Her voice is just like that...

307
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,660
Because I mostly know her from photos

308
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,630
She hasn't changed that drastically, has she?

309
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,370
She has, you know. She's changed too much...

310
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,370
Isn't it just a little?

311
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,200
It's not a little. It's not

312
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
She's a totally different person

313
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,440
That being said, I don't really mind

314
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,440
Yes, yes

315
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,440
In the end, it's all about whether she's happy with it or not

316
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,440
I guess

317
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:27,050
Hashimoto is a progressive comedian, respectful of diversity

318
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:34,190
So once again, the shoot ends without surgery being mentioned

319
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,960
(Staff) "Tokyo Shopping Street Tour"
isn't the name of this show

320
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,160
Prank Reveal

321
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,430
Wait a moment. Seriously

322
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,140
I think there's only one show it could be

323
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,740
Suiyoubi?

324
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,740
What else?

325
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,370
Woah, hold on a minute. This is so bad

326
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,140
It has to be Anzai-san

327
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,380
Theory: If a female celebrity you haven't seen for a long time has had loads of plastic surgery, it's hard to point it out

328
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:58,350
So after she explains today's
theory to them...

329
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,750
There's no way we could

330
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,090
It's impossible

331
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,590
What kind of theory is this?

332
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,660
It's obviously impossible, right?

333
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,660
Why didn't you mention it?

334
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,960
Huh, so you're really her?

335
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,130
I am

336
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,860
You are... Sorry, sorry

337
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,970
Huh, so it's okay to tell you that?

338
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,570
That you've done loads of surgery

339
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,900
So you're going public about it?

340
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,280
Unagi thinks the plastic surgery is real

341
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,980
And our last targets are...

342
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,180
It's Tokyo Shopping Street Tour!

343
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,180
Yay!

344
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,690
Hamaie Ryūichi

345
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,690
Kamaitachi

346
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,690
Yamauchi Kenji

347
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,990
And our plant is...

348
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,190
Nīyama Chiharu, with even
more plasticity

349
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,860
Nīyama Chiharu-san? Come in!

350
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,500
We haven't met before

351
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,500
That's right

352
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
(Nīyama) Hello

353
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,200
Hello

354
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,090
Nīyama Chiharu-san? Come in!

355
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,760
We haven't met before

356
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,760
That's right

357
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,590
Hello

358
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,160
Nice to meet you. I'm looking forward to today

359
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,170
This time, in addition to her eyes and lips,

360
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,400
Eye
bags

361
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,400
Lips

362
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:28,040
Surgery Level

363
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:28,040
Surgery Level

364
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,170
we've given her a prosthetic nose too

365
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,040
Nose

366
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,010
(Nīyama) Hello!

367
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,010
Come in, Nīyama Chiharu-san!

368
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,510
(Nīyama) Ah, that's right

369
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,510
We haven't met before

370
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,510
(Nīyama) Ah, hello

371
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,510
Hello

372
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,580
Nice to meet you.
I'm looking forward to today

373
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,850
Yamauchi.. Ah, Hamaie's laughing. Stop!

374
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,860
Hamaie-san

375
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,860
Stop it Hamaie

376
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,360
I'm so happy
That's right, we haven't met before

377
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,560
I come here fairly often

378
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,530
(Yamauchi) Ah, we don't...

379
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,600
Hamaie has to stop

380
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,600
Hamaie's laughing, seriously

381
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
He can't do that

382
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,640
(Yamauchi) We weren't expecting it but
our first shoot was in Togoshi Ginza.

383
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,410
Out of Tokyo's shopping streets...

384
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,480
He's become like Furuhata

385
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,480
TL Note: Musician Furuhata Ninzaburō poses like that

386
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,310
it's the shopping street we know best.

387
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,380
(Nīyama) Ah

388
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,380
He is

389
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,380
Yamauchi's very good

390
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,620
Huh, Hamaie-san, are you okay? What happened?

391
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,620
I'm fine. Excuse me

392
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,390
Faced with this deadly weapon,

393
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:25,660
right from the start, Hamaie can't stop laughing

394
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,330
And then...

395
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,500
There's a Korean restaurant nearby

396
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,170
The gomtang soup there is really good

397
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,510
What's "gomtang"?

398
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,510
I've heard of it

399
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,640
It's full of collagen

400
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,640
So it makes you plump and soft

401
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,010
You definitely seem plump

402
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,820
Really? Yesterday I had some actually

403
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,020
So if you eat that your skin fills up

404
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,020
Like jelly

405
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,030
Just like how Korean cosmetics contain capsaicin to make your lips swollen

406
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,960
They really are

407
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,960
Huh? I'm so happy. Is that a compliment?

408
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,170
(Nīyama) It's really popular now

409
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,400
They're really plump

410
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,070
Although he doesn't use
the term 'plastic surgery'...

411
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:14,310
Yamauchi boldy mentions her lips

412
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,150
And then...

413
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,080
Have you changed your makeup?

414
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,080
My makeup...

415
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,220
As I approached my 40s,

416
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,890
I've started using nothing but drug store makeup that doesn't cost a lot

417
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,090
thinking it'd be good to make a change

418
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,230
Today it's all drug store makeup

419
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,170
(Nīyama) Yes

420
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,230
Plump... They're so plump

421
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:43,270
Like, compared to how I remember you, they're so plump

422
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
Ah, really?

423
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,440
The drug store

424
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,850
Halfway through! There's no coffee left

425
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,720
Yes, it's that good

426
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,820
It has to be something special to do that

427
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,890
Once again, Nīyama and the staff leave them alone

428
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,130
Her face is weird

429
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,630
Manager

430
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,630
I almost made a joke about it

431
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,170
Thinking it was a joke where a fake person comes out

432
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,180
Like I was going to say "Who are you?"

433
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,680
I was about to say "you're fake, right"

434
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,310
That was really close

435
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,380
And can you stop with all that beauty talk?

436
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,060
Like how you were talking about how plump her lips are

437
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,330
Well there are people who like that kind of thing

438
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,330
I guess so, sure

439
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,700
Fat lips must be fashionable

440
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,670
Although...

441
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,600
Nīyama Chiharu-san probably thinks it's a good idea

442
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,600
Manager) Probably

443
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,140
So we shouldn't really worry about it

444
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,870
Kamaichi say if she's okay with it,
the outside world shouldn't complain

445
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,870
However...

446
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,190
Were you popular? In your schooldays

447
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,190
In school but also...

448
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:09,260
Recently men have been checking me out even more than back then

449
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,830
I think

450
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,860
Wow! This is going to give my skin a boost

451
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,370
It's boosted plenty already

452
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,870
It is?

453
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:16,870
Yeah

454
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,840
Isn't it already the best already now?

455
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,010
It's good now?

456
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,940
It's not good to boost it too much

457
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,580
Now's already enough

458
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,650
If you become even more attractive than this,
everyone will look at you too much

459
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,020
So now's a good time to stop

460
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,750
Really?

461
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,120
Seriously, right now, this is enough

462
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,330
You're beautiful

463
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,560
(Nīyama) Really?

464
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:50,070
"You shouldn't get more surgery", they tell her in a roundabout way

465
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,270
Is she trying to get them even puffier?

466
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,970
It seems so

467
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,540
She's had her lips done

468
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,910
Ah, definitely

469
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,810
She's totally different

470
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,380
Her nose's different too

471
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,280
Now I look at it, it seems so

472
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,590
Horipro will have to stop her, right?

473
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,590
TL Note: Talent agency

474
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:14,590
Ah but she herself said she's good now

475
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,590
She did. Because...

476
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,460
It's like manzai. Sometimes you end up having no idea what's going on

477
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,030
You try to keep fixing it

478
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,030
And it stops being funny

479
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,770
So you fix it and fix it and you don't know what's funny anymore

480
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,440
One month before M-1?

481
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,110
Around then

482
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,110
That time?

483
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,980
We fixed it too much and didn't know

484
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,350
Nīyama-san's now a month before M-1

485
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:46,060
Prank Reveal

486
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,830
Staff) Good work

487
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,890
Ah, the lips

488
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,600
It has to be the lips

489
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,770
Not just them. Everything, right?

490
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,540
You're the Wednesday people, aren't you?

491
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,000
Staff) Are you sure?

492
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,140
It definitely feels like it

493
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,310
Staff) What do you think the theory is?

494
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,680
"Nīyama Chiharu's had surgery"

495
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,680
It wouldn't be so simple

496
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,920
As before, Nīyama explains the theory

497
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,830
Theory: If a female celebrity you haven't seen for a long time has had loads of plastic surgery, it's hard to point it out

498
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,360
It is

499
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,730
But that's not a theory

500
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,730
That's hard to do

501
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,030
You knew before investigating, surely

502
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,700
We're not going to say "You've had surgery!"

503
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,440
Only an outsider would say such a thing

504
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,280
So, the result is:
People are free to have surgery and it's not something to point out

505
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,880
(Ogi) Great

506
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,880
Wow, amazing

507
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,550
Well...

508
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,690
It was done perfectly

509
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,050
Right?

And it looked so good too

510
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,060
The surgery

511
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,060
Yeah

512
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,560
And Anzai Hiroko-san...

513
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,690
What an excellent choice

514
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Really,
it seemed so plausible

515
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,400
Like if Anzai Hiroko-san
did have surgery...

516
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,830
"That'd be her face"
if she were to get surgery

517
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,840
Daian laughed the most, right?

518
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,840
That was terrible

519
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,840
Right

520
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,840
Tsuda was so bad

521
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,510
Tsuda was, really.
And the inside of his mouth...

522
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,010
Even though it was full,
he burst out laughing

523
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,010
You could see everything inside

524
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,080
He went that far
despite being on camera

525
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,290
If we were to progress it a bit further...

526
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,520
We could give them 3 nostrils

527
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,420
Like what would people do then?

528
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,420
They'd probably say in that case

529
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,260
They'd say something

530
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,860
(Ogi) They'd say something

531
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,860
They would

532
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,860
Well...

533
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,860
What would they say?

534
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,770
Huh...

535
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,030
Huh... What happened?

536
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,670
Here's our next presenters.
Come in!

537
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,880
Yes, it's Shizzle!

538
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,220
Presenters:
Ikeda Kazuma / Murakami Jun
(Shizzle)

539
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,380
Thank you, hello.
We're Shizzle!

540
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,450
Long time no see, Shizzle

541
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,850
For our segment today,
everyone...

542
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:00,190
Do you eat the bentos in the green room?

543
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,390
Yes

544
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,390
Yes

545
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,390
I do sometimes

546
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,390
Yeah, I do

547
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,160
And Hori-san,
how about...

548
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,130
Taking a bento from there home?

549
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,170
Really?!

550
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,170
Yes, I do

551
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,170
Ah, really?

552
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,240
Huh?

553
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,240
Three meals a day isn't enough so...

554
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,740
Huh?!

555
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,740
I eat about 5 or 6

556
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,580
Just like Rickson Gracie

557
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,510
Oh, really?

558
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,580
Breathing?

559
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,580
Can you do that cool breathing?

560
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580
(Ogi) Rickson's breathing

561
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580
She can't

562
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,020
She probably doesn't know who he is

563
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,850
I definitely don't take them home

564
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,850
Ogi, do you take them home?

565
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,190
Definitely

566
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,190
Definitely?

567
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,460
It's just embarrassing

568
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,190
First of all, the act of taking one
home is embarassing

569
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,190
It's not embarrassing

570
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,190
Such a simple reason

571
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,200
But it's unseemly,
carrying it around

572
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Well, sure. Put it in a bag

573
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
And I don't think of them
as being left over

574
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,070
I think of them as being for the crew

575
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Fantastic

576
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,210
So taking them is wrong

577
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,210
I see

578
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,210
Today,

579
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,710
we bring you a theory
related to those bentos

580
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,710
Here it is

581
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,710
Yes!

582
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:59,780
Unsuccessful Comedian Competition:
The battle to decide the King of the Taking Bentos from Backstage Home

583
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,720
(Ōkubo) Oh no!

584
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,650
I don't like this

585
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,650
Oh, sounds funny

586
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,660
You know, young comedians
with no money

587
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,160
will surely take home
not just 1 or 2

588
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
I see

589
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
but a large amount of bentos

590
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
There's a tendency, yes

591
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,230
Today we'll find out who's the best at it

592
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,230
By the way, what about you?

593
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,840
The truth is, Ikeda here...

594
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,840
Yes

595
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,170
You?

596
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,170
has a bit of a habit of taking them home

597
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,170
Yes. Well, however...

598
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,740
I've only found out now that this is an "unsuccessful comedian battle"

599
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,010
Ah, they got you, did they?

600
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,010
I'd understand if it were "not successful"

601
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,350
but "unsuccessful" is a bit...

602
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,450
It's like "in the future too"

603
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,350
It's true

604
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,350
This is the first I've seen of it

605
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:42,130
Unsuccessful Comedian Competition:
The battle to decide the King of the Taking Bentos from Backstage Home

606
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:48,370
For this, we surveyed comedians and managers from each office

607
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:55,540
to find comedians with a habit of taking bentos home. Of those with the most votes, 7 have been entered into the competition

608
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,440
The first is...

609
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,980
Hey

610
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,980
Hi

611
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,650
Target:
Shizzle
Ikeda Kazuma

612
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:12,490
Nominator:
Shizzle
Murakami Jun

613
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:11,050
I've never seen him not take catering or bentos home so...

614
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,460
In 18 years

615
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,330
As soon as Ikeda enters the green room...

616
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,560
Hey, wait a moment. What's this?

617
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,200
Huh, what's all this?

618
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,670
There are bentos

619
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,870
Don't you wish they'd told us?

620
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,680
I ate before coming here, unfortunately

621
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,680
They don't usually but still...

622
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:38,350
Today, we've invited the comedians to a fake segment in
the show "Dream East-West Gag Battle"

623
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:43,750
and prepared this room as green room for the VTR material

624
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:48,190
Because it's a large-scale special program,
the bentos are numerous and luxurious

625
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:50,360
Maisen
Mini burger

626
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:50,360
Maisen
Sandwich

627
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:50,360
Origin Bento

628
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:50,360
Torikyū

629
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:50,360
Tsutaya

630
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,190
Furthermore...

631
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,700
Oh, it's just us?

632
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,530
We're last so it seems people were taking turns in here

633
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,530
Ah, really?

634
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:04,140
Yes, this is a green room that comedians shooting material take turns using

635
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,640
And they're the last ones

636
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,650
G Takashi

637
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,650
Shiomariachi

638
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,650
Shizzle

639
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,650
TEAM Kondō

640
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,480
Perfect conditions for taking bentos home

641
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,380
At this point, Ikeda...

642
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,490
Do you have something like a bag...

643
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,490
(Staff) One moment, yes

644
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,790
Ah, is it alright?

645
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,330
Sorry to trouble you, thank you

646
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,330
He orders a bag
from the program staff

647
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,500
A bag? They're not even free anymore

648
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,430
It's that...

649
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,870
I came here with a small bag

650
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,370
I can't fit so much. What should I do?

651
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,580
Huh, what's this? It's so good

652
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,520
It's because it's a new year special

653
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,520
Great. So that's why?

654
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,350
Then...

655
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,360
Better than Messi?

656
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,360
What... ...dding ...ally

657
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:55,260
TL Note: He's only saying some of the words

658
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
What... kidd...

659
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,230
Thank you very much

660
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,800
After they've finished shooting material...

661
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,300
Murakami leaves the green room first

662
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,070
and starts monitoring in another room

663
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,310
Then...

664
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,310
He's standing there so much

665
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,310
He keeps looking and looking

666
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,380
Because he's alone

667
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,380
He's already taken 2

668
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,380
Oh, he's stacking them up

669
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,860
First he secures 2 of the
popular Torikyū bentos

670
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:26,520
Torikyū (Karaage Bento)

671
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:26,520
Torikyū (Special Bento)

672
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,730
And then...

673
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,530
he puts that bag in his rucksack

674
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,700
He travels by motorbike

675
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,370
Right now he's planning, in his head

676
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,510
So Ikeda can't carry things in his hands

677
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,710
Next...

678
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,520
4 Maisen

679
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,620
Maisen
(pork fillet cutlet sandwich)

680
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,620
Maisen
(shrimp cutlet sandwich)

681
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
and then...

682
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,530
another 2 Torikyū

683
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,130
Torikyū (Karaage Bento)

684
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,130
Torikyū (Special Bento)

685
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,730
Woah... This is offensive

686
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,800
*tuts*

687
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,010
He tutted! What was it for? What?

688
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,140
"It doesn't fit"

689
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,710
He then fills the empty space
with snacks and cup ramen

690
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:21,810
Prices are based on our research

691
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,810
Choco pie

692
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,810
Jagarico (chips)

693
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,810
Cup ramen

694
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,810
Cup ramen

695
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,810
Cup soup

696
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,390
Once his rucksack is full...

697
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,460
he reluctantly leaves the green room

698
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
So here's the...

699
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,260
Prank Reveal

700
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,460
This is embarrassing

701
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,960
I don't like this kind of thing

702
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,700
Evening

703
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,470
Good evening

704
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,800
Good evening. Can we go inside for a minute?

705
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,970
Eh, what is this?

706
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:54,310
Ikeda's eyes are like those of a frightened shoplifter

707
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,310
Definitely

708
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,310
No no

709
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,410
Just like he's a shoplifter

710
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,320
We know already

711
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,480
I stole nothing!

712
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,850
Could you please unpack your bag?

713
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,950
Woah... no.. woah

714
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,620
Could you please unpack your bag? Come on

715
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,690
I know what you're thinking

716
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,260
Ah, look how full it is

717
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,170
Wow... this... it's so bad

718
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,000
It's really bad isn't it?

719
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,010
Incredible!

720
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:30,080
Oh man, it's going to be so bad when my dad sees this

721
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,380
Here's a mini ramen

722
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,520
Even though he told me to stop doing stuff like this

723
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,380
Mini ramen, yes

724
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,450
Ikeda's haul consisted of:

725
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:45,030
Bento

Cutlet sandwich

Mini burger

Cup ramen

Snacks

Drinks

Total items

726
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,220
Cup ramens
with snacks and cans of juice,

727
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,560
and 4 Maisen with 4 Torikyū.

728
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,260
A total of 6,758 yen.

729
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,530
I was going to tell my wife about this on LINE

730
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,970
Like "I've hit the jackpot today"

731
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Our next target is...

732
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:02,050
Target:
Makino Suteteko

733
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,510
Please don't forget me!

734
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,840
Hip hip hip!

735
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,850
It's hip hop!

736
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,550
The person nominating her is her kōhai
from the same office,

737
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,220
Nominator:
Ishide Nanako

738
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,020
She never doesn't take something home

739
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,190
Whenever I've been able to work with her,

740
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,560
Suteteko-san's always taken something home

741
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,530
So, after returning from shooting material...

742
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,330
Suteteko changes her clothes and then...

743
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,470
Looks like it

744
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,470
She's free to take anything

745
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,980
She knows what to do

746
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,480
As expected, she first takes
2 easy-to-carry Torikyū Bentos

747
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,680
Torikyū (Karaage Bento)

748
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,680
Torikyū (Special Bento)

749
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,980
Look how big her bag is

750
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,820
Unsuccessful comedians have
big bags, don't they?

751
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,820
And then...

752
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,820
She's still going?

753
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,820
Yes, yes

754
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,330
Looks like it

755
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:58,500
Maisen (mini burger)

756
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,300
2 Maisen mini burgers,

757
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,440
and 2 cutlet sandwiches.
And then...

758
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,510
Maisen
(pork fillet cutlet sandwich)

759
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,510
Maisen
(shrimp cutlet sandwich)

760
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,140
2 of the industry favorite
Tsutaya bento

761
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:09,680
Tsutaya (Seaweed bento)

762
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,950
Carrying them 2 at a time
for some reason,

763
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:18,560
Origin (makunouchi)

764
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:18,560
Origin (seaweed)

765
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,450
She puts a total of
10 products in her rucksack

766
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,460
And then...

767
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,460
She rummages through the snacks too

768
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,470
She looks bad with her mask

769
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,140
I don't know why but it looks bad

770
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,840
And how she's speechless too

771
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:44,250
Appro

772
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:44,250
Baum-roll

773
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:44,250
Choco pie

774
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:44,250
Jagarico

775
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:44,250
Kabukiage

776
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:44,250
Le Monde

777
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,640
She's selective

778
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,150
Her rucksack's about to burst

779
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,480
And then finally...

780
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,490
No way. Stop already!

781
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,030
Cup ramen

782
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,390
She adds a cup ramen

783
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:04,330
With enough food on her back to last her a week if she got lost in the mountains,

784
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,740
she escapes the green room half running

785
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,640
Prank Reveal

786
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,940
Huh?

787
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,940
You dropped your tea

788
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,870
Suteteko-san!

789
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,650
Suteteko-san

790
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,680
Nana-chan!

791
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,680
You took quite a look didn't you, Suteteko-san?

792
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,420
No but this is really...

793
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,950
Yes, well, could you just take out...

794
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,950
No but it's...

795
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,160
It's...

796
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,420
Ah, look at this

797
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,120
What is this? It's like a goody bag

798
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,030
Suteteko's total is an astonishing 43 items

799
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:40,470
Bento

Cutlet sandwich

Mini burger

Cup ramen

Snacks

Drinks

Total items

800
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:36,300
for a score of 9,229 yen,
beating Ikeda's.

801
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,300
(Ishide) I said take it all out,
didn't I, Suteteko-san?

802
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,110
Well, actually...

803
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,640
The truth is I wanted to take so much more

804
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,480
So why did you stop?

805
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,980
Well, if I'd been carrying stuff in both my hands,→

806
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,990
wouldn't it have looked weird? I came here carrying nothing

807
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,990
Next, it's...

808
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,920
(singing theme song to Jaws)

809
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,930
Woah, an Indian!

810
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,160
Target:
Impossible
Hiru-chan

811
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,830
One time he took like five bentos home,

812
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:15,840
Nominator:
Impossible
Eiji

813
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,370
with the aim of rationing them out over a week

814
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,840
but he ate them all in a single day

815
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,280
When Hiru-chan
returns to the green room,

816
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,810
he takes out his clothes to make an empty bag

817
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,860
With a hat like a criminal

818
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,630
He's thinking about how to pack it all

819
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,630
Definitely. He's good at this

820
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:46,040
Tsutaya (Seaweed bento)

821
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,470
It's not

822
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,470
Yeah, it's not his first time

823
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,870
Like a convenience store clerk

824
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:54,180
Then he balances the bentos'
positions to destroy the evidence

825
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,180
So he knows he's doing wrong, then

826
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,180
Cup soup

827
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,850
It's scary how he's saying nothing

828
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,860
Can of coffee

829
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,860
Can of coffee

830
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,860
Can of juice

831
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Ah, wait, wait

832
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:14,860
Prank Reveal

833
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,330
Do you have a moment?

834
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,330
Huh?

835
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:19,040
Don't say 'huh?'. Just empty the bag, please

836
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,270
What? It's just clothes...

837
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,570
Look! Look!

838
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,110
Just clothes

839
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,440
He's covered it. Woah

840
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,440
It's just clothes

841
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,640
It's just clo...

842
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,710
I thought something was wrong

843
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,020
Wow!

844
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,220
Seriously? Huh? How embarrassing

845
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,960
He had 10 bentos
in his bag but

846
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:50,770
Bento

Cutlet sandwich

Cup ramen

Snacks

Drinks

Total items

847
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,460
Hiru-chan's total is 9,060 yen

848
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,870
just about losing out
to Suteteko

849
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,400
I'm embarrassed

850
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,710
You've been in the industry for 17 years already

851
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,310
Yeah

852
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,080
Even a young comedian wouldn't do this, really

853
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,780
I was planning to party for three days and three nights

854
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,420
Next...

855
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,420
You don't need that
you idiot

856
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:17,060
Someone who's lately been working
mainly as a garbage worker...

857
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:17,060
Target:
Machine Guns
Takizawa Shūichi

858
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:31,570
Nominator:
Machine Guns
Nishihori Ryō

859
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,560
Takizawa's obsession with free stuff is amazing

860
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,940
He derives the greatest pleasure in not having to spend a dime

861
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,570
So it's not that he has no money but he wants to profit

862
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,940
Let's see...

863
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,850
Thank you very much!

864
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,390
We're done

865
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,390
We're done

866
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,290
Without hesitation

867
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,290
Wow!

868
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,960
The moment they return
to the green room,

869
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:55,200
Can of coffee

870
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:55,200
Can of coffee

871
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
he springs smoothly into action,

872
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,860
putting 5 canned coffees
into his rucksack.

873
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,730
It's like he's tidying up

874
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,640
It is like he's tidying up, isn't it?

875
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,740
Like a garbage worker

876
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,140
Then, Nishihori exits the room

877
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,640
leaving him alone...

878
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,140
He's eating

879
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,450
That's another bag, the stomach

880
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,720
Can of juice

881
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,720
Can of juice

882
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,890
He did it, he did it

883
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,490
All of them!

884
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,490
Scary

885
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,890
Can of juice

886
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,890
Can of juice

887
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,830
Amazing

888
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,560
He's doing it while eating

889
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,500
He's looking outside occasionally

890
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,740
Ah, this is good

891
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,580
He's not doing it while eating
but rather eating while doing it

892
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,520
I don't like how he's doing it

893
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,520
It's amazing how he can hold three of them

894
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:56,390
Can of coffee

895
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:56,390
Can of coffee

896
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,500
He occasionally interrupts his work to eat...

897
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,630
He's not going for the bentos at all though

898
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,630
Yes, how come?

899
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,640
He's looking outside so much

900
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:13,410
One after another, with a practiced hand.

901
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:13,410
he cleans up the catering in an organized fashion

902
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:18,510
Perhaps if I were there he wouldn't go this far

903
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,920
Maybe I make him self conscious

904
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,260
Next, Takizawa takes this out of his rucksack...

905
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,330
A spare bag dedicated to carrying things home

906
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:45,110
Torikyū (Karaage Bento)

907
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:45,110
Torikyū (Special Bento)

908
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,910
He puts 6 Torikyū bentos in all at once

909
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,910
And then...

910
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,190
With the skill of a trader

911
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,190
It is like a trader, really

912
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,790
he takes a total of 10 Maisen
shrimp cutlet and pork fillet
cutlet sandwiches

913
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:02,290
Maisen
(pork fillet cutlet sandwich)

914
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:02,290
Maisen
(shrimp cutlet sandwich)

915
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,460
For sure

916
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,460
This wouldn't be possible for a beginner

917
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:09,600
He puts 5 Tsutaya bentos
into his second carrying-home bag

918
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:13,640
Tsutaya (Seaweed bento)

919
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:22,950
In just 6 minutes

920
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:22,950
he cleans up almost all the catering that was in the green room and finishes

921
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,980
Then...

922
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,180
He checks the perimeter and exits the room

923
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:34,090
Prank Reveal

924
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,490
You did it

925
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,490
You did it

926
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:38,330
Huh, what?

927
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,500
Where are you running off to?

928
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,130
What? What? What?

929
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,170
The one on your back too

930
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,900
This...

931
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,570
Yes, you

932
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,880
What is it I've done?

933
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,980
It's not like I've done anything wrong

934
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,880
There's nothing bad about it

935
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,820
That's why I knew you'd do it

936
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,650
In fact, you did better than I could have imagined

937
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,990
Huh, what? Is everyone angry at me?

938
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,490
Are you angry?

939
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,990
We're not angry

940
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,660
Everyone's scared

941
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,530
What's this?

942
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:11,530
No, no

943
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,670
I got these from the office so they're unrelated to this

944
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,170
What did you get?

945
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,170
It's full of tissues

946
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:23,540
Wait, you got all these tissues from the office?

947
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,370
They had spare...

948
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,710
Hey, this is just the office supply

949
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,710
No, no, no, it's not

950
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,050
"I haven't done anything wrong", he says

951
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:35,650
but for some reason Takizawa can't stop sweating

952
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,490
The things he took home
from the green room

953
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:46,930
Bento

Cutlet sandwich

Cup ramen

Snacks


Total items

954
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,990
totaled an extrodinary 19,147 yen.

955
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:46,900
The fourth player to finish,
he holds a decisive lead

956
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,070
What would you do with all this? You couldn't have eaten it

957
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,070
Well, um...

958
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:54,270
Well for example, if it's hijiki, I'll collect the hijiki, from each of them

959
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,410
And then freeze it

960
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,510
You open them all

961
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,880
I open them, disassemble, if it's hijiki collect the hijiki,

962
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,780
put it in Tupperware, and freeze it for later

963
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,720
Then it's always ready. I just nuke it

964
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,950
It's not really "always ready"

965
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,790
Staff) You were amazingly fast at putting the cans in

966
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,790
Yeah

967
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,160
I thought since no one's here, I-I-I-I'll do it while I can

968
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,760
Staff) You don't like being seen?

969
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,700
Well, as you'd expect, if I get told off,

970
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,970
it's a little uncomfortable, isn't it?

971
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,970
Yes, yes

972
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,970
It is

973
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,470
Next, the fifth target is...

974
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:32,640
Target:
Miura Mild

975
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,410
Can you do that
kind of thing at karaoke?

976
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:38,310
Nominator:
Oideyasu Oda

977
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,140
When we go do a performance

978
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,310
he'll take home a huge amount of water

979
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,820
But all he took was...

980
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,650
2 Torikyū and 2 water

981
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:48,360
Bento

Drinks

983
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,790
Wait wait wait

984
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,030
This isn't funny at all!

985
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,460
No, it's so bad. No no no

986
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,700
Hey everyone, let's beat him up

987
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,700
Hold on. Did I do anything wrong here?

988
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,600
Then...

989
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,210
Target:
Minamikawa

990
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:05,210
Someone else who's
said to have a habit of
taking a lot of water home...

991
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,050
Nominator:
Ojin Osborn
Shinomiya Akira

992
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,050
Result: the joke bombed

993
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,950
It bombed?

994
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,950
Yes

995
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:13,050
Bento

Snacks

Total items

996
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,950
Why? When did it happen?

997
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,490
So what was the right answer? To take loads home?

998
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,720
If you'd put loads in, we'd be laughing so hard

999
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,720
Who would do that?

1000
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:24,330
And so our 7th and last target is...

1001
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,930
Target:

1002
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Thank you very much.
I'm AMEMIYA.

1003
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,270
Nominator:
Viking
Nishimura Mizuki

1004
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,730
We work out of the same office

1005
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,270
and have the same manager

1006
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,610
It seems he's got a dedicated carrying-home bag

1007
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,780
Plus, once he was taking so much

1008
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,510
that when he got home he found

1009
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,880
he'd taken someone's half-eaten food

1010
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,320
Could AMEMIYA beat Takizawa's score of 19,147 yen?

1011
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,220
This won't be easy
with a score like that

1012
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:12,880
Target:

1013
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,270
Our last challenger is...

1014
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,790
There it is!

1015
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:26,060
It's huge, isn't it?

1016
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,030
Wow

1017
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,130
This is possible

1018
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,660
"This is possible" he said

1019
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,100
What's possible?

1020
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
For this man, everything's possible.
He takes...

1021
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:43,940
Tsutaya (Seaweed bento)

1022
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,840
6 Tsutaya,

1023
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
6 Torikyū,

1024
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,180
Torikyū (Karaage Bento)

1025
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,180
Torikyū (Special Bento)

1026
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,180
and 10 Maisen,

1027
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,680
Maisen
(pork fillet cutlet sandwich)

1028
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,680
Maisen
(shrimp cutlet sandwich)

1029
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,980
leaving none of them behind.

1030
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,290
He's carrying them from the bottom?

1031
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,330
It's pretty heavy

1032
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,260
And then...

1033
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:13,100
He's still going?

1034
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:13,100
I guess we'll see

1035
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,140
Maisen (mini burger)

1036
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:18,710
Then he takes all 20 of the
mini burgers Takizawa left alone

1037
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,650
That's enough now. That's enough

1038
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,720
But that won't stop AMEMIYA

1039
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,290
who puts snacks into the remaining space in his bag

1040
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,330
Finally, he takes some waters...

1041
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,400
and, unbelievably...

1042
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,930
puts them into his guitar case.

1043
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,400
After stripping the room bare of its catering,

1044
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,110
AMEMIYA leaves the green room with a huge amount of luggage

1045
00:43:53,310 --> 00:44:01,120
Prank Reveal

1046
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,750
Hey, AME-chan!
Good evening

1047
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,080
Good evening

1048
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,080
What are you doing?

1049
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,290
What's that?

1050
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,520
Now hold on a minute. What is this?

1051
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,130
This is pretty terrible

1052
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:12,290
Terrible?

1053
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,100
AMEMIYA managed to get 132 items

1054
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:22,300
Bento

Cutlet sandwich

Mini burgers

Cup ramen

Snacks

Drinks

Total items

1055
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,100
with a total of 27,208 yen

1056
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,800
greatly surpassing
Takizawa's score.

1057
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:26,780
I guess I just had an urge to take it

1058
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,140
Seriously. Also, um...

1059
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,780
I'll be honest. This is kind of like my appearance fee

1060
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,780
No, this isn't included

1061
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,050
Well, basically, TV doesn't pay that much, does it?

1062
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,120
Really AME-chan?

1063
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,690
As someone from the same office, I'm embarressed

1064
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,190
There's no one who takes this much

1065
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:43,190
Well today I kinda...

1066
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,860
I got a bit greedy

1067
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,730
(Nishimura) That much?

1068
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,070
And so, the winner is...

1069
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:55,970
Green room catering take home ranking

1070
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:55,970
Takizawa Shūichi (Machine Guns)


Makino Suteteko


Hiru-chan (Impossible)


Ikeda Kazuma (Shizzle)


Miura Mild


Minamikawa

1071
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:55,910
AMEMIYA, who took home everything except for some canned drinks and 1 bento

1072
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,910
(Ogi) Amazing

1073
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,910
Amazing

1074
00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:11,490
Machine Guns -
Takizawa Shūichi






Makino Suteteko





Impossible -
Hiru-chan




Shizzle -
Ikeda Kazuma






Miura Mild







Miamikawa

1075
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,910
I didn't think he could
beat Takizawa

1076
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,910
20,000…

1077
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,910
That's true

1078
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,410
He's quite successful,
surprisingly

1079
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,420
Isn't he? Relatively

1080
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,750
He's ranked highly

1081
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,750
That's right, yes

1082
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,420
Well, that's
a bit surprising

1083
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,420
But it's not like it's...

1084
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,420
wrong

1085
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,490
It was very thief-like

1086
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,490
Well...

1087
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,490
They're not violating
any rules, right?

1088
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,500
I see

1089
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,500
(Ogi) Really?

1090
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:22,260
It's just bad manners

1091
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:24,500
And manners depend
on the individual, sometimes

1092
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
(Ogi) So it's a moral thing?

1093
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Don't cover for him so much

1094
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
(Ikeda) Morals differ by person

1095
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Ōkubo-san

1096
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,610
She is

1097
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,610
You've been looking repulsed for a while

1098
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,880
That's not...

1099
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,880
You looked totally different before the VTR

1100
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
(Ogi) I don't think it's that different

1101
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,910
It's like I've seen a nasty face

1102
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:42,820
If we checked it on an infrared camera his eyes would be glowing

1103
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,420
Really?

1104
00:45:42,820 --> 00:46:14,820

♫ I cut my nails, cut my hair

Next week, the 7th
Lyric Changing Tournament takes place

1107
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,040
Popular comedians' changed lyrics

1108
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,380
are graded by
University of Tokyo students

1109
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,380
♫ If you take it, you're done

1110
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,720
Also, the make-your-grandkid-laugh
championship

1111
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,720
where the grandkids don't laugh.
A painful reverse-prank

1112
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1113
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,720
And we investigate whether

1114
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,780
TL Note: Twin comedians

1115
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,530
The Touch do solo gigs
