Last year we did not care a bit,

13
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,240
we knew it was a joke.

14
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,440
But really ...

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,060
THIS DAY IS REALLY HAPPENED!

16
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,530
I do not remember that anger.

17
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,190
He participated in the show since the second episode.

18
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,490
But today, it's really his last appearance,

19
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,840
then I suggest we demand more explanation to the person concerned.

20

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,300
We want to hear your own lips that you stop the show.

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,820
Explain to us why.

28
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,290
Well, there are several.

29
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,130
There are several.

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,250
Yes, I see.

31
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,310
I participated in a special broadcast.

32
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,600
On my way to the backstage

33
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,190

35
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,690

00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,630

38
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,910
The Jaru Jaru were also treated to a private suite.

39
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,630
Continuing to walk,

40
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,830
I see "Rehearsal Hall B-2".

41
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,200
It is a large room for 8 groups.

Comedians

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,010
I was with THE PUNCH.

44
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,710
So I talked with Yanaoka (staff member).

45
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,050
He asked: "What is funny?"

46
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,050
Production Manager

47
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,050
Yanaoka Shuichi

48
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,040
It pissed me off.

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,770
No, I did not say that to make him laugh.

50
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,910
I told him: "It's not that!"

51
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:43,360
Yanaoka san said, "Really? I see...

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,040
This is where I would reply: "Really? You see? "

53
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,630
What do you mean?

54
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,940
We want to know why you quit the program.

55
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,470
The official version, so to speak.

56
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,450
But maybe it's hard to tell ...

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,940
You may not want to talk about it.

58
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,330
Well ...

59
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,870
My wife called Aya.

60
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,070
I talked with her,

61
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:17,150
and it turns out we managed to save enough to enter semi-retirement.

62
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,060
We would like to open

63
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,070
a store of imported items in Meguro.

64
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:28,190
* Meguro rounding Tokyo.

65
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,650
A store?

66
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,190
My wife and myself,

67
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:34,020
we love the furniture from Guam.

68
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,570
That's why we want to import this kind of furniture and open a store.

69
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,660
The discussion is progressing in this direction.

70
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,450
But this is not ... a reason to stop ...

71
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,220
You may very well continue the program in doing this.

72
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,530
- "Exactly!"

73
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,040
You can keep your store while continuing the program.

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,750
Maybe he can not tell the reasons Matsumoto san.

75
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,940
His reasons can not be said on television.

76
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,890
His heart must be closed.

77
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,590
He thought maybe we would not understand them.

78
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,860
You talked Suga san? About your reasons?

79
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,860
You could answer correctly?

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,170
But it's true, what's that video?

188
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,500
Almost 10 years.

189
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,570
We saw it 10 times.

190
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,750
The quality is excellent as well.

191
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,320
Even for television, there is no such quality.

192
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,980
Eh! ...

193
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,580
He cried!

194
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,560
Am I dreaming?

195
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,570
It's fast!

196
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,390
I dream!?

197
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,030
What made you cry in there!?

198
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,260
You have grown up in Gaki No Tsukai, Hosei kun.

199
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,970
The time has come for you to put an end to this story.

200
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,300
However ...

201
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,270
The years spent with you will never wither.

202
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:39,500
I'm sure you always decorate the album in our hearts.

203
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,940
Yes For eternity.

204
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,480
He ran away!

205
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,250
Goodbye and thank you for the memories.

206
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,780
Goodbye!

207
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,780
Thank you for the memories

208
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,040
A user, there you go.

209
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,980
It is normal that so long,

210
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,600
he was in the show for almost 20 years. This has happened things.

211
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,530
It's time to flower distribution.

212
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,390
It begins with Suga san.

213
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,590
Please.

214
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,550
~ A word from the producer Suga ~

215
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,540
Yama chan, you really did a good job.

216
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,080
You too.

217
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,340
The world of show business is really ruthless.

218
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,280
It's all or nothing.

219
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,730
Despite all these people who have made comments to him unpleasant,

220
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,910
Yama chan, 20 years ... no, 21,

221
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,770
lived in the world of show business with no talent.

222
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,420
It's impressive.

223
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,250
For thou hast left no impression.

224
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,560
Among the artists with no talent, you were in third or fourth.

225
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,300
In "Gaki", you were the 5th.

226
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,700
I am really grateful to you.

227
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,930
Thank you, I am grateful.

228
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,300
thank you very much (polite)

229
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,930
It continues ...

230
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,930
The female member of staff of Gaki No Tsukai, Uchino, would have something to say.

231
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,060
Uchino chan.

232
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,280
~ A reminder of the part of Uchino ~

233
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,820
Thank you. - "Ah! But it ...

234
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,540
Hey, it's your makeup box.

235
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,190
It was heavy to carry!

236
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,620
Ouch!

237
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,110
So the special box of Yama chan

238
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,330
prepared by staff members for the program.

239
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,440
- "Exactly!"

240
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,810
- "OK... As we now say a word,

241
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,550
and distribute bouquets of flowers. First the COCORICO.

242
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,920
~ Kohai his speech, the COCORICO ~

243
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,320
When I started in Gaki No Tsukai,

244
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,720
I did not know at all how to approach DOWNTOWN.

245
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,260
One that was between us, and gave me advice,

246
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,800
Yamasaki was you, eh?

247
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:15,750
* Endo tu his senpai, Yamasaki, which is rude and disrespectful.

248
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,010
I am really grateful to you.

249
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,810
Congratulations. Good job.

250
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,450
"Congratulations"?

251
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,590
Congratulations on your graduation.

252
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,700
In any case, I've always hated.

253
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,850
thank you very much (polite)

254
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,760
In our turn.

255
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:35,390
~ Speech of his senpai, the Downtown ~

256
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,860
Personally, I really have nothing to add. Courage for the future.

257
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,240
That's over.

258
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,920
I think that Matsumoto san has something to say.

259
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,330
Well ...

260
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,210
At one time, I was often asked: "But what he did there, Yamasaki?"

261
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,080
I replied: "No, but Yamasaki, looks like it but ..."

262
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,380
"This is an artist who sees only once a week"

263
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:04,220
Starting next week, it will change Nezumi Senpai (singer, tarento).

264
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,970
Although I wish he remains himself. This time he will be on the viewers,

265
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,750
and I hope we look.

266
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,420
I did not know that separations with only good things existed.

267
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,730
- "OK... It's finally time for Yamasaki Hosei make a speech.

268
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:37,560
~ Farewell Message to the viewers, from Hosei Yamasaki ~

269
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,950
I ..."

270
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,040
"Excuse me." I ..."

271
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,340
COCORICO san ...

272
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,190
The COCORISOCO san ...

273
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,520
Hello, le site congres-medical.com est n cour de traduction et sera tres prochainement dispoble completement e anglais

274
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,850
that's how they call me.

275
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:49,040
I ... 'll leave the "Gaki no ..."

276
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:55,980
But that does not mean ... I'll leave the TV.

277
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:03,040
I will appear in several programs ... a little bit in several travel programs.

278
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,970
And when you see me a little bit in several travelogues,

279
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,470
cheer for me!

280
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:19,000
ENCOURAGE ME, EVERYBODY!

281
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,730
I WILL BEGIN TO KEEP A BLOG!

282
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,530
THEN LEAVE ME COMMENTS!

283
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,540
Hurry up and save me!

284
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,940
There's someone, right?

285
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,420
NO I HAVE NOT WANT!

286
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,910
I DO NOT WANT TO STOP!

287
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,600
If you do not want to stop ...

288
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,510
If you do not want to stop, you're not forced to leave.

289
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,950
I DO NOT WANT!

290
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,070
It is you who ...

291
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,140
We do not force you to go ...

292
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,500
I will not!

293
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,670
I have no choice!

294
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,630
Okay, it's going ...

295
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,820
Save me!

296
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,690
Black on black, we do not see well.

297
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,740
It is less visible than he thinks.

298
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,350
He decided himself that he wanted to stop, that's why we're here.

299
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,780
But then he says he does not want.

300
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,890
That may be because of downsizing ...

301
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,990
Anyway, nothing can be done.

302
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,990
Exact.

303
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,100
So I suggest we go away.

304
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,810
Let's go.

305
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,310
Let's go.

306
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,820
WAIT A LITTLE ~!

307
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,400
So I suggest we go away. Let's go.

308
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,070
WAIT A LITTLE ~!

309
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,990
YAMA CHAN WILL NOT STOP gaki no tsuki,

310
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,930
IT WILL NOT STOP!

311
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,670
IT WILL NOT STOP!

312
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,510
IT WILL NOT STOP ~!

313
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,410
You scared?

314
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,670
You too have been afraid, not true, dear viewers?

315
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:03,570
The COCORICO and Gaki No Tsukai Downtown asked Yama chan

316
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,410
preparation of this hoax.

317
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:11,540
Yama chan Gaki No Tsukai not stop.

318
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,160
Why he chose Kudo Shizuka? (Singer)

319
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,670
Kudo Shizuka san is? - "Ah! That's true.

320
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,580
Causes a storm

321
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,540
Yama chan will not stop

322
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:31,990
Arashi no Sugao

323
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:31,990
~ Version "will not stop Yama chan ~

324
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:40,360
Yama chan is beautiful, then it can go it alone

325
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,970
Starting tomorrow, I am proposing new

326
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,700
appointment for the job

327
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:56,970
If I have the habit of running away so pathetic

328
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,600
It's all the fault of Gaki

329
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,930
I was on tiptoes

330
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:13,100
Lately, Komu is cold, it would be laughable

331
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,990
By pointing the finger at Komu

332
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,300
I want to pull the trigger

333
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,940
All the better if Komu collapses

334
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,120
Causes storm

335
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,230
Yama chan will not stop

336
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,190
Causes storm

337
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,990
I will not stop Gaki Tsuka

338
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,600
He just wanted to do this piece, I think.

339
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,270
Looks like ...

340
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,570
He wanted to do that too.

341
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,490
He had seen somewhere.

342
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,340
Again!

343
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,220
Please wait while the changes of costume and decor.

344
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,260
We must still wait?

345
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,900
It is just waiting for since earlier.

346
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,530
Welcome home, dear master ♥

347
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,360
Sorry for making you wait.

348
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,380
We bring the Premium Iced Coffee. ♥

349
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,760
A user, there you go.

350
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,820
Master Matsumoto, I would add gum syrup and milk in your coffee iced

351
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,670
do you agree?

352
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,070
Yes, if you please.

353
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,120
בסדר

354
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,070
I will now add the milk, when there will be enough,

355
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,930
Tell me, "Nyan Nyan ♥"

356
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,930
Tell a cute way, if you please. ♥

357
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,900
It must be said otherwise it will not stop.

358
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,770
Do you mind?

359
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,980
Nyan Nyan.

360
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,360
Nyan Nyan!

361
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,020
Yes thank you very much (polite)

362
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,770
But I said "Nyan Nyan" ...

363
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,270
Then, for gum syrup,

364
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,850
saying: "Chuki ♥"

365
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,850
Say it out loud, if you please.

366
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,420
Chuki!

367
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,400
I am happy, the repetition-if-you-please ♥

368
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,110
Chuki!

369
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,020
Oh, I'm happy! Again, if you please ♥

370
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,280
CHUK! I do not understand ...

371
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,100
I am happy, the repetition-if-you-please ♥

372
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,480
I said "Chuki".

373
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,390
A user, there you go. thank you very much (polite)

374
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,190
- ”Shut up!"

375
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,320
And now you can attend the rest ♥

376
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,970
Excuse us.

377
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,310
You should tell the others too.

378
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,980
No, thank you.

379
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,850
After:

380
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,850
Yamasaki in trouble in the 2nd stage!

381
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,160
It's 2 against 1, that is not fair.

382
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,680
It's not over yet ~!

383
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,670
A movie theater?

384
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,350
A 3D movie? Maybe it's "Avatar" ...

385
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,690
Komu (Director Komurasaki)

386
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,540
We're sorry for making you wait.

387
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,130
The film will be screened immediately.

388
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,170
AVATAR

389
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,630
I knew it.

390
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,810
Please bring these 3D glasses.

391
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,680
We can not even wear them ...

392
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,890
Real are much better.

~ Version "will not stop Yama chan ~

395
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,420
Wow

396
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,880
Looks like Komu sees the film in 3D.

397
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,410
Ouuuaahh

398
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,540
There is no connection with "Yama chan will not stop."

399
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,510
It does not even speak.

400
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,220
That's true.

401
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,960
It does not say "Yama chan will not stop."

402
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,030
... Will stop ...

403
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,850
- "Ah! He said.

404
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,340
He finally said.

405
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,000
But he still stumbles.

406
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,750
... Will not stop ...

407
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,690
I think it is problematic if it is still long.

408
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,030
Oh?

409
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,480
He tries to tell us: "Go".

410
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,620
Go away !

411
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,200
He asks us to leave.

412
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,990
"Hurry up and go!"

413
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,170
Well, well, let's go.

414
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,870
It persists because it took him time to prepare.

415
00:23:45,560 --> 00:24:09,350

416
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,340
Yes, that's normal.

417
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,020
This is backwards.

418
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,240
עבודה טובה

419
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,710
Why you chose Kudo Shizuka?

420
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,350
Yeah, why?

421
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,430
I wanted to do this.

422
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,350
I knew it.
