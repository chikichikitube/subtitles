1st Gaki-no-tsukai-ya-arahende!!
Duo Showdown: Battle Across Various Competitions for 100,000 Yen Prize!

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,680
Hi guys!

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,820
The two duos participating in this are Cocorico and License!

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,430
Now, let's introduce today's stars!

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,260
Downtown!

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,240
Hi.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,880
I don't really know what to do today.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,180
Moreover, I'm not feeling well today.

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,850
What should I do?

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,590
- This is a 3 duos competit ....
- Hurry up and say it.

11
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,520
- Don't be so sluggish and say it quickly.
If you make it concise, I will understand.
- Really?

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,890
- You are indeed slow to speak.
- But...

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,660
You speak slowly.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:12,370
I'm sorry!
Today, 3 teams will compete.
There are 16 panels here. Compete with the games or riddles written behind them.

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,210
The team with the highest points will receive a prize of 100,000 yen!

16
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,520
Is this given to the duo? Or is it given to each person separately?

17
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,190
That was unclear.
It can be taken either way.

18
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,890
- We will give 100,000 yen to the duo.
- 50,000 yen each?

19
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,300
Are you guys a duo?
I don't watch TV, so I don't know.

20
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,740
- We've been working together on this show with you for about 16 years.  Yes, we are a duo.
- Is that so?

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,370
Also, are the duos color-coded?

22
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,910
- Yes. Red, blue and yellow.
- I see it now.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,480
I see.

24
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:59,790
[Subbed by RAIDEN1017]

25
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,360
Anyway, the winning team will receive the prize! Good luck!

26
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,200
Now, Downtown, please pick one of the 16 panels!

27
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,900
- Then, I'll decide.
- Please do!

28
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,030
- Number 5!
- Open number 5!

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,400
Riddle!

30
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,810
This is a buzzer quiz for all teams to participate in!

31
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,650
As soon as you know the answer, press the answer button.

32
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,020
Okay, here is the question!

33
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,930
Q. Where is the scariest place in a house?

34
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,160
Go ahead!

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,030
The scariest place in a house.

36
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,100
The scariest place in a house?

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,240
Oh, I got it!

38
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,240
Go ahead, Endo.

39
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,640
- Stairs.
*Both stairs and horror stories in Japanese are
called "Kaidan".
Stairs: 階段(Kaidan) / Horror stories: 怪談(Kaidan)

40
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,610
Correct!

41
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,620
Is Endo scared of stairs?
Is your name Endo?

42
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,590
I'm not scared of it.
Horror Stories are called Kaidan, and there are Kaidan(Stairs) in the house too.

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,490
I don't think it's a good idea to suddenly say "stairs".

44
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,660
Viewers might find it hard to understand.
We understand, though.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,070
But I think they can understand it too.
It's a simple.

46
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,240
I thought Endo might have a trauma with stairs.

47
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,240
What was your intention in answering that?

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,870
What do you mean?

49
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,410
Why are you laughing!?

50
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,410
Sorry.

51
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,480
Isn't a riddle supposed to be like that?

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,820
If that's okay, then Hamada knew the answer.

53
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:46,560
But if Hamada said that, everyone would be thinking, "So what?" I think.

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,860
Hamada has influence, so everyone is expecting what he will say.

55
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,470
- You can just answer as you are.
- But, considering Hamada's influence, he can't say that.

56
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,440
You have to understand that.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,140
Hamada is a Tsukkomi! He can't say that!

58
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,810
- No, I didn't ...
- Hamada is really pitiful! He is missing out.

59
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,950
No, the riddle is fine with that answer.

60
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,750
We are missing out!!

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,580
Especially Hamada!

62
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,850
- He is not missing out at all.
- He has influence. I've said this many times!

63
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,060
This is just a riddle, please answer it quickly.

64
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,930
Cocorico earns 10 points!

65
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,630
They got ahead of them.

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,430
Next is Cocorico, please pick a panel!

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,970
- Then, number 12 please.
- Number 12, open!

68
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,970
Is the question changing from a riddle?

69
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,010
"We asked 100 people."

70
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,180
He didn't explain enough. Is this a riddle or not?

71
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,950
We interviewed 100 female college students.

72
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,350
Please see here.

73
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,620
"What is the popular dating spot?"

74
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,120
I see!

75
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,260
Please answer in order starting from Cocorico.

76
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,460
Cocorico has the advantage.

77
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,600
Amusement park!

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,230
Amusement park?
Okay, please be more specific.

79
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,870
You give Cocorico preferential treatment!

80
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,210
That's terrible! What the hell are you doing?

81
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,440
No, I didn't do that.

82
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,080
You are doing something suspicious with Cocorico!

83
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,780
You are doing something suspicious with them!

84
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,250
And it's got caught by me!!

85
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,750
No, it's not.

86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,690
You should not let Cocorico answer again, you should let License answer.

87
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,490
Oh, my god!
I'm laughing so hard it's hilarious!!

88
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,690
That's so funny!
That's sooo funny!!

89
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,260
- But an amusement park would ...
- Oh, my god!
That's so funny!
That's so funny!

90
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,830
- What does that mean?
- That's so funny!

91
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,800
You are doing something suspicious with them!
And it's got caught by me!!

92
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,570
Oh my god! I'm going to laugh!

93
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,140
We don't have to answer that, it's okay.

94
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,740
That's so funny!
That's so funny!
It's got caught by me!!

95
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,680
It's got caught by all of us!!

96
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,410
- Let License answer ...
- That's so funny!
That's so funny!

97
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,880
Shut up!!

98
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,420
- Cocorico.
- Yes.

99
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,460
"Amusement park" has a wide range, so please give a specific answer.

100
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,890
- Can I answer?
- Go ahead.

101
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,260
Disneyland.

102
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,260
Is that ranked?

103
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,730
- What the hell.
- He answered twice.

104
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,200
Correct!

105
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,570
- It's a 1st place!
- Great!

106
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,870
It's a 1st place!

107
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,310
Eiga-kan (Movie theatre).

108
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:20,650
Licence's answer was "Eiga-kan(Movie theater)," earning him 10 points.

109
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,650
Next up is Downtown!

110
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,320
- It must be Odaiba
- Yeah.

111
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,990
Is that your answer?

112
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,390
Is this ranked?

113
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,230
There will be a lot of people there.

114
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,200
- Correct.
- It's no wonder.

115
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,240
The place names are also ranked.

116
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,110
It is strange that he carefully checks with our answer.

117
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,080
The place name Odaiba was in third place.
So...

118
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,180
We're talking right now!!

119
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,750
What have you been doing since earlier?

120
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,820
Say a wrong answer.

121
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,360
Say something unrelated.

122
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,330
Say the answer, not the spot.

123
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,330
Takoyaki stand.

124
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,030
No way.

125
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,100
No way, idiot!!

126
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,570
You are an idiot.

127
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,840
No way.

128
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,970
Incorrect.

129
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,070
It's no wonder.

130
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,140
What the hell is a "takoyaki stand?"

131
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,050
You have no sense at all!!

132
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,250
"Takoyaki stand"?

133
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,280
License, go ahead.

134
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,490
It's a  chance!
Suizoku-kan (Aquarium)

135
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,890
Aquarium!
Is that ranked?

136
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,830
Yes!

137
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,940
It's a common place, so there's no need to think too hard about it.

138
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:54,610
Technically, it's "Suizoku-kan."
He said "Suizokkan."

139
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,710
There is no place called "Suizokkan".
That place doesn't exist!

140
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,850
But I understood.

141
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,120
Next up is Downtown.

142
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,650
Could it be Tokyo Dome?

143
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,190
- A common place?
- That's right! It's so...

144
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,860
Is it domed?

145
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,560
I can't answer that.

146
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,730
Tell me that much.
Is it domed or not?

147
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,000
I can't answer that.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,200
What do you think about that?
What is your personal opinion?

149
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,370
My personal opinion?

150
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,410
I can't give you my personal opinion, that would be a hint.

151
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,780
Well then, I'll also exercise my right to remain silent.

152
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,750
I don't understand what that means.

153
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,350
The answer is a common place.
There's no need to think so hard about it.

154
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,450
Karaoke.

155
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,890
Karaoke.
Yup.

156
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,290
Are you alright?

157
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,990
Okay!

158
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,160
Is karaoke ranked?

159
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,630
This is ranked.

160
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,630
That is not ranked.

161
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,410
You have led us to the incorrect, right?

162
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,140
Time's up!

163
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:12,250
The current score is Cocorico with 30 points, License with 20 points, and Downtown with 10 points.

164
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,760
Why does License have 20 points? That's weird.

165
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,960
That's for Suizokkan(Aquarium) and ...

166
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,360
- It's "Suizoku-kan"!
- Yes.

167
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,930
And Eiga-kan(Movie theatre).

168
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,600
Suizoku-kan and Eiga-kan.

169
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,940
Everything has "kan" in it.
You appear in this and that's all you say. That's terrible.

170
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,810
- Congratulations! It's good that you earned 20 points.
- Thank you!

171
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,980
There's still hardly any difference in points.

172
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:44,990
Then, Licence picked a panel of Celebrity Association Quiz.

173
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,730
It's a game where you guess who is being referred to based on hints about a celebrity.

174
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,400
Here is the first hint!

175
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,070
"Brazil."

176
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,430
Please press the button to answer once you have figured out who it is.

177
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,900
License!

178
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,400
Ruy Ramos (former soccer player).

179
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,180
- He can't guess that quickly.
- There are many people who are originally from Brazil.

180
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,580
Hamada-san!

181
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,910
Coffee.

182
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,750
There was a café called "Brazil", right?

183
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,590
The answer is a celebrity.

184
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,720
- There was a café near the training school!
- Yes, there was.

185
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,830
Hamada, I thought for a moment that it wasn't there, but it was there.

186
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,060
- Yeah.
- Medaka-san often ordered coffee there.

187
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,540
They bring it in a cup with a cling wrap, right?
"Hi, it's Brazil."

188
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,440
- Maybe I should have explained that celebrity name is the answer at the beginning.
- It's written there.

189
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,880
The Brazil's lady was a celebrity around the training school.

190
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,250
And when I say "Brazil's lady," she's just an older lady from Osaka.

191
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,080
But she was a celebrity.

192
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,790
It's a top-notch comedian ordering that coffee.

193
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,290
Hamada didn't really think this was the correct answer!

194
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,160
He answered for this show!!

195
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,530
Is it not allowed to talk about the café's older lady on this show!?

196
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,270
Did this show become one where you can't talk about the café's older lady?!!

197
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,280
Give us points!

198
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,610
Give us points!

199
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,280
- That's impossible.
- Why!?

200
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,850
Isn't that unfair?

201
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,220
Why not? We've been embarrassed here!

202
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,460
You didn't answer correctly.

203
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,930
Now, Cocorico, please pick a panel.

204
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,900
Number 15.

205
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,700
Number 15, open.

206
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,440
[Battle: Fishing Game]
Battle  Gaaaaaaa!!

207
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,370
What's a "battle gaaa"?

208
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,740
It's a fishing game.
Please go forward.

209
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:58,720
Duos will compete in a fishing game.
The time limit is one minute, and the duo who catches the most fish will receive 10 points.

210
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,190
It starts from downtown.

211
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,060
- It's a disadvantage to be the first to do this.
- Really?

212
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,690
I don't know what kind of game this is.

213
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,000
- Since we are at the top, shall we do this first?
- I see.  Let's have Cocorico do it first.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,840
- "Since we are on top"?
Hey, what's with the arrogant tone?
Then the juniors should go first.
- Then we will do this first.

215
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,310
Let's do it. We can't waste time.

216
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,620
- Hey, why are there no strings?
- Matsumoto-san...?

217
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,420
What are you talking about?
Say it clearly!

218
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,220
Matsumoto-san snapped the string before handing it over to us.

219
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,430
Do you mean to say that I snapped this?

220
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,790
Y-Yes.

221
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,460
There's no way I would do something like that. We're about to use this now.

222
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,500
That's right.

223
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,170
Oh, there's something lying over there.

224
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,040
Look, it has been lying there from the beginning!

225
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,810
This has been snapped off.

226
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,310
Since it was already like that from the beginning. Why are you so sure about that?

227
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,720
Why did you say "snapped off"?

228
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,090
"Snapped off"?
Hey, what's your point?

229
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,090
Hey.

230
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,990
- Hey, Endo, apologize to him.
- Sorry.

231
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,500
Why are you laughing?

232
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,770
- Endo.
- Sorry.

233
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,200
What are you talking about?

234
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,800
Why are you so irritable?

235
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,440
Why are you laughing?

236
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,350
- You've been strange since you came to the dressing room. Don't get annoyed!
- Sorry.

237
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,880
You definitely have some good qualities as well!!

238
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,550
Don't show your irritation on the show!

239
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,920
Yes.

240
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,390
Why are you holding onto stress by yourself?

241
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,260
- Hey!
- Sorry.

242
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,560
You'll be fine!

243
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,700
Okay, let's do this.

244
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,940
First, let's start with License.

245
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,610
Are you ready?

246
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,450
Start! The time limit is one minute.

247
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,310
What is this? It's creepy.

248
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,720
Well done.

249
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,090
Hurry up or you'll run out of time.

250
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,490
Please don't move the table.

251
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,060
I've only caught one fish so far.

252
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,830
That makes two fish now!

253
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,440
Isn't this too long?
Don't you think so?

254
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,110
10 seconds left!

255
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,640
Please don't touch the string.

256
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,450
You faaaaaaaailed!!

257
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,680
Hey, don't do that!

258
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,150
You faaaaaaaailed!!

259
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,320
Okay?

260
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,720
Your record is three fish.

261
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:50,960
How was it?

262
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,890
- The table was moving.
- Aren't you guys the worst?

263
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,660
That's not a lot.

264
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,600
You guys are the worst.

265
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,270
Didn't you touch the string with your finger at the end?

266
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,670
- This is quite difficult, isn't it?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,070
Next, Cocorico's turn.

268
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,810
Okay, let's start!

269
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,250
Wow, you're good!

270
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,780
Hey, Tanaka!

271
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,290
Do your best!

272
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,060
Endo-san already caught one fish quickly.

273
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,190
Hey, don't move, Tanaka.

274
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,160
Keep it up!

275
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,830
Endo-san is good at this!

276
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,000
It's too long.

277
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,000
Wow, awesome!

278
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,200
You still have more than half of the time remaining!

279
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:43,080
Cocorico's two skillfully caught five fish.

280
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,020
Actually, I could have caught more fish.

281
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,150
But isn't five fish enough?

282
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,660
Hamada-san kicked my butt...

283
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:02,330
- I would never do that.
We're all competing.
- What the hell.

284
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,970
That makes us look really mean, doesn't it?

285
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,970
Hamada wouldn't do something like that.

286
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,300
He quite likes Tanaka.

287
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,610
Can I watch the recorded video?

288
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,080
[VCR Verification]

289
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,850
After this, that will happen.

290
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,090
What did you do to him?

291
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,560
- I haven't seen this in a while!
This is a habit of Hamada!
- Yeah.

292
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,500
I saw it for the first time.

293
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,430
Hamada has been doing it like this since the old days.

294
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:49,480
When he became a duo with me, he used to do it a lot.
He stopped doing it when Tomii-san(Yoshimoto's employee) told him to, but he did it again after a long time.

295
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,310
He is not kicking Tanaka.

296
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,150
Wow! Can I get a copy of this video later?

297
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,350
How nostalgic!

298
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,960
Okay.

299
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,660
Next is Downtown.

300
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,460
Alright, get ready.

301
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,860
Ready, start!

302
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,770
It has started.

303
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,310
It's quite hard!

304
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,240
Keep it going!

305
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,710
He caught one.

306
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,610
Please don't hold the string.

307
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,980
Can't I hold it?

308
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,750
30 seconds left.

309
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,190
Don't hold the string.

310
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,520
Keep it going!

311
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,500
He is catching fish with his hands.

312
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,900
20 seconds left!

313
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,970
- 15 seconds left!
-  Hosei-san!

314
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,670
He is catching fish with his hands!

315
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,670
Hamada-san, please don't catch it with your hands.

316
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,210
Almost! Let's go for perfect!

317
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,150
Close!

318
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,620
They were catching fish with their hands.

319
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,360
- Did you guys see that?
- Yes.

320
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,460
- Yama-chan didn't see that.
- I was just looking at the timer.

321
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,830
Is that true?

322
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,870
I'm just surprised.

323
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,570
We all saw that.

324
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,670
I didn't expect my junior to be so inexperienced.

325
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,010
You guys can say that to your senior so easily.

326
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,580
Are you trying to make a joke?
No one is laughing!

327
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,950
- Nobody is laughing at all!
- Yeah.

328
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,460
- That's terrible!
- This is not a joke.

329
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,860
It's hard when you say something out loud and no one is laughing.

330
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,730
You'll probably dwell on it.
But I'm not really bothered by it, to be honest.

331
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,030
This is not a joke.

332
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,300
- I just held the fish I caught with a rod with my hand
- Did you really catch a fish?

333
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,700
Was it really?

334
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,440
Downtown won the game with 7 catches.

335
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,940
FUCK YEAAAAAAAH!!

336
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,410
So they get 10 points.

337
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,950
10 points!

338
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,780
Huh!? Wait!!

339
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,790
- It's okay if it's just 10 points.
- 10 points is too low!

340
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,890
That's no good.

341
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:25,330
Finally, it's a paper-cutting battle!
Each duo representative must complete a paper-cutting art that follows the theme within one minute.

342
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,600
The duo with the best work will receive 100 points.
I will judge.

343
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,910
That's good, right?

344
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,370
Let's turn the winning team of this game into a victorious team.

345
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,840
Okay, that's fine.

346
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,210
But， we ．．．

347
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,150
This is a cliché.
Endo, no one is laughing.

348
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,980
Don't make such an easy joke.

349
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,820
Endo, no one has laughed since you woke up this morning.
You know that, don't you?

350
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,600
The fate of the competition is in the hands of the three of them.
What's the theme of the paper-cutting?

351
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,900
An elephant full of dynamism.

352
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,440
Elephant.

353
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,980
Let the paper-cutting battle start!

354
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,480
Give it your all!

355
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,410
Go for it!

356
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,780
- Make an elephant in one minute!
- Hamada, do your best!

357
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,590
Elephants are characterized by their shape.

358
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:27,690
Please have the buddy set the cut paper onto the mounting board.

359
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,370
There's only a little time left.

360
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,570
We finished within the time limit.

361
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,540
- We finished quickly, so take that into consideration.
- Sure!

362
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,380
Finish!

363
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,310
Please show us one by one starting from Licence.

364
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,950
- This is my elephant.
- Nice!

365
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,350
How about this?

366
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,890
It's so detailed, and it even has tusks!

367
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,690
This looks like a mite!
This is what it looks like when you magnify a mite.

368
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,590
The house dust mite looks like this.

369
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,060
If you look at that under the microscope, it looks like this.

370
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,630
This is great! I especially like how the trunk is raised upward.

371
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,630
- It's dynamic.
- It's quite good.

372
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,860
This isn't dynamic.

373
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,370
Next, Tanaka!

374
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,170
Yeah, this is an elephant.

375
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,470
- I see! What are the points where you made efforts?
- He likes animals, but this is nothing special.

376
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,340
This is a poor elephant.

377
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:21,580
- I've depicted the elephant's mouth carefully, with an upper lip attached to the trunk and a lower lip.
- Oh, Isee.

378
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:27,720
- If a child who woke up to go to the bathroom at night saw this at their pillow, they would cry.
- That's right.

379
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,690
All right, it's pretty good.  Then, please show us Hamada-san's work for the last

380
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,700
He is truly in a different league than you guys.

381
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,430
Then, please show us Hamada-san's work for the last

382
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,070
He is truly in a different league than you guys.

383
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,370
He is truly in a different league than you guys.

384
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,070
- This is scary.
- What the hell is this?

385
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,510
What did you make?

386
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,750
Hamada is truly in a different league than you guys!!

387
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,380
Excuse me, the theme is elephants.

388
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,950
Where is the elephant in this?

389
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:00,790
This just needs a little gap here, see?

390
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,560
Is this an elephant seen from the front?

391
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,760
He just didn't have enough of it.

392
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,990
Did you guys get scared of him!?

393
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,760
He's on a different level than you guys!!

394
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,330
Why did you make a silhouette of an elephant viewed from the front?

395
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,140
That looks like a girl's face.

396
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,970
This will determine the winning team.

397
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,240
And now, let's announce the winning team!

398
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,610
The winner is ...

399
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,280
License!

400
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,650
That's ridiculous!

401
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,450
That's ridiculous!!

402
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,090
Congratulations!

403
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,360
- You were really good.
- That's ridiculous!

404
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,420
Please take this.

405
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,930
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!!

406
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,600
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!!

407
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,800
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!!
- He's extremely angry.

408
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,300
That's ridiculous!!!

409
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,770
What part of this is missing!?

410
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,340
Rather, what part of that is winning?

411
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,080
Congratulations, License!

412
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,650
Thank you!

413
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!!

414
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,990
It might have been better to cut it a little smaller.

415
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,490
We should have had an expert evaluate this.

416
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,900
We don't want an amateur who has never done paper cutting to be the judge.

417
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,730
We should have asked Dyna Haruno to come.

418
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,440
- Do you know him?
- I don't know.

419
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,510
Did someone who doesn't know Dyna Haruno judge this?

420
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,340
Endo, what's wrong?
You're off your game.

421
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,480
Me?

422
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,650
- No one is laughing.
- Me?

423
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,550
Get it together!

424
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,820
Okay, let's go.

425
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,320
He took the money.

426
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,050
- Licence, are you guys okay?
- No!

427
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,660
Please return the money.

428
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,720
- Hamada-san!?
- Hamada-san!

429
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,360
Please return the money.

430
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,060
Even though he made such a terrible elephant.

431
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:54,330
