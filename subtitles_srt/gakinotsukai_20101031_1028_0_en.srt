00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,450
We're waiting on Hamada!!

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,000
He's late.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,110
He's probably practising golf. Like an idiot...

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,000
He's really stupid.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,540
He's not stupid...

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,400
If you can't keep time, you're not even civilised, you're retarded.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,000
But he's really busy at the moment. He's involved in a drama series.

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,650
He is a bit busy I guess

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,450
That has nothing to do with it. Gaki is Gaki. He has to respect the meeting time.

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,220
That is true...

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hey... well...

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,680
Can I show you something?

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,850
What's that? It's been a while since I've since one!

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's a video tape but...

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But there is actually something on it I want to show you...

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,770
What are you saying?!

20
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,020
It sounds scary

21
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,280
-It's not like that

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,850
It's going to be something I don't want to see

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,420
You're mistaken, I've been thinking about moving house recently

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,910
The other day, I had some spare time, so I checked out this place.

25
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,400
I thought the wife would want to see it so I took a camera...

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,140
I  went to view the house, but when I got home and checked the video...

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,480
So can we...

28
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,370
Stop, that's scary!

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,740
No, no, but really...

30
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,000
I really want you to see it

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,570
It is really something unbelievable

32
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,710
This is scary!

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,250
You know, I was REALLY surprised!

34
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:39,420
But just what is this mysterious footage on Tanaka's tape?!

35
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:50,800
FunnyJapan/ShinobiSubs  Reddit /r/FunnyJapan
Facebook/ShinobiSubs  Twitter @ShinobiSubs

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,680
Tanaka has brought a video tape with him, but what has he captured!?

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,510
I was really shocked.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,170
You were actually surprised?

39
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,540
I was EXTREMELY surprised!

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,940
That's why you have to see it

41
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,010
I'm kinda interested...

42
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,850
It's only lasts 2~3 minutes, please watch

43
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,140
What happened is incredible

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,050
Do you mind if I film this?
-(Agent) Not at all.

45
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,710
I would like to show this to my wife later
-I understand feel free

46
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,680
-Sorry for the trouble
Please come in a take a look

47
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,910
So this is the house?

48
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,940
Yes, this is it.

49
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,800
It's really plush
Woah, you're aiming high.

50
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,010
It's all white.

51
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,010
It's really beautiful inside.

52
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,910
A hundred pairs of shoes?!
Yes!

53
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,820
He mentioned there was room for 100 pairs of shoes, remarkable

54
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,010
It really wasn't bad at all.

55
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,010
Everything is white.

56
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,010
Wouldn't your children get it dirty?

57
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,010
Hmmm... I am concerned about that.

58
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,010
The toilet is just beside the entrance.

59
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,570
I think having the toilet there is kinda...

60
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,600
Really? It's practical I thought

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,480
That's what I think. It must be in the house.

62
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,010
Yes, exactly.

63
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,010
It's a European style.

64
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,540
It's amazing. Very spacious.

65
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,010
Perfect for a family of 4

66
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,140
20 jou! (About 60 metres)

67
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,710
I was really pleased at this point

68
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,010
The TV was included?

69
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,010
Yes, it comes furnished

70
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,480
Does it have parking?

71
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,000
It has

72
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,010
I was really delighted, the TV is included.

73
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,000
It probably relates to the rent

74
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:08,200
It really wasn't that expensive, plus the TV was 42 inches

75
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,850
It's a really nice place

76
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,570
There are a lot of windows, so the room gets plenty of light

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,510
From this part on please pay close attention

78
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,880
It's very spacious!

79
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,020
It has a very foreign style to it

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,880
Wait a sec...?

81
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,170
This is the part, I'll pause it

82
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,850
There was something!

83
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,370
It was at this point.

84
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
It was only you and the estate agent right?

85
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,800
There was only two of us.

86
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,220
I looked around the whole place, it was modern, and I really liked it

87
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,200
I was filming the place but...

88
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,220
I happened to capture something unbelievable

89
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,280
Please watch again
-In the kitchen?

90
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,570
Watch again

91
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,850
It's really big.

92
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,770
I was really impressed

93
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,850
It's just coming up now, please watch carefully

94
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,010
There was something !

95
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,420
Can you pause it, I want to see...

96
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,010
I'll pause it on the scene

97
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,420
Stop when you see it, got it?

98
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,010
I loved the house, it was beautiful.

99
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,000
There!

100
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,480
It's a member of Downtown...

101
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,340
Is it really?

102
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,010
It's our member...

103
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,010
It's a Downtown member?

104
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,280
It's him right? It's him for sure

105
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,250
It looks like him, but it's hard to tell

106
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,280
But if you look at that face...

107
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,850
With a head that big...

108
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,080
The balance is out of proportion right

109
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,910
Did you say hello?

110
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,510
You didn't say hello?

111
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,420
To this guy

112
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,010
No, I... Also think the same...

113
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,910
I didn't notice him at the time!

114
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,710
It was only once I went home and watched the recording that I thought WTF?!

115
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,340
I'm sure your wife was surprised.

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,010
She was shocked

117
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,600
It's usually okay to see him on TV but this...

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,010
Actually, I feel pretty uneasy

119
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,540
I was really surprised, I had no idea at the time

120
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,740
No Tanaka, it's rather... How should I put it

121
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,010
I really don't understand

122
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,510
I didn't see, and meanwhile...

123
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,010
Well you weren't looking for him right?

124
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,370
I just don't understand what happened

125
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,910
Can I just mention something?

126
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,820
Well...

127
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:55,010
Actually, I also have something I would like to show...

128
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,740
-What is it?

129
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,340
The other day, I was taking a break

130
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,140
So I went to play golf with some friends

131
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,620
A friend had just brought a camera

132
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,940
He just wanted to film in general, nothing special

133
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,000
After the golf, we went to eat

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,800
And he was always trying to film

135
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,000
That evening, he called me and asked me to come see him

136
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,450
I was wondering what had happened, and well...

137
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,000
There was something in his recording...

138
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,800
I brought it with me

139
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,310
Tanaka isn't the only one... Endo also has "something" in his video!

140
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,680
Can I?

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,480
If it's not long, go for it.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's not long then?

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,250
It's not long, it was just meant to be a normal private video

144
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,280
This place, the food is delicious

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes, those are my friends.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's a restaurant I often go to.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,940
He didn't have to film, but as it was his new camera...

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But it's good to film things. It's preserves memories.

149
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,000
When you forget and find it, this kind of movie is always funny

150
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,000
You played very well for your first time.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,450
You think so? I didn't realise it was so tiring!

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's just a regular private video.

153
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,860
It's a burger restaurant

154
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,370
It's got that amateur shot feel to it with the movement

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,680
Haven't you filmed enough today?

156
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,200
It's cool, anyway can I ask something

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Both of you are dressed alike!

158
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,800
Like a dance routine!

159
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,050
Look, about this...

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Even the same colour!

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,650
I dressed after showering and then I realized.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's quite embarrassing

163
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,000
You have to dress the same as us next time!

164
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,130
I don't have anything stylish like that!

165
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,880
It's such a normal video...

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,340
I'll have the hamburger please

167
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,880
(Waitress) Okay

168
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,940
This also please
-Sure thing

169
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, I'll have the same.

170
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,600
It's a little inconsiderate to film like that

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But well, it's difficult to ask to stop.

172
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,940
I've caught a cold.

173
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,630
Are you ok?

174
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,570
I didn't notice it earlier playing golf

175
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,220
It's probably because I was concentrating

176
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,680
It's only afterwards that I was suddenly reminded of my cold.

177
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,970
You should eat meat to help get better

178
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,850
Please pay close attention to this part

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Wait, wait, that part
Stop the video!

180
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm not sure what I... Did everybody...?

181
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Let's take another look

182
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,940
The waitress drops a fork and then... Watch again

183
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,280
She dropped the fork just there!

184
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,480
Here! Look!

185
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,770
Can we watch it again but slower?

186
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,650
I'll just re-wind a little

187
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,200
What is the meaning of this
-I'm sure I saw something for certain

188
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,050
This is... Where is it coming up soon...

189
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,760
Stop there!!

190
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,850
It's him...

191
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,820
He's looking right at the camera

192
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,510
Did you...
-Not at all

193
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,200
I didn't notice at all

194
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,610
It's quite a shock...

195
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,450
This is just as much of a shock as the Lehman shock (2008 financial crisis)

196
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,990
What is the meaning of this? What's going on

197
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,170
I don't really know myself...

198
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,890
Did you say hello?

199
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,570
No I didn't...

200
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,850
There's no mistake that is a Downtown member right?

201
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,140
It's him. It is definitely him.

202
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,700
It certainly appears to be so...

203
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,000
But even so with this...

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,340
That member doesn't appear to be in a good mood though...

205
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,680
That's true... It's a little scary

206
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,570
Really, what is he thinking....

207
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,650
It's definitely this jerk for sure though ahhhh!!!!

208
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,970
This is weird

209
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,250
Can I show you guys something?

210
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,820
You must be joking...

211
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,880
Housei-san has a tape also?

212
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,420
I was going to a shoot in Osaka...

213
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,880
I live in Tokyo...

214
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,650
I was driving with the manager recording...

215
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,570
It must have been the day before yesterday...

216
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Please take a look

217
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,880
Coming up next, even more bizarre footage?!

218
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,800
Just what is the unbelievable thing Yamasaki saw while driving?!

219
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,930
It's pretty intense

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,420
This has an awkward feel to it already

221
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,880
I wasn't expecting anyone to see it

222
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
It's a personal recording right?

223
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,570
This is on the freeway

224
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,050
It really is!

225
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,020
What were you doing?!
-It was meant to be private you know so...

226
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,420
It's private but you still do this kind of....

227
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,900
I think I just...

228
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,540
There was something just then

229
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,020
I saw something...

230
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,000
It was on the freeway but we saw something

231
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,050
Can you see it?
-You can clearly

232
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,680
Lets watch again to be sure

233
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,620
This is it, here, here.

234
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,620
-STOP!

235
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,970
This is strange

236
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,200
This is our guy right...

237
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,200
There is no mistake

238
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,110
He's outside though?
-Outside on the freeway!

239
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,110
It's impossible!

240
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,310
He's looking this way

241
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,080
Why do I have to be okay with having him as a partner

242
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Really, it's bizarre

243
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,940
Well look, the meaning of this, let's stop for a second

244
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,510
The data is piling up that he's trying to send a message...

245
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,170
But what is it?

246
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,710
His spirit...

247
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,180
His spirit seeking revenge?

248
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,510
Can it really be...

249
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,970
We know that guy is...

250
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:35,050
A super sadist, maybe he wants to watch you guys suffer?

251
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,910
It's not the curse of words, it's the curse of Hamada

252
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:43,970
TN; 言魂kotodama, is 'The spirit of words' that influence the world
The wordplay 浜魂Hamadama being the spirit influence is the gag

253
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,000
It must be the power of Hamada's spirit at work here

254
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,450
The curse of Hamada...
-He shouldn't be cursing or resentful toward us!

255
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,000
Can I say something if it is the curse of Hamada...

256
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,740
What...
What now...

257
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,740
I have something that my prove it...

258
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,020
What is this mysterious footage Fujiwara has that proves the curse of Hamada?!

259
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,850
Recently I was out practising some vocals

260
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,710
I was with the director at a karaoke box

261
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,400
It was being taped to send for auditions and such

262
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,740
Then later, the director suddenly called me

263
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,850
'Something great happened' he said to me

264
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,130
Can I show you?

265
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,800
Is it okay to...

266
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,140
I don't really have any idea of how it will look so...

267
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,600
It's coming up, please listen carefully

268
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,650
I have heard this laugh before...

269
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,220
There is definite laughing

270
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,220
I could hear the laughing

271
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,530
I heard it but...
-Wait, hold on...

272
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,000
There is no other person laughing there

273
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,250
Did you notice it when you were there?

274
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,200
I didn't hear it at all

275
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,170
If I had, you would see my reaction

276
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,710
Can we watch it again?

277
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,510
The laugh is so out of place

278
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,850
There is no mistake

279
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,620
That's enough, that's enough...

280
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,770
You could quite clearly hear the laugh was going on

281
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,220
I have experienced the same thing coming from the next dressing room

282
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,460
I don't even know what he's laughing at

283
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,140
But... What if

284
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,800
That was... How to put it...

285
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,880
I'm sure it was

286
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,310
Crosstalk it's called

287
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,800
Like interference with the karaoke equipment?

288
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,280
Exactly! The more convenient to use equipment has come the more complex it also is

289
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,620
I can understand that...

290
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,680
I'm not going to stick up for my partner but...

291
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,420
I just don't think he is like that

292
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,820
I know what you mean...

293
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,090
Sorry, can I say something?

294
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,480
It isn't great but....

295
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,140
What kind of scene is it?

296
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:44,000
Just what has been happening to Inomoto?!

297
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,050
Recently I've been snoring...

298
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,170
It's pretty bad and loud

299
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,780
So I set up a camera to record me sleeping

300
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,310
Please keep that in consideration

301
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,650
It isn't a very good picture captured but...

302
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,020
This is a pretty spooky scene

303
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,140
Is the snoring really that bad?

304
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,000
I've been told it is but wanted to see for myself, that's why...

305
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,170
The tape is quite long, you can fast forward it if you want

306
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
This is just normal sleeping

307
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,970
I don't think anyone starts snoring that quickly

308
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,020
The snoring should be coming up

309
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,140
But I still haven't hear the snoring it's pretty quiet

310
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,030
Ah I see... Like that...

311
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,050
This part here, here!!

312
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,290
You saw it right?

313
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,140
I was a lot!

314
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,260
I saw a lot! Why...

315
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,400
There was a ghost!

316
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,970
That happens now and again

317
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,370
That's a good thing?
-That's fine, it's after that

318
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,770
Right after that you need to check

319
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,600
It's really scary

320
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,970
Let's watch it once again

321
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,420
It's definitely a ghost!
-That's fine

322
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,480
There!!

323
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,850
The other member!

324
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,340
It definitely was that right?

325
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,850
Lets watch closely

326
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,570
That's how it begins but...

327
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,570
Here! This is a ghost for sure

328
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,910
That ghost is fine, it comes round every night

329
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,280
Look!

330
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,820
The curse of Hamada

331
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,800
The member with the shining nostrils...

332
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,420
He must be in heat, that's why he is shining

333
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,880
It must be breeding season then?

334
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,340
When this happened you didn't hear any voices?

335
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,140
I didn't notice a thing

336
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,000
Does he want to become a ghost?

337
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,570
Why would he? I don't understand

338
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,420
Hamada-san?

339
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,710
Hello?

340
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,310
Hamada?

341
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,600
It's me

342
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,020
Matsumoto

343
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,220
What do you mean you didn't have the number saved? It's me Matsumoto

344
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,220
He didn't have the number saved....

345
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,680
It's Matsumoto, I told you to save my number the other day

346
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,680
Up next, the truth revealed?!

347
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,710
To find out the truth about what's going on, Matsumoto calls Hamada...

348
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,250
No really, yeah... Yeah

349
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,940
It's fine

350
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,410
Seriously?! Oh I see

351
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,910
Oh yeah?

352
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,770
No way!!

353
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,570
-What are they talking about?

354
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,820
Serious?

355
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,600
The 60 minute course?

356
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,140
No fucking way, you really did?!

357
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,090
That's how it was then

358
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,940
I see!! I see!!

359
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,280
That's nice but...

360
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,020
Recently...
