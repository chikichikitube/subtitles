1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,020
6th time on Gaki no Tsukai CHIKI CHIKI

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:08,220
"Let's ask for the best 3 in a new town"

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,330
Very loud isn't he?

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,870
The 6th installment after 2 years

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,670
Just a bit too loud

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,180
So this is the 6th one,

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,330
And we've going to mostly Chiba!

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,090
That's true

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Chiba

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Chiba

11
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Chiba

12
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Chiba

13
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Kanagawa

14
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,200
A lot of Chiba

15
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,580
And we hate Chiba, don't we?

16
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,580
No, that's not true

17
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,310
I love Chiba!

18
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,490
You're going too far there

19
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,580
You love a lot of things too much

20
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,180
I was just kidding!

21
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,690
Their destination depends on this lottery

22
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,510
1 out of the approximately 2500 stations in Kanto's 6 prefectures,

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,830
What town was chosen this time?

24
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,560
So where is it?

25
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,090
Takezawa

26
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,360
Takezawa...

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,730
This is seriously the first time I've heard of that place

28
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,400
Where is Takezawa?

29
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,960
Saitama

30
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,240
Ah, Saitama

31
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,560
Down here? Oh no, up there

32
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,330
There it is!

33
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,000
Takezawa?

34
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,040
And it's the perfect distance from here!

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,890
What the hell are you talking about?

36
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,560
subbed by senor_wristband

37
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,560
If you'd like to support my subs,
I've setup these accounts :)

38
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,130
Their destination is 1.5 hours by car from Tokyo,

39
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,870
In Ogawa, Hiki District, Saitama Prefecture

40
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,730
Takezawa Station

41
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,710
30 trains a day run at this unmanned station, with an average of 31 passengers,

42
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,600
They want to time the start of the shooting with the arrival of the train

43
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,490
Oh there, it's coming it's coming

44
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,360
Here we are, at Takezawa station

45
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,600
That was timed perfectly

46
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,560
Yeah, if we missed this we'd have to wait another hour

47
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,820
However,

48
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,070
Nobody got off the train

49
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,360
What?

50
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,810
Hold on, we can't ask people then

51
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,040
The next train is in 1 hour

52
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,680
1 hour?!

53
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,820
Hold on, we can't do anything here,

54
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,700
We'll just have to wait

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,500
But then in front of them,

56
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,490
They found some locals

57
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,850
Hello!

58
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,820
Hello, excuse us

59
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,260
Please, hear us out

60
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,350
Hold on, why are they running away?

61
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,800
I get it though,

62
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,400
It's cause of Hamada, cause he called to them

63
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,700
You need Tanaka for this sort of thing

64
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,550
They just don't like me?

65
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,510
They think you're gonna smack them like "BAN!"

66
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,620
They managed to talk to them

67
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,750
How long have you ladies lived here?

68
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,550
Yes, it's been 50 years now

69
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,350
50 years?

70
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,090
Is this a nice place?

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,450
Yes, it's very nice!

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,700
None of us feel the same way at all

73
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,000
That's not true

74
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,600
We've only just gotten here, yes

75
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,100
What suggestion does the mother who has been living in Takezawa for 50 years have for number 3?

76
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,480
We were thinking of going to the nice spots in this town,

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,550
You might have a top 3 in mind,

78
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,450
Could you give us what #3 is?

79
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,600
And we've got exactly 3 of you here

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,850
Who could have known

81
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,520
Somethin like "Oh you should check that place out"

82
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,950
It's towards Arashiyama,

83
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,500
They specialise in making Japanese Paper in that area,

84
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,000
Ah, and are you involved with that?

85
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,380
No, not really

86
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,070
Sorry, it's just we have to stay near the station

87
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,410
Driving to Arashiyama from here would take 20 minutes

88
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,220
Is there anything nearby the station?

89
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,420
I think the Yoshida Family House

90
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,020
I think it has to be the Yoshida Family House then

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,860
Yoshida Family?

92
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,130
Yoshida Family House

93
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,670
It's an estate built 300 years ago, and it's been preserved,

94
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,680
They've preserved it?

95
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,470
It's been maintained to be the same way

96
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,870
You're so knowledgeable...

97
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,180
Did you plan this?

98
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,910
I was just passing through

99
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,930
She was so articulate

100
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:27,780
They jot down Yoshida Family House, but they want to find something a little closer to the station

101
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,060
There's nobody walking outside

102
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,690
Yeah this is amazing,

103
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,580
If we keep messing about, it'll turn dark by 4 you know!

104
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,090
That's true

105
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,360
That's true, we need to finish before 4

106
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,360
I have to go the dentist today...

107
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,410
Today it's the dentist huh?

108
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,930
There's a sake store up ahead,

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,200
Oh, there is

110
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,250
Well then,

111
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,310
Let's go inside

112
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,310
Excuse me, hello

113
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,160
Ah, excuse me,

114
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,490
We're looking for recommended places here in Takezawa,

115
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,490
You should go to the Yoshida House

116
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,270
The Yoshida Family House

117
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,400
Woah, the same as before

118
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,180
For example, a nice restaurant

119
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,310
There's lad here who sells ramen,

120
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,870
It's 3 types in 1

121
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,870
Oh it's a special?

122
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,380
Is it close by?

123
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,380
Yup, right next to Yoshida House

124
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,400
Sir, could I get your name?

125
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,330
Yoshida Nobuaki

126
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,980
Yoshida-san?

127
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,760
What a coincidence

128
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,780
Thank you very much

129
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,780
They get a side-suggestion after talking to him,

130
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,090
His name was Yoshida-san

131
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,800
How old was he?

132
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,270
Ah, I didn't ask hi-

133
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,380
Ask that!

134
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,580
I just asked his name, Yoshida-san...

135
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,310
Oh, there's something!

136
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,970
What is that, a convenience store?

137
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,560
It is a convenience store

138
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,330
Hello

139
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,570
Hello, excuse us,

140
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,690
Is there a specialty in this town?

141
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:03,070
Something in this town that stands out, something you would suggest?

142
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,130
Near here?

143
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,770
What does Yoshida-san suggest, in this convenience store near the station?

144
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,000
There's the Yoshida Family House,

145
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,640
Everyone is saying that huh?

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,460
A lot of people have suggested that,

147
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,270
Ogawa Genki Plaza,

148
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,240
Genki Plaza?

149
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,800
In the mountains nearby, there's school facilities and a planetarium,

150
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,170
Anyone can go in though

151
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,170
Is the planetarium open right now?

152
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,110
A planetarium would be nice,

153
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,730
That family house keeps coming,

154
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,080
I think we better go there,

155
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:46,360
Since everyone said Yoshida Family House, they were gonna go there,

156
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,600
But then that Family House should be #1 then right?

157
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,230
Since everyone is saying it,

158
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,670
But we can't move on until we're done with #3,

159
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,530
Do you have a #3?

160
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,490
Can you go and find out if we can go to the planetarium today?

161
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,420
No no, we'll do it

162
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:04,310
He's running the store right now

163
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:11,750
However, we couldn't film inside the Planetarium today,

164
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,590
At Segenyama, there's a roller slide

165
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,180
A roller slide?

166
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,870
Sounds interesting!

167
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,870
Like a park?

168
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,220
You can slide down the mountain

169
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,500
Oh, that sounds nice!

170
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,890
Sir, who are you gonna go down the slide after?

171
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,890
Why the hell?

172
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,730
He's running the store!

173
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,110
Thank you very much

174
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,690
Thank you very much, sorry for the sudden intrusion

175
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,440
We've prepared the car

176
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,930
Now you can go find out that old man's first name

177
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,490
His first name and his age

178
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,440
Yoshida, Yoshitake-san I th-

179
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,240
Just, hurry!

180
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,690
They're always making me run!

181
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,070
If I was Endo, I'd bring the old man with me

182
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,560
I'd give him a piggy back ride

183
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,130
That far?

184
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,530
I want him to go that far

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,810
I've come here to ask his first name and his age,

186
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,010
Yoshida Nobuaki

187
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,180
Nobuaki-san? Could I get your age too please

188
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,270
91 years old

189
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,070
Wow, 91 years old. You look very healthy!

190
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,400
Thank you

191
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,800
Yoshida ... Yoshida Nobuaki-san

192
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,290
Now we're waiting on Endo

193
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,890
He said Yoshitake-san

194
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,490
He said something like that

195
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,510
Really?

196
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,470
Ah he's back!

197
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,300
I asked him

198
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,730
I asked him,

199
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,160
What was his name?

200
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,000
Yoshida ... Nobuaki-san

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,730
You were way off

202
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,510
His age?

203
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,360
91 years old

204
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,840
His wife, was she there?

205
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,840
... She was ...

206
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,670
Really?

207
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,760
His wife was next to him

208
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,780
What was her name?

209
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,090
I didn't ask her

210
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,910
Isn't Yoshida-san enough?

211
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,330
Isn't that good enough?

212
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,910
After getting in the car,

213
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,640
The 5 head to Segenyama Hill View Park

214
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,670
We said it was his wife, but it might have been his sister,

215
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,580
Ahh ... I think it was his wife though

216
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,620
Endo doesn't really care about people

217
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,630
No that's not ture

218
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,400
You only care about yourself

219
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,070
That's not true, that's not true,

220
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,960
I don't even care about myself that much

221
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,550
Then just die already

222
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,330
I'm glad the weather turned out fine

223
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,640
Ah we're here

224
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,430
This is it

225
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,500
The car arrives at Sengenyama Hill View Park

226
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,220
You can see great views of Ogawa at this park,

227
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:59,730
And what about the 203 metre roller slide here?

228
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,160
We're here

229
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,990
Wow, the weather is nice

230
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,580
"Roller Slide"

231
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,310
I wanna see DownTown go down together

232
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,600
They do seem love slides

233
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,430
We love slides?

234
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,090
This is amazing!

235
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,400
203 metres...

236
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,530
Yeah it even says it there, 200 yen

237
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,540
So it's 1 yen per metre

238
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,760
They start off with Hosei

239
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,760
This is pretty scary!

240
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,910
If you'd like, you can together, for example the 2 of you

241
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,130
Here I go!

242
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,400
It's pretty fast

243
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,270
Alright Tanaka you go

244
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,640
Here I go!

245
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,220
Next is Tanaka, and then Matsumoto

246
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,270
And then Hosei reaches the end!

247
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,360
How am I supposed to get off?

248
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,510
How are you supposed to get off that?

249
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,960
And Tanaka as well...

250
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,110
That hurt

251
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,980
Oh there's Matsumoto-san!

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,560
His hemorrhoids are in danger

253
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,160
Of course that would happen!

254
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,040
Exactly, exactly!

255
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,070
This thing

256
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,800
They never told us about this!

257
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,780
They didn't tell us anything!

258
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,560
Next is Hamada and Endo's turn

259
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,470
Will Hamada-san's hemmoroids be alright?

260
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,000
That's gonna hurt

261
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,510
The end is scary! This is scary!

262
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,930
Oh no!

263
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,530
No way

264
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,380
This is how it ends?

265
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,040
Exactly!

266
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,040
They didn't tell us this right?

267
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,440
Yeah!

268
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,290
Honestly, this "welcome mat" thing is no good!

269
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,110
Exactly

270
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,000
It should be a bit softer

271
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,270
Exactly, we should tell them!

272
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,640
Right around there you go "Hmm?"

273
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,730
"This is impossible isn't it?"

274
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,020
It's just straight up impossible

275
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:20,710
With that, the number 3 suggestion around Takezawa is Sengenyama Hill View Park

276
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,250
They set off to ask for #2

277
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,530
Ma'am, are you a local?

278
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,530
We're from Funabashi

279
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,600
You're wearing a Tiara and eating Onigiri!

280
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,470
So you don't know too much about this town?

281
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,840
Yes

282
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,620
I guess we can't really ask a non-local. Thank you!

283
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,640
It's my first time here

284
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,890
Oh, your first time? Thank you!

285
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,940
That old man from before

286
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,330
Thank you!

287
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,070
When did you get here?

288
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,130
Did you slide down here just now?

289
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,650
They ask the gentleman from before for his #2

290
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,620
Like a restaurant or such

291
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,270
This used to be a castle town,

292
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,970
There's a very old establishment there called Futaba

293
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,530
What sort of establishment?

294
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,730
Ochazuke

295
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,980
TN: Ochazuke is a rice dish served in tea, broth, or hot water

296
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,980
That sounds nice, an Ochazuke store

297
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,090
Sorry, could I get your name?

298
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,380
Me? My name is Ogino

299
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,960
And your first name?

300
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,380
It's Katsuji

301
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,180
And your age?

302
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,330
I'm 78 years old!

303
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,110
Thank you, sorry for the bother!

304
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,950
Thank you, goodbye!

305
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,980
It's a 5 minute drive from the park to Futaba

306
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,620
They set off right away

307
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,980
The wind was really strong

308
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,600
Wow ... ignored like that ...

309
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,400
I said "yes"

310
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,220
I'm not sure about the people in the back though

311
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,290
I didn't hear your "yes"

312
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,170
I said "yes"

313
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,690
If this was our first time meeting you would be done for

314
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,420
When was the last time you had Ochazuke?

315
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,420
I have it a couple times a year

316
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,200
Oh really? When do you eat it?

317
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,980
Ignored

318
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,000
Wow ... ignored like that ...

319
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,580
Isn't that it?

320
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,930
"Futaba-san", we're here

321
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,040
They arrive at the Futaba Inn

322
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,180
So nice!

323
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,310
It's great

324
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,360
It's amazing!

325
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,090
It's brilliant

326
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,820
Wow! I like this Japanese style

327
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,710
Where should we sit?

328
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,820
Is it OK here?

329
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,090
Thank you very much

330
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:02,710
Futaba Kappou Inn

331
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,930
A 270 year old establishment preserving the history of Saitama

332
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,640
What do you suggest?

333
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:14,890
We suggest the Chushichi-meshi Nori Ochazuke, one of Japan's "5 Great Rice dishes"

334
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,130
The Japanese Imperial Household decided on this dish in Showa 4 (1929)

335
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,040
We'll get that

336
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,840
Understood

337
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,890
Thank you

338
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,600
Why does he get to decide?

339
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,870
You guys should try the specialty

340
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,890
That's true

341
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,690
They wait 10 minutes for the food to cook,

342
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,590
This is a dish that uses local ingredients and produce,

343
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,600
It looks so good

344
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,810
And this is the specialty Chushichi-meshi

345
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,270
With seaweed sprinkled over rice,

346
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,520
And served with yuzu, spring onion, and wasabi

347
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,420
Enjoy it like an ochazuke, with hot water poured on top

348
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,980
It's delicious

349
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,400
The seaweed is the great

350
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,890
That's true

351
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,890
Delicious

352
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,040
We can only eat this here right?

353
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,020
Are you done with that?

354
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,310
We can't get this in Tokyo right?

355
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,490
Yes thank you

356
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,510
We can only get this here?

357
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,510
Thank you

358
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,510
We can only get this here?

359
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,330
Yes

360
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,400
We can't get Chushichi-meshi in the city can we?

361
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,620
Yes. Thank you very much

362
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,200
Just here then

363
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,800
Futaba-san, thank you for the meal!

364
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,080
Only #1 is left in the Takezawa recommendation ranking

365
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:23,290
Since so many people suggested it, they consider Yoshida Family House

366
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,510
They asked the Futaba-san host

367
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,160
A lot of people have told us about this Family House

368
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,960
The Yoshida Family House, that's right, that's an interesting place

369
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,960
It's interesting?

370
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,580
It's famous?

371
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,580
Yes, it is

372
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,450
Do you remember of that guy from before?

373
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,600
The very first guy

374
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,510
The very first person

375
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,040
The very first person was Yoshida ... Nobuaki-san

376
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,840
The guy from the slide?

377
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,890
The guy from the slide? Honestly I ...

378
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,560
O-Ogiku?

379
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,640
Ogicha?

380
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,470
That's definitely not it

381
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,580
Hagi... Hagi no ...

382
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,730
His name was like "Hagi no Tsuki" or something

383
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,730
TN: Hagi no Tsuki is a sponge cake dessert

384
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,960
If it was "Hagi no Tsuki" I'd definitely remember

385
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,490
It's a 10 minute drive to Yoshida Family House

386
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,270
Oh we came back here

387
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,840
That's where Endo's BFF lives

388
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,240
Yoshida-san thank you very much

389
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,870
That looks like it

390
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,820
It says it right there

391
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,220
It was written there

392
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,560
Hmm? Is that it?

393
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:50,240
Takezawa station's #1, the Yoshida Family House

394
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,330
Oh, here?

395
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,090
It's amazing

396
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,270
Hamada-san, there's a donation box

397
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,960
There sure is

398
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,580
Hello

399
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,270
Sorry for the intrusion

400
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,690
Ah, it's the smell of that

401
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,690
There's a lot of food here, like Dango

402
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,750
Takezawa Station's #1 - The Yoshida Family House

403
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,470
Turning 300 years old this year,

404
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,580
Preserving the country's national heritage,

405
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,020
The oldest house in Saitama Prefecture

406
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,490
They light the fire with a prayer, and dig in

407
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,960
How many hundreds of years old is this place?

408
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,840
Exactly 300 this year

409
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,740
Exactly

410
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,930
Exactly

411
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,780
This used to be a house?

412
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,800
They lived here normally until the start of Hesei (1989)

413
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,670
Until the Hesei-era?

414
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,580
Yes, they lived here normally up until then

415
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,290
We can date this house back 300 years,

416
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:20,220
And the way we do that is using the Munefuda (building tag)

417
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,040
And that tag was placed right there

418
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,200
Do you get it?

419
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,330
Tanaka go look at it, hurry

420
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,840
This thing?

421
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,760
It was placed in that manner

422
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,400
And since the writing is on the reverse, nobody knew how old it was

423
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,840
So when they decided to demolish this place and build a new house,

424
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:47,730
But then they thought "Wait, I think they did say it was 300 years old or something"

425
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,890
And then after doing some research they found out

426
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,830
That's genuinely what happened

427
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,830
Wow, it was almost demolished

428
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,130
So if that pillar wasn't there in Kyoho 6 (1721), they couldn't have placed the tag there

429
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,710
I see

430
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,730
So it's a good thing that pillar was there

431
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,490
If you look up there, everything has been kept exactly the same

432
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,150
It's rare for things like that to be left so intact

433
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,150
And with that, this place recieved a National Desgination

434
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,180
That looks like it's just right

435
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,930
Thank you very much

436
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,780
There used to be 4 dango, but now there's 3

437
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,840
Why do you think that might be?

438
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,840
Oh, why?

439
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,160
Because "Dango 3-Kyodai" was popular at the time! (3 Dango Brothers)

440
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,160
TN: "Dango 3-Kyodai" is a popular song from 1999

441
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,490
There were 4 dango up until then

442
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,440
You didn't know that?

443
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,900
No, I know Dango 3-kyodai

444
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,870
I think when talking about the 300 year old history, it's best not to bring something like that up

445
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,770
Is that ready?

446
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,200
Thank you for the meal!

447
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,250
Ah, but, it's delicious

448
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,870
It's nice and chewy

449
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,870
How was this episode? It seemed to go smoother than usual

450
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,930
It's not like nothing happened

451
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,100
A lot happened

452
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,110
Yes, we experienced a lot

453
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,400
Endo, you still have that job left,

454
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,270
That old lady's name

455
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,810
You know every time I have some errand to do

456
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,870
Like every time-

457
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,880
Yeah last time we were at that cafe place,

458
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,400
Yes and you all left

459
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,130
When I got back I saw your car pass by

460
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,020
"Hmm?" "It's over?"

461
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:30,930
You never know, next time we might even visit your town!

462
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,130
Was it always this kind of show?

463
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,870
Was the ending always like this?
