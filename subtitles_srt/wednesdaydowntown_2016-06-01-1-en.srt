00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,740
Hello everyone, this is Wednesday Downtown! We'll be in your care!

5
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,340
We'll be in your care.

6
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,120
Let's get this started, here are your first presenters. Please come out!

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,160
It's Drunk Dragon!

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,640
We'll be in your care.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,540
There's two of you.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,540
Yes, there is.

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,440
It's a bit rare.

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,440
But that's not necessary.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,500
Not necessary? Well I don't know if you're talking about me though...

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,680
It's definitely you!

15
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,940
This time I've brought a theory that I really wanted to do.

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,940
Oh, really?

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,400
Here is the theory that we'll be presenting today:

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,520
Theory: Those that have a unique gravestone have an anecdote behind it.

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,840
What's this?

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,740
I used to be an altar maker before I started doing comedy for a living.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,420
There was a thing called "Present Day Altars"

22
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,510
with altars that were fashionable and modern.

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,120
We were progressing towards those. If I were to explain it simply, there was a glass barrier

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,580
which would light up the Buddha statue inside when opened.

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,020
And it was called "Jupiter".

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,640
Never heard of it.

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,440
In the same vein, recently gravestones have been becoming more unique.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,040
The one that I found recently was a plate shaped stone about this big

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,100
with a toy poodle figure drawn into it.

30
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,300
Etched in?

31
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:35,040
Yes, and it was painted as well. There was a speech bubble that said "Thanks furry much".

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,120
I don't know what they were trying to accomplish but

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,600
they really liked poodles.

34
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,600
That's why you thought there something behind it.

35
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,220
But if you only say that, it's just the grave of a toy poodle.

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,580
After this, a variety of unique gravestones will appear, also...

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,840
The theory that your parent's strange faces will definitely make you laugh.

38
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,260
The theory that there are no 70+ year olds that are more than 100 kg.

39
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,760
The theory that you can find all ages from 0 to 100 in song lyrics.

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,580
We'll be collaborating with countdown TV!

41
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,080
We'll be investigating the theory that there's an anecdote to every unique gravestone.

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:42,500
This time, we'll be getting help from this company that is having a grave design contest.

43
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,240
We'll be finding unique gravestones from around Japan.

44
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,100
The first one...

45
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,400
A coffee bean.

46
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,580
Also the name written on the grave is...

47
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,860
"Coffee Person Takemoto".

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,180
It's a pretty unique grave but

49
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,200
when we ask why it's a coffee bean.

50
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,600
My father was managing a coffee shop.

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,310
He was really into coffee.

52
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,310
There's a mark of a coffee bean in the name of the shop.

53
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,550
The shape of that bean was quite good.

54
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:32,520
They made a gravestone out of the coffee bean mark in his father Kouhei's shop's name.

55
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,080
There’s a story about how much the father was into coﬀee

56
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,770
My father was in Japan during the war,

57
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,740
but he really wanted to go to the battlefield.

58
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,510
And if you asked him why,

59
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,580
"If I can go to southern countries, I could probably drink some really tasty coffee".

60
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,980
That's how long ago he was in love with coffee.

61
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,980
The man that's resting with a gravestone of a coffee bean

62
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,300
was the man in love with coffee to the point of risking his life, a "Coffee Man".

63
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,020
Next we have this piece.

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,880
A milk cow.

65
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,420
But it's not a cow that's resting inside.

66
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,810
There's a fence and the flower pot is a milk carrying can.

67
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,040
We wanted to give it the feel of a farm.

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,740
To honor the father's job as a dairy farmer, a milk cow grave.

69
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,560
He helped to cultivate Roppougaoka and we continue that to this day.

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,530
He was working so hard for many years, doing weeding.

71
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,830
He said that "Everyone can now eat until they're full".

72
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,650
The man resting in a milk cow grave was

73
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,620
bringing dairy farming to an afore uncultivated land.

74
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,700
He gave his entire life to that cultivation.

75
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,180
Next we have this.

76
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,690
My husband was a cameraman, so I decided to use a camera as a motif.

77
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,260
The man who loved cameras was

78
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,880
the cameraman Shinoda Noboru.

79
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,820
Winning an award for camerawork for the film Crying out love in the center of the world

80
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,280
from the Japanese Film Academy.

81
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,000
Leaving his mark in the film industry, but lost his life at the young age of 52.

82
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,780
He would think about camera work even in his daily life.

83
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,420
"How much could I use my wrist until the camera wouldn't shake?"

84
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,990
"I will investigate this holding a mug."

85
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,160
He was doing training with a coffee filled mug to not tremble.

86
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Next, we have this.

87
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,280
What is the inspiration behind this stone?

88
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,510
It's a "pin-perm".

89
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,380
This ring is an image of the curled up hair.

90
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,360
A pin-perm is a perm technique using pins to wrap and fix the hair, not using any rods.

91
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,280
The person that invented the technique is the mother Hatsue.

92
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,530
When did she pass away?

93
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,370
No, my mother is still alive.

94
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,060
This grave was built 23 years ago by the mother but

95
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,480
since she's still alive and well, nobody is in it.

96
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,640
Also...

97
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,540
A calligrapher's grave: brushes and an ink stone.

98
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,320
A rail worker: locomotive.

99
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,200
A horseshoe maker: a horseshoe, and

100
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,920
various animals.

101
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,520
A tailor: sebiro (Japanese style business suit)

102
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,420
There were a lot of graves related to the person's job, all with stories behind them.

103
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,400
However, these sister's father Osamu's grave is...

104
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,440
an apple.

105
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,120
It's the shape of an apple type called "Star King Delicious".

106
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,190
It's really red right?

107
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,490
It's gleaming with light.

108
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,200
Our dad really enjoyed that apple.

109
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,020
Somehow, he wasn't in the apple business.

110
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,470
He really like that apple.

111
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,360
Differing from the pattern until now, it was just that he enjoyed the apple.

112
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,020
Who was it that came up with the idea of an apple?

113
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,790
We both were like "Should it just be an apple?"

114
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,740
It wasn't even his own idea.

115
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,730
He used to say "An apple a day keeps the doctor away" and

116
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,060
he always ate them.

117
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,240
He died of cancer ironically.

118
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,820
The pattern of making gravestones out of favorite things.

119
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,800
Next we have the husband's grave.

120
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,740
Shogi (Japanese chess)

121
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,920
My husband really liked shogi when he was alive, going around to friends' houses.

122
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,020
He went about a lot of houses.

123
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,320
He could play it until the end so,

124
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,790
I thought of making it related to shogi.

125
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,080
It seems there is another unique gravestone in this cemetery.

126
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,170
There's a heaven and earth kind of difference between us and Guts-san.

127
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,910
Guts-san has a grave here?

128
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,040
Yes, right below here, there's a splendid one.

129
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,680
(Writing says: "Guts Family grave is this way")

130
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,680
We decided to take a look.

131
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,990
Discovery: The Guts Family Grave.

132
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,620
The name isn't Suzuki, or even Ishimatsu.

133
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,660
The Guts Family!

134
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,900
The person is still alive but...

135
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,560
A belt and gloves made out of stone.

136
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,460
And his amazing fight record.

137
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,000
His "I don't know" catchphrase "OK Corral" is carved on the grave.

138
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,660
There were other graves related to the person's hobbies or the things they liked.

139
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,280
Piano

140
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,920
Violin

141
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,900
Guitar

142
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,000
Fishing

143
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,860
Wind-surfing

144
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,220
Golf

145
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,680
Rugby

146
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,180
Scuba diving and other sports. Furthermore,

147
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,280
Cars

148
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,640
Sake

149
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,000
The genres are varied but

150
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,640
Oh, you can even find those?

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,080
the trickiest was this one.

152
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,060
What? What?

153
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,580
Cigarettes

154
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,020
Moreover, a specific brand

155
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,980
called Mild Seven.

156
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,660
That's amazing.

157
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,340
And if you look closely,

158
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,980
Oh wow.

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,580
It's not and S but

160
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,060
an H.

161
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,420
It's a Mild Heaven.

162
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,380
It's not really the place to do a pun.

163
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:36,940
Until now, there were a lot of gravestones related to jobs or hobbies

164
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,940
It's unbelievable.

165
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,580
but this person's husband

166
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,380
is resting in a grave that doesn't suit any of those categories.

167
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,840
The grave that's related to neither the job or hobby.

168
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,280
A living room.

169
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,400
That's awesome.

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
What the-?

171
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,680
That's the ultimate one.

172
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,720
Somehow, the living room of their house

173
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,520
was completely recreated out of stone

174
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,280
The sofa is completely solid but

175
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,980
Stiff as hell right?

176
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,980

635

636
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,960

Are you confident you'll make your son laugh?

669
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,700
No, less that I'll make him laugh, more the shock of it right?

670
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,350
There is that possibility.

671
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,280
That could happen.

672
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:18,440
To begin, Wakkii, who not even in his dreams would expect his mother as his opponent, enters the stage.

673
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:24,510
Will Wakkii laugh at his mother's strange faces as expected?

695
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,040
Come on Mom!

696
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,860
Their repertory is small.

697
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,650
The tongue comes right out.

698
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,960
This is... what are we watching.

699
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,960
What is she doing?

700
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
He's losing it.

701
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,960
Wakkii can't do it at all.

702
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,590
It's a bit...

703
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,310
That's dangerous.

704
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,460
Wakkii is difficult to...

705
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,460
Mom's wide open.

706
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,970
They're doing the same thing.

707
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
Wait...

708
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,950
He can't hold it in.

709
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,450
Mom...

710
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,950
It's impossible not to laugh, huh.

711
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,860
Mom...

712
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,690
"Wait mom."

713
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,190
Time's up!

714
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,080
No! Really?

715
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,480
Hold on!

716
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,840
What the hell are you making me do?

717
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,940
It went better than I expected.

718
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,940
No, it's a different matter.

719
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,600
The theory that you'd definitely laugh at your parent's funny face.

720
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,730
We were investigating it.

721
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,330
I mean...

722
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,310
No way you won't laugh.

723
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,870
What is this feeling?

724
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,830
Me too.

725
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,200
Stop it! Don't say stuff like that!

726
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,030
Stop it!

727
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,840
Next is...

728
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,080
Good morning.

729
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,080
Good morning.

730
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,750
We're with Wednesday Downtown, we'll be in your care.

731
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,870
Ooji-san!

732
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,750
I'll be in your care.

733
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,840
Another person who apparently has confidence in peek-a-boo.

734
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,450
Dainoji's Ooji Yousuke

735
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,110
Opposing him is...

736
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,000
Ooji's mother Kiyo-san.

737
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,720
So will Ooji

738
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,900
end up laughing at his mother's face?

739
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,690
They look alike.

740
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,920
Let's get started.

741
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,910
Let's make funny faces, if you laugh you're out, ha-ppu-ppu!

742
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:04,250
The mother is not really good is she...

743
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:17,250
Aah... This is just amazing.

744
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,240
You'd end up like that though.

745
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,090
You have to laugh at that...

746
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,920
Continue the game please.

747
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,580
Go on!

748
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,550
Kiyo-san is funny though.

749
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,890
Hold up a sec...

750
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,520
Wait for a moment please.

751
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,260
Everyone had a similar reaction like 'What the hell are you doing here?'

752
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:48,130
With that, we explain the situation.

753
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,680
You'd laugh for sure!

754
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,440
You'd laugh, also...

755
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,270
before you laugh there's a surprise that comes.

756
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,910
This feeling is almost making me sick.

757
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,780
And now, the last mother is...

758
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,840
I'll be in your care.

759
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,340
Whose mother are you?

760
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,770
Yes, I'm Kojima Yoshio's mother.

761
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,870
They came all the way from Kumejima (Okinawa).

762
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,640
I'll be in your care

763
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,200
Now, will Kojima

764
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,360
end up laughing at his mother's weird face?

765
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,660
With that, let's begin.

766
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:28,500
Let's make funny faces, if you laugh you're out, ha-ppu-ppu!

767
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,770
Saliva is coming out.

768
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,870
He's keeping it up!

769
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,750
No reaction whatsoever.

770
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,490
Right? He didn't get surprised.

771
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,220
It's a real battle!

772
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,990
No reaction from either one?

773
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,940
Even before considering her being the mother,

774
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,050
she's just good at the game.

775
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,880
He's frickin' amazing.

776
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,920
Aah he's torturing himself.

777
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,130
They're serious!

778
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:31,620
They're like 'I have to keep it up!'

779
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,880
The mother isn't giving up!

780
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,670
The mother is something!

781
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,490
Time's up!

782
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,980
That's just foul play!

783
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,780
She's still doing it.

784
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,730
Theory that you'd definitely laugh at a parent's funny face.

785
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,310
Haaah-

786
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,570
What an amazing theory.

787
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,400
How was it? Your mother's funny faces?

788
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,110
No, really...

789
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:12,160
It was incredibly funny.

790
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,410
With that, you'd for sure laugh at your parent's silly faces.

791
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,280
Well well well well well...

792
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,450
It's perfect.

793
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,450
This was...

794
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,720
But for Kojima there was no surprise at all.

795
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,520
He's actually surprised but trying to control it.

796
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,410
A lot of saliva came out like BHAAN.

797
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:32,270
His body is actually reacting, but

798
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,080
he's pushing it down really hard.

799
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,060
Wow, it's incredible that you can comment from that angle.

800
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,100
As expected (from a psychiatrist).

801
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,100
A psychiatrist.

802
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,480
Amazing.

803
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,450
Next we have this presenter, please enter!

804
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,220
Hello!

805
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:58,070
Peace's Ayabe!

806
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,070
I'll be in your care.

807
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,350
It's the free...

808
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,410
The free one (from the combi).

809
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,410
I'm not the free one, no.

810
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,830
I do lots of work.

811
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,500
From your knowledge, he's the freer one of the two?

812
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,090
He's like the free one, or maybe

813
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:09,400
the cheap one.

814
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,690
The sensei (his partner) is busy yes, but I'm also doing my best.

815
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,780
First off, please the two from Sandwichman,

816
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,010
how much do you weigh approximately?

817
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,450
Weight?

818
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,450
Yes, you two.

819
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,530
I'm 90 kg.

820
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,530
90 kg?

821
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,010
I'm also about the same.

822
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,470
And now you're about forty-

823
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,870
42 years old.

824
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,870
two right?

825
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:29,900
But, you'd expect to go down in weight as you get to your fifties or sixties

826
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,050
as you get older, correct?

827
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,490
Considering that, the theory that I've brought today is this one.

828
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:40,330
Theory: There is no one over 70 years old and over 100 kg.

829
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,400
How about it everyone? Have you seen one?

830
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,740
Yeah, right?

831
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,550
I haven't really looked closely.

832
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,620
Just try to imagine one for a second, over 70

833
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,430
if they were in their fifties or sixties

834
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,020
you'd find some.

835
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,020
Yes.

836
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:58,520
Over 70, a grandpa or grandma over 100 kg.

837
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,490
Even Sumo wrestlers go down in weight.

838
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,490
If you think about it a bit...

839
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,890
Sumo wrestlers right?

840
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,890
Yes, even for them.

841
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,990
Sumo wrestlers right?

842
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,170
Excuse me for a moment.

843
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,960
There aren't really that many pigs in there.

844
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,670
Sumo wrest-

845
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,050
How many times are you gonna say that?

846
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,530
Asking only about sumo wrestlers, I have nothing to do with sumo.

847
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,520
You do have something to do!

848
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,950
Are you really going to get that mad?

849
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,790
Am I getting scolded that much from that side?

850
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:29,420
We're investigating the theory that there aren't any elderly in their 70's over 100 kg.

851
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,980
With that, we immediately go to Sugamo

852
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,860
the classic spot for elderly interviews.

853
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,310
Excuse me.

854
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:41,120
We're with TBS, from a program called Wednesday Downtown.

855
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,740
The first person that we spoke to was this man.

856
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,660
Could we weigh you if you wouldn't mind?

857
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,090
Uh huh, okay.

858
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:54,700
131.3 kg

859
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,820
But is he in his 70's? It's the age that matters here.

860
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,220
First off, he easily passed over the 100 kg goal.

861
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,580
How old are you?

862
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,580
Sixty.

863
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,170
He wasn't in his seventies.

864
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,920
Next, we have this man.

865
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,770
When we weigh him...

866
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,580
111.7 kg

867
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,330
However...

868
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,330
I'm 53.

869
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:23,920
Somehow, he was the same age as Downtown.

870
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,160
Same age?

871
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,360
We continue with the search but...

872
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,990
Huh, it's 79 kg, it's lower than before.

873
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,030
The weight goes down with age.

874
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,340
70 kg

875
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,700
Is it okay for you to say?

876
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,710
We couldn't find anyone over 100 kg and 70 years of age.

877
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,470
Next, we gave more attention to weight first.

878
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,700
We went to this shop

879
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,640
Oh, I see.

880
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,780
specializing on bigger sized clothes.

881
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,100
Going to a place like this.

882
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,810
Yes, since they have bigger people as clients

883
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,500
And then...

884
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,850
We're with a TV program called Wednesday Downtown.

885
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,760
I started working, and gained about 20 kg.

886
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,570
110 kg in freshman year, 120 in sophomore.

887
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:08,810
About 83 kg, it goes up and down though.

888
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,930
We have a scale with us,

889
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,390
could you please get on it?

890
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,390
Ah- it's okay.

891
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,080
It became 88.7 kg.

892
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,520
A bigger number than she expected,

893
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,270
and a bigger toe too.

894
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:26,620
We couldn't find what we are looking for.

895
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:31,160
The staff went around Sugamo and Sakazen thoroughly, but

896
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,500
they went to a place known for longevity of life and high metabolic rate

897
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,560
Okinawa.

898
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,900
After going around various towns looking for a potential person...

899
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,790
There's a deputy called Maekawa Tsuyoshi that might be what you are looking for.

900
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,890
His age is over 70.

901
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,850
Oh the age is sure.

902
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:55,600
I probably think that he is over 100 kg.

903
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,300
With that, we went to Izena Village.

904
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,220
They really went far away.

905
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,530
Good day.

906
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,530
Hello.

907
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,080
Good day.

908
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,080
Hello.

909
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:12,620
This is Maekawa Tsuyoshi, the chief deputy for the town of Izena.

910
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,790
I gain about 2~3 kg every year.

911
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:22,190
Maekawa-san's weight was...

912
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,820
92.6 kg

913
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,400
Unfortunately, we were a single step away from 100 kg.

914
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,880
Then...

915
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,120
Yes, hello.

916
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:39,720
He's pretty big.

917
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,390
How about this man that suddenly appeared?

918
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,970
He is 115.2 kg.

919
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,040
But...

920
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,730
I'm 62 years old.

921
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,690
62 years old?

922
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:57,070
Also, this man we met with the help of a local gym.

923
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,350
I am 65 this year.

924
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,860
Furthermore

925
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,510
75, this year.

926
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,200
Entering the latter-stage elderly.

927
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,770
We reliably thought he would be over 100 kg based on the net image of his.

928
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,130
He fell short of the goal just by a little 3 kg.

929
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,590
In the midst of it...

930
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:23,160
We received a powerful tip that there is someone.

931
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:29,030
We heard from the butcher that there is a 70 elderly over 100 kg.

932
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:33,410
By the way, the owner is 123.8 kg.

933
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,650
And

934
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,490
There is someone who fits what you are looking for.

935
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,490
Who is it?

936
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,590
Over 70 right?

937
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,590
What type of person are they?

938
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,860
Aguni-san.

939
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,760
Aguni-san?

940
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,200
Aguni-san. They run a soba shop.

941
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,490
Located around this shopping district?

942
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,490
Yeah, within this area.

943
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,530
You will lead us there?

944
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,530
Therefore

945
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,270
Ryuukyuu's Okazu Club
(Comedy duo) unexpectedly guides us.

946
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,760
We head towards the soba shop.

947
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,660
She does resemble Yui-P.

948
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,930
Welcome.
Hi.

949
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,320
Hi.

950
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,320
This is Aguni-san.

951
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,140
This is the rumored Aguni Nobumitsu-san.

952
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,770
Aguni-san, how old are you right now?

953
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,810
In August, I will be turning 73.

954
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,640
Right now, aged 72.

955
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,150
Firstly, he has cleared the age requirement.

956
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,040
By the way, how much do you weigh right now?

957
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,510
Without measuring, I'm not clear myself.

958
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,620
Will his weight really be over 100 kg?

959
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,840
Is it okay?

960
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,930
95.1 kg

961
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,520
Close but he fell short by 5 kg.

962
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,120
Just a month ago,he was well above 100 kg

963
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,500
Is that true?

964
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,500
Yes, it is true.

965
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,450
Right now, he is going through a diet.

966
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,410
I was about 103 kg.

967
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,930
Unbelievably, he was 103 kg just a month ago.

968
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:55,000
He's slowly reverting back right now.

969
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,560
My weight was due to my drinking.

970
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,350
Now that he is no longer restricting himself from alcohol,

971
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:05,180
he is happily drunk and rebounding back.

972
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,460
In this case, we came just a tad too late.

973
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:14,910
Indeed, do all our findings lead to the conclusion that there are no elderly which are 70 over and 100 kg?

974
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:19,230
We spread our nets even further, enlisting the help of amateurs and professionals in our endeavour.

975
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:23,080
When we looked upon ex-sumos...

976
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,910
ex-yokozuna (Grand Champion) Wajima Hiroshi (Winner of 54th)

977
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,960
Right now aged 68, weighing in at 85 kg.

978
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,360
He clearly dropped quite a bit of weight compared to when he was active in the sumo scene.
From 132 kg to his current 85 kg.

979
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,700
Furthering our research...

980
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:43,680
it was very hard to get a hold of any ex-sumos above the age of 70.

981
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,640
And when we look upon on why, we realize.

982
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,990
Looking at the results of yokozuna from the Meiji period onwards,

983
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:56,440
those that are in their 60's and living are 22 out of 47.

984
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,790
More than half have passed away before reaching their 60th.

985
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,930
Moreover, within them those that lived to see their 70th,

986
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,840
just 7 out of 47.

987
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,560
The possibility of a yokozuna living to see his 70th:

988
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,200
16%

989
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,090
What about ex-wrestlers?

990
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:25,440
First up, renowned for his husky voice, Tenryuugen Ichiro.

991
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,400
His weight is above 100 kg but his age hasn't reached 70.

992
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,940
Following that we have, Killer-Khan.

993
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:39,060
Here too, meeting the weight requirement but not yet 70.

994
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,970
Again, we see a similar pattern with Choshu Riki.

995
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:48,870
In the case of Fujiwara Yoshiaki too, 67 and 98 kg.

996
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:53,970
Finally, the most elderly active wrestler Great Kojika too.

997
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:58,730
At age 74, his weight almost making to the 100 kg mark but not there yet.

998
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:04,070
But within all that, we found someone who might fulfill our criteria.

999
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,160
And he is...

1000
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,070
Sakaguchi Seiji (Wild Eagle of the World)

1001
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,620
With that being the case,

1002
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:18,270
We quickly head to Shin Nihon pro wrestling dojo where Sakaguchi awaits.

1003
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,240
Pleased to meet you.

1004
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:29,100
This is Sakaguchi Seiji (AKA Big Saka) right now aged 74.

1005
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,070
Even at present over the age of 74,

1006
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:35,160
he definitely will train at least 3 times a week.

1007
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,520
How tall are you?

1008
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,800
*Husky Noises*

1009
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,240
Could you repeat that once more please?

1010
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,930
He too is no slouch in the husky voice department.

1011
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,490
He seems promising.

1012
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,410
Could you repeat that again?

1013
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,410
194 cm.

1014
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,940
194 cm?

1015
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,720
Did you shorten by a bit?*

1016
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:58,840
*Note: 196 cm during his career.

1017
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,860
*Husky Noises*

Who knows? Maybe I did shrink by a bit.

1018
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:04,440
The fact that he is over 70 and 190 cm makes him a rare grandpa to find.

1019
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,950
In the end...

1020
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,780
Ex-wrestler Sakaguchi Seiji at 74.

1021
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,480
What will his weight be?

1022
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,990
He doesn't cross 100, does he?

1023
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,250
Unexpectedly, he weighs in at 121.9 kg.

1024
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,080
Such a person does exist.

1025
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,360
These numbers.

1026
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,340
I have stuck with this weight for quite a few years.

1027
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:52,980
Aged 74, Height at 194 cm, Weight at 121.9 kg.

1028
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,550
Such a monster elderly does exist.

1029
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:00,150
On the other hand...

1030
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,180
By this year April, just go over the 100 kg in weight?

1031
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,810
It has been 10 months since the recording.

1032
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:14,280
We entered in May and now we came back to check upon the rebounder.

1033
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,770
It has been a very long time.

1034
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,290
Ossu.

1035
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:18,320
Since then, what's changed?

1036
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,450
Drinking, Drinking, Drinking a bunch.

1037
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,000
It seems likely that you have reached over 100 kg.

1038
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,430
Are you stupid, idiot?

1039
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,970
There's no way I weigh over 100 kg.

1040
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,970
Why don't we just check?

1041
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:32,060
Does he really weigh over 100 kg?

1042
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:39,100
101.4 kg

1043
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,780
It seems I have returned to my previous form.

1044
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:47,050
With that said, take note to all the elderly:

1045
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:50,170
Please take good care of your body.

1046
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,120
Look, people like that clearly exist.

1047
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,020
Are you sure, I mean just even for Sakaguchi-san (Ex-Wrestler).

1048
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,750
He was still doing muscle training after all.

1049
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,700
He is the rare oddity in this case.

1050
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,340
However, Ageni-san was just happily sipping away.

1051
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,170
*Note: Jocky = Beer mug

1052
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,170
He was wearing shoes and carrying the Jocky*

1053
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:10,010
He definitely would have left his mug behind.

1054
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,450
Did he leave his mug behind?

1055
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,450
I think even he would.

00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:39,900

00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:15,810
In the next episode...

1059
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:19,750
Theory: If magicians were to attempt stealing, even anti-shoplifting guards won't be able to stop them.

1060
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,470
Magician vs G-man Showdown

1061
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,810
Furthermore, mixed rule match between wanko soba and Reversi.

1062
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,130
In the 10 times quiz you'll definitely fall for it for the first time!

1063
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:39,900
Theory: People will definitely throw up once they realize it was not barley tea but it was mentsuyu (noodle soup base).
