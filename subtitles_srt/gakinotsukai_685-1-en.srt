2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,470
Can you take videos on this?

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,690
No, you can't take videos

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,090
Oh, you cant

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,100
Yeah

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:12,940
Huh, I didn't know

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,520
Good morning

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,270
Good morning

9
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,270
Good morning

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,680
What's wrong?

11
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,800
Do you have a toothache?

12
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,270
I was punched

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,000
What?

14
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,000
By whom?

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,520
Heipo!

16
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,520
what!?

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,520
No way!

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,360
There's no way he would do that

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,530
He seems so gentle

20
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,510
Right

21
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,720
He dragged me around by my hair

22
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,730
You don't have any

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,110
Heipo's super angry today

24
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,390
Why?

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,750
If I think about it,

26
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,960
I think I can partially be blamed

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,950
How many years have we been running this show?

28
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,410
Fifteen years

29
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,070
How many episodes?

30
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,240
Dunno

31
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,340
You can't even tell anymore

32
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,450
And...

33
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,850
Of those times...

34
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,310
Has there been a time where Heipo looked cool?

35
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,180
Has there been a time where Heipo looked cool?

36
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,850
Has there been a time where Heipo looked cool?

37
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,340
Well, if you think about it, you're right

38
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,300
Has there been a time where Heipo looked 180 cm?

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,410
Nope, never

40
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,040
But hold on

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,090
We've had a lot of episodes

42
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,180
centered around him

43
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,190
Yeah

44
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,550
Like having him be a baby

45
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,660
Right?

46
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,140
And he's unhappy with that?

47
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,020
In just this year, he's already had

48
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,640
six prospective marriages destroyed

49
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,120
Yeah but isn't that Heipo-san's own...

50
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,800
He's only had 5 meetings, but 6 were destroyed

51
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,720
So whose fault is it?

52
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,920
So what are we supposed to do?

53
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,430
so...

54
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,770
He's saying to show his cool parts on the show.

55
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,770
He's saying to show his cool parts on the show.

56
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,890
He's saying to show his cool parts on the show.

57
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,730
He says he wants people to go,

58
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,770
"Wow, there are cool parts about Heipo-san"

59
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,390
That's hard...

60
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,240
But...

61
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,250
He gets scared at

62
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,700
even the slightest things

63
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,660
Yeah, that's why

64
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,820
So even if we do it...

65
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,600
There's nothing we can do for him, right?

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,570
I don't think so either

67
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,310
Right?

68
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,130
He's actually getting worse

69
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,860
I don't know, I can't tell

70
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,750
What do you mean you don't know?

71
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,740
No, I have to go back him up

72
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,170
It's all the time now

73
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,310
I have to go suck up to him now

74
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,830
So...

75
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,160
Just think of some ways

76
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,380
I really have to go

77
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,890
But even then..

78
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,350
Heipo, whose lameness has been getting worse every year

79
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,350
It's a currrrse!

80
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,750
which has been continuously shown on TV

81
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,030
for fifteen years now

82
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,290
Will they really be able

83
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,270
to make this man look cool?

84
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,160
To grant the chief director Heipo's wish,

85
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,390
four men stood up!

86
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,390
Make Heipo look cool!

87
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,720

It's okay, right?

102
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,220
They all head to Heipo's green room

103
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,440
Let's make his mood better

104
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,990
Excuse me

105
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,380
Excuse me

106
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,870
Good morning

107
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,530
Well, so...

108
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,010
Saitou-san is cool...*

109
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,050
*Saitou is Heipo's real name

110
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,040
Of course

111
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,850
Obviously he is very cool normally

112
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,510
So,

113
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,800
I think the idea is that

114
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,710
we just need to show him

115
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,960
as his regular self

116
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,850
Well, we talked it over

117
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,520
between ourselves and decided

118
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,970
Still, what's cool have always been cowboys

119
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,810
Still, what's cool have always been cowboys

120
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,100
Visually

121
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,600
And with that in mind

122
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,650
we prepared a costume and everything

123
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,430
So specifically, what do you...

124
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,610
Yeah, since he's a cool cowboy, we thought...

125
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,890
Rodeo!

126
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,090
Rodeo, huh

127
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,350
It is manly

128
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,740
What do you think, Heipo-san?

129
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,100
Heipo whispering to Matsumoto's ear

130
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,770
So what is it?

131
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,620
"Is it definitely gonna be cool?"

132
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,590
Yeah, it's cool, right?

133
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,580
I think there's no doubt about it

134
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,190
I think it's definitely gonna be cool

135
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,350
Say it yourself!

136
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,350
It's bothersome, again and again

137
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,640
What?

138
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,380
You all and I have been friends

139
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,260
for 10 years, no 20 years

140
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,770
So as such long friends,

141
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,610
it this something that must be done, or not?

142
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,090
Was he really speaking to him for that long?

143
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,240
We think, after giving it that much thought,

144
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,650
that it should be done, but...

145
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,210
This is definitely going to be cool!

146
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,220
Yeah

147
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,220
Let's do this, Heipo-san! Heipo-san let's do this!

148
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:54,680
So since he thinks the same...

149
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,180
So since he thinks the same...

150
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,720
Okay so we'll be waiting here

151
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,690
please do it for us

152
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,720
Let's Show a Cool Heipo Using Rodeo!!

153
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,720
Let's Show a Cool Heipo Using Rodeo!!

154
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,100
this is gonna be perfect

155
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,360
Yeah this is good

156
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,590
We've spent a lot of money for Heipo

157
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,430
A Rodeo Machine

158
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,100
Going through the trouble of preparing this

159
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,930
Oh, he's coming

160
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,470
Ok, so pretty much...

161
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,470
we've been allowed to set this up so

162
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,420
Ok, I see, you meant like this

163
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,190
And just in case you fall

164
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,830
you'll be totally okay

165
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,220
"You've done pretty good!"

166
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,140
Oh, thank you very much

167
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,180
And, since it's very easy, anyone can do it

168
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,180
Yeah anyone can do it

169
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:48,970
"Oh no! I'm getting super hyped!"

170
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,640
"Oh no! I'm getting super hyped!"

171
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,250
So are we doing this?

172
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,230
It seems good

173
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,860
So let's go

174
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,550
Yeah, let's go

175
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,800
Yeah we can do this whenever you're ready

176
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,450
Yes, please do

177
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,450
Yeah

178
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,820
Let's put this on just in case

179
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:00,820
Yeah

180
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,470
Just in case, ok?

181
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,660
He'll probably be fine though

182
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,010
Just in case

183
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,240
You're still plenty cool after this

184
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,980
You're right, he's still very cool

185
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,060
Usually if you put that on you wouldn't

186
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,570
Heipo-san, let's try striking a pose

187
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,340
It's very good

188
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,360
Super cool!

189
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,540
No matter how you look at it, he's a cowboy

190
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,240
Cameras, make sure he's properly captured

191
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,650
Ok, please

192
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,560
So...

193
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,810
Heipo-san it's up to you!

194
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,810
Yes!

195
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,100
All yours!

196
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,360
Don't wanna!

197
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,940
He's talking

198
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,470
It's only spinning around!

199
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,450
No... I don't wanna

200
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,960
Wait! Wait, sorry!

201
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,060
Scary....

202
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,490
Heipo-san, um...

203
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,880
It was only turning around

204
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,540
It's after this we wanna see..

205
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,620
And, Heipo-san, um...

206
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,760
Can you go like "Yee-haw" or...

207
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,180
He was like "Don't wanna, don't wanna"

208
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,150
But you know

209
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,770
He was actually saying "Yee-haw"

210
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,350
He was actually saying "Yee-haw"

211
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,120
It kinda sounded like "Don't wanna", right?

212
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,090
Yes

213
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,090
But that's it

214
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,150
He's misunderstood

215
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,040
If he could say it a little more clearly

216
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,020
"Yee-haw", please

217
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,410
Show us your cool side!

218
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,390
Your cool side!

219
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,490
Show it to us!

220
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,920
"Yee haw!"

221
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,650
Say it!

222
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,500
Yee...

223
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,680
Ha- no! Don't wanna!

224
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,940
I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

225
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,690
Heipo-san

226
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,810
Heipo leaves in anger

227
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,790
Heipo-san!

228
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,600
Heipo-san!

229
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,810
Heipo-san!

230
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,810
You all better remember this!

231
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,040
Heipo-saan!

232
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,420
What does he want us to do..?

233
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,820
After we grudgingly...

234
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,400
He got scared

235
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,060
It only rotated...

236
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,380
It's nothing, right?

237
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,400
It's almost just fun

238
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,050
Maybe he was tired?

239
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,030
Ok, then, we should just go apologize

240
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,140
Everyone goes to see how Heipo's doing

241
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,920
It would be dumb if he says something later

242
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,550
What's wrong?

243
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,770
I was punched!!

244
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,770
again?

245
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,760
He was very agitated

246
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,290
and finally, just now

247
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,910
he got his calm back

248
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,860
I guess it means there's room for improvement

249
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,820
So can you let us talk to him about...

250
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,810
Improvement?

251
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,340
Let's do that, we can't continue like that

252
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,650
So we want to explain that to him

253
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,930
Can you ask him?

254
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,520
If we can go in or not

255
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,800
Ok, ok, then

256
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,810
Excuse us

257
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,810
Excuse us

258
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,050
pardon us...

259
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,310
Heipo elegantly enjoying a book

260
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,320
Heipo-san...

261
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,860
Can we have a moment of your time?

262
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,460
So us four talked it over

263
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,730
and decided that

264
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,120
the mechanical way it looked

265
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,840
may have contributed to the fear

266
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,860
and we made a small adjustment

267
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,180
Changing the Appearance to Erase the Fear

268
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,180
Point of Improvement

269
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,180
aayyyyayay

270
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,180
ayyy

271
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,580
to the machine itself

272
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,420
to change the appearance

273
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,290
What do you think?

274
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,410
He says "I will believe you"

275
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,060
"just once more"

276
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,360
Seriously!?

277
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,350
Thank you very much

278
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,150
"If something were to happen again..."

279
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,350
"A revelation from the gods will come down"

280
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:38,850
"A revelation from the gods will come down"

281
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,520
"A revelation from the gods will come down"

282
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,880
I think it's weird he said "revelation"

283
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,020
What did you mean, Heipo-san?

284
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,810
He says, "But, you know..."

285
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,810
"It's a very good thing"

286
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,170
Huh?

287
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,440
"Friends, I mean."

288
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,170
Oh, it's very gratifying that he thinks so

289
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,060
It is

290
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,850
He's reading a really old book...

291
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,830
Tanaka Yasuo's...

292
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,030
"Vaguely Crystal"...

293
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,660
Let's Show a Cool Heipo Using Rodeo!

294
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,020
Let's Show a Cool Heipo Using Rodeo!!

295
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,040
This is really great, right?

296
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,020
Wow, it is really good

297
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,970
It's so cute...

298
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,970
Not scary at all

299
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,470
It's a field of flowers

300
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,470
Yes

301
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,420
It's great

302
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,490
The colors are very good

303
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,650
Oh, he's coming

304
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,640
He's here

305
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,080
We've been waiting for you

306
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,720
What do you think of this

307
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,250
fun-looking...?

308
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,720
"I like it because it's cute!"

309
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,380
Oh, his opinion changed...

310
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,320
The first one was too mechanical, right?

311
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,810
This way the mood changes a little

312
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,140
And this isn't the only thing

313
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,210
To help with the fear,

314
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,890
we've arranged for this person to come

315
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,620
She's cute

316
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,650
She's laughing a lot, though...

317
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,650
It's very nice

318
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,350
"This is irresistible"

319
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,220
He even tried to speak himself just now

320
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,060
Maybe, you know

321
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,060
See? He's forgotten

322
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,300
if he shows her his cool side, something might...

323
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,640
Something romantic

324
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,640
Maybe it will happen

325
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,880
See? Something rewarding might...

326
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,310
Well, well, um...

327
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,320
What'd he say?

328
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,310
Something dirty, you know!

329
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,600
He totally said it as it is!

330
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,380
He used language!

331
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,450
So, Heipo-san, are you ready?

332
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,510
We're counting on you!

333
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,650
Please watch right in front of him

334
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,650
Yes, please see him

335
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,250
Are you good, camera-people?

336
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,010
Catch his cool moment perfectly, please

337
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,290
Catch him being cool!

338
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,270
Ok, then, please!

339
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,430
Then let's go!!

340
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,890
He looks very cool

341
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,090
No! I'm falling!

342
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,980
Why is he leaving?

343
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,400
Wait, why is he leaving?

344
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,390
Heipo leaves again

345
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,830
Heipo-san

346
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,890
You all have done too much!

347
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,360
Heipo-saan!

348
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,280
We haven't done anything too much!

349
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,270
Right?

350
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,210
This is a little too hard...

351
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,770
She's gone through the trouble of coming

352
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,550
I'm sorry

353
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,390
We're very sorry

354
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,470
Everyone goes to see how he's doing again

355
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,150
We're gonna go... Thank you

356
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,720
Go home!

357
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,720
Wait, hold on

358
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,560
He's very very angry!

359
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,980
So he says

360
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,530
I've been saying, not to embarrass him in front of women!

361
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,200
That is the root cause behind this!

362
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,780
And yet you again, bring a woman

363
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,640
And embarrass him in front of her

364
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,550
This isn't right!

365
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,890
Then... Can we at least explain ourselves...?

366
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,060
I don't think you can see him!

367
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,500
Definitely not...

368
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,530
Well, that's that

369
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,520
I guess it can't be helped

370
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,850
He says it's okay!

371
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,410
Oh, it's okay?

372
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,850
That was fast

373
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,860
Excuse us!

374
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,770
Heipo getting measurements for a new suit

375
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,160
Heipo-san...

376
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,100
Um... They say they want to talk to you...

377
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,080
We all talked together afterwards

378
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,160
about other possible improvements

379
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,200
and thought... maybe a machine isn't right

380
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,380
So basically, instead of machines, using ourselves

381
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,810
Point for Improvement

382
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,810
Using Manpower Instead of Machinery

383
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,810
aayyyyayay

384
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,810
ayyy

385
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,050
Using the power of man

386
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,240
I understand that, but...

387
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,890
"I want to hit someone!"

388
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,450
Wait, please, we've been doing this seriously...

389
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,200
Heipo-san has been saying

390
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,940
he can't go on to the next step

391
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,750
without hitting someone

392
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,340
but next...

393
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,010
Who are you angry at, Heipo-san?

394
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,430
Who makes you most angry?

395
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,650
It's okay...

396
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,820
I'm very sorry.

397
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,930
To be honest....

398
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,850
After this

399
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,850
Heipo's slaps get worse!!

400
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,850
I'm much less excited now

401
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,370
Let's Show a Cool Heipo Using Rodeo!!

402
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,560
Let's Show a Cool Heipo Using Rodeo!!

403
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,320
I saw that slap and I thought, "Wow, he's really mad"

404
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,410
Yeah, I thought so too

405
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,530
Yeah, but it wasn't all Endo's...

406
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,630
I guess he...

407
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,830
Oh, he's ready already

408
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,520
So...

409
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,180
this is set up so

410
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,740
it's not a machine anymore

411
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,940
You get it if you see it, right?

412
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,060
Mikoshi Rodeo

413
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,440
Yeah, we can imagine

414
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,430
This does seem more gentle

415
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,780
Ok, then...

416
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,050
Great

417
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,060
Yes

418
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,410
Let's do this

419
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,560
This should be okay

420
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,580
Ok, Heipo-san

421
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,390
If you'd please get on...

422
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,400
Yes

423
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,030
This is really heavy

424
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,710
Heipo-san's pretty heavy

425
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,100
Wow, this is pretty tough

426
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,310
Hahahaha

427
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,880
He looks really pleased

428
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,980
Wait wait wait

429
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,210
Wait

430
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,140
He's not ready...

431
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,140
Ah, he's okay

432
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,510
Ok, let's go!!

433
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,040
We're ready!

434
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,910
No, ahh, ah

435
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,290
Ow ow ow ow

436
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,850
Wait

437
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,250
What the hell?

438
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,610
What is it?

439
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,410
What's wrong?

440
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,270
Uhyahahaha!

441
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,520
Heipo leaves for the second time

442
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,020
You!

443
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,390
You're all devils wearing people's faces-masks!!

444
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,060
You're all devils wearing people's faces-masks!!

445
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,020
You're all devils wearing people's faces-masks!!

446
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,130
Devils, I say!!

447
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,740
Why the hell...?

448
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,250
Yama-chan are you okay?

449
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,960
My hand got caught

450
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,600
Oh, that's painful...

451
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,600
between the gun-thingy

452
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,680
Yama-chan it's all messed up!

453
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,350
Yama-chan it's all messed up!

454
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,340
Yup, it is

455
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,920
I was about to go, "POW"

456
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,300
For the last try, there's only *that*

457
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,520
Everyone goes to see how Heipo's doing again

458
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,670
Yeah, there's only *that*

459
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,060
Yeah, it's already...

460
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,470
Please leave.

461
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,410
Wait,

462
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,200
you can't just...

463
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,390
Please, just leave!

464
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,290
But since we've come this far, and

465
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,840
we finally got something...

466
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,470
He's very very angry!

467
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,270
The thing we're about to explain will definitely do it

468
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,060
I think there's definitely no way

469
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,060
Please, you have to

470
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,890
Yes

471
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,220
We have nothing to lose

472
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,270
He says it's fine!

473
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,450
That's a relief

474
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,480
Yup, that was fast

475
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,460
He might even

476
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,590
go along with it

477
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,440
Excuse us

478
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,420
Excuse us!

479
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,100
Heipo is waxing a surfboard

480
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,970
Does he even know why he's doing that

481
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,870
Heipo-san

482
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,880
You dare come here now?

483
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,490
We're very sorry

484
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,460
We really are

485
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,250
As proof that we've worked hard for you

486
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,490
look at Yama-chan's hand

487
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,510
it has a welt

488
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,080
How do you feel about this Heipo-san?

489
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,320
"Well, before any of that..."

490
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,700
"I..."

491
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,180
"Want to hit someone"

492
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,520
"Want to hit someone"

493
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,300
Who do you want to hit, Heipo-san!?

494
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,070
Endo, wait wait, I get it, but...

495
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,130
I get it, but!

496
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,920
Fine

497
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,650
I'm sorry

498
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,970
We know this is our last chance

499
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,980
so this will definitely be

500
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,560
very safe,

501
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,890
Point for Improvement

502
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,890
Using a safe and reliable method

503
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,890
aayyyyayay

504
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,890
ayyy

505
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,050
without anything to fear

506
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,380
and without danger

507
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,020
While still being cool

508
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,020
Of course

509
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,510
that's why...

510
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,170
Can you really do it?

511
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,470
I think

512
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,610
it really is safe this time

513
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,710
What do you say?

514
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,780
For real?

515
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,810
"I want to hit another person!!"

516
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,020
"I want to hit another person!!"

517
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,600
"I want to hit another person!!"

518
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,770
Who is it? Heipo-saaaan!!

519
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,430
Who is it? Heipo-saaaan!!

520
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,530
Are you okay?

521
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,790
He got my ear

522
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,610
He's okay

523
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,070
I'm counting on you!

524
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,060
Yes

525
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,800
I'll make Heipo-san

526
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,470
go as soon as possible

527
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,720
Let's Show a Cool Heipo Using Rodeo!!

528
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,060
Let's Show a Cool Heipo Using Rodeo!!

529
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,380
If he's got a problem after this...

530
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,380
He wouldn't

531
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,440
It wouldn't be fair to Tanaka

532
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,680
That's true

533
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,800
Why do you have to do such a thing?

534
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,810
For real

535
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,140
Tanaka Rodeo

536
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,550
To be honest it's embarrassing

537
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,010
I'm sorry, dude

538
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,010
It's okay, I'll do it

539
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,640
Why don't you have that nose ring...

540
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,640
I'll do it

541
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,640
It does suit you though

542
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:18,760
Does it...?

543
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,460
Oh he's running here

544
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,460
Oh, wow

545
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,250
His spirit's changed

546
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,220
wow

547
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,490
Heipo-san, it's as you see it

548
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,780
this has no danger

549
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,490
undeniably safe

550
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,970
What do you think?

551
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
"Well, despite all of the"

552
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,770
"ill-feelings and such"

553
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,650
"All's well that ends well"

554
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,650
Of course

555
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,620
So, um...

556
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,640
He is greatly regretting

557
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,430
He is greatly regretting

558
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,430
his choice to hit Hamada

559
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,430
Oh, really?

560
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,930
As for Endo, nothing at all!

561
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,810
As for Endo, nothing at all!

562
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,640
He's not even finished yet!

563
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
I see... did I do anything to him?

564
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,430
It's okay with this, right?

565
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,430
Are you good?

566
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,020
He says it's absolutely no problem

567
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,290
He's really depending on you

568
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,280
Yes

569
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,180
If you'd just do it with love

570
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,720
We've been together for years, and I'll do it

571
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,520
You can only wear this out of love

572
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,130
Exactly. I can do it

573
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,050
Ok, let's go

574
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,320
Yes!

575
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,760
You will look very cool

576
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,910
Ah, wait

577
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,610
I promise I'll make you look cool

578
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,590
Very cool

579
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,430
Yes, very cool

580
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,730
Ok, steady, ok

581
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,960
Ow ow ow

582
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,970
Augh

583
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,400
Ah! Ow ow!

584
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,900
Wow, very cool

585
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,110
Please do your best, Heipo-san

586
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,060
Just a little more...

587
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,180
Heipo leaves for the third time

588
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,890
You don't have to go?

589
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,180
I don't care about that guy

590
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,880
This week we are releasing an unreleased Talk

591
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,850
"What is in Antonio Inoki's chin?"

592
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,910
Wow, this is a direct confrontation

593
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,910
Yes it is

594
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,200
Before that, his chin is actually paper-mache

595
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,510
He's actually just putting it on

596
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,310
It's fake?

597
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,310
Yup

598
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,310
And if you take it off,

599
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,600
There's like a caster inside

600
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,080
Just like the wheels on this

601
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,480
That comes out

602
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,540
And?

603
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,080
So if you hold Inoki's legs,

604
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,740
You go like this first, then like this

605
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,510
And when you can't just go like this

606
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,250
You have to go further first, then like this, then this

607
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,880
You can't just turn

608
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,020
because then Inoki will be like "Scary, no, no!"

609
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,600
My shoulder's gonna get scraped! It's gonna get scraped!

610
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,170
Well, of course,

611
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,200
the mental image is funny

612
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,170
but why the hell would there be a caster there?

613
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,940
If you get to Inoki's level, you don't just wanna walk anymore!

614
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,220
I think that way is more tiring though...

615
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,220
Why? Fujita holds him and stuff

616
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
It doesn't matter who holds him, but...

617
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,340
you're saying since he puts it there to hide it?

618
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,970
It's easier to go like this for Fujita when the road is wide,

619
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,970
If he goes in a narrow one, it goes like this

620
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,600
And since Inoki was like "anything but that",

621
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,910
Fujita now goes forward a little, before backing up.

622
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,510
And Inoki's all...

623
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,970
"Hey, Fujita, you're not so bad at this"

624
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,510
Ok, I get that

625
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,820
Once, when he was resting his chin, his hand slipped like this

626
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,770
"Y'know, in that case-" "SHKOW!"

627
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,200
and the wheel turns like this

628
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:34,020
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

629
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,800
It was so hard to keep from laughing

630
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,940
Because you can't laugh too much, right?

631
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,940
Yeah

632
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,340
It was like "RRRROOOOLLLLLLLL"

633
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,680
Wow, his hand really slipped huh?

634
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,820
Something would've got caught in it

635
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,080
Shut up already

636
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,540
It was all

637
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,200
and he says, "I'm leaving now"

638
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
and it was like
