1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,000
It's gonna be like this

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,310
Really?
-Yeah it's just like before

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,490
Still gotta do things like this

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,670
The person coming today is the same as before, right?

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,290
Probably

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,430
The guy from Osaka

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,530
Then let's get him out, please

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,920
It's this one

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,880
This one is more trouble

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,250
Why do you talk as if you don't want to see me

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,500
It's a 2m 4cm one

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,470
No, I'm 188

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,100
That's pretty tall!

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,280
Well, there's no time to lose

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,590
Today the theories are all the same theme

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,070
There is a theme that unexpectedly comes up a lot, what do you think it is?

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,700
There are a variety of topics

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,880
Eating contest?

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,970
There are quite a lot of eating contests
-Indeed

20
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,290
It's actually music

21
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,170
So, we have selected some and formed this project today, which is this:

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,840
Music Theory Day

23
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,680
We are taking inspiration from TBS' music special "Music Day"

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,860
So, we bring you an episode full of musical theories

25
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,190
First of all, do you remember this project? Please take a look

26
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,220
It is possible to create feel-good lyrics just by using the names of comedians

27
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,240
This is an old one, ages ago, right?
-I don't remember it at all

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,820
Hey, do you remember? Did we do this?

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,940
You probably forgot since you've seen so much since then

30
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,610
This was on 100 Seconds Doctor Academy

31
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:38,250
※Dr. 100 Seconds Academy is a former Downtown show

32
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,240
No, no, no, no. How is that possible?

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,250
It's a theory

34
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,410
It was 6 years ago

35
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,040
How could anyone remember that?

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,120
Music arrangements with only the names of comedians

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,150
An attempt to form a song with a good feeling

38
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,520
That was the theory

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,520
This time we replaced the second verse of a song with the name of comedians

40
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,030
After the original first verse, the changed second verse comes up

41
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,810
After listening I may remember

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,160
6 years ago

43
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,340
Bearworm

44
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,680
New York Skyscrapers

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,050
A shooting star is a messenger

46
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,680
Like this? We did this?

47
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:25,460
Always from here falling in love

48
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,860
Maybe I was off during this period

49
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,630
My home in Downtown

50
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,800
Dangerous nights

51
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,800
※Knights written as "nights"

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,230
Unstable nights

53
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,400
If you have the chance to come a second time

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,970
Hi-Hi you're such an idiot!

55
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,350
The real kids are already a middle school student now

56
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,350
※Real Kids member Yuuki resigned from Yoshimoto in 2014 due to his debt crisis

57
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:53,990
Goodbye light of youth

58
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,990
There are so many different people!

59
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,160
Gorgeous high heels

60
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,460
Comfortable asian silk

61
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,500
Wagyu's cola cake

62
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,230
Replicas of the giants

63
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:14,010
X-GUN's bike, kawasaki motorcycle

64
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,850
Bearworm sings well

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,810
ZUN ZUN ZUN

66
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,480
"Hello Keisuke" "Hey Taku-chan"

67
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:33,990
Same gender are really congratulatory

68
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,760
This was the first verse from that time

69
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,830
The second verse is by Koga Ken

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,270
Nature in the Grassland

71
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,540
Rainbow in the blue sky

72
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:57,120
Isn't twilight under the rainbow great?

73
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,150
Don't know any of them

74
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,120
They're all combos right?

75
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:05,860
Australian Vacation Quiet Couple Time for Two

76
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,290
Well...a little niche

77
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,860
Map Messy

78
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,860
So old!

79
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,500
Suddenly, into the jungle

80
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,800
Pocket Monkey

81
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:25,110
Koala, panther, woolly-nosed wombat

82
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,800
Koala became that?

83
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,510
With two pistols BANBANBAN

84
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,850
Chasing light trucks

85
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,240
Hey, that kind of name...

86
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,720
Monster Engine A-Slip-Smoke

87
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:49,430
Thank you, President of Japan

88
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,580
Good singing

89
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,340
ZUN ZUN ZUN

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,610
Here we go again.
-Don't need them again

91
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,970
Who are you guys? Boyfriend

92
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:09,890
Love triangle is not impossible ha

93
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,050
The story is finished

94
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,790
That's it. Do you remember?

95
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,800
No, I don't remember at all, even after listening to it

96
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,510
Even with the photos below it...

97
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,660
Yes

98
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,530
He said "so old" when Messy came up

99
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,180
※The group formed in 1979 and disbanded in 2008

100
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,180
That I don't agree with, what do you mean old?

101
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,880
The others were more recent

102
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,350
Then suddenly there's people even older than us

103
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,960
But he really has no memory of it

104
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,850
We were both so unimpressed

105
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,590
So why bring this back now?

106
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,090
Next on Music Theory Day is...

107
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:57,100
Regarding the "Who do you think you are" part of Hikaru Utada's First Love, the theory is that everyone at karaoke sings "Who will you be thinking about daha-"

108
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,280
This time we were assisted by this KTV

109
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,840
And firstly talked to some visitors

110
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,280
We are looking for people who can sing First Love well

111
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,490
And launched an investigation under the guise of a singing test

112
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,520
The singing is viewed with a fixed camera

113
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,400
And so, the test begins

114
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,570
The last kiss with the flavor of a cigarette

115
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,380
Don't need this part
-It's quite long

116
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,740
Will she really say "da-ha"?

117
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:45,180
Where will you be tomorrow?

118
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,930
Very good at singing

119
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,300
It's the part after this

120
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:52,420
Who will you be thinking about daha-

121
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,200
Coming! Coming!

122
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,250
She sings "daha-"

123
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,830
Must feel a bit stupid

124
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,770
The second person is...

125
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,070
This woman

126
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:13,240
Where will you be tomorrow?

127
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,100
Too interesting

128
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,350
So emotional, singing so powerfully

129
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,410
This person will definitely sing wrong, right?

130
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:21,430
Who will you be thinking about daha-

131
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,620
It's like they're going to "da ha" supermarket

132
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,390
Also sang it

133
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,900
Next

134
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,840
Who will you be thinking about daha-

135
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,950
Very cute these two

136
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,620
Don't sing it wrong! Don't sing it wrong!

137
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,440
Wrong

138
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:44,110
The friend of this one also takes no issue with the singing

139
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,710
By now, three people have sung incorrectly in a row

140
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,550
100% rate

141
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,670
After that the investigation continued

142
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,930
Sure enough, most people sang "da-ha"

143
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,130
Let's listen to Utada Hikaru's First Love again

144
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:18,610
Who will you be thinking about daha-

145
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,850
She also says "daha-"

146
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,890
To be faithful to the original song, you'll have to sing "da-ha-"

147
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,400
So, what about  other artists who have covered First Love?

148
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,530
First is this person

149
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,170
May J

150
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,530
Let's verify

151
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:59,950
Where will you be tomorrow?

152
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,320
May J is good!

153
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,570
Be careful, May J

154
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,970
Don't sing it wrong!

155
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:07,060
Who will you be thinking about dala-

156
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,140
Surprisingly sings "dala-"

157
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,660
Next is the talented Taiwanese singer, Lin Yuqun

158
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:32,920
Who will you be thinking about dala-

159
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,040
Two people in a row singing "dala-"

160
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,210
Has "dala-" become mainstream in covering this song?

161
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:48,250
Next is the well known cover from Tokunaga Eimi

162
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,170
Where will you be tomorrow?

163
00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:01,350
Who will you be thinking about?

164
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,200
Be careful

165
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,680
Brother, please!

166
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Be careful

167
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,610
A normal recitation

168
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,320
Next is...

169
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,020
JUJU

170
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:23,700
Where will you be tomorrow?

171
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:30,780
Who will you be thinking about dasa-

172
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,810
Dasa-

173
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,550
Dasa-

174
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,780
This is a joke, right?

175
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,880
This one's awesome

176
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,910
Surprisingly, the majority of covers sing "dasa-"

177
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,400
Anything's fine

178
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,760
What about the one we all know well?

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Otomo Kohei

180
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,110
What is the synergy between Otomo Kohei and "daha-"?

181
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:11,550
The last kiss with the flavor of a cigarette

182
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:19,420
A bitter and tiresome fragrance

183
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:32,800
Where will you be tomorrow?

184
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,040
Careful!

185
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,240
Here's the important part

186
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,340
Who will you be thinking about dayo-

187
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Careful

188
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,950
Dayo—

189
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,080
Dayo—

190
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:56,390
Not all of them are "da-ha-" but also "da-la-" "da-sa-" and "da-yo-".

191
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,900
Next on Music Theory Day is...

192
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:07,570
The lyrics of "I'm going to Tokyo" by Yoshizo is exactly the same as that of an existing village.

193
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,450
The theory was as follows:

194
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,800
We contacted 183 town halls throughout Japan...

195
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,080
...and conducted a survey on the synchronization rate with the lyrics of "I'm going to Tokyo" and ranked them.

196
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:26,500
So, is there really a village with a 100% synchronization rate?

197
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,040
So, we asked a man with the likeness of the original singer...

198
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,330
...to provide a word-for-word version of "I'm going to Tokyo".

199
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,270
Firstly

200
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,700
In fifth place is Nagano Prefecture, Shimo-Ina-gun, Sagi-mura

201
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:49,680
In addition, all of the videos played along with the song were filmed on location in Sagi-mura.

202
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
There's TV...

203
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,680
There's radio

204
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,690
Not many cars on the road

205
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,790
There's piano...

206
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,690
There's no bars...

207
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,520
There are police patrolling...

208
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,690
Got up in the morning and took the cows for a walk for over two hours.

209
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,860
There's phone...

210
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,860
There's gas...

211
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,700
Buses come five times a day.

212
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm tired of selling shellwood.

213
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,010
Going to Big Tokyo.

214
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,180
For Tokyo, go to Iida Station first.

215
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,680
It takes an hour to drive...

216
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,090
There's guitar...

217
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,090
There's stereo...

218
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,130
I've seen this guy before

219
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,130
There's tea stores and restaurants.

220
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,130
Closed but still there.

221
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,130
There's young people...

222
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,130
Elementary school, middle school, all just one school together.

223
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,340
There's a pharmacy...

224
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,440
No movies...

225
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,240
Tourists unlikely to visit.

226
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
No ballroom...

227
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,540
No peeping toms...

228
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,080
Do you know about laserdiscs?

229
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,880
No, I haven't been.

230
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,650
Laserdiscs, who are you?

231
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,750
Although there's a karaoke...

232
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,680
...can't sing without a reservation.

233
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,790
No evening papers.

234
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,690
No magazines.

235
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,690
Occasionally a notice board is passed around.

236
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,120
Only two signal lights...

237
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,660
...our village has electricity.

238
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,000
But shellwood is for sale.

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,170
Got a hot spring.

240
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,000
The hotel has a hot spring.

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,140
Youth is regained.

242
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:32,280
In summary, the synchronization rate of the lyrics is 37%.

243
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,610
Next is tied in fifth place...

244
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,770
...Watarunakiki Village, Shimajiri-gun, Okinawa.

245
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,670
Next

246
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,800
Second place is also a tie between two villages

247
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,270
Nosakogawa Village, Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture

248
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,860
And Tokyo Aonoshima Village. The synchronization rate is 40% for both.

249
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:04,520
So, the place with the highest synchronization rate with the lyrics of "I'm going to Tokyo" is...

250
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,460
Kagoshima Prefecture, Kagoshima County, Mishima Village.

251
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,750
Located about 40 km south of the Satsuma Peninsula.

252
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:20,010
Mishima Village, spread across three small islands, wins 1st prize.

253
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,630
There's TV...

254
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,700
There's radio...

255
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,770
Not many cars on the road.

256
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,770
There's a piano...

257
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,770
No bar...

258
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,610
One policeman patrolling...

259
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,780
Got up in the morning and took the cows for a walk for over two hours.

260
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,780
There's phone...

261
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,950
There's gas...

262
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,780
Doesn't even have any busses.

263
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,120
I'm sick and tired of Mishima Village...

264
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,290
Going to Big Tokyo.

265
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,330
Going to Tokyo, got to go to Kagoshima first.

266
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,730
The ferry takes four hours.

267
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,110
There's guitar...

268
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,270
There's stereo...

269
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,280
African drums are also popular.

270
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
There is no coffee shop, but there is a bed and breakfast.

271
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,450
There's 20 young people in their 20s.

272
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,620
There's no high school, not even one.

273
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,450
By the age of 15 all students leave the island.

274
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,450
No pharmacies...

275
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,490
No movies...

276
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,390
Occasionally a boat comes.

277
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,390
No ballroom...

278
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,390
No peeping toms...

279
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,390
There are laser discs available.

280
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,490
The karaoke only has 28 songs.

281
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,530
Only 28 songs to choose from.

282
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,700
Newspapers come four times a week.

283
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,530
No island-wide broadcasts...

284
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,540
No traffic lights, seriously...

285
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,470
But then again, the power is always on.

286
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,810
But in Mishima Village, but in Mishima Village...

287
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,810
...there's a hot spring.

288
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,980
Although there's a hot spring, there's no locker room.

289
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,990
There's nothing around it.

290
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:58,180
In summary, Mishima Village's lyrics synchronization rate is 44%

291
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,790
In all of Japan...

292
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,100
...even the closest villages only has a synchronization rate of 44%.

293
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,220
So what if we expand the scope to villages around the world?

294
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,740
Will there be a village with the exact same lyrics as "I'm going to Tokyo"?

295
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,540
Expanding the scope of the survey to the world...

296
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,760
...for the village that best fits the lyrics of "I'm going to Tokyo"...

297
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,000
...the world's top ranking is...

298
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,880
Laikipia County, Republic of Kenya

299
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Samaritan Village, Bois-Rob region, Neri County

300
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
That's quite a find
-Yeah

301
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,000
What exactly is its lyrics synchronization rate?

302
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,800
That's it!

303
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,220
Absolutely.

304
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,820
The live video shot in Kenya reveals the details.

305
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,490
Can't even see any wires.

306
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,150
It's true. You can tell just at a glance.

307
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,030
No TV...

308
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,060
No radio either...

309
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,130
No cars either...

310
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,130
No piano...

311
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,130
No bar...

312
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,970
No police patrol but there are warriors.

313
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,140
Get up in the morning, take the cows and basically walk around all day.

314
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,270
No phone...

315
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,310
No gas...

316
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,140
Not even a road where a bus can run.

317
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,480
I'm sick and tired of Samaritan Village.

318
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,650
Going to Nairobi.

319
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,890
To Nairobi, first through the roadless wilderness.

320
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,720
Drive for six hours...

321
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,600
No guitar...

322
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,630
No sound...

323
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,640
No African drums, no instruments.

324
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
No coffee shop...

325
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
No meetings...

326
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,740
The village is full of young people.

327
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,640
Grandma, grandpa, I can't tell how old you are.

328
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,810
No pharmacies...

329
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,850
No movies...

330
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,750
Apply aloe vera to minor injuries and pains.

331
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,750
No ballroom...

332
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,750
No peeping toms...

333
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,750
What are laser discs?

334
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,850
Karaoke even less likely.

335
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,890
Singing is ceremony not entertainment.

336
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,890
No newspapers...

337
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,960
No magazines...

338
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,890
It is said that there is no writing in the village.

339
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,900
No traffic lights, seriously.

340
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,830
My village does not even have electricity.

341
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,170
But this is Samaritan Village, but this is Samaritan Village...

342
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,170
No disputes, no wants, no needs.

343
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,340
No disputes and nothing to do.

344
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,350
Drinking in the daytime.

345
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,680
To sum up, the lyrics synchronization rate of Samaritan Village in Kenya is 77%.

346
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,330
Next, remember the theory related to Yoshizo's commercial songs?

347
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,540
I think I remember this one.
-A commercial song?

348
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:56,740
Workman and New Japan House were both used for commercials but only one is remembered

349
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,740
Seems familiar

350
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,120
You may remember one but not the other

351
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,680
I'm used to living in my house~

352
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,970
That's New Japan House

353
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,100
And Workman

354
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,380
Eh... really?

355
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,800
Really?
-Yeah

356
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,780
Then listen to it.
-Okay

357
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,170
New Japan House, please listen

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,920
It's coming back to me

359
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,570
It appeared every now and then

360
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,420
Walking and singing.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah

361
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,720
Mmm, I know it

362
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,380
So you don't remember Workman?

363
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,170
But after listening to Workman it might come back to you

364
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,000
Workman is this one

365
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,480
Really?
-Incredible

366
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,040
It can be said it's different

367
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,900
From here it's very...

368
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,660
Ah yes

369
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,120
Everyone, Workman together
-So it is

370
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,530
Hamada you can sing along if you listen to it

371
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,460
If you listen to New Japan House first, you won't be able to remember

372
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,200
It's Yoshizo cutting corners

373
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,010
It's not that

374
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,600
Next on Music Theory Day is...

375
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:35,540
After being scolded, it would be hard for Yaguchi Mari to let out her "sexy beam" when "Koi no Dance Site" is playing during karaoke.

376
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,280
When thinking of Yaguchi's time in Morning Musume

377
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,360
Her signature "sexy beam" move always comes to mind

378
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,360
This time, Yaguchi is given a lecture by a friend

379
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,800
Wow so mean

380
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,260
An actress with whom Yaguchi has a close personal relationship

381
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,820
Her angry must be scary

382
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,660
They are very close

383
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:07,580
So, Yaguchi and her friends start singing karaoke together

384
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,600
Good atmosphere

385
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,220
Really good vibe

386
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,450
Finally, time for the lecture

387
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,050
If you don't know anything about current affairs

388
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:24,360
You should have the self awareness of not studying hard enough

389
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,660
But I don't think you have to tell me that

390
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,130
Why do I feel the need to say this?

391
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,460
I don't know. You...

392
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,700
Have I done something to you?

393
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,500
What i'm saying is the staff's opinion, not mine

394
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,440
Surprisingly, Yaguchi rebuts and a heated argument begins

395
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,040
This is bad

396
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,740
So serious

397
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,610
And even if you say that to me now

398
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,580
What can I do in my work from now on?

399
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,510
I don't know

400
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,780
I should refuse work?

401
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,720
This argument continued for a period that cannot be broadcast

402
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,580
Finally...

403
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,760
I don't want to do this either

404
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,980
Yaguchi begins to cry

405
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,320
Next

406
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,900
Forget it, help me choose the song

407
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,920
Even if Yaguchi is in this state

408
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,180
Why did she choose this song?

409
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,900
Will she still do her signature move, the sexy beam?

410
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,140
How could she

411
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:29,520
Every time you fall in love, heartbeat Bon Bo Ba Bon

412
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,930
That's right, the first page of life

413
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,260
No, still crying

414
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,480
Crying

415
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,280
If she's told the truth she won't be happy

416
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:42,830
Just update it with the sexy beam

417
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,860
Quickly!

418
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,640
It is completely impossible to do it

419
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,360
Of course

420
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,140
So, the program team entered to explain the situation

421
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,380
I hate this

422
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,950
I really hate this

423
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,390
Sorry

424
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,490
Its over...

425
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,960
Wait

426
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,330
This one is terrible

427
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,360
I'm so sorry

428
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,130
I don't think that way at all!

429
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,080
Their friendship has deepened

430
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,440
I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry

431
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,680
I don't want this either

432
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,100
Why is it still 1 2 3 4

433
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,190
Next on Music Theory Day is...

434
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:42,660
No one will notice different lyrics to a famous song played as BGM

435
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,600
The investigation was conducted at this coffee shop

436
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,460
First of all, the first song is

437
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,420
TUBE's "Ah-Summer Vacation"

438
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,420
Is the chorus changed?

439
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,720
To change the lyrics of this song

440
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,920
The singer will be BETU, who has a similar appearance and voice

441
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
It'd have to be, otherwise it will be exposed immediately

442
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,500
These targets were called out on separate days for fake interviews

443
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,100
Fujimoto is very sensitive

444
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,120
The song is played while the person waits for the interviewer

445
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,400
Can they detect that the lyrics have been changed or not?

446
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,340
Chris may also realize

447
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,340
Chris knows a lot

448
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,960
After all, he loves ballad songs

449
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,010
First, the normal lyrics

450
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:44,250
I saw you through the bamboo curtain in Shonan

451
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:51,760
Everyone turns and has you in their eyes, feel so good

452
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,280
He's listening very carefully. Is it okay?

453
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,380
Because the vocals are very close

454
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,380
The three people have not yet discovered that it is someone else who is singing

455
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,620
From here, the lyrics will start to change slightly

456
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,660
First of all, "Ah-summer vacation" of Level 1 chorus will become slightly different lyrics

457
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,560
Change here?

458
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,060
They'll be found out, right?

459
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,100
What will change?

460
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,020
Dangerous to do it here

461
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:27,100
Ah Love summer

462
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,060
I see

463
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,320
It's like this

464
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,120
After all, it was a very subtle change that all three ignored

465
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,840
Next is Level 2

466
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,480
The second verse has a summer feel, but the content is completely different

467
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,750
Night falls, yukata and fireworks

468
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:49,750
The unicorn will undergo a test of courage at night

469
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:57,130
I can't see through your eyes, time goes by

470
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:57,130
There are still swimsuits on the beach and swarms of surfers.

471
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:03,800
Chinese cold noodles or runny vegetarian noodles

472
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:03,800
The back keeps shaking as if to tell something

473
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,060
Just continuous summer vocabulary

474
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:11,610
Five-person family, a watermelon is not enough to eat

475
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:11,610
Glistening lipstick, wet and writhing, I've got you

476
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:18,580
The smoothie that was eaten at the festival

477
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:18,580
The tears buried in the sand are good to forget

478
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,410
Whose cover is this?

479
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,580
Who's cover?

480
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,480
So quick

481
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,380
Impressive

482
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,140
Really!

483
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:27,290
Hesitation is gone and the bellworm are crying

484
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:27,290
The fireflies are so beautiful.

485
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,660
Chris realizes

486
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,620
However, the remaining two do not react

487
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:43,720
The next Level 3 lyrics all become winter

488
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,320
This will definitely be noticed, right?

489
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:56,450
Hold me tight, isn't it a dream? Such a beautiful meeting

490
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:56,450
Winter Love, is the snow going to melt?

491
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:03,430
Every summer I fall in love

492
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:03,430
My love will even melt the ski slopes

493
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,430
Doesn't work, it not Maeda's voice, i'm not feeling it

494
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:10,600
It's all right to hold me in your hot skin

495
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:10,600
Pink snow, Lovers are Santa Claus and hearts are dyed white

496
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,100
Ah, New Year's Day

497
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,100
Ah, summer vacation

498
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:23,680
Some tired of swimming, chest cool baby

499
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:23,680
Uncle will give you a red packet, baby

500
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,040
This is a spoof version, right?

501
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,360
Fujimoto did not react at all

502
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,680
What New Year's Day? Don't be ridiculous!

503
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,880
And so we reveal the truth

504
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,350
We are from Wednesday Downtown

505
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,990
What did you put in this?

506
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,190
Didn't put anything in it!

507
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,960
Why suspect such a thing

508
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,130
How could I not notice it?

509
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,170
I know "Ah-summer vacation" ah

510
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,130
I feel sorry for Maeda

511
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,370
Then, the two who didn't respond are also informed

512
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:01,180
It's getting cold. When did it become winter?

513
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,060
Sure enough, didn't notice at all

514
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,590
But Fujimoto...

515
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,200
I noticed it!

516
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,800
But I just thought a funny cover version came out

517
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,540
I didn't not know if it was the original singer or not

518
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,170
Can you not do this sort of unexpected thing, please?

519
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,440
Indeed

520
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:31,000
It's true that if you change the meaning of the lyrics completely, someone will notice

521
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,480
Next we try another song

522
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Eiaki Tokunaga's "Radio on the verge of breaking"

523
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,080
The lyrics will be written by...

524
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,660
Why?

525
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,700
Hollywood Zakoshi

526
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,300
The targets are these three

527
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,020
What will be the result?

528
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,340
Ito

529
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,100
There are many imitation artists

530
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,850
HanmaKanma

531
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,020
HanmaKanmaHanmaKanma

532
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,220
What is this?

533
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:16,390
HanmaKanmaHanmaKanma

534
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,160
HanmaKanma? Whose version is this?

535
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,180
What does it hope to convey?

536
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,940
What's the meaning?

537
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,100
Is this pirate radio?

538
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,720
After all, there are many covers of Tokunaga's works

539
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,320
Is there such a version?

540
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,930
HanmaKanma version?

541
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,170
Always singing HanmaKanma

542
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:06,980
The result is that HanmaKanma was exposed instantly

543
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,080
Your singing sucks if you don't have teeth

544
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,690
We go out into the street and talk to people who have no teeth

545
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,440
Excuse me

546
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,390
Excuse me, we are TBS

547
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,660
Seriously TBS?
-Yes

548
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,330
Any proof?

549
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,890
A wise man

550
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,920
"It's okay to sing a song"

551
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,370
We will provide these participants, who are willing to open up their hearts

552
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,030
With the opportunity to join a toothless karaoke contest

553
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,250
First of all, the first person without teeth is

554
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,910
I'm Fumio Shima, 67 years old

555
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,420
Sloppy speech

556
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,080
I have only 2 teeth left

557
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,150
Thank you for having me

558
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,120
Participant No. 1

559
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:50,580
Shima Fumio, who has 0 teeth on top and just 2 on the bottom

560
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,820
A nice close-up

561
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:57,060
Q. What is the reason for the loss of the teeth?

562
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,230
Mostly because of fighting and tooth decay

563
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,500
A frivolous and wasted youth

564
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,370
Always a fight at the drop of a hat

565
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,000
Little things like bumping into you while walking

566
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,770
And so on ... when I was young, I was like that

567
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,910
It is indeed hard to understand what he's talking about

568
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,010
Yes, if it's not subtitled...

569
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,610
But the issue is still the singing
-Yes

570
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,890
His speech seems to be somewhat impaired

571
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,710
Will it affect his singing?

572
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,230
No need to write "2 teeth"

573
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:35,170
Shima, who usually works in the warehouse as a sorting agent

574
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,330
After work, he goes to a small bar he often visits to drink with the female owner

575
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,420
This is his only pleasure

576
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,460
So, please listen to this song brought to you by Shima

577
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,560
"Love Can Can" by Misora Hiba

578
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,480
Can he get the "Can" out?

579
00:32:51,010 --> 00:33:02,590
The rain falls on my body

580
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:14,400
I'm not sure if I'm happy with the way things are going.

581
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:27,250
People are really sad, with a sad existence

582
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,950
I can't believe they shot all of this

583
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,780
This show is the worst

584
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,960
Where does he chew?

585
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:39,260
Even so, the past still creeps up on me

586
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:51,880
Life is incredible!

587
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,000
Very good at singing

588
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,580
Very good, good singer

589
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,550
The singing is unexpectedly good

590
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,060
Accidental?

591
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,260
How many points will be scored?

592
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,650
Thought I could...

593
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,650
Can't understand what he's saying

594
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,630
This time the scoring will be done with special mixed rules

595
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,120
What are the rules?

596
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,400
Given that fewer teeth can be detrimental to singing

597
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,710
The number of teeth will be subtracted from the karaoke score

598
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,610
The final score will be determined with a toothless handicap

599
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:27,250
Since Shima got 80 points in karaoke

600
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,730
After subtracting the number of teeth

601
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,960
His final score is 78

602
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,360
Incidentally, the number of normal human teeth is 32

603
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,090
In other words, even if a person with a full mouth gets 100 points for singing

604
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,030
In the end, the most they can get is 68 points

605
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,680
I see

606
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,860
This makes it easy to understand

607
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,260
It is not a question of whether it is good or not

608
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,560
The No. 2 contestant in the Toothless Sing-Off is

609
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,540
0 above, 4 below

610
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:00,140
Tatsuo Ueno, who retired to work in a restaurant, aged 66

611
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:06,280
Even with teary eyes

612
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,090
You can't stop me

613
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:16,460
Nowadays, there are no more

614
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,720
The view from this side is normal

615
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,660
Only this side can you see the teeth

616
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:21,130
Things that can be lost

617
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,550
Not from this side

618
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,170
The tempo is great though, right?

619
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:26,000
Love is everything

620
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,640
Now I could swear

621
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,150
Saturated with love

622
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:40,550
So intense, so intense

623
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,690
Ueno-san scored 90 points at karaoke

624
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:50,560
After subtracting 4 points for 4 teeth, he gets a total of 86 points

625
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,150
Next is contestant #3

626
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,250
2 above, 4 below

627
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
What the hell!?

628
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:01,610
Nobuo Hata, who runs a small bar for a living, is 76 years old

629
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,510
How could you leave it like that?

630
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:17,520
Men's Fountain Festival

631
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,670
Also good at singing

632
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,340
The singing is also very good

633
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,580
Really good

634
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,990
Born to carry and believe

635
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,440
Keep the camera away

636
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,990
It has nothing to do with teeth at all

637
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:35,540
Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate the festival

638
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,770
This is great!

639
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,540
Can get the sounds out right

640
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:40,680
The smell of the land is engraved in my heart

641
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:54,490
The young man's hands are an irreplaceable treasure

642
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,650
Don't need teeth!

643
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,080
I'm happy

644
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:06,130
Participating in this program has given me confidence

645
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:11,700
The score for Sanaka Hata is 91 minus 6 for the number of teeth

646
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,500
He receives 85 points

647
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,920
The highest score so far

648
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,630
But Ueno goes down a place because of the toothless handicap mechanism

649
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,180
Unfortunately, he ranks 2nd

650
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,010
Next is contestant #4

651
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,010
0 above, 5 below

652
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,660
Masao Kiyomizu, 72, who works as a security guard at the construction site

653
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,770
The neon lights of the streets are beautifully interlaced.

654
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:44,910
Yokohama Green light, Yokohama

655
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,140
A bit off

656
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,190
Open your ears!

657
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,090
Unfortunately, the karaoke score was not as good as it could have been, with a total of 70 points

658
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,580
And so, he's ranked in last place currently

659
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,730
It is very clear to hear

660
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Next is contestant number 5

661
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,030
6 above, 0 below

662
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,530
Akiha Masamune, who works at the construction site, 59 years old

663
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:07,730
Don't panic, bride Samba

664
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,170
Women are always mysterious

665
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,920
Good taste

666
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:15,530
Akiba was the only contestant to select this style of music

667
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,280
He scored 80 points

668
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,100
Finally, the last toothless opponent

669
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,520
Mamoru Kaneko 49 years old

670
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,070
He's young

671
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,660
0 teeth

672
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,700
He lost his teeth in his 40s

673
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,700
Only the gums are left

674
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,910
How come?

675
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:45,600
Q. What is the reason for the loss of the teeth?

676
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,970
Uh... why...

677
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,600
Always fighting

678
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,280
A bunch of rebels

679
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:58,050
Q. Did fights cause all of the total loss?

680
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,550
This led to broken teeth

681
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,740
Apart from fighting

682
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,210
Well, there was a little bit of abscess leakage...

683
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:03,690
Q. Is there anything you can't eat?

684
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,350
Something I can't eat...

685
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,690
No

686
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,960
Losing the first at 27

687
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,580
The straw that broke the camel's back

688
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,930
Surprisingly, it was down to soba

689
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,450
Listen to this song brought to you by Kaneko, who doesn't even have a single tooth

690
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:29,810
I can't even sing the popular songs of the day, so old-fashioned

691
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,420
「SINGLE BED」

692
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:42,090
It's been a year since I left you, trying to become a good man

693
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:53,170
But at this age, born with a naked heart

694
00:39:53,170 --> 00:40:05,550
Even if you learn to dress up and change your car, the result remains the same.

695
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:18,530
Hugging dreams and your time in a single bed

696
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:29,970
The two people who used to laugh at each other because of boring little things

697
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,920
How many points will he get?

698
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,160
Well, I was nervous

699
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,480
Kaneko comes in 4th place, and the final results are as shown

700
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,800
So, teeth have nothing to do with whether one can sing well or not

701
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,770
It's hard to remember music ones

702
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,280
After all, we prefer to see others being bullied

703
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,900
Bullying is bad behavior

704
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,900
When I drank with you once, Matsumoto, I remember your tone of voice being very firm

705
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,050
The next theory is something that was proven 6 years ago

706
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:17,690
No one can understand the chorus of SADS's "Forgetting the Air" the first time hearing it

707
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,410
Do you two remember?

708
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,990
Possibly...

709
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,160
Can't understand what he's singing, right?
-Yes, yes, yes

710
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,390
I remember this very well.
-Really

711
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,860
6 years ago, we sought to see if someone could understand it instantly

712
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,770
At that time, the studio guests were invited to undertake the challenge

713
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:52,440
Only understood the last part

714
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,660
Isn't the last sentence "can you hear my voice?"

715
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,900
At the end, right? I heard that one

716
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,350
No one could understand it the first time

717
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,720
Too difficult

718
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:09,510
Can you hear my voice

719
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:09,510
Under the caramel-colored sky, I can hear the song

720
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,540
I'm calling it quits

721
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,260
The correct answer is as follows

722
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:19,630
Under the velvety sky, you can hear the song

723
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:25,600
Avoiding bullshit nonsense, I can hear my voice

724
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,200
Did he really sing this?

725
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,490
Bullshit nonsense

726
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,380
This...

727
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,050
Isn't it just bullshit?

728
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,830
He really sings it like this

729
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,140
Yes, yes

730
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,160
I remember this one

731
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,340
This theory was tested

732
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,300
So lets verify another song

733
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,340
This time, there is a bonus for you two

734
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:52,920
If you guess correctly the first time, you will get 100 million yen

735
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,150
It's only fair to be excited

736
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,090
It's ridiculous to the extreme

737
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,690
If it was 100,000 instead

738
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,250
Totally uninteresting

739
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,810
Then let's change it to 1 million

740
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,730
It's okay, right?

741
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,360
Do you think we will agree to that?

742
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,440
So we found a song that surpasses "Forget the Sky"

743
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,500
Can you guys tell what the lyrics are in one go?

744
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,300
That overflowing with loneliness

745
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,020
Memories of me in retrospect

746
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,250
Repaint the field of view

747
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,960
What?

748
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,810
It ends "give it to him", right?

749
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:46,350
That's it... the end is "give it to him"

750
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,410
Is the song "Your Damn Tiger Teeth"

751
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,740
"Give Him Your Damn Tiger Teeth"

752
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,230
Get your tiger teeth

753
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,150
And give it to him

754
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,200
What kind of lyrics are these

755
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,910
He didn't say "give him your tiger teeth"

756
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,960
To the old man with missing teeth?
-Yes, yes, yes

757
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,380
The old man with missing teeth turned his head when he saw an old man with missing teeth

758
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,360
"Give him your tiger teeth"

759
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,190
Why is SADS singing this kind of song?

760
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,420
It's a song written for Ueno Shopping Street

761
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,050
That's not correct

762
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,660
Let's hear it again
-"Damn you"...

763
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,410
Listen carefully once more

764
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:16,140
Repaint the field of view

765
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,030
Why did he have to keep saying tiger teeth

766
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,610
I can't hear anything else

767
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,150
"Be serious, dammit!", right?

768
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,660
That sounds too weird

769
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,860
According to you, the lyrics have always been very unreasonable

770
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,360
This is his world view

771
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,230
Yes...
-Let's announce the correct answer

772
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,360
Please watch this

773
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,170
Repaint the field of view

774
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:55,300
Giving beauty to the feathers as if they were sharp blades

775
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,740
So it's a sharp blade

776
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,790
What a shame!

777
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,640
Blade...
-Blade and Tiger

778
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,310
No no no no...

779
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:07,210
Although the world view is cool and unique, people can't understand

780
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,320
So hard...

781
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,820
After singing this, you'll forget how to sing "Workman", right?

782
00:45:13,060 --> 00:46:14,750
