00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,320
Life Guard

3
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,900
Everyone, tomorrow and the day after
tomorrow the beach will be open.

4
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,700
Yes.

5
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,720
Accidents will increase,

6
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,690
which means our job will increase.

7
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,550
Yes.

8
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,250
So if by any chance,

9
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,520
an accident happens, we must react instantly and help.

10
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,650
Let's get prepared for that.

11
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,050
Yes.

12
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,120
Let's use this doll for practice.

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,520
OK, Nishihata-kun.   Give the doll heart massage.

14
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:24,970
Yes.

15
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,670
Do your best.
- Yes.

16
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,940
Use more strength.

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,800
OK, You-kun...

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,740
mouth to mouth.

19
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,640
Try your best.

20
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,470
Try hard, You-kun.

21
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,750
This is an emergency.

22
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,990
You need to save his life.

23
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,150
With mouth to mouth.

24
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,120
That's it.

25
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,020
What are you doing?

26
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,450
Just making a funny face.

27
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,320
Give it your all!

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,670
What's this...

29
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,470
The beach will open the day after tomorrow.

30
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,440
Oh, he is dead.

31
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,500
Is he? That's enough.

32
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,270
Imada-kun! Let's see how it's done.

33
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,550
Yes?

34
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:11,700
OK!

35
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,390
You did mouth to mouth!

36
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,320
I did it.

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,150
Understood?

38
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,590
Yes!

39
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,450
You, try your best!

40
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,250
Huh?

41
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,750
That's enough!

42
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,700
Never mind. Just try it.

43
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,420
But, I'm just a musician...

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,420
I can't.

45
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,570
Show us again Imada-kun.
- Will do!

46
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,470
Excuse me.

47
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,470
This is how you do mouth to mouth.

48
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,550
This doll was eating a croquette earlier.

49
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,200
Was it?
- Yes.
