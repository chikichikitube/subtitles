1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,120
Good evening. Good evening

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,240
Good evening

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,360
Speaking like this together

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,420
Downtown
Matsumoto Hitoshi                    Hamada Masatoshi

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,540
It's great

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,940
Just before, us two were just speaking here, now we're here, we don't need you guys

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,300
Tsukitei Housei

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,760
I'm happy

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,020
Actually, the guests here really got to like us

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760
Cocorico
Endou Shouzou                          Tanaka Naoki

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,780
They got to like you a lot?

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,600
Yeah, they did. I didn't realise how much necks can go up and down

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,060
It should be from side to side

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,900
And then someone's chin got stuck and we had to stop

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,900
But we are really happy to be here

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,900
Just one moment

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,120
What are you chuckling about?

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,960
I just can't get enough of your design perm

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,780
Yeah, I get what you mean, it really is something

20
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,120
What is?

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,860
Isn't it normal? What's wrong?

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,320
Isn't something simpler better? You don't have frizzy hair right?

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,080
It's not frizzy

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,220
It's on purpose

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,220
There's nothing wrong with a bit of fluffiness

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,060
Okay, let's do our best

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,160
I'll do my best

28
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,860
You're balding!

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,360
You've forgotten right?

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,240
I had a joint disorder and my chin was in a bad state

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:41,840
Housei has been appealing for his chin's bad state from before the start of this years No-Laughing Game

32
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,560
It's a lie

33
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,560
It's not a lie

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,660
I'm being truthful

35
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,900
No. How many times have we been lied to with the end of year games?

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,620
When you got hit by the Harisenbon you said your ear was hurt

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,700
And then there was nothing wrong with it

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,960
All lies. And then your abdomen was broken or something

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,720
I'm really sorry for all the lies I said up till now

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,580
So you acknowledge that?

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,580
You acknowledge you lied?

42
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,860
So you acknowledge that it was just cowardliness

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,420
All cowardliness

44
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,020
And then your chin?

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,940
This is real

46
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,360
With what proof?

47
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,500
It's really real

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,880
But you haven't actually been to a hospital yet, right?

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,380
Yeah, he's just saying it hurts

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,620
So I let you hear it many times, many times, how my chin makes popping sounds

51
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,700
So then let Matsumoto-san have a listen

52
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,360
It made the sound

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
It totally made the sound

54
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,040
It sounded like peoples' do normally

55
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,660
Mine doesn't make that sound, but that's not to say it's not normal

56
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,660
This is a very bad sympton

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,500
Really

58
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,140
Even though you haven't seen a doctor

59
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,980
What sort of things give you trouble with it?

60
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,980
Today as well - Can I speak frankly?

61
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,980
Well, I went to take a dump

62
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,960
So I went and then as I was going 'buuuh' as I did the deed

63
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,300
My chin came loose

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,780
This is being pretty well received

65
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,940
They're so nice

66
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,060
Pretty funny

67
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,420
Was it funny?

68
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,420
It was a lie right?

69
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,340
Was that a lie?

70
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,800
It was a lie?

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,220
Are you serious?

72
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,780
So what you are trying to say is that always getting hit by Chouno-san is the cause?

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,860
But I have been getting hit continuously now for 10... 9 years, so that effect remains

74
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,360
Honestly, I want to be compensated

75
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,080
Compensated?

76
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:02,740
The strange thing is, you say that it hurts after getting slapped, but when did it start hurting this time?

77
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,020
Around 1 week after I was told that we were going to do the No Laughing Game...

78
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,500
Isn't that strange?

79
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,180
Because for 9 years -

80
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,980
So for the 11 months since you were last hit by Chouno-san, it didn't hurt?

81
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,220
Yes, it didn't hurt

82
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,080
And then when you heard about the game, it started popping?

83
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,880
Yes

84
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,580
What was it like again when you go to poo?

85
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,200
When I go to poo and clench up, it goes...

86
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,060
It's different now!

87
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,300
This year's theme for the annual No Laughing Batsu Game: American Police!

88
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:46,040
No Laughing
American Police 24 h
On air from 6.30pm 12/31 (Su)

89
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,460
Now, we reflect on the harsh filming that took place the other day

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,840
How many years is it now? How many times is it now?

91
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,400
So actually, it is now 12 years since it started as a New Years Eve event

92
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,880
If we include the ones from before that, it is 14 years

93
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,760
But 12 times now for New Years Eve

94
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:06,220
No Laughing Game Series
14 past broadcasts (New Years Eve: 12 times)

95
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,460
Before that we split it up into four 30 minute segments

96
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,060
Yes, 30 minute parts

97
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,640
2003 ~ 2017 No Laughing Batsu Games History

98
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,420
It started from 2003

99
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:16,920
2003: No Laughing Onsen Hotel 2d1n trip
(Mastermind: Hamada, Participants: Matsumoto, Housei, Cocorico)

100
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,860
and then from 2006, it started being broadcast over New Years Eve

101
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,960
2006: 24h No Laughing Police
(Masterminds: Matsumoto,Tanaka, Participants: Hamada, Housei, Endou)

102
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,500
I want to ask everybody about this, but when on route to location, how do you feel?

103
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,740
For me, this is the hardest job each year

104
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,580
Leading up to it, from around 1 week beforehand I start to feel blue

105
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,800
I get what you mean

106
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,820
The first car will come to pick me up from my house at around 8, 9 am

107
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:49,140
So before it comes, my family are sitting to down to eat with the 3 of us. Then when it is nearly time...

108
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,220
I feel like I will start to cry

109
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,100
Like your last farewell

110
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,480
That far?

111
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,360
Yeah, my heart feels like I will really start to cry

112
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,640
The food gradually becomes tasteless

113
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,700
This year, just before I had to leave for it, I have a kid who is just over 1 years old

114
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,820
I was just silent and embraced him tighter and longer than usual

115
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,420
Like I wouldn't be able to return

116
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,540
That's too much

117
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,320
That's how it gets

118
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,180
The bus on the day that goes towards the filming site, from the hotel it takes around 20 to 30 minutes

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:32,600
Really, no one speaks. It's just completely silent on the way to the site

120
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
No one speaks

121
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,520
Not even one word

122
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Everyone is like this

123
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,100
It's so stressful, right

124
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,080
It's like an escort

125
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,200
You don't think it will turn off

126
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:52,600
And then when they say 'We're here now, please get off', no one gets off and just pretends they can't hear

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,700
Age is age after all

128
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,600
We all get older of course, but the punishers switch out with younger people

129
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:11,200
They switch out and stay young, and they're also getting better, so the gap gets bigger which I think is the problem

130
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,020
Really, I'm not sure how much I should say, but my anus has gotten really sensitive

131
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,580
That's a different illness now

132
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,140
The strange this is, Hamada-san doesn't really say much about this either

133
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,880
But actually, Hamada-san has a custom that he does each time

134
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,800
Before the No Laughing Batsu Games, Hamada-san, myself and Cocorico, the 4 of us have dinner together

135
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,600
Because our schedules match up then

136
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,340
After the first pick up car

137
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,020
The first pick up car comes, and then the 4 of us eat together

138
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,400
Since I'm always a little bit late

139
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,820
And then things like fugu, we have some really good food together - like the Last Supper

140
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,100
The Last Supper?

141
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,380
During this no one is noisy, everyone just eats quietly

142
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,380
We taste each bite

143
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,400
Just like your meal

144
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,980
I think that the behind the scenes of the games are funnier

145
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,760
There a lot of stories, really

146
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,600
Also, people who got a break during last year's game, including comedians

147
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,260
For example, Hyakura - ah, that was wrong

148
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,420
What type of hairstyle does he have?

149
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,780
Akira crossed Hyaku-pa (100 %) equals Hyakura

150
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,500
Akira and Hyaku-pa

151
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,620
You're so embarrasing

152
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,080
You just dropped the plate in front of the cameras

153
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,160
Everyone can see it now

154
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:57,560
He became big after last year's game, and then went onto win the R-1 Grand Prix in February

155
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,480
That's right

156
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:08,260
Harada-san, he collaborated with Akira 100 %, he also went onto become the "Obsessed with 5 o'clock" host from this Spring

157
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:16,320
Yes, also Sunshine Ikezaki-kun also became the ambassador for Sunshine 60

158
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,880
The building?

159
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,340
Yes, the building ambassador. It became the starting platform for a lot of people

160
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,120
Yeah, this year there will be more of that as well

161
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,420
So we can also think about what might happen this year

162
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,260
But if he's still at the level where he is called 'Hyakura' it might not have sunken in

163
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,580
He has to try a little harder

164
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,120
Yeah, he has to work a little harder

165
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,060
Were you trying to drop that?

166
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,880
What happened, Tanaka?

167
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,260
Are you tired?

168
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,620
I'm sorry

169
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,740
Has something gone wrong psychologically?

170
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,720
Tanaka, you went and did your live broadcast the next day properly

171
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,080
Yeah, I had a broadcast for ZIP

172
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,780
How long did you have till it started?

173
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:08,460
ZIP's staff knew that I had the No Laughing Batsu game on the previous day

174
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,880
And assumed that my butt had taken a pounding

175
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,000
So, on the chair, they actually gave me a cushion

176
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,680
They knew about it, so they gave me a cushion especially

177
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:30,920
But, there are some who didn't know. Didn't know I had come directly following the game, and saw my special cushion

178
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,520
And thought that I might have become a genie

179
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,280
You just stuttered, right

180
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,800
I didn't want to keep you waiting, so I tried to talk fast

181
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,700
Zip and zi, it was like zi-zip

182
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,040
There were lots of zi's

183
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,360
Ah, I'm so embarrased

184
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,100
But looking at the numbers, there was one I was surprised about

185
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,720
The total amount of times our butts have been hit, for all of us

186
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,020
I want to know that

187
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,460
11 823 times in total

188
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:19,760
5 person total: 11 823 times

189
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,240
Over 10 000?

190
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,120
Over 10 000 for all of us, isn't that crazy?

191
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,640
It's over 10 000

192
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,440
So first place is Matsumoto-san with 2 867 hits

193
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,740
No.1 Matsumoto: 2 867 times

194
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,700
This year, last year, every year it is the same, but aren't they harder on me?

195
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,480
Even though I chuckled so little no one should be able to see, it goes 'Ba-Baam'

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,980
Aren't they always hard on me?

197
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:52,880
That's true, but also there are the behind the scenes parts where we talk directly to the staff, which definitely won't be used in the broadcast

198
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,020
The parts which you know they won't use

199
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,920
Even during those parts, when we just laugh a tiny bit, it's 'Ba-baam'

200
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,780
You think 'Why now? Even though you guys won't use this part anyway?', right?

201
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,580
And also, the 'Thai kick's

202
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,880
You would have the most

203
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,920
Yes, I have gotten the most

204
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,700
In total I have gotten kicked 18 times

205
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,960
Oh, that's all

206
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,660
No. 1 Tanaka: 18 times

207
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,820
Yes, I thought it was more as well

208
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,100
So you need to get kicked more

209
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,400
That logic's just strange

210
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,900
Matsumoto-san got hit over 2000 times

211
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,440
That was the basic punishment since he laughed

212
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,180
But actually, the first person to receive a Thai Kick was me

213
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,500
Matsumoto-san was the first

214
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,100
To receive the punishment called 'Thai Kick'

215
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:55,240
It was seriously painful. He went for broke and struck around my hip area

216
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,980
By the way, what is a 'Thai Kick'?

217
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:07,240
But actually, it was Matsumoto-san, right? The person who brought in the 'Thai Kick'

218
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:14,920
I brought in the 'Thai Kick'? I brought in the 'Thai Kick'?

219
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,760
You introduced the 'Thai Kick' into variety shows

220
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:30,380
Ah yeah, I once suggested getting kicked by a Muay Thai athlete as a punishment, and that somehow evolved into the 'Thai Kick' that everyone knows

221
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,380
But I didn't bring it in

222
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,400
Coming up, revisiting precious TV footage: Matsumoto and the first Thai Kick

223
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:46,780
It was 17 years ago. This was the moment where Matsumoto received the first Thai Kick.

224
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,760
After losing a game, his punishment was to receive the kick

225
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,860
Are you ok? Are you ok?

226
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,180
This, the Hospital in2007

227
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,240
2007: 24h No Laughing Hospital

228
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:27,300
Megumi-chan - I think it was - had a button, a 'Matsumoto Thai Kick' button that she kept pressing so Matsumoto-san received a ton. I remember that really well

229
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,980
Yeah, yeah

230
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,320
That's because - Housei, being cowardly again - left mid-way

231
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,920
He went for an IV drip

232
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,360
Yeah, I really went for an IV drop because of the problems with my intestines, and blood was coming out

233
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,080
No, there was no blood

234
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,000
That was real. Completely real.

235
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:58,800
I was in the hospital for 2 weeks, but on the 10th day we had filming for the game

236
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,120
I was told by my doctor to not go, he asked me, 'Do you want to die?'

237
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,120
And?

238
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,200
And then I said, 'No, I will go forth'

239
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,360
Go forth?

240
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,600
The time period changed

241
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,520
Suddenly, the time period changed

242
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,800
'I don't care if I die, I will go forth'

243
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,920
And then during filming he said his condition got worse, so he left to go to the hospital

244
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,780
So I got all of them, that day I was showered with a lot of Thai Kicks

245
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,480
This is that footage

246
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,040
Press it

247
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,780
Matsumoto, hurry up and press it

248
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,340
At this time, Matsumoto got 3 Thai Kicks in a row

249
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,920
And then the drawer items started from 2005

250
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,480
Really?

251
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,200
2005: No Laughing High School
(Mastermind: Hamada, Participants: Matsumoto, Housei, Cocorico)

252
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:29,180
Yes, and then from this High School version, the drawer stuff has continued on

253
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Before it was pretty tame, like Hamada-san opening his drawer and there were banana skins

254
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,340
So it was basically a nice reprieve

255
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,780
Yes, that's right. That's right

256
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,460
During High School there were stale rolls in Yama-chan's drawer right?

257
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,120
Yeah, that was the level it was at

258
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,820
Yeah, light hearted

259
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
There was also an explosion too

260
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,780
When Matsumoto-san's drawer was opened, 'Bo-kaan'

261
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,040
And then after it was over I hit the back of my head

262
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,600
Yeah, that was bad

263
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,760
Coming up, a favourite video

264
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,060
At the start, the drawer surprises were just simple

265
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,180
However, gradually they escalated

266
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,480
The Endou family also, from 2011, started to help out each year

267
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
2011: 24h No Laughing Airport

268
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,760
From the Airport?

269
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,540
Chiaki doesn't come out anymore...

270
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,960
No, well, I don't know anything about it

271
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,620
Chiaki, how is she going, happy?

272
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,580
Chiaki-chan is now happily married to another guy

273
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,580
Yeah, he's quite a bit younger than her, huh

274
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,660
Yeah, 15 years younger

275
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,660
He's from TBS?

276
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,120
Yeah, from TBS, a really successful person

277
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,320
Successful

278
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,060
Well, Endou, say a few words for Chiaki

279
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,660
Were you just listening?

280
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,180
I am also re-married and have a kid

281
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,080
Yeah, you have 2 now

282
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,000
Yes, my wife is now pregnant with the second, and Chiaki-chan is also married.

283
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,560
Yeah, you both sound happy

284
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,640
Yes, well, we are just going on with life.

285
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,860
So, tell her 'I love you!'

286
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,720
Chiaki

287
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,860
I love you

288
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,060
Don't act shy just because you love her

289
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,000
My wife hates where this conversation goes

290
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,040
She doesn't get what's funny about it

291
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:37,500
It's always, going on, the same specified punishment, but do you remember what the punishment was at first?

292
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,640
Of course

293
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,920
If we did it now it would be a huge issue

294
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,860
Now it would be impossible

295
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,660
Was it eye crushing?

296
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,540
Not that hard core

297
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,100
It'd be over in one go

298
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,360
It was blow darts

299
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,560
With real needles

300
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:16,860
Yeah, that was crazy. The pipes themselves weren't even proper ones, they were ones made by an assistant director

301
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,180
The ones where paper is folded up into triangles

302
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,000
Folded into cones

303
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,680
And then a needle was stuck at the end

304
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,720
Yeah, a needle at one end

305
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:35,800
And then, the short ones and - they were handmade and uneven. Sometimes there were ridiculously long ones as well

306
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:45,320
And then they were used on our butts, once they pierced we couldn't take them out easily

307
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,040
I took one out and there was flesh still attached

308
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,580
There was actual fat stuck to the head of the needle

309
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,380
Yeah there were strange ones, like cat ones

310
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,500
And then we got hit by 10s of those

311
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,460
Matsumoto-san, after entering the onsen, his naked butt got hit as well

312
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,680
Yeah, his naked butt got hit

313
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,160
'Ahhhh', he was yelling, 'Ahhhhh'

314
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,940
Do you know why I got hit?

315
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,360
I only laughed

316
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,860
Yeah, it's a weird situation

317
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,960
'My boxers are gone'

318
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,900
Yeah, there was a black guy at the change room going 'My boxers are gone, my boxers are gone~'

319
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,160
You have to laugh at that. It was hilarious. And then the next thing I know 'Ba-bam'

320
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,580
Coming up, we show that shocking punishment

321
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,880
This is the shocking punishment from the first No Laughing Batsu game installment

322
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:06,460
My boxers are gone. My boxers are gone~

323
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,460
My boxers are gone

324
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,920
My boxers, boxers... Boxers

325
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,120
A lot of things happened after that and they changed the format so our punishment was fixed as butt smacking

326
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,180
I hope people watch this year's as well

327
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,080
Lots of things happened, this year as well

328
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,060
Yeah, it was stressful

329
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,420
A lot of things changed up, this year that is

330
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,280
I don't know how things will continue on, it's all up to Hamada-san really

331
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,000
You're the one with the authority

332
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,440
I wish you would stop doing that

333
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:07,540
I really wish you would stop doing that, even with the guests, everyone thinks I decide everything... but not even once
